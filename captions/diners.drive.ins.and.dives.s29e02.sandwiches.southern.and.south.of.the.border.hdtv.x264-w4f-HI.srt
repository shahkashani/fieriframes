00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,377
         Extra-virgin olive oil.

263
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,045
                  Oregano.
                   Cumin.

264
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,214
   So bloom that,
 kind of wake it up.

265
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,282
             Put it in the pot.

266
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,150
 Sugar, kosher salt.

267
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,385
              Stir it a smidge.

268
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,120
  That was a smidge, wasn't it?
            -Smidge.

269
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,189
                  Puree it
      with an immersion blender.

270
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,692
    Next, I'm going to add water
   with veggie base mixed in it.

271
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,861
        Red chili sauce.
        -Enchilada sauce.

272
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,630
              So this will cook
          about 10 more minutes,

273
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:54,332
             and then it's ready
              for the tamales.

274
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,934
  That's delicious.

275
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:56,935
      You know,
 you can take that,

276
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,870
just warm it up, make a soup.
                     We do.

277
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,206
            We actually put that
               in our pozole.

280
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,410

281
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,612
                 Portobello
      and winter squash filling.

282
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:08,914
    -And what type of squash?
           -Butternut.

283
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,282
           -Very nice.
           -Thank you.

284
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:13,451
             Olive oil, garlic,
           portobello mushrooms.

285
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,186
     Beautiful.
And then in with the squash?

286
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,088
              -Yes.
-Round it out, a little oregano.

287
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,523
              Salt and pepper.

288
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,859
Now this is gonna simmer
down, now, for how long?

289
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,527
        -15 minutes max.
      -Just so it's tender.

290
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,129
                Yeah, just so
           it's slightly tender.
Cooked and tender.

291
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:25,163
 Time for the masa.

           Vegetable shortening.

293
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,834
          While that's creaming,
              this is the masa.

294
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,736
             -Salt.
         -Baking powder.

295
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,371
She's doing something
 I really like here.

296
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,806
              This is water...
And vegetable stock.

             I mix this by hand.

300

I like how you're making
these little cylinders

   drop in there.
        Yeah, just blob them in.

Little flavor bombs.

      put two olives in the top.

307
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,993
   -And then we'll steam them.
   -About an hour and a half.

308
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,495
    All of this
just for a tamale?
                     Correct.

309
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,898
You have the patience
    of an angel.

310

  Don't be small-e

              -Yep.

313
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,439
That's a big tamale.

314
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,807
   You're looking

I'm just gonna end up

326

The meatiness of that portobello
 really carries it.

327
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,799
This red sauce is going
all the way through it,

    but you know
what the real kicker is?

329

Is whipping that fat,
getting it nice and light.

330

             -Yeah.

531
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,794
  And we let these briskets rest

So, the same dry rub
    that we did.

 apple cider spritz.

587
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,367

594
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,244

all that smoke flavor in.
