   NOW ARE WE GONNA             
USE THAT LIQUID AGAIN?          
                   IN THE CHILI.

    THAT REALLY JUST COMPLEMENTS
        THE CHILI PERFECTLY.    

105
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,914
DEGLAZE A LITTLE BIT            
     WITH THAT.                 
          YOU COOK DOWN. WE'RE  
       GONNA ADD JUST SOME WATER

110
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,990

   THE MEAT'S REALLY TENDER.    

150
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,678
HOW'S THE BRISKET SANDWICH?     
                 IT'S FANTASTIC.

151
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,349
  THAT'S A GOOD-LOOKING BRISKET.
    THIS IS GONNA BE FOR WHAT?  
FOR OUR BRISKET SANDWICH.       

152
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,484
WE'RE GONNA CUT IT IN HALF,     
 SEASON IT WELL WITH SALT.      

153
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,886
IT'S A BIG PIECE OF MEAT,       

154
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,888
  SO WE'RE GONNA BE             
A LITTLE HEAVY-HANDED.          

155
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,890
     I LIKE                     
A LOT OF PEPPER.                
            ESPECIALLY THAT     
       NICE FRESH GROUND PEPPER.

156
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,892
OH, YEAH. NOW JUST A LIGHT      
 TOUCH OF THE HOUSE RUB.        

157
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,027
        THAT ADDS A LITTLE COLOR
              TO THE BARK.      
MM-HMM.                         

158
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,430
       SO THESE ARE DONE. NOW TO
       THE SMOKER? GOT IT. OKAY.
YEP, LET'S DO IT.               

159
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:08,099
AND HOW MANY HOURS ARE WE GONNA 
   PUT SMOKE ON THE BRISKET?    
      ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF SMOKE.

160
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,234
AND WHAT ARE WE RUNNING,        
          220?                  
                            YEP.

161

162
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,105
TO JUST REALLY                  
COOK IT DOWN.                   
                   THAT'S RIGHT.

163
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,107
      ALL RIGHT, TIME TO MAKE   
   THE BOURBON BARBECUE SAUCE...
MMM.                            

164
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,176
    FOR THE BRISKET SANDWICH--  
  A LITTLE OLIVE OIL, RED ONION.

165
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,511
     AND ONCE THESE ARE NICE    
AND SOFT, SOME OF OUR HOUSE RUB,

166
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,513
     AND I LIKE TO COOK THAT OUT
              IN THE OIL        

167
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,183
    TO HELP BRING OUT THE FLAVOR
           IN THE SPICES.       
AND IT ALSO DISSIPATES IT       
      INTO THE OIL.             

168
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,185
                    ABSOLUTELY. 
                  NEXT, BOURBON.

169

         TEMPER THAT WITH ABOUT 
       AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF WATER.
OKAY.                           

171
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,525
NEXT UP.                        
      WE GOT SOME MOLASSES HERE,
         A COUPLE BAY LEAVES,   

172
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,795
           MUSTARD POWDER,      
    WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE, SUGAR.

173
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,397
                FINISH IT OFF   
              WITH SOME KETCHUP.
       THE GLUE                 
OF THE BARBECUE SAUCE.          

174
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,599
                   THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S GONNA COOK DOWN          
    FOR HOW LONG?               

175
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,734
         ABOUT 20 TO 30 MINUTES.
ALL RIGHT.                      

176
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,736
       THE BRISKET'S COOLED DOWN
             A LITTLE BIT.      

177
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,738
                 NOW WE'RE GONNA
                   SLICE IT UP. 
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

178
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,740
           LOOK AT THE NICE BARK
               ON THAT. MMM.    

179
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,742
             SLICE SOME MORE.   
          LET'S MAKE A SANDWICH.
LET'S DO IT.                    

180
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,744
WE'RE GONNA START BY ADDING SOME
 OF OUR BOURBON BARBECUE SAUCE. 

181
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,746
                 NOW I'M GONNA  
                ADD THE BRISKET.
      REHEAT IT                 
IN THE BARBECUE SAUCE.          

182
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,549
                 THAT'S CORRECT.
GOT IT.                         

183
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,617
  COAT THE MEAT.                
WARM THE MEAT UP.               
           SOME NICE CARAMELIZED
               RED ONION HERE.  

184
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,620
  AND THEN THIS GOES IN THE OVEN
        FOR A FEW MINUTES.      

185
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,622
         THEN WE'LL PUT THE ROLL
              IN THERE, TOO.    

186

         YOU CAN FEEL IT        
 JUST STARTING TO COME TOGETHER.

283
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,251
  WE'RE GONNA                   
DRAIN THIS OFF.                 

284
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,521
IT'S ALREADY COOLED DOWN BECAUSE
  IT ABSORBED INTO THE CHEESE.  

285
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,723
    WE REALLY WANT              
SOME HOT MILK IN THERE.         

286
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,059
THAT'S GOOD. LET IT BUILD.      
WE'RE GONNA STRETCH IT UP.      

287
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,928
    IT'D BE EASIER IF YOU MILKED
      A COW AND THIS CAME OUT.  
(laughs)                        

288
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,930
      LIKE THE PIZZA DOUGH,     
WE'RE GONNA ROLL IT INTO ITSELF.

289
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,866
 YEAH, WE'RE GONNA ROLL IT,     
AND THEN I JUST PINCH IT OFF.   

290
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,334
     THAT'S IT.                 
INTO SOME ICE WATER.            
                LET IT JUST     
          SEIZE UP A LITTLE BIT.

291
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,538
AND NOW WE'LL CUT IT UP         
FOR THE PORK LOVE PIZZA.        

292
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,607
                       MMM.     
                  I'M MOVING IN.

293
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,809
             SAUSAGE LOOKS GOOD.
                LOOK AT THAT.   

294
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,811
      LET IT REST,              
SO WHEN YOU CUT INTO IT,        

295
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,813
YOU DON'T LOSE                  
ALL THE JUICE.                  
                 THAT'S CORRECT.

296
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:24,149
SO THE TOMATO SAUCE...          
      IT'S SAN MARZANO TOMATOES,
          SICILIAN SEA SALT.    

297
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,151
                   THAT'S IT.   
               WHY MESS WITH IT?

298
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,153
                  ALL RIGHT,    
              TO MAKE THE PIZZA,

299
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,621
        A LITTLE FLOUR PERFECTLY
        PROOFED UP, READY TO GO.

300
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,691
    I ONLY GOT                  
ONE SET OF CLOTHES.             
               I'M JUST GONNA...

301
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,225

302
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:37,028
TOMATO SAUCE...                 
                     PUSH IT    
                OUT TO THE EDGE,

303
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,163
     THE HOUSE-MADE MOZZARELLA, 
        THIN-SLICED PANCETTA,   

304
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,033
  SOPRESSATA SALAMI, OUR SAUSAGE
        ALL THE WAY AROUND.     

305
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,702
              FINISH IT OFF     
         WITH SMOKED PROSCIUTTO.
YOU GET A TAIL                  
 AND A SNOUT,                   

306
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,972
YOU'LL HAVE THE WHOLE PIG       
        ON THERE.               
                 WE'RE RUNNING  
              ABOUT 800 DEGREES.

307
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,108
     WATCH HOW FAST             
THIS STARTS TO FIRE OFF.        

308
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,376
    LET THE BOTTOM OF THAT CRUST
         SEIZE UP, SPIN IT.     

309
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,779
           CRAZY. THAT THING'S  
         ROCKIN' HOT. (whistles)

310
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,447
                    WICKED FAST.

311
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,449
YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE BIT     
      OF BURN SPOTS,            

312
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,851
BUT THAT'S PART OF THE FLAVOR.  
       THAT'S AWESOME.          
                 ONTO THE PLATE.

313
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,122
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.

IS THE FOUNDATION.              

316
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,261
IT'S LIGHT, BUT IT'S FIRM,      
  AND IT'S GOT TEXTURE.         

317
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,263
IT'S GOT NICE CHEW TO IT.       
     ALL THE MEATS--            

318
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,199

     TRUE COMMITMENT            
TO DOING IT THE RIGHT WAY.      

323
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,142

       IT'S VERY LIGHT.         

401
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,467

       OF THE TRUFFLE.          

406

THE OIL WITH THE TRUFFLE INSIDE 
   OF THE MOZZARELLA ITSELF,    

407
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,481
A TOUCH OF THE SALTINESS        
   AND THE SWEETNESS            

408
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,550

A LITTLE BIT OF LEMON ZEST,     

409
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,552
 BECAUSE IT NEEDS               
THAT TOUCH OF ACID.             

410
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,554

427
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,064
THAT'S LIKE BUNGEE JUMPING      
     IN FLAVOR TOWN.            
                  NOT TOO THIN, 
                 1/4 OF AN INCH.

428
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,466

     FOR IT JUST LIKE THAT.     

429
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,468

       TO FIT OUR STYLE,
