I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN
 CHICKEN CORDON BLEU SUBMERGED.

19
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:39,304
IT DEFINITELY
    IS THE CRUNCHIEST.

20
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:41,240

    A TEXTURE ON THAT.

NOW WE'RE NOT HERE
 TO TALK ABOUT CHEESESTEAKS.

27
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,194
WE'RE HERE TO MEET
  A FRENCH-TRAINED CHEF

00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,688
NO, YOU WANT IT ON A SKEWER.
  THAT'S A SHISH KABAB.

310
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,490
OH, SO YOU CAN CALL IT A KABAB
EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT ON A STICK?
      THAT'S
     A KIFTA KABAB?

311
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:35,560
KIFTA MEANS SOMETHING YOU PUT IN
 YOUR HAND AND YOU MAKE A BALL.

312
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,429
YOU KIFTA IT?
      EXACTLY.

313
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,365
NOW WE'RE GONNA
GRILL SOME KABABS.

314
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:44,002
CUT IT IN HALF.
   ...STUFF IT IN A PITA.

315
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:47,138
WOW.
   TAHINI SAUCE WITH MIXED
    VEGETABLE TO IT.

316
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,475
AND THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE
   LOVE HOT SAUCE.

317
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:53,111
AND BON APPÉTIT.
     ENJOY.

318
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,548
THAT'S LIKE
A MEDITERRANEAN MEATBALL.

319
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:59,150
LOOK AT THAT.

320
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,053
THE SEASONINGS REALLY
 WORK WELL WITH THE MEAT.

321
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,055
GO AHEAD AND JUST
KEEP WORKING. I'M FINE.

322
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,123
<i> GETTIN' THIRSTY, THOUGH.</i>

323
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,858
<i> SO CHECK OUT THIS</i>
   <i> HOUSE SPECIAL.</i>

324
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,294
HOW ARE
    THE BANANA SHAKES?
OH, THEY'RE THE BEST.

325
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,730
WHAT IF YOU DON'T
     LIKE BANANAS?
WELL, THEN I GUESS YOU DON'T
 GET THE BANANA SHAKE.

326
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,231
BA-DUM-BUM.
   BUT SERIOUSLY, JOHNNY.

327
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,667
SO WHO MADE UP  THE BANANA SHAKE?
      MY FATHER DID.

328
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:16,901
HE LOVED FRESH FRUIT,

329
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,304
AND THAT WAS THE ONLY ONE
  YOU CAN GET YEAR-ROUND.

330
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,673
SLICE IT.
OH, AND THAT'S HOW YOU SLICE
IT--ON THE EDGE OF THE CUP?

331
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,575
NONFAT MILK.
LET ME SEE THAT
 ARM STRENGTH.

332
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:25,977
I LOOK SMALL,
    BUT I GOT MUSCLES.
REALLY? YOU CAN
TAKE 'EM DOWN?

333
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,380
YEAH, I CAN. I GOT
   THREE BROTHERS, TOO.

334
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:34,119
MMM, THAT'S LITERALLY BANANAS.

335
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:37,021
<i> IT GOES SO WELL</i>
 <i> WITH FALAFEL AND HOT SAUCE...</i>

336
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,457
IT KIND OF PUTS OUT THE FIRE
IN THE HOT SAUCE, YOU KNOW?

337
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,392
<i> THAT IT'S THE HOT COMBO</i>
   <i> ON THE MENU.</i>

338
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:42,927
THE FALAFEL WITH BANANA

339
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,230
TWO FALAFEL
  WITH BANANA SHAKES?

340
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,465
PEOPLE SAY THEY MOVED AWAY,
   AND THEY COME BACK,

341
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,968
"GOD, I JUST HAD TO COME OVER
 HERE AND COME TO THIS PLACE.

342
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,370
"I JUST LEFT THE AIRPORT,

 ...TO GET
MY FALAFEL FIX.

345
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:58,109
THAT'S WHAT
   THEY CALL IT--THE FIX.

346
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,011
<i> ...EVEN IF THEY STILL</i>
 <i> DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.</i>

347
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,347
YOU KNOW HOW

YUMMILY.

348
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,516
YUMMILY?
  THEY'RE MADE YUMMILY?
YES.

349
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:07,485
OHH, I GOTTA
   USE THAT.

350
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,788
WELL, THESE ARE ACTUALLY
   MADE WITH A LOT

351
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:12,323
OF YUMMYLICIOUS-ISH-NESS.
YUMMYLICIOUS.

352
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,225
YUMMY-LISH-NESS.
LISH-IS-NESS.

353
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,494
YUMMY-LICIOUSNESS.

354
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:19,364
<i> NEXT UP, I'M HEADIN'</i>
   <i> DOWN THE COAST</i>

355
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,698
<i> TO A SMALL-TOWN CAFÉ...</i>

356
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,534
IT'S THE BEST FOOD IN TOWN.

357
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,402
<i> WHERE FRENCH-FRYING</i>
  <i> DOESN'T MEAN POTATOES.</i>

358
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,604
THAT'S FRIED CRUNCH-A-LICIOUS
   RIGHT THERE.

359
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,975
SO I'M IN RAMONA, CALIFORNIA,

360
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,311
WHICH IS ABOUT AN HOUR
 NORTHEAST OF SAN DIEGO,

361
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,313
RIGHT AT THE GATEWAY
   OF THE DESSERT.

362
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,649
NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF TOWN
  IS THIS LITTLE JOINT

363
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:40,218
OWNED BY THE DAUGHTER
 OF A LOCAL EGG FARMER...

364
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,786
FRIES READY?

365
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,789
<i> THE KIND OF PLACE YOU'D EXPECT</i>
  <i> BASIC CAFÉ COOKING...</i>

      THANK YOU.

367
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:49,394
<i> NOT A HOMEMADE CHICKEN CORDON</i>
 <i> BLEU WITH FRESH HOLLANDAISE.</i>

368
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,930
IT'S SPICY AND TENDER.

369
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:52,997
REALLY GOOD.

370
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,333
<i> AND GET THIS--IT'S DEEP-FRIED.</i>

371
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:58,436
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN
 CHICKEN CORDON BLEU SUBMERGED.

372
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,405
WHY DEEP-FRY IT?
   IT JUST TASTES BETTER.

373
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,407
IT HAS A CRISPY TEXTURE
   TO THE EXTERIOR,

374
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,008
AND IT TASTES
     REALLY YUMMY.

375
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,345
<i> SO DOES THE FRIED CHICKEN</i>
 <i> AND THE CHICKEN-FRIED STEAK</i>

376
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:08,813
<i> AND FISH AND CHIPS.</i>

377
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,683
<i> EVEN THE KID-FRIENDLY CHICKEN</i>
  <i> STRIPS ARE HOMEMADE,</i>

378

380
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,621
IT'S THE BEST FOOD IN TOWN.

381
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,556
ANYBODY KNOW WHERE
   RAMONA CAFÉ IS?

382
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,258
<i> ...A SMALL-TOWN LANDMARK,</i>

383

<i> A 26-YEAR-OLD LOCAL LEGEND...</i>

IS THIS MY TWIN, HUH?

386
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:25,897
GREAT SERVICE--REALLY FRIENDLY.

00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,166
<i> RUN BY A LOCAL LEGEND...</i>

00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,635
<i> SONJA VANDERVEEN.</i>

390
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,570
CINNAMON ROLL

391
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,273
SONJA IS SUCH A PIE.
  SHE'S REALLY SWEET.

392
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,709
WHEN DID THEY
PUT STOPLIGHTS IN?
      OH, MY GOD.

393
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:39,644
THE FIRST SIGNAL
    WENT IN IN '79

394
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,079
WHEN I GRADUATED
    FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

395
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,081
<i> SONJA LEFT FOR A WHILE</i>
  <i> AFTER SHE GRADUATED,</i>

396
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:44,282
<i> THEN CAME BACK HOME.</i>

397
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,284
<i> 20 YEARS AGO,</i>
  <i> SHE BOUGHT THIS PLACE</i>

398
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,785
<i> WITH SOME HELP</i>
  <i> FROM HER PARENTS,</i>

399
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,821
<i> INCLUDING SOME RECIPES</i>
 <i> FROM HER SWISS-BORN MOM.</i>

400
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,458
NOW I GET IT. I DIDN'T KNOW
 THERE WAS SWISS INFLUENCE.
     OH, YEAH.

401
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,827
DID YOU MAKE CHICKEN CORDON
  BLEU WHEN YOU WERE A KID?

402
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,729
DID YOUR MOM
    COOK IT FOR YOU?
YES.

403
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:00,098
SO THIS IS JUST KIND
   OF YOUR ADAPTATION.
TRADITIONAL.

404
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,533
SO TAKE ME
      THROUGH IT.
 OKAY, YOU TAKE
A CHICKEN BREAST,

405
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:03,935
AND WE CUT IT
 IN HALF.

406
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:05,870
THEN WE PLACE THE PLASTIC
 WRAP OVER THE CHICKEN,

407
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,373
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA
 POUND IT OUT.
    YOU DON'T WANT IT
     TO K-K-K-K-K?

408
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:10,775
RIGHT. 1/4-INCH THICK.

409
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,849
ALL RIGHT. TAKE
THE SARAN WRAP OFF,

410
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:21,085
AND PLACE THE HAM
 IN THE MIDDLE

411
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:24,255
AND GRUYèRE
SWISS CHEESE.
   YOU REALLY HAVE TO USE
   THE GRUYèRE CHEESE?

412
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:27,091
YES, YOU DO. IT REALLY
ADDS THAT EXTRA FLAVOR.
    THAT'S THE TANG.
     THAT'S RIGHT.

413
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,560
AND THEN WHAT
    DO YOU DO TO IT?
ROLL IT UP.

414
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:33,498
AND WE SECURE IT
WITH TOOTHPICKS.
   AND I'D EAT THAT
  IF I LIKED CHICKEN CEVICHE.

415
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,433
NOW WHEN YOU FIRST
   PUT THIS ON THE MENU,

416
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,835
DID PEOPLE
    JUST GO BANANAS?
THEY DID. THEY LOVE IT.
  OH, MY GOSH.

417
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:41,005
BANANAS IS GOOD.
  BANANAS IS GOOD
WITH CHICKEN CORDON BLEU--

418
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,675
FRIED BANANAS.

419
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,377
MOST PEOPLE JUST BAKE IT AND PUT
 THE STUFF ON IT, AND THAT'S IT,

420
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,913
BUT WE'RE
     GONNA FRY IT.
RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA
 DEEP-FRY IT.

421
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,783
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA
     DIP IT IN EGG.
 STRAIGHT-UP EGG,
OR IS IT EGG WASH?

422
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:53,685
IT'S STRAIGHT-UP EGG.
STRAIGHT-UP EGG.

423
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,454
SO IT'S
REALLY GONNA--
   THEN WE'RE GONNA DO IT
   AGAIN ONE MORE TIME.

424
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,323
OH, WE'RE GONNA
DO THIS BA--OH.

425
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:02,327
SO YOU REALLY ARE THE COLOSSAL
  KING KONG OF CRUST?
      DEFINITELY.

426
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,762
DROP IT.
SAY "HAMMER IT."
      HAMMER IT.

427
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:09,801
I'M THE COLOSSAL
KING KONG OF CRUST.
     COLOSSAL
    KING KONG OF CRUST.

428
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:12,270
OH, WE SET A TIMER?
   YOU LOVE YOUR TIMER.

429
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,138
SEE, YOU'RE A BAKER.

430
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:18,710
IT LOOKS GOOD.

431
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,414
MMM.

432
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:26,718
THAT CHEESE
    REALLY STANDS OUT.
DOESN'T IT?

433
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,187
IT REALLY STANDS OUT IN THAT.
 DEFINITELY IS THE CRUNCHIEST.

434
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,189
I MEAN, THAT HAS
    A TEXTURE ON THAT.

435
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,157
<i> THE KEY TO THE CRUNCH</i>
 <i> IS SONJA'S HOMEMADE BREADING,</i>

436
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,492
<i> MADE FROM HOMEMADE BISCUITS</i>

437
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,427
<i> THAT HAVE BEEN SITTING</i>
  <i> AROUND A WHILE.</i>

438
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,831
AND WE DRY 'EM OUT
 A LITTLE BIT.
    THIS IS DRIED OUT
     A LITTLE BIT?

439
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:43,334
A LOT. THEY'RE STALE.
     SO A LITTLE
     BIT OF FLOUR.

440
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,703
SO LIKE A 50-50
     MIXTURE?
YEAH, A 50-50
 MIXTURE.

441
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,706
PEPPER, A 1/2 TEASPOON
  OF CAYENNE,

442
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,743
A TABLESPOON
OF POULTRY SEASONING.
     HOW MUCH SALT?

443
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,444
A 1/2 TEASPOON.
 AND CAJUN.

444
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,179
NOT TOO SPICY. OKAY.

445
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,315
<i> SONJA USES THAT SAME BREADING</i>

446
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,117
<i> ON HER BUTTERMILK</i>
   <i> FRIED CHICKEN.</i>

447
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:02,553
THAT'S FRIED CRUNCH-A-LICIOUS
   RIGHT THERE.
OH, GOOD.

448
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:05,223
<i> SHE ALSO USES IT ON HER</i>
  <i> CHICKEN-FRIED STEAK...</i>

449
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,391
VERY GOOD.

450
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:07,592
<i> WHICH IS REALLY MOIST.</i>

451
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,993
JUICY.

452
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,995
<i> AND HERE'S THE TWIST--</i>
 <i> SONJA'S CHICKEN-FRIED STEAK--</i>

453
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,997
<i> INSTEAD OF A SOLID</i>
  <i> PIECE OF BEEF--</i>

454
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,600
<i> IS A 50-50 MIXTURE</i>
 <i> OF GROUND BEEF AND VEAL.</i>

455
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,369
I THINK THE VEAL AND THE BEEF
IDEA OF CHICKEN-FRIED STEAK--

456
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:21,606
NICE BIG AND VERY
  FLAVORFUL, FLUFFY.

457
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:24,075
IT'S GOT A LITTLE BIT
 OF A PEPPERY TASTE TO IT.

458
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,643
OKAY.

459
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:34,218
THAT IS REALLY GOOD.
THE BREADING'S NOT TOO THICK,

460
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,988
AND THE MEAT IS NICE
 AND MOIST INSIDE.
       YES.

461
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,390
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE
     ABOUT IT.
 AND THERE'S
A LOT OF FLAVOR.

462
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:40,858
YOU CAN ACTUALLY
 TASTE MEAT.

463
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,860
YOU'RE NOT JUST TASTING
FRIED BATTER, FRIED THING.

464
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:45,129
<i> THE LOCALS SAY IT'S THE SAME</i>
  <i> WITH EVERYTHING HERE--</i>

465
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,366
<i> REAL HOME COOKIN'</i>
<i>THAT TASTES LIKE SOMEONE CARES.</i>

466
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,401
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE ALL
 THE FLAVORS COME TOGETHER,

467
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,203
AND IT TASTES REALLY GOOD.

468
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:53,738
<i> AND REAL HOME BAKING, TOO.</i>

469
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:56,074
<i> WHEN WE COME BACK, I'M MAKING</i>
 <i> A LITTLE SOMETHING SWEET</i>

470
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,942
<i> TO TOP OFF MY MEAL.</i>

471
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:04,348
<i> AT THE RAMONA CAFÉ,</i>

472
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,417
<i> THE LUNCH AND DINNER CROWD</i>
 <i> IS PACKIN' THE JOINT...</i>

473
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,886
YOU'RE WELCOME. DO YOU GUYS
 NEED ANYTHING ELSE RIGHT NOW?

474
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,022
<i> FOR BIG FAVORITES</i>
 <i> LIKE CHICKEN CORDON BLEU</i>

475
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,691
<i> AND CHICKEN-FRIED STEAK.</i>

476
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,427
<i> BUT THIS PLACE IS JUST</i>
 <i> AS BIG FOR BREAKFAST...</i>

477
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:19,897
TOMATOES, BACON, GARLIC,
  GREEN BELL PEPPERS.

478
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,933
<i> WITH SOMETHING</i>
 <i> CALLED THE KITCHEN SINK.</i>

479
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:25,069
CHEDDAR CHEESE.
IS THIS GONNA STOP
 AT ANY POINT?

480
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,471
JACK CHEESE.
     SOME POINT.

481
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,606
<i> THE HAWAIIAN SHORT STACK</i>
  <i> WITH PINEAPPLE,</i>

482
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,041

483
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,643
<i> AND STRAWBERRY-CREAM-CHEESE-</i>
  <i> STUFFED FRENCH TOAST.</i>

484
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,012
ONE OF THE BEST RESTAURANTS
 IN THE AREA, YOU THINK?
 DEFINITELY.

485
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,180
OH, THE BEST.

486
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,849
THAT'S LIKE A FOOTBALL.

487
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,284
<i> FOR A OT OF FOLKS,</i>
  <i> THE BEST OF THE BEST</i>

488
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,753
<i> ARE THE MASSIVE CINNAMON ROLLS</i>
  <i> MADE FRESH EVERY DAY.</i>

489
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:45,923
I SEE THAT YOU'VE OPENED IT AND
DISPLAYED IT FOR ME SO NICELY.

490
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:49,193
BUT I HAVEN'T REALLY FELT
THE INVITATION TO EAT IT YET.
     OF COURSE NOT.

491
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,628
THAT'S FOR ME
     TO TAKE HOME.

492
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,030
WHO TAUGHT YOU
    HOW TO MAKE 'EM?
MY MOM.

493
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,399
YOUR MOM?
 YES. YOU PUT
2 CUPS OF MILK IN,

494
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,368
AND THEN YOU THROW IN
4 OUNCES OF MARGARINE.

495
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,870
SLOWLY POUR IT
 IN THERE.

496
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,772
<i> IT'S ALL MIXED UP WITH SALT,</i>
 <i> SUGAR, YEAST AND FLOUR.</i>

497
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,909
SO THAT'S GONNA WACKA-
 WACKA-WACKA FOR FIVE MINUTES?

498
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:08,012
AND THEN YOU PUT IT
IN A BOWL AND LET IT RISE.

499
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:11,682
THEN WE THROW THE BIG
   GOB OF GOO--DOUGH--
THE BIG GOB OF GOO?

500
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,085
THAT'S WHAT I CALL IT.
 IS THAT
A BAKING TERM?

501
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:16,154
IT GOT HAPPY HERE.
  OKAY.
     IT GOT HAPPY?

502
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:19,056
YES.
     THE BIG GOB
    OF GOO GOT HAPPY?

503
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,693
YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING
 OUT, LIKE, A BIG GOB OF GOO

504
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:25,096
WORKOUT VIDEO.
THERE YOU GO.

505
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,064
OKAY, WE GOT
THE MARGARINE...
       WOW.

506
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,033
AND WE'RE GONNA SPREAD THAT
 ALL OVER THE DOUGH.

507
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:31,969
WATCH OUT.

508
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,906
AND THEN WE PUT
THE CINNAMON, BROWN SUGAR.

509
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,408
THAT IS A TON
   OF CINNAMON AND SUGAR.
IT IS.

510
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,943
WHAT KIND OF NUTS?
PECANS.

511
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,979
THEN WE'RE GONNA ROLL IT
   FROM THE FREE.

512
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,881
SERRATED
SO IT DOESN'T TEAR.

513
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,551
DO THEY GO RIGHT
     IN THE CENTER?
UM, THAT'S FINE.

514
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,986
HEAVY.

515
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,789
WHAT PART DO YOU EAT FIRST--
  THE CENTER OR THE OUTSIDE?
THE CENTER.

516
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,858
THAT'S WHERE YOU GO?
YEAH.

517
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:03,301
MY SON HUNTER WOULD GO--
    OR RYDER--

518
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,803
WOULD GO OUT
  OF THEIR MINDS FOR THIS.

519
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,206
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
 I GOTTA TAKE HIM ONE OF THESE.

520
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,107
GET A SPATULA, TOO.
SPATULA? OKAY.

521
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,510
YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
 TO SCRAPE ME OFF THE CEILING

522
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:13,644
AFTER THIS MUCH SUGAR.

523
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,147
I'M GOOD FOR TWO
    A DAY SOMETIMES.
TWO A DAY?

524
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:19,016
ONE IN THE MORNING
     AND THEN--
 YOU NEED TO GET
INTO SOME REHAB, BRO.

525
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:21,786
WE NEED TO HAVE
A COUNSEL GROUP.
  THAT'S THE WHOLE REASON
  I HAVEN'T LEFT THIS TOWN

526
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,721
IS BECAUSE
   OF THE CINNAMON ROLLS.

527
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,957
<i> SONJA'S SURE NOT</i>
  <i> GOING ANYWHERE.</i>

528
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,558
<i> SHE'S HAVING TOO MUCH FUN...</i>

529
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,659
SHE STACKED HER EGGSHELLS.

530
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,361
<i> RUNNING THE PLACE TO GO...</i>

531
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,830
DID HE PUT HIS HAIR ON FOR ME?
  IS THAT FOR ME TODAY?
YEAH, FOR YOU.

532
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:33,831
YOU'RE MONEY.

533
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,533
<i> IN HER HOMETOWN.</i>

534
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:38,903
ASK ME WHAT
    I GET FOR DINNER?
 I DON'T KNOW
CINNAMON ROLL KING.

535
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,339
EXACTLY,
    A CINNAMON ROLL.
 NO, YOU DON'T GET
A CINNAMON ROLL FOR--

536
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:42,506
YES, I DO.

537
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,408
WELL, THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP,
  BUT DON'T WORRY.

538
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,910
I'LL BE LOOKIN' FOR YA

539
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,145
AT AMERICA'S GREATEST DINERS,
  DRIVE-INS AND DIVES.

540
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:53,184
NOW THAT PUTS
    THE "T" IN TASTY.

541
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:57,788
THAT MADE NO SENSE.
