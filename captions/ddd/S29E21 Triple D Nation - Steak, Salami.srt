115
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,708
       that we would call       
      people's names out...     

116
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,043
         Order up, Mike!

  ...and they couldn't hear us  

118
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,379
 'cause it would be so crowded. 

119
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:08,780
     So we got a microphone.

00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,051
I just wanna come here

We went teriyaki on it?

             RENDI:             
 Teriyaki pork with wasabi slaw.

129
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,733
 We make our own teriyaki sauce.

130
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,604
  It's brown sugar, soy sauce,  
    lemongrass, ginger root,    

131
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,739

        to make it thick.

    Slice a pork tenderloin.

00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,411
       Then we marinate it      
     in our teriyaki sauce.

teriyaki sauce on the pork,     

141
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:03,201
and all of sudden, that wasabi  
horseradish on the slaw.

 Got the slaw in it, the cheese,
 and the teriyaki gives the pork

 kind of a tangy taste to it -- 
    complements it very well.

          Yes, you are.         
     Cheesesteak egg rolls.     

153
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:33,532
  I'm using the same meat that  
   we use in our cheesesteaks,

       some chopped onion.

       for the State Fair.

   You know, it's really nice   
   having just hand-held food.  

158
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:45,877
      And then I'll add the     
 mushrooms, fresh bell peppers. 

159
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,481
          Add American          
    and Monterey Jack cheese.   

160
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,084
     I'm just gonna take our    
        egg roll wrapper,       

161

    and meat, seal the edges,

00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,423
     and I'm gonna drop them    
       right in the fryer.

Moochie's cheesesteak egg rolls.

164

     There's one that we do

165
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,766
       and one that we do       
      with a nacho cheese.

  The cheesesteaks              
always reign supreme.

   After one bite, I was sold.

 immediately as the cheesesteak.

fresh basil, fresh garlic.      

233
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,545
Gonna take celery, carrot,      
onion -- just a quick chop.     

234
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:35,013
Now I take extra virgin.        

235
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,348
   Good red wine.               

236
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,416
I let this sweat for about four 
   or five minutes              

237
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,884
and add my tomatoes.            

238
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,953
   Three scoops of this in here,
      right in with the ricotta.

239
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,154
Right in with the ricotta.      

240
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,089
             -Cream?            
           -Two cups.           

241
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,958
  Reggiano, Asiago.             

242
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,160
              Pecorino Romano,  
            Parmigiano Reggiano.

243
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,762
    Just give it                
 a nice little stir.            

244
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,831
            So, it's got kind of
             a rosy color to it.

245
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,567
         -A little rosa.        
   -You got a word for it all.  

246
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,636
                    Hey!        

247
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:58,970
        Okay, mixture goes down?

248
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,573
Couple of ladles of marinara.   
  Fresh mozzarella.             

249
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:02,841
I cook the pasta al dente       

250
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,242
  'cause when I go              
in the oven with it,            

251
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,577
   I don't want it              
   to become mush.              

252
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,045
             Ooh, look at that! 

253
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,513
             This show's called 
    "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

254
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,314
    I travel around the country,
        and I watch<i> other people</i>

255
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,583
      cook in their restaurants.

256
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,851
             Right.             
          He was great.         

257
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,387
    I'd hire him in a minute.   

258
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,389
 Add some marinara.             
A little bit of Reggiano.       

259
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,991
Right into the oven --          
350 for about 30 minutes.       

260
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,660
 It'll set right up             
  for the takeout.              

261
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:22,994
    There you go.               
That's the finished product.    

262
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,462
           Look at that bad boy.

263
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,598
Take this nice piece like that, 
put it in a frying pan,         

264
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,934
and put a nice ladle of sauce   
here, some fresh mozzarella.    

265
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,003
And I'm gonna go right in the   
wood-fired oven with this.      

266
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,004
             -Boom.             
             -Boom.             

267
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,472
             -Done.             
    -Ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom.    

268
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,474
After about two minutes         
in there, I'll take it.         

269
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:39,411
 Stays nice and high            
on the plate like that.         

270
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,079
 There's your baked             
spaghetti pie lunch.            

271
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,413
                [ Whistles ]    

272
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,949
       You just served me enough
   for my whole family to enjoy.

273
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,551
        Mmm.                    
   Great texture.               

274
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:49,955
The fresh mozzarella on top,    
the handmade sauce -- delicious.

275
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,556
   Nice job, man.               

276
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:54,492
             FIERI:             
     And this place is still    
  putting out real-deal Italian 

277
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:56,094
 right in the middle of Arizona.

278
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,296
         But these days,        
   Dennis is more likely to be  

279
00:09:58,298 --> 00:09:59,897
          on the couch          
      than in the kitchen.      

280
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,232
   You know, he's retired now,  

281
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,500
        and it's my turn        
      to take care of him.      

282
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,101
           Thank you.           

283
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,237
FIERI: But when he does come in,
  he's showcasing the classics  

284
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:09,707
       like his polpettes       
       or fried meatballs.      

285
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,977
DENNIS: 80/20 on the ground beef
         is always good,        

286
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,712
     because you don't want     
        a lot of gristle.       

287
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:17,048
Parsley, salt -- about an ounce.

288
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,717
    Regular pepper, garlic --   
          four ounces.          

289
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,119
       Then I'm gonna add       
      a little bread crumbs     

290
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,122
      here, a little milk,      
 and a little cheese to start --

291
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,589
       Parmigiano Ramono.       

292
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,591
    I'm gonna add three eggs.   

293
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,860
     Yeah, if Guy was here,     
 he'd be right over my shoulder.

294
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,462
       "Can I taste that?       
       Can I touch this?"       

295
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,598
                     Mm.        

296
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,866
              Look at this guy. 

297
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:37,334
                    Huh.        

298
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:41,206
You're missing the cheese-eating
          and him yelling at me.

299
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,042
   He knows what good food is,  
       and that's the key.      

300
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,613
      We're gonna put these     
       in the oven at 350       

301
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,348
     for about half an hour.    

302
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,752
   10, 20 seconds in the fryer  
  each, and they'll be perfect. 

303
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,286
    FIERI: And they're topped   
         with marinara,         

304
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:58,156
        which has gotten        
     a lot less complicated.    

305
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,424
 House marinara is extra virgin 
           olive oil,           

306
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,360
         chopped garlic,        
         chopped onion,         

307
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,161
          house-peeled          
      San Marzano tomatoes,     

308
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,698
      chopped basil, salt,      
           and pepper.          

309
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,366
              Done.             

310
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,434
    Super moist on the inside   
   and crunchy on the outside,  

311
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,703
      so it's really tasty.     

312
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,505
  They are perfectly textured.  

313
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,307
        I absolutely love       
 the house-made marinara sauce. 

314
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,376
    That's my favorite thing    
          on the menu.          

315
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:21,579
        I could drink it.       

316
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:24,448
   This guy is out of bounds.   

317
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,984
           Hysterical.          

318
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:29,587
I was so serious, trying to make
    the food come off right,    

319
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:30,989
       trying to make sure      
    everything was technical.   

320
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:32,390
     And my dad just came in    
        and threw a whole       

321
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,591
          monkey wrench         
      in that whole thing.      

322
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:34,859
I don't know where Justin is,   

323
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,994
   but he has got               
a hard act to follow.           

324
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,396
             JUSTIN:            
   You know what I feel like?   

325
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,664
   I feel like the opening act  
       for Metallica now.       

326
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,998
          That's great.         
         -Yeah, exactly.        

327
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,934
FIERI: Oh, remember those pizzas
        we came here for        

328
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,202
       in the first place?      

329
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,337
  Well, Justin's about to take  
          center stage          

330
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,207
 with a killer pie he's rocking 
     in the wood-fired oven.    

331
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,277
   Plus, wait till you see his  
encore with that homemade dough.

332
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,279
       It's out of control here.

333
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,983
   FIERI: We're checking in on  
     a family-run brick-oven    

334
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:01,653
          Italian joint         
      in Glendale, Arizona.     

335
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:04,055
      The grandfather used      
    to own the Bendix Diner,    

336
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,724
  a real legend in New Jersey.  

337
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,925
      The dad's a graduate      
       of culinary school.      

338
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,794
        Life's too short        
        to eat bad food.        

339
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:13,197
 And the son's been making pizza
   since he was 13 years old,   

340
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,467
 so he's had plenty of practice 
     slinging real-deal pie,    

341
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:19,270
   like this house-specialty,   
       the Mediterranean.       

342
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,938
  Flour it up, stretch it out,  

343
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,740
     and we're just going to    
     give it a little twirl.    

344
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,809
  There you go, nice and soft,  
         nice and thin.         

345
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,544
        Fresh mozzarella        
         goes on first.         

346
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:27,946
    It's got homemade pesto.    

347
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:29,948
         Alfredo sauce.         
     Put the pesto in there.    

348
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,082
