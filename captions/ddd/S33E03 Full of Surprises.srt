  American fare, Mexican fare,  

228
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,376
      you can find it here.     

229
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,213
      FIERI: That's 'cause      
 Carlos Arzola and Jose Gonzalez

230
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,948
  are bringing a mix of flavors 

231
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,151
      and their backgrounds     
   to this city on the border.  

232
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,819
         Are you born and raised
                 in El Paso?    

233
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,687
 No. I was born in El Salvador, 
            actually.           

234
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,089
I was born in Paris.            

235
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:41,159
   Me and Carlos, we met here   
at the El Paso Culinary College.

236
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,693
   I started as a pastry chef.  

237
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,695
     Then I went to Germany,    
       studied over there.      

238
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,631
       Yeah. Yeah, so, you know,
      I went to culinary school.

239
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,899
         Then I went to Germany.

240
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,367
          Chef, where'd you come
               into this mix?   

241
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,235
He texted me one time           
    and was like,               

242
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,637
 "I need a Head chef            
for this restaurant."           

243
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,239
So I was like, "Okay.           
We're gonna make it unique."    

244
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,508
     Argentinean salpicones.    

245
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,775
      WOMAN #5:                 
What I like about DELIght is    

246
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,778
  that you can have             
a little bit of everything.     

247
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,313
  And what's your favorite thing
                on the menu?    

248
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:02,781
I will say, pupusas.            

249
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:06,184
  The pupusa from here are same 
   as the ones in El Salvador.  

250
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,652
       Chicharrón pupusas.      

251
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,655
      The chicharrón pupusa     
       is a piece of pork       

252
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:15,126
with just a little bit of fat --
   very crunchy and delicious.  

253
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,128
                   Let's go.    
We're making the cordito.       

254
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,330
              What is cordito?  

255
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,065
The slaw that goes on           
 top of the pupusa.             

256
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,265
          I'll follow your lead.

257
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,201
We have here one head           
of blanched cabbage,            

258
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,669
  carrots, onions,              

259
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,338
      bay leaf,                 
chili flakes, sugar,            

260
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,940
      oregano,                  
apple cider vinegar.            

261
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,408
                 The cabbage    
              blanching water?  

262
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,743
        Yes.                    

263
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,678
          So, to put that flavor
               back in there?   
   Exactly.                     

264
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,948
It's gonna sit outside at       
cool temperature for five days. 

265
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,751
  We're making Salvadoran kimchi
               or sauerkraut.   

266
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:40,952
      Exactly.                  

267
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,287
Now we're gonna make            
  the pupusa sauce.             

268
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,688
              The pupusa sauce. 

269
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,889
 We have a hot pan,             

270
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,826
    oil, onions,                
tomato, oregano, bay leaf.      

271
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:50,761
                       Bay leaf.
Sugar, salt, water.             

272
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,031
Once it boil, we let it sit     
   for 45 minutes               

273
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,498
at a medium-low heat.           

274
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,168
We blend it and then we chill it
for another eight hours,        

275
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,703
and then we get it ready        
      to serve.                 

276
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,704
           What are we into now?

277
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,239
 So, we have a piece            
    of pork butt.               

278
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,708
What you're gonna do here       
is trim all the fat as possible.

279
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,443
          What is the Salvadoran
                 chicharrón     

280
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,912
      compared to the chicharrón
     you and I know from Mexico?

281
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,514
Chicharrón from Mexico          
 comes from the fat.            

282
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:10,982
Salvadoran, we're gonna         
      grind it                  

283
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,917
   with some meat               
and call it chicharrón.         

284
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,519
              Wait, wait, wait! 

285
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,054
    So the chicharrón we know --
 Yeah.                          

286
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,122
 I try to tell you.             
That's the situation.           

287
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,091
 This is Salvadoran             
     chicharrón.                

288
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,526
        Yes.                    

289
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:22,994
                 We're back.    

290
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:27,265
        So, what we're making is
     Salvadoran ground-pork dish

291
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:30,335
    that goes inside of the masa
             to make the pupusa.

292
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:31,335
      Exactly.                  

293
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,072
              So the chicharrón 
               that we know...  

294
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,873
     is not the same chicharrón.

295
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,009
           So we have to call it
          Salvadoran chicharrón.

296
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,677
 Exactly.                       
              So, break it down.

297
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,012
 We render the fat.             

298
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,548
Once the fat is crispy,         
   we take it out.              

299
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,349
               Cook the pork.   

300
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,550
         Then you hit the garlic
               and the onions.  

301
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,153
      Yes.                      
               We're gonna use  
               the pork butt,   

302
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:50,488
   the garlic, and the onions --
     run it through the grinder.

303
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,624
      Exactly.                  
    Salt, cumin.                

304
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:53,958
           And that's gonna make
                the stuffing.   

305
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,160
        Yes.                    
                    Got it.     

306
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,628
We're gonna make the masa.      
                           Okay.

307
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,830
   We have Maseca,              
    salt, water.                

308
00:09:58,832 --> 00:09:59,964
So, are you gonna help me       
      out here?                 

309
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,367
               You can do it!   
               Good job, Chef!  

310
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:04,502
    Didn't he mean it like that,
             like, help him out?

311
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,237
Get a nice well here.           

312
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,572
 Pork in the center.            

313
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:08,573
If you start breaking down,     

314
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,108
then you have to add            
  more masa to it.              

315
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,243
                You're making   
              the determination 

316
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,379
         if you want to add masa
                 or less-a.     

317
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:15,647
   Got jokes, Guy.              

318
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,716
          I'll be here all week.
 Goes to the flat top,          

319
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,451
  and then cook it              
for a minute on each side.      

320
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,585
 Now they're ready.             

321
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:21,986
         Served with the cabbage
           and the tomato sauce.

322
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,654
        Yes.                    

323
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,591
                     ♪♪         

324
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:27,725
                    Mmm.        

325
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,327
                I'll have 500   
              of these, please. 

326
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:32,530
       Nice texture of the meat,
      creamy, good salt balance,

327
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:35,933
          nice onion and garlic,
 a little funk from the cabbage.

328
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,669
         Nice crunch, good acid.

329
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:39,404
              That's different. 

330
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:40,538
               Tons of flavor.  

331
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,940
                When you get    
             that tomato sauce, 

332
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,541
       it's enough of a contrast

333
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:45,744
        to this crunchy, pickled
                  cabbage.      

334
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,679
   I can't eat any more of this,
               but I have to.   

335
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:49,981
          I'm doing this for you
         in the name of science.

336
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,619
               That's no joke.  

337
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:55,954
       Chicharrón pupusas.      

338
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:58,222
      The chicharrón pupusa     
     is one of my favorite.     

339
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,824
It's very crispy on the outside,

340
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,293
   but it retains the softness  
         on the inside.         

341
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,429
 The cordito, which is the slaw,

342
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,698
      and the tomato sauce      
     complement really well.    

343
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,966
         Falafel tacos.         

344
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:11,168
    I love coming to DELIght    
  because everything I have had 

345
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,637
       has been wonderful.      

346
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,772
                  The name      
         doesn't exactly explain

347
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,708
                  all that      
            the restaurant does.

348
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,044
   The name is mostly because,  
 like, how you leave the place. 

349
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:21,046
   You feel happy, delightful.  
                          Right?

350
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:22,447
          And you know,         
       it's a play on word      

351
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,315
     because it's also like,    
      "deli" and "delight."     

352
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:25,850
               No, I got you.   

353
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,052
 MAN: I think this really brings
   a little bit of a new taste  

354
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,186
           to El Paso.          

355
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,321
                  What else     
             are we gonna make? 

356
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,656
GONZALEZ: Chickpea fries        
 with black ketchup.            

357
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,124
       The chickpea fries.      

358
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,860
 MAN #2: The chickpea fries with
  black ketchup are delicious.  

359
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,863
  I like the idea of them being 
 chickpeas instead of potatoes. 

360
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,532
  The flavor is just fantastic. 

361
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,732
              Not just regular  
                French fries.   

362
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:42,933
  Not your typical              
    French fries.               

363
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:43,935
                You worry me.   

364
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,269
      Exactly.                  
   You should be.               

365
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,738
         I resemble that remark.

366
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,939
                We'll see you   
              in a little bit.

368
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,752
          Alright, welcome back.

369
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:03,021
          "Triple D" hanging out
    in El Paso, Texas, at, uh --

370
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,890
        Now, am I correct to say
               "deliliiight?"   

371
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,224
     "Delight."                 

372
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,627
               Oh, you made it  
              much more simple. 

373
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,296
     The food is delicious.     

374
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,565
   Whatever you're in the mood  
  for, you'll be able to find.  

375
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,567
     FIERI: Even if it's off    
        the beaten path.        

376
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,368
   GONZALEZ: Chickpea fries up  
       with black ketchup.      

377
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,304
  The chickpea fries are very,  
           very good.           

378
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,307
    It's very different than    
  the typical, uh, French fry.  

379
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,043
          The texture's         
        a little firmer.        

380
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:28,379
  The black ketchup, also very  
tasty, adds a nice little spice.

381
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,580
                   So, now      
         what are you making us?

382
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,048
   Chickpea fries               
 with black ketchup.            

383
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,716
     I told you.                
     It gets weirder as it goes.

384
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:33,918
I told you to get ready.        

385
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,386
It's chickpea flour.            

386
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,254
      And we're gonna make fries
 out of this, like French fries?

387
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,656
     Like fries.                
       Water.                   

388
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,991
Salt, then you mix it.          
                         Right. 

389
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,394
    Next, we get                
  into the big pan.             

390
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,096
      Oh, we're gonna cook this!
Yes, we're gonna cook it.       

391
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,867
                    I --        

392
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,403
 Olive oil, garlic,             
      rosemary.                 

393
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,538
Once you have your mix          
    all ready...                

394
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,873
            Your pancake batter.

395
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,408
...you're gonna cook it         
 for about an hour.             

396
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,276
        And once it gets cooked,

397
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,612
  I assume we gotta bring it out
              and let it chill. 

398
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,947
    For 24 hours.               

399
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,682
   Then we cut it.              

400
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:05,950
                    Okay.       

401
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:09,020
We take this to the deep fryer  
for about four minutes.         

402
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,754
              The last piece is 
          to make black ketchup.

403
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,756
  Black ketchup --              
my favorite one, actually.      

404
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:16,494
Olive oil, old garlic,          
  onion, tomatoes,              

405
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:19,230
  forbidden rice --             
     black rice.                

406
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,298
              I'm lost, folks.  

407
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,167
    Salt, sugar,                
water to cook the rice.         

408
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,435
            Gonna cook this down
               how long, Chef?  

409
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:25,770
   For 45 minutes.              

410
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:28,172
    We blend it.                

411
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,708
 Now it's mixed with            
 the sherry vinegar.            

412
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,178
We let it rest for 24 hours,    
   and we're done.              

413
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,379
            Let's see it, buddy.

414
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,714
So, we have the chickpea fries, 
  nice and golden,              

415
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:37,982
 with black ketchup.            

416
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,386
    I don't think I've ever seen
                these before.   

417
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,187
                 Reminds me     
             of a polenta fry --

418
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,455
           a little bit lighter.

419
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,991
      Rosemary really comes out.

420
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,460
   This black ketchup -- you get
             the sherry vinegar 

421
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:53,965
 with all the caramelized onions
        and tomatoes and garlic.

422
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,332
         And it gets balsamic-y.

423
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,135
                 Balsamic-y?    

424
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,535
      It's a lot of flavor, man.

425
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,671
               A lot going on   
              in a little dish. 

426
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,340
                  Well done.    
Thank you, sir.                 

427
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,742
         Chickpea fries.        

428
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:06,210
            WOMAN #6:           
      The taste is amazing.     

429
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,881
    You want to eat healthy,    
   the chickpeas are way to go  

430
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:12,016
        'cause you're not       
         feeling guilty.        

431
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,886
      The black ketchup is      
   a nice little sweet adding   

432
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:17,021
       to the salty flavor      
     of the chickpea fries.     

433
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,157
    Are you guys enjoying the   
 pupusas and the chickpea fries?

434
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,358
             -Yeah.             
            -Love it.           

435
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,226
 FIERI: So, what makes the food 
          so good here?         

436
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:22,160
                 The taste.     

437
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,561
     That's profound, buddy.    

438
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:24,896
      Come on, help me out.     
                             No.

439
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,631
       It's the different flavor
                  to it --      

440
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:27,966
               something that   
         I'm not really used to.

441
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,234
       It just makes it amazing.

442
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,301
          Lamb burger.          

443
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,437
             MAN #1:            
  Carlos is just a great chef.  

444
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,639
  He really puts his own style  
         into the food,         

445
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,708
     and that's really what     
  makes this restaurant unique. 

446
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,909
         Watch out for this guy.

447
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,244
        Keep all that creativity
           and all that freedom.

   Thank you, sir.              

450
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,651
FIERI: Coming up, a stellar spot
         in Santa Fe...         

451
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,052
       It's got character, baby.

452
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,988
 ...cooking up a crazy combo... 

453
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,589
           That's the money bite
                right there.    

454
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,791
     ...and putting a twist     
           on tamales.          

455
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,726
   It makes me actually question
              why I haven't had

00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,776
     30 minutes.                
Add them to the blender.        

574
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:08,579
 Finish it with salt            
    and cilantro.               

575
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:09,981
                  Next up?      

576
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,183
We're gonna roast the chicken   
for the salsa verde.            

577
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,784
                     Here we go.
  Salt and pepper.              

578
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:17,120
      How long's it gonna roast?
45 minutes at 350.              

579
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,522
             Shred the chicken. 

580
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,790
Add our chili verde.            

581
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,793
Little bit of cooking time      
there, and that's that.         

582
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,462
   What else goes on the tamale?
               Anything else?   

583
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:25,929
We put red chili down.          

584
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,798
      Let's make some red chili.
Right on.                       

585
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,068
    Water, chili,               
   onions, garlic.              

586
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,469
                    Coriander.  
      Yes, sir.                 

587
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,138
                    Cumin       
             and a little salt. 

588
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,873
 Bring that to boil.            

589
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,008
        Into the blender, puree.

590
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,343
  We have the masa.             

591
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,345
      These are                 
rehydrated corn husks.          

592
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,547
So we go here, right?           
                         Okay.  

593
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,415
     The chicken                
 tomatillo filling,             

594
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,685
and then it's just fold         
 one over the other.            

595
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,953
        Boom.                   

596
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:49,953
            And then we're gonna
          steam these, how long?

597
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,088
     25 minutes.                

598
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,756
  We let them cool,             
and then we fry them            

599
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,291
   out of the husk              
  in the duck fat.              

600
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,760
         Let's build the tamale.

601
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:59,230
     Red chili,                 
with some Cotija cheese.        

602
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:01,432
              A lot of tamales, 
              never one fried.  

603
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,036
             It's a really nice 
              and light tamale. 

604
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,705
      The duck fat works in that
       it helps suspending that.

605
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,974
   I really do like the textural
   difference of the soft tamale

606
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,909
           to the crunchy tamale
               on the outside.  

607
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:12,910
        Yeah.                   

608
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:15,379
       It reminds me of a pupusa
                or an arepa.    

609
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,847
The chicken and the green chili,
                 of course,     

610
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,382
         works so well together.

611
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,785
                   I want       
             to drink the sauce.

612
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,119
                 It makes me    
              actually question 

613
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:25,256
              why I haven't had 
    more duck-fat fried tamales.

614
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,657
      Me, too.                  
                    Well done.  

615
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:27,658
       Peace.                   

616
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,926
      MAN #4: Tamale down.      

617
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,929
 MAN #8: What I love about this 
    tamale is the red chili.    

618
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:34,932
Red chili runs through our veins
        here in Santa Fe.       

619
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:37,067
It's the duck fat --            
everything in duck fat,         

620
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,568
anything in duck fat.           

621
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,537
          There should be a duck
           fat T-shirt from Joe.

622
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,807
           -Should be.          
  -Will you chop that eggplant? 

623
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,075
 I absolutely love coming here. 

624
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,943
     It's a privilege to get    
       to enjoy his food.       

625
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,812
             Simple ingredients 
             done the right way,

626
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:49,880
           treated with respect.

627
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,415
              Everything you do 
              is very mindful.  

628
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,751
           Good job, my brother.
Thank you.                      

629
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,886
  Was that a road trip or what? 

630
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,288
        But don't worry.        

631
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,623
   There's plenty more joints   
  all over this great country.  

632
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,493
     I'll be looking for you    
    next time on "Triple D."
