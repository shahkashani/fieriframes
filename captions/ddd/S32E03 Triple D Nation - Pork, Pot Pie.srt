107
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:17,529
                    Wow.        

108
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,730
     We're gonna                
   score this now               

109
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,932
so it can absorb the            
seasoning much better.          

110
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,268
Alright, now we are ready       
to add our seasoning.

00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,337
       Dry rub                  
  and the wet rub.              

112
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:26,938
         That is crazy.         

113
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,273
        Okay, roll it up        

114
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,208
     like you're rolling up     
 your sleeping bag at pig camp. 

115
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,877
                I cannot wait   
                to try this.    

116
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,811
      It's gonna marinate       
      for 12 hours and then     
      we go on the grill.       

117
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:34,946
      Yeah.

121
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,221

 three, four hours.

00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:54,026
 First we start with            
   local ram goat,              

165
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:55,626
   add some curry,              
   a bit of salt,               

166
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,962
  and then we have              
   a special blend              

167
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,630
   of all-purpose               
     seasoning.                 

168
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,966
 This marinates for             
   about 12 hours.              

169
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,901

   sit and simmer               

170
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:03,968
for about 20 minutes

194
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,771
          Then you fry.

                No restaurant

203
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,619
    You can't eat               
    enough of it,               

204
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,688
 then you're full

  every bite of it.             

211

  Can't beat that.              

212
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,102
                 I told you

215
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,707
        As soon as we got       
        back to the ship,       

216
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,110
       we were all craving      
    that jerk all over again.

         Now, coming up,

      Does anybody ever do      
     the John Belushi and --

  of "least likely to change."

  Atlanta, in Tucker, Georgia,  

224
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,836
      there's a 64-year-old

     go as planned that day.

      sweet potato souffle.     

249
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,962

     everything ready to go.    

250
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,765

    "What else can you make?"   

251
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:47,833

      "Biscuits and gravy."

00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,782

this measuring technique.

         start cutting them out.

286
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,304
            Boil for

287
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,305
         and then we're         
        gonna thicken it        

288
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:03,507
            with our

      our pulled, chopped,      
       white-meat chicken.

            Mix those           
          a little bit.         

292
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,217
            Now time            
         for the gravy,         

293
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:15,186
   and the part everyone loves  
          is the crust.         

294
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:16,187
          Roll it out.          

295
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:17,989
           Put it back          
      on your rolling pin,      

296
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,190

        melted margarine.       

299
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:22,994
       It's gonna make it       
      really golden brown.

303
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,936
         The chicken's shredded,
      which makes it very moist,

304
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,005
             and then the crust 
                 is amazing.    

305
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,607
MAN: It's kind of like          
  Mom use to make.              

306
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,274
    The carrots,                
   the green peas,              

307
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,609
and then with the crust         
  and the chicken.              

308
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:39,744
  It's phenomenal.

00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,346

     is hitting a triple --

     chicken and dumplings.     

311
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,749
   Now we're gonna              
   make dumplings?              

312
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,418
          We're gonna knead this
                 quite a bit    

313
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,620
       We need                  
    a lot of it.                
            We need to knead it.

314
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:49,754
       We need                  
 a lot of dumplings?

642
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,251
                  really is     
        a combination of flavors

643
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,119
                 that works     
              very, very well.  

644
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:25,122
          The pork loin

everybody loves the joint.

                 It's nuts.     
                 It's gonzo.

It's "off the hook,"
