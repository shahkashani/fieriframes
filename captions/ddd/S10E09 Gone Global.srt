           SWEET, SALTY, SPICY.

       BETTER THAN THAT.        
WANNA MAKE                      
FETTUCCINI?                     

236
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,478
                           YEAH.
THEN LET'S MAKE IT.             

237
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,145
WE'RE GONNA USE                 
SEMOLINA FLOUR.                 

238
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,749
I START THE MACHINE FIRST,      
    THEN PUT THE EGGS.          
           HOW MANY EGGS DID YOU
             JUST ADD IN THERE? 

239
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,751
I PUT ABOUT 20.                 
                 WHO'S COUNTIN'?

240
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,753
 THEN WE'RE GONNA PUT           
A LITTLE BIT OLIVE OIL.         

241
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,755
AND THEN WE JUST LET IT MIX     
    AT THE SECOND SPEED         

242
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:19,357
FOR THREE, FOUR MINUTES.        
         YOU'RE NOT GONNA USE   
     A MACHINE TO ROLL THIS OUT?

243
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:20,892
NO, I USE A ROLLING PIN.        

244
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,628
                 I-I AM LATE    
            FOR SOME IMPORTANT--
TAKE TWO SECONDS.               

245
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:25,630
               I WILL BE BACK.  
             I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

246
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,898
              GOOD LUCK ON THAT.
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA          
   KNEAD THE DOUGH              

247
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,835
BEFORE IT RESTS.                
 I PUT A BOWL--                 
                          RIGHT.

248
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,103
   JUST COVER IT UP.            
WE'RE GONNA LET IT REST         

249
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,706
FOR 20 MINUTES, THEN IT'S READY 
     TO BE STRETCHED OUT.       
                      (whistles)

250
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,508
   SO NOW YOU JUST              
SLICE A LITTLE PIECE.           

251
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,643
YOU DUST A LITTLE BIT           
      OF FLOUR.                 

252
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:39,911
AND I USE THE ROLLING PIN,      

253
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,913
AND THIS IS WHERE ME AND MY     
  WIFE ARGUE ALL THE TIME       

254
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:44,048
BECAUSE SHE USES                
  A BROOMSTICK.                 
                    MARIA?      
              COME HERE, MARIA. 

255
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:46,717
             CAN YOU SHOW ME HOW
             TO DO THIS, PLEASE?
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH          
THE WAY I WAS DOIN' IT?         

256
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,587
         OH, SEE, WE SEE A WHOLE
             DIFFERENT STYLE    

257
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:51,122
   RIGHT OFF THE BAT. I'VE NEVER
      SEEN IT DONE LIKE THIS.   
 MY GRANDMOTHER USED            
TO MAKE IT LIKE THAT.           

258
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,924
      IT'S OLD-FASHIONED.       
              YOU CAN KEEP GOIN'
                  ON YOURS.     

259
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:56,260
I THOUGHT I WAS OFF THE HOOK.   
  YOU DON'T LIKE MY THING?      

260
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,663
      IT'S BIG NOODLE DAY HERE. 

261
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,598
             ALL RIGHT.         
     OH, CHECK THIS METHOD OUT. 

262
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,534
       SO YOU GET NICE UNIFORM--
           CONSISTENTLY THIN    

263
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:04,736
           ALL THE WAY THROUGH. 

264
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,737
                     CAN I SEE  
                  ONE OF YOURS? 
I'M TRYIN' MY BEST.             

265
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,739
             FIND THAT THIN ONE.
THERE YOU GO.                   

266
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:12,210
             YOU READY FOR THIS?
                     OOH.       
MINE YOU CAN                    
SEE THROUGH.                    

267
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,544
           YOU CAN SEE THROUGH? 

268
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,880
             HERS IS SO THIN,   
           IT ONLY HAS ONE SIDE.

269
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,816
I FEEL DEJECTED NOW.            
         WELL, THIS WAS AMAZING.

270
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:20,285
               WHAT ARE WE GONNA
                MAKE WITH THIS? 
          VODKA SAUCE.          

271
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,553
FETTUCCINI AND VODKA SAUCE.     
            I LIKE ALL THE PARTS
                  OF THAT.      

272
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,755
        A LITTLE BIT OF OIL.    
     HEAT THIS UP A LITTLE BIT. 

273
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,024
      PUT IN SOME ONIONS. NOW   
  WE'RE GONNA PUT SOME MARINARA.

274
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:30,629
AND WHAT'S IN THE MARINARA?     
          IT'S CRUSHED TOMATOES,
                OREGANO,        

275
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:33,765
         A LITTLE BIT OF BASIL. 
        NOW WE'LL PUT THE VODKA.
PUTTING THAT VODKA--            

276
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,834
IT DOESN'T BURN OFF ALL         
THE ALCOHOL, BY THE WAY,        

277
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,769
BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH LIQUID'S    
      ALREADY IN THERE.         

278
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,504
   THERE'S JUST                 
THIS UNIQUE FLAVOR              

279
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:40,905
THAT GOES ALONG WITH            
  THE TOMATO SAUCE.             

280
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,974
PRETTY CRAZY COMBO.             
                NOW WHILE THIS  
             IS DOIN' ITS THING,

281
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,042
                 WE'RE GONNA PUT
                  THE PASTA IN. 
  FRESH PASTA                   
GOES REAL QUICK                 

282
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,645
             ABOUT A MINUTE.    
        NOW WE'LL PUT THE CREAM.
JUST A TOUCH.                   

283
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,581
LOOK AT THAT.                   
                 PASTA COMES UP.

284
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,582
   YOU GRAB IT.                 
I LIKE IT AL DENTE.             

285
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,050
FRESH-MADE PASTA                

286
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,653
    WITH A NICE, LIGHT          
VODKA SAUCE LIKE THIS--OH.      
                AND WE'RE READY.

287
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,722
             TAKE THIS OFF      
      AND PUT THAT ON THE PLATE.
AND PECORINO ROMANO?            

288
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,925
    YOU BRING IN THE WHOLE WHEEL
          AND BREAK IT DOWN     

289
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,394
             AND FRESH-GRATE IT?
GRATE IT EVERY MORNING.

292
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,933
          THERE IS A TEXTURAL   
      DIFFERENCE ON FRESH PASTA.

293
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,402
        THE WAY IT SEIZES UP    
     GIVES THE NICE CHEW TO IT, 

294
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,804
                 BUT IT'S SOFT. 

295

     AND THE FRED MILLINI.      

378
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,934
 MY SANDWICH, THE FRED MILLINI, 
       IT'S A WORK OF ART.      

379
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,469
    IT'S A VERY ELITE GROUP TO  
   GET A SANDWICH ON THE BOARD. 

380
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,739

             AND ARE THEY SPICY?

384
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,614
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.              
           OH, THEN YOU TRY ONE.

385
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,016

386
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,685
                 ALL RIGHT, CHOP
                  THE PEPPERS.  
TWO SECONDS JUST                
  SLICES IT UP.                 

387

         BEFORE. THEY'RE CRAZY. 

388
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,222
 WE WANT TO PUT THE ARTICHOKES, 
    A LITTLE BIT OF EGGPLANT.   

389
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:55,025
              OH, YOU ROASTED   
             THE EGGPLANT OFF?

A LITTLE BIT OF OIL.            
           BUT YOU DON'T WANT   
        TO BREAK IT UP TOO MUCH.

391
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,030
NO. THERE WE GO.                
           WE'RE DONE WITH THIS.

394
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,371
  ABOUT 8 INCHES APART.         
THE HEEL IS THE BEST PART.      
            THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

395
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,507

00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,878
  TOO BIG AND WON'T BREAK DOWN  
UNLESS YOU WERE TO HEAT THEM UP.

   IS TOO LIGHT COLOR,
