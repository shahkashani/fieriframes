00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:03,735
    Everybody, I'm Guy Fieri,   
     and we're rolling out,     

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:06,939
 lookin' for America's greatest 
  Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. 

3
00:00:06,941 --> 00:00:09,541
        This trip it's --       
           Da-da-duh!           

4
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:11,276
         It's real-deal         
       Southern cookin' --      

5
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:13,278
      Pour it all in there.     
        Don't hold back.        

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,481
Served up in northern territory.

7
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:17,549
        Get on the train        
      to Flavor Town, baby.     

8
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,953
  Like a Nashville Cajun combo  
       in Massachusetts --      

9
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:23,888
           Lights out.          
   Serious smoke in Nevada --   

10
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,024
         That's killer.         
       And up in Alaska --      

11
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,759
              What?             
          Don't judge.          

12
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,295
             A funky            
        barbecue fusion.        

13
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:33,198
 I'm in a happy spot right now, 
      so I'm just rambling.     

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,635
     That's all right here,     
    right now, on "Triple D."   

15
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:42,908

16
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:48,981
                     ♪♪         

17
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:50,115
 So I'm here in Juneau, Alaska, 

18
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:51,784
       about five minutes       
        from the airport        

19
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:54,053
      to check out a joint      
      that's been a house.      

20
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:55,653
  It's also been a coffee shop. 

21
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,523
      So what does it turn      
       into next? Exactly:      

22
00:00:57,525 --> 00:01:00,926
 A Southern smokehouse with kind
  of an Asian bistro attitude.  

23
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:05,130
   Ah, you hear it every day.   
    This is Zerelda's Bistro.   

24
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:06,532
            Pork belly, table 6.

25
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:08,133
  Pound for pound,              
 best in town, man.             

26
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,468
      Absolutely delicious.     

27
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,402
I've got the shrimp noodle bowl.

28
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,738
             How do you describe
               this food here?  

29
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,806
Asian fusion with comfort food. 

30
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,541
The best thing here is Abby.    

31
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,677
She's just full of joy,         
and that comes in her food.     

32
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,812
             Everybody who knows
          Abby, raise your hand.

33
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,882
    Okay. That's no surprise    
       since Abby LaForce       

34
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:25,551
has spent her life in this town.

35
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:28,019
  But when she met Southern boy 
         Jeremy Barnett         

36
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,021
           and married          
     his barbecue background    

37
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,823
     with her Asian recipes,    

38
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,359
         a funky fusion         
      love affair was born.     

39
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:35,693
               We met online.   

40
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,896
     I was just posting pictures
              of my tater tots, 

41
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:41,099
     and he was posting pictures
     of his barbecue sandwiches.

42
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,968
    I came to see her first.    
        I stayed a month.       

43
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:47,439
 I didn't have a return ticket. 
                Yeah. [ Laughs ]

44
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,707
    And the name                
  comes from what?              

45
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,576
             My grandma Zerelda.
             She is from Texas. 

46
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,312
           My mother's Filipino,
          my father's Caucasian.

47
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,715
  This is gonna be              
 some kind of story             

48
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,651
  with a Filipino-              
Caucasian-Asian-Southern        

49
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:02,187
influence brisket pho bowl.     

50
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,455
      Brisket pho's ready.      

51
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,456
 There is nowhere else in Juneau

52
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,325
          that does pho         
      quite like Zerelda's.     

53
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,594
   WOMAN: It's got the smoked   
         brisket in it,         

54
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:10,996
        so you get those        
       fusion of flavors,       

55
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,464
    and it's just to die for.   

56
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,732
       FIERI:                   
Okay. What are we makin'?       

57
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,133
       Smoked brisket pho.      

58
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,935
You had me at hello on that.    

59
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,738
          Kosher salt.          
      Course black pepper.      

60
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,207
Course.                         
       Granulated garlic.       

61
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,142
             Chili.             
    This is Jeremy's recipe.    

62
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,611
Jeremy's recipe, okay.          
            Actually.           

63
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,212
  Now that you two              
are together as a couple,       

64
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,147
you'll share these recipes.     
           Yeah. Yeah.          

65
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,616
Brisket goes on for how long?   

66
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:34,553
 Ten to 12 hours at 225 degrees.

67
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:35,888
  What kind of wood             
are we smoking this with?       

68
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,756
       Apple and hickory.       

69
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,558
So this is going to be          
the beginning of our pho broth? 

70
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,426
     Yes. So we have cloves.    

71
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,161
         Fructus Amomi.         
A-what?                         

72
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,230
     It's the weirdest name.    
    It tastes like licorice.    

73
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,498
           Star anise.          
          Fennel seed.          

74
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,568
         Cinnamon stick.        
Coriander seed.                 

75
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,835
So toast all the spices?        

76
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,706
    Yeah. We're going to take   
roasted beef bones, raw chicken.

77
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,974
Water?                          
              Yeah.             

78
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,110
       Carrot and a onion.      

79
00:02:58,112 --> 00:02:59,911
          Green onion.          
Ginger.                         

80
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,913
         Garlic cloves.         
Lots of chicken base.           

81
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,649
And a little beef base.         
 Yeah. And then salt and pepper.

82
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,518
And then our spices?            
              Yeah.             

83
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,321
        So, this simmers        
        for three hours.        

84
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,389
Beautiful looking brisket.      
         Oh, thank you.         

85
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,124
     Jeremy does a good job.    

86
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,459
 That is delicious.             

87
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,261
So for we're -- we're going     
in the right direction.         

88
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,863
        Okay. Okay, good.       
   This is the boiling liquid.  

89
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,465
Keep going, everybody's         
 watching right now.            

90
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,001
   You eat some more brisket.   

91
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:25,136
      You like fish sauce?      

92
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,005
I love fish sauce.              
        Good, good, good.       

93
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,807
  Have all of these drippings.  

94
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,275
  From the brisket,             
  from the smoker.              

95
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,477
So right onto the noodles.      

96
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,012
          The brisket.          

97
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:37,882
   White onion, green onions,   
     and roasted sesame oil.    

98
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,751
 And then my garnish            
    if I want it.               

99
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:42,154
                     ♪♪         

100
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:43,488
           That is not          
       lacking in flavor.       

101
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,692
        That little smoke       
         kick is killer.        

102
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,026
         You got a big,         
       rich piece of meat.      

103
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,761
        Great vegetables        
          inside of it.         

104
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:54,833
    The kiss of the drippings   
    from the smoker makes it.   

105
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:57,769
     I like that the noodles    
 are steeping in the pho broth. 

106
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,704
                I don't like    
               soggy noodles.   

107
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,240
      I wouldn't want that      
 as my gang name, Soggy Noodles.

108
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,642
      Who do you run with?      
          Stale Bread.          

109
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,377
        Flavor turf wars.       

110
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,313
 I'm in a happy spot right now, 
      so I'm just rambling.     

111
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:11,049
   This is, without question,   
   one of the most unique phos  

112
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,917
            I've had.           

113
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,854
         I can't get it         
     in my face fast enough.    

114
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,389
        Here is your pho.       

115
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:19,191
   I love the rich, rich broth  

116
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:22,060
     and also the smokiness     
       that comes with it.      

117
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,594

     For our chicken thighs,    
         we make a rub.         

343
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:24,842
      Paprika. Brown sugar.     
          White sugar.          

344
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:29,848
  Salt. Black pepper. Cayenne.  
    Chili powder. And cumin.    

345
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,783
         Now we're going        
        to prep our ribs.       

346
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:32,984
       Salt.                    
           Cracked black pepper?

347
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:35,653
    Yeah. Granulated garlic.    
                  Paprika, okay.

348
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,922
       And a little onion.      
      Slather it on there.      

349
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,324
            Both are going to go
               to the smoker?   

350
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:41,059
    Smoke everything at 250.    
                 Got it.        

351
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:42,927
    When they're done, take 'em,
            cool 'em, shred 'em,

352
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,462
            and that's the basis
                of the gumbo?   

353
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:45,663
    That's right.               
That goes in the gumbo.         

354
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:46,931
        All right, Chef,        
       let's get into it.       

355
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,199
We're going to start off        
   with our roux.               

356
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:50,001
We make ours with a little      
olive oil and canola oil.       

357
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,036
           And flour.           
    So we keep it dairy free.   

358
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,605
Because, you know, there's a lot
    of allergies these days.    

359
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,406
      Yeah, we're really worried
     about your health down here

360
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:56,541
             at Highland Fried. 

361
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:58,075
          Going to cook         
     our veggies over here.     

362
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:01,745
We got the holy trinity.        
Onions, celery, and bell pepper.

363
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,681
             Garlic.            
   And we put our Andouille --  

364
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,483
                Andouille in,   
   let that render down with it.

365
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:08,552
       A blackening spice.      
    Fresh thyme and oregano.    

366
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,421
              Salt.             
          Black pepper.         

367
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,690
          Some bay leaf         
      and some gumbo filé.      

368
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,625
                From the leaf   
          of the sassafras tree.

369
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,428
    Gonna add the dark roux.    
         Chicken stock.         

370
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,230
    Smoked pork jelly.          
                   Love it.     

371
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,431
         Fresh tomatoes.        

372
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,966
     And we're going to put     
      in our pork shrapnel.     

373
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,301
         Pulled chicken.

374
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,369
              Yeah.             
 We're going to let this simmer 

375
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,971
for about 45 minutes to an hour.

376
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,307

You get a softness from the meat

        -Wonderful smoke.       
 -I've eaten myself into regret 

457
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,573
       with this brisket.       
 -All right, let's get into it. 

458
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:17,842
    We're just going to trim    
         the brisket up.        

459
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,109
         And we're going        
        to make the rub.        

460
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,378
              Okay.             
                    Kosher salt.

461
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,979
      Coarse black pepper.      
                      Of course.

462
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:22,981
       Granulated garlic.       

463
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,648
           Mix it up.           
    A little mustard schmear.   

464
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,318
        I have seen some liberal
 rubbing of briskets in my life.

465
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,720
   This guy might take the cake.

466
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,655
  Let it tack up a little bit,  
       you know, an hour.       

467
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,192
                Go to the smoke.
      215, about 15 hours.      

468
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,593
   We're going to wrap it up,   
          finish it off         

469
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,528
    until it hits about 203.    
                        Pull it?

470
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,131
     Yeah. We let them rest     
  for an hour, hour-and-a-half. 

471
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,133
         You have got to explain
         to me what we're doing.

472
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,135
         Collard greens.        
    What happened to the greens?

473
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,336
      Well, they're chopped     
          and blanched.         

474
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,738
  Where'd you learn this method?
     Believe it or not,         

475
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,340
it was my Italian college buddy.
        That's a new one for me.

476
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,541
       You learn something      
         from everybody.        

477
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,143
       Let's see how they taste.
        All right. Bacon.       

478
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:55,746
    Onions. Sweat the onions.   
 Add the greens. And some water.

479
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,281
       And some beef base.      
               That's a new one.

480
00:16:57,283 --> 00:17:00,284
Let this go for about two hours.
      Apple cider vinegar.      

481
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,353
           Some salt.           
         We're off to the races.

482
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,955
                      Next step?
    Moonshine barbecue sauce.   

483
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:05,890
          You mean, like, legit?
           Moonshine.           

484
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:06,957
                    Shine-shine?
              Yeah.             

485
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,827
                     ♪♪         

486
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,962
                         Smooth.
              Yeah?             

487
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:12,362
             It's good, though. 

488
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,898
     Should get a second opinion
         on that from the camera

489
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,299
    and just see what you think.

490
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,368
      Camera, what do you think?
                There you go.   

491
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,370
  See, the camera's not driving.
          That's right.         

492
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,640
  Camera! Camera! Stick with me.

493
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,575
     Ketchup. Seasoned salt.    

494
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,045
           Moonshine.           
       You do it like that, son.

495
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,981
  Liquid smoke. Cider vinegar.  
      Worcestershire sauce.     

496
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,650
      Hot sauce with some sugar.
             I like this sauce. 

497
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,319
    Just bring it to a boil,    
      and we're good to go.     

498
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,954
                 That's some    
           good-looking brisket.

499
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,859
           I mean, that is about
            as juicy and tender.

500
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,261
               That is killer.  
        Some of the best brisket

501
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,063
              I've seen outside 
             of Texas, actually.

502
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,398
              Not that I think  
       this brisket needs sauce.

503
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,268
  Mmm. In the world of collards,
         boy I'll tell you what.

504
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,270
       Tender and cooked down...

505
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,272
       But still enough texture.

506
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,808
             That's great, man. 
This is like you've been working

507
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,543
              with a pit master 
          down in Texas a while.

508
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,413
  The real deal. Well done, man.
Thanks.                         

509
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,614
        The meat is melt        
         in your mouth.         

510
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,217
     It's got this fantastic    
           peppercorn.          

511
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:09,820
 MAN: The moonshine sauce adds a
 little sweetness and smokiness.

512
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,288
                    Good greens?
Very good.                      

513
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,091
     MAN: Clay is definitely    
       a world-class chef.      

514
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,893
        He's got a great        
    catering business going.    

515
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:19,229
   FIERI: And he's no stranger  
    to a little competition.    

516
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,032
         They've won all        
      over northern Nevada.     

517
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:23,834
 He's got trophies that are just
    used to wedge open a window.

518
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,236
            I mean, they're just
             laying around here.

519
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:27,505
        I think someone used one
    as a stepstool a second ago.

520
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:28,840
       We did the chicken       
        wing competition.       

521
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:31,375
       We did first place       
      for about five years.     

522
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,643
    Five-wing nachos are up.    

523
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,645
     The smoked wing nachos     
          are awesome.          

524
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,580
   WOMAN: Everything that you   
      usually see on nachos     

525
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,116
   now suddenly is on chicken.  
    They're just devastating.   

526
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,384
   We have our chicken wings.   

527
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,186
       We're going to make      
     our smoked wing nachos.    

528
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,721
     We're going to rub them    
       down with some oil.      

529
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:44,922
                       Oil only?
           That's it.           

530
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,057
         No salt, no pepper now?

531
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:47,458
      Not yet because we're     
     going to deep fry 'em.     

532
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,992
       We don't want that       
     char flavor on the rub.    

533
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,861
                    Okay.       
             That's a big wing. 

534
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,730
       There's a couple wingless
         pterodactyls out there.

535
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,798
      Smoke them for about      
        45 minutes, 275.        

536
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,535
    Okay. Come out of the smoker
               into the fryer.  

537
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:58,936
   All right, what are you into?
            Dry rub.            

538
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:01,739
       Which is half Cajun      
    seasoning, half rib rub.    

539
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,207
  This is our Cajun seasoning.  

540
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:06,677
         Paprika. Salt.         
Granulated garlic. Black pepper.

541
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:10,014
   White pepper. Onion powder.  
   Ground thyme. Dry mustard.   

542
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,615
        And chili powder.       
                         Got it.

543
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,084
   And we're gonna go rib rub.  

544
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:16,954
  Salt. White pepper. Paprika.  
   Black pepper. Chili powder.  

545
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,689
            This is going to get
        interesting in a second.

546
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:19,890
                          Sugar?
          White sugar.          

547
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,692
       Brown sugar clumps.      
       Granulated garlic.       

548
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,494
         You don't find the burn
             on the white sugar?

549
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,495
         No, I like it.         

550
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,763
         You've won competitions
               with this rub?   

551
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,566
            I have.             
      I won't tell anybody. Shh.

552
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:29,967
        Do a little half        
         and half here.         

553
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:31,435
    And this is what we're going
       to sprinkle on the wings?

554
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,104
   Hit it with some moonshine   
         barbecue sauce.        

555
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,738
         Cheese. Bacon.         

556
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,440
Pop it in the oven for a minute.

557
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,042
                    Okay.       
        Where are the tortillas?

558
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,643
     There are no tortillas.    
     The wing is the nacho.     

559
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,880
 It has all the toppings on it. 

560
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,514
    All right. This I gotta see.
          Diced tomato.         

561
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,584
 How you going to get the tomato
    to stay on the chicken wing?

562
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:49,720
    Green onion. Spicy ranch.   
           Sour cream.          

563
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:53,057
                     ♪♪         

564
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,325
        It's a really good wing.

565
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:57,528
              I love the smoke. 
             A little fry to it.

566
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,862
      Who needs a tortilla chip?

567
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,864
             You get the crunch 
     of the outside of the wing.

568
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,266
              The cheese melts  
               on really nice.  

569
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,668
         Then you have the bacon
               sticking to it   

570
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,670
          so you get all best of
        both worlds all over it.

571
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:08,005
    You hit that moonshine sauce
    on there, which is dynamite.

572
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,408
              You get yourself  
    some of the cool sour cream.

573
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,410
          That's one of the most
      unique dishes I've seen on

574
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:15,412
             "Triple D," and you
         actually pulled it off.

575
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,814
                      Well done.
           Thank you.           

576
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,349
         There's so much        
         going on here,         

577
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,351
    but it all works really,    
          really well.          

578
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:23,221
      Sour cream on a wing      
          is delicious.         

579
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,555
       And it's something       
         I haven't had.         

580
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,157
                They're amazing.
It's crazy, isn't it?           

581
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,491
                            Yes.
 It is a nacho that             

582
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:29,760
became a chicken wing, or a     
chicken wing that became --     

583
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,028
Anyhow.                         
      Dixie dog for pickup.     

584
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,229
               Makes you happy  
             to come down here. 

585
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,432
Lights out. Game changer.       
                         Insane.

586
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,834
       A bunch of smokers,      
  making a lot of people happy. 

587
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:40,438
  The real deal. Check 'em out. 

588
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,905
   So that's it for this trip,  

589
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,241
        but don't worry,        
       there's plenty more      

590
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,709
        "Triple D" joints       
      all over the country.     

591
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,378
     I'll be looking for you    
          next week on          

592
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,513
 "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives."

593
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:50,781
              I just love pho.  

594
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:53,251
It's so pho-n to make.          
  Pho-get about it.             

595
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:56,320
Do you have any pho ball teams  
up here, or is it too cold?     

596
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:59,357
How many phos has that been?
