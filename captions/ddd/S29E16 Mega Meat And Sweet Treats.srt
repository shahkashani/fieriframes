My dad asked him the same
question when he first met him.

He was very firm about how
things go in this relationship.

in the family."

in ‐‐ in full Korean?

356

Like "prr‐gogi."

How do you say "fries"?
Fries.

358
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,713
There's no "prr"
in the front of it?

359
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:25,880
Almost French.

It's like Pavlov

We'll take Napa cabbage,
natural sea salt.

367

Pull all the moisture
out of it.

Absolutely.

370

And then we have
our seasoned salt.

Which is salt and a little bit
of Korean chili flake.

So now we're going to make
the Holy Moly Stromboli.

513
00:17:21,713 --> 00:17:25,846
So this super‐herb‐laden,
Parmesan cheese dough.
Yep.

514
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:27,280
Italian‐seasoned dough.

515

You really don't care
that a lot of your methods

Oh, no. Who, us?

we just made,

522

You've got to
be kidding me.

525
00:17:45,113 --> 00:17:48,380
We have mozzarella, Fontina,
Asiago, Parmesan,

526
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,546
Romano, cheddar, and Gouda.

527
00:17:50,546 --> 00:17:52,613
Now we roll it up,
brush it with olive oil,

528
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,813
dust it with Parmesan cheese,
and throw it in the oven.

Lots of herbs.
The texture of the bread

You get
this cracker crunch.

541

It's dense,
and it's rich.

I mean, it is not in any way,
shape, or form

It's huge.

It's got a really good
