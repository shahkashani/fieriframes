00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,566
      We'll do a little green --
           fresh collard greens.

117
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,702
Are you a greens fan?           
          Oh, big time.         

118
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:57,903
What do I get for this?         

119
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,771
      I use my hands, man.      

120
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:00,972
             Savage.            

121
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,775
            Put the chow-chow on
                if you want.    

122
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:06,178
 That chow-chow on it definitely
    adds the freshness to it.   

123
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,845
         They're silky.         
        Really good, man.       

124
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,381
   And especially               
 with the chow-chow.            

125
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:10,849
 The counterbalance             
   of the acidity               

126
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,585
and a little bit of that bright,
fresh flavor and texture.       

127
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,654
          Really good.          
 I have dibs on the thigh, man. 

128
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,588
      I'm not scare of you.     
 All right ZB, Do it.           

129
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,058
                 That's it.     

130
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,326
All right, so give me           
  the rundown, Zac.             

131
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:22,927
  I think it's fried perfectly. 

132
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,729
   Everything's cooked tender,  
       it's pulling apart.      

133
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,865
   The buttermilk really gives  
           that flour           

134
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,533
 something to really grip on to.

135
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,402
  Look at this skin right here. 
         That's perfect.        

136
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,004
       But I'll tell you,       
       like he said, man,       

137
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:34,639
     the lemon pepper honey,    
    that's the tipping point.   

138
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,409
      That's the difference     
     between good and damn.     

139
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:38,610
  Get me a guitar.              

140
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,679
     Seriously.                 
Get me a guitar right now.      

141
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:41,880
Zac, you couldn't have said     
   it any better.               

142
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,215
 The fry's right on.            

143
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:45,083
The depth of the flavor in the  
chicken itself is dynamite.     

144
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,351
     Well, I'm glad you enjoyed.
    Do you agree?               

145
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,620
              Mm-hmm.           
  See, Zac agrees!              

146
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,355
     Your lemon pepper honey    
         fried chicken.         

147
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,091
 The chicken with the seasoning 
   in it, it just lays it out.  

148
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,827
And then that lemon pepper honey
  takes it right over the top.  

149
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,962
  That savory and that sweet... 

150
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,432
 A dude from Chicago

in a funky old chicken shack,

         I could sing and dance.

     Collard green lasagna.     

180

      Collard green lasagna     
       is my new favorite.      

181
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,067
 The sauce is just so flavorful.

182

      Just creamy, cheesy,

     everything you look for    
    in a lasagna right here,    

184
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,474
      then the little twist     
    with the collard greens.

       Oh, wait a minute.       

188

  I've had spinach in lasagna,  
         maybe, before.         

189
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,083
Thank you. You're going         
exactly where I'm going.        

190
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,685
      But collards seem way     
           more legit.          

191
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,754
        It'll kind of remind you
        of spinach a little bit,

192
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,890
         but with our own twist.
 Let's get into it.             

193
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,492
                Smoked turkey   
             is where we start. 

194
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:35,360
              And we just throw 
             the greens right in

195
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,295
           because they all have
      to cook and stew together.

196
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,631
           Once these cook down,
         then we'll season them.

197
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,966
      So you put a little sugar,
     Cajun seasoning, chicken...

198
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,034
   Chicken base.                
                There you go.   

199
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,101
              Garlic powder.    
       Onion.                   

200
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,837
                Onion powder,   
               that's it, oil.  

201
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,305
And these are gonna go down     
 for how long, Chef?            

202
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:48,974
        Three, three and a half,
                 four hours.    

203
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:51,910
Drain them, then we add in      
the ricotta, the heavy cream... 

204
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,578
       Salt, pepper, and garlic.
Salt, pepper, and that's it.    

205
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,780
                      That's it.
Then over to the meat sauce.    

206
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:59,050
   Yeah. Onion, garlic, salt and
  pepper, and Italian seasoning.

207
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,852
We brown off the ground turkey. 

208
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:03,054
                Tomato paste    
        and then crushed tomato,

209
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,655
    do a little sugar, garlic...

210
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:05,924
    Chicken base.               

211
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,458
Now we build this monster.      
                 That's it.     

212
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,127
   Add in some turkey red sauce.

213
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,661
Lasagna sheets down.            

214
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:14,132
 Collard green, ricotta mixture,
  and then you smoosh it around.

215
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,400
       Top it with shredded moz.

216
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,468
Now how long is this gonna      
    go down for?                

217
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,136
              About 45 minutes. 

218
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,804
Bring it out, what size         
piece are we talking?           

219
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,139
               A big serving.   
                   A hunk.

 That's what I want.

 Make a hunk happen.

00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,079
                 That's it.     
             Then we get a hunk.

224
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,748
  Half hour show, Chef.         
               Oh, you ready?

There's a ton of collards.      

231
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,297
  They have really cooked down. 

232
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,166
       The collards work.       
 The turkey's nice.             

233
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:51,703
You get a good texture          
   from the meat.               

234
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,172
You're using a really           
   strong noodle.               

235
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,374
  I like a thirsty noodle, too, 
  and this noodle's drinking up 

236
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,442
        all the goodness        
     that he's got going on.    

237
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,911
        Hey.                    

238
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:01,579
Where do you come up            
with "thirsty noodle"?          

239
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,047
              So good.          
Is there like a cooking --      

240
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,317
you got a Zac cookbook          
coming out, what's going on?    

241
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,451
   Thirsty noodle.              

242
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,386
Hey, you crushed it, my friend. 
                 Thank you.     

243
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,387
Congratulations.                
                 Thank you.     

244
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,856
            -Amazing.           
     -Collard green lasagna.    

245
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:14,259
   The lasagna is the perfect   
       ratio between meat,      

246
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:15,860
             cheese,            
       and collard greens.      

247
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,262
  It's incredible, really good. 

248
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:18,863
      Crab stuffed catfish.     

249
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,532
        Greens and Gravy        
          is wonderful.         

250
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,267
         I'm from 30 miles away.

251
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,469
So you had to make a voyage     
    to get here.                

252
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:25,604
                     Yes.       
  Was it worth it?              

253
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:26,871
               Yes. [ Laughs ]  

254
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,340
I mean, it's legit, right?      

255
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,875
              Yes.              
  Just a wonderful place to go. 

256
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,177
I wanted this to be really good,
  and it exceeded.              

257
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,212
    It's great.                 
                 Thank you.     

258
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,280
ZB, nice having you,            
      brother.                  

259
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,281
     Yes, sir. Thank you.       
   Thank you, man.              

260
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:37,315
 Appreciate it.                 
            Yes, sir.           

261
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,684
     Watch out.                 

262
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,018
        FIERI: Up next...       

263
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,221
     We're keeping the hits     
 coming as we head to Austin... 

264
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,356
You had me at "Hello."          

265
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:47,225
     ...where the real star     
    in the Lonestar state...    

266
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,960
              -God.             
        -...is Brazilian.       

267
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,295
Little truck, big flavor.       

268
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:56,935
                     ♪♪         

269
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,470
     So the last time I was     
        in Austin, Texas,       

270
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,872
    I took this buddy of mine   
      to the Monument Cafe      

271
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,273
       and we had a blast.      

272
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,208
  So I rolled back into Austin, 
         and of course,         

273
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,544
          he's shooting         
        a movie overseas,       

274
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,144
          but he says,          
     "Listen, bro," he says,    

275
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,748
  "if you like Brazilian food,  
you got to check this joint out.

276
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,149
      It is totally legit."     

277
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,283
         What did I say?        

278
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,618
     "All right, all right,     
           all right."          

279
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,155
         This is Boteco.        

280
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,223
This is only the best food truck
           in Austin,           

281
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,492
  but it's also the best place  
     to get food in Austin.     

282
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,228
I got the Yuca fries right here.

283
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,363
  It's like my food, you know,  
       it's my mom's food.      

284
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,564
This is how your mom            
   would make it?               

285
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,965
                    Yeah.       

286
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,100
       FIERI: And it's how      
  Fernando Marri's mom made it  

287
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,435
     when he was growing up     
         in Brazil, too.        

288
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:32,771
My family has restaurants       
     in Brazil,                 

289
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,305
    so I grew up                
in the kitchen, literally.      

290
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,506
            So what is the food?

291
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,975
What we're making today         
    is feijoada.                

292
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,843
                  Feijoada.     
National dish of Brazil.        

293
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,378
  It's a black bean             
 and porridge stew.             

294
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,981
    Feijoada, it can keep me    
        alive for years.        

295
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:46,384
   You could really tell that   
  he puts the passion into it.  

296
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:47,985
So we start with a pork butt.   

297
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,388
     Oil, salt,                 
garlic and onion paste.         

298
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,656
                    Okay.       

299
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:52,924
Got the same marinade           
   on the ribs...               
                       Okay.    

300
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,259
...on the sirloin.              
     What type of grill is this?

301
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,128
 It's a yakitori.               
    Super hot charcoal in there.

302
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,863
Next step is to caramelize      
  the smoked meats.             

303
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:00,665
               Which is what?   
Good chunks of bacon.           

304
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:01,933
         The hocks and the tail.

305
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,134
The smoked neck bones.          

306
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,602
              You can get those 
               anywhere here.   

307
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,939
Prosciutto, pork and bean       
sausage, put the onions here.   

308
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,541
Garlic and onion paste.         

309
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:11,610
             Then we'll take the
   grilled pork butt and ribs...

310
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,744
     Yes.                       
                   Got it.      

311
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,079
Add a little beef base.         

312
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,481
  Fresh bay leaves,             
black beans soaked overnight.   

313
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:19,084
            Water goes in, salt,
              pressure cooker,  

314
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,285
       how long's this gonna go?

315
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,086
                   30 minutes.  
What are we making next?        

316
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,888
       We're gonna have a little
          pork belly on the side

317
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,222
               just to give it  
         a little bit of texture

318
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,624
          because all the meat's
              gonna be stewed.  

319
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,959
      We're just gonna score it.

320
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,427
   Through the fat              
right down to the meat.         

321
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,429
        A little bit of salt and
        a little bit of Cachaça,

322
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:32,697
               Brazilian rum.   

323
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,433
     A little rum.              
 Then we make a bed of onions...

324
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,969
Oranges, lemons, limes.         
     Beautiful.                 

325
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,437
           A little more Cachaça
                   on top.      

326
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,039
Looks like you've had           
    some Cachaça.               

327
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,307
                     I did.     
   In the oven...               

328
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,109
               About 2 hours,   
                400 degrees.    

329
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,443
And what's the final piece?     

330
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,646
        Farofa, the most popular
            side dish of Brazil.

331
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,047
        Okay.                   
   Oil and butter.              

332
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,249
                      Chilies.  
Garlic and onion paste.         

333
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:52,517
             Cook a little bit. 

334
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,918
              And then you add  
               the Yuca flour,  

335
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,319
         then you're free to add
             whatever you want. 

336
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,789
           A little bit of salt.

337
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:58,989
             We'll add bananas. 

338
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,727
      Bananas.                  
Literally, that is...           

339
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,262
            The pork belly, pour
  a little bit of hot oil on top

340
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,197
     to get this thing cracking.

341
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,532
  I like this move.             

342
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,200
            Now we're just gonna

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,939
          ...take a type of food

458
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:09,207
               that they found  
            in South Carolina...

459
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,075
Or pizza, pizza sounds          
    really good.                

460
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,409
     Hunter, what are you doing?

461
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,344
I'm trying to figure out        
what we want to eat.            

462
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,612
  We're gonna get some barbecue.

463
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,013
Oh, I love barbecue.            
     All right.                 

464
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,549
          Great, because this is
         Porter's Real Barbecue.

465
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,753
               The whole time   
          we had it figured out.

466
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,087
          Beef brisket.         

467
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,622
        I've had barbecue       
      all over the country,     

468
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,423
        I'll put this up        
        against anything.       

469
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,892
          Pulled pork.          

470
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,494
You know, other places they'll  
have like sweet barbecue,       

471
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,629
 this is more tangy,            
has that spice to it.           

472
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,297
       MAN: Smoked turkey.      

473
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,300
    I love coming to Porter's   
  because basically the story.  

474
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,501
             FIERI:             
     So here's the scoop...     

475
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,370
      Porter Kinney grew up     
         in Washington,         

476
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:42,039
     but meets his wife Kate    
       in South Carolina.       

477
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,174
     They end up moving back    
        to his home state       

478
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,977
       and try convincing       
        his brother Reed        

479
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:48,979
 to jump into the barbecue biz. 

480
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,782
      Porter wanted to open     
          a food truck.         

481
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:51,915
    FIERI: Okay.                

482
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,518
     And I dragged my heels     
        into the ground.        

483
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,919
  -Doesn't look like it worked. 
      -And we went to Reed,     

484
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,720
     and he said, "You want     
   to help us start this up?"   

485
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,989
     And he said, "I've had     
  Porter's food, it's awesome." 

486
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,257
           There was a few of us

487
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,525
          that thought he wasn't
              completely crazy. 

488
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,194
   FIERI: So they went for it,  
         and it worked.         

489
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:04,528
      With the Kinney crew,     

490
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,865
      eventually graduating     
   from 120-square foot truck   

491
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:10,668
 to a smoking brick and mortar. 

492
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,270
What kind of barbecue           
   do you guys do?              

493
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:13,538
             PORTER:            
    Texas-style beef brisket,   

494
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,807
   Carolina-style pulled pork,  
        Kansas City ribs.       

495
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,808
So you're a man of the country  
    of barbecue.                

496
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,277
             -Yeah.             
  -No one's doing like Porter.  

497
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,078
      Porter's the only one     
       doing the beef rib.      

498
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,280
            Beef rib.           

499
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,015
   It's like a giant burnt end  
           on a bone.           

500
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,017
         It's enormous.         

501
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,086
We're gonna make the rub that's 
gonna go on the beef ribs.      

502
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,553
                          Okay. 
Course black pepper.            

503
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,021
                 Of course.     

504
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,558
Brown sugar here, paprika       
going in, granulated onion...   

505
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,625
             Granulated garlic. 

506
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,494
...salt, chipotle powder.       

507
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,362
            And this is gonna go
       on the brontosaurus ribs.

508
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,764
Yeah, the dino beef ribs.       

509
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,365
           What's our next step.
A little Worcestershire.        

510
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,035
We usually let them tack up     
with the rub for about two hours

511
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,503
 before we let them             
   hit the smoker.              

512
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,771
         Okay, what kind of wood
     are we using in the smoker?

513
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:47,972
Apple and cherry wood.          
                    Okay.       

514
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,440
We have orchards in our area.   

515
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:50,575
              What temperature  
                we gonna run?   

516
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:52,043
260 for about eight hours.      

517
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,312
                   260. Not 250.
        Nope.                   

518
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,313
                        Not...  
              255?              

519
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:57,982
260.                            
    What do we have up next?    

520
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,584
Our mustard barbecue sauce.     

521
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:01,252
              Yo-ho, let's go.  

522
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:04,788
Start off with a lot of mustard 
here, brown sugar, molasses,    

523
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,258
granulated onion, cumin,        
 granulated garlic,             

524
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,795
 dark chili powder,             
   seasoning salt.              

525
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:14,131
               Can I try this?  
             Hunter, your spoon.

526
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,866
        That's not okay.        
         I thought it was funny.

527
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,934
                 Delicious.     

528
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,603
          Oh, yeah.             
           A little wango tango.

529
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,071
    Yeah.                       
            Awesome.            

530
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,607
So they come three ribs         
to a rack of beef ribs here.    

531
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,208
      And the housemade pickles.
   That's it.                   

532
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,544
                Look at that.   

533
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,545
        This is how I get Hunter
   to try new food all the time.

534
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,348
           [ Imitates airplane ]

535
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,282
    The airplane.               

536
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,017
             Oh.                
            See how Dad eats it.

537
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,086
         I don't get fed.       
                Unctuous fat.   

538
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,889
       I like the caramelization
     we're getting on that bark.

539
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,557
              Mmm.              
       That is so tender.       

540
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,892
         Oh, my gosh.           
             That is delicious. 

541
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,293
          That's a dynamite rib.
        That is awesome.        

542
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:43,828
             Eat it up, Hunter, 
             skinny little kid. 

543
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,363
            How you gonna become
             like me and Porter?

544
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:46,697
 One beef rib a day             
is all the doctor...            

545
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,433
             That's all we want 
          is one beef rib a day.

546
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:50,501
        -I'm still young.       
           -Beef ribs.          

547
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,302
        It's a little bit       
     like brisket on a bone.    

548
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,505
Love the flavors, the smokiness.

549
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:57,174
    The quality of the meat,    
the bark on it, it's perfection.

550
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,509
              MAN:              
    Half pound of burnt ends.   

551
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,776
         -You're Delana?        
              -Yes.             

552
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,445
What inspired you to write us   
     and tell us                

553
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,980
that we had the check out       
Porter's Real Barbecue.         

554
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:04,515
     It's really good food.     

555
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,316
    I'm also their employee.    
 -Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 

556
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:09,453
You not only are a fan of the   
restaurant, you also work here. 

557
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,854
           Yes, I do.           

558
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:11,856
Doesn't that sound like,        
"I'm not only a member,         

559
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:13,591
but I'm the President."         

560
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,860
I tell people all the time, go  
and work at a place you admire. 

561
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:18,195
      They are an absolute      
        beautiful family.       

562
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,730
      I'm a single mother.      

563
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:22,266
  They work around my schedule  
 so I can be there for my kids. 

564
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,601
I'm gonna get a tear here.      

565
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,002
      They genuinely care.      

566
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,604
Oh, I taste it in the food.     

567
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,407
             FIERI:             
   Whether it's mega mouthfuls  
         or bite-sized.         

568
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:30,941
        Jalapeño poppers.       

569
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,677
 The poppers are peppers stuffed
           with cheese          

570
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:33,811
      and wrapped in bacon.     

571
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,279
   I don't know how you can go  
        wrong with that.        

572
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,014
   Let's get down with this rub.
This is our original rub.

   They go on our               
  jalapeño poppers.             

574
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,684
                    Okay.       

575
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,985
Paprika, sugar, kosher salt,    
dark chili powder...            

576
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,020
                    Okay.       

577
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,155
...granulated onion,            
real course black pepper.

  They use a horse to grind it. 

580
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,826
 Yeah, horse power.             

581
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,428
   In medieval times for sure.  

582
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,695
     Definitely medieval pepper.

583
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,497
 Granulated garlic,             
   a little cumin.              

584
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,698
   That's it.                   
    All right, Hunter, let's go.

We're gonna go ahead            
and make our filling.           

587
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,570
Cream cheese, break it up.      

588
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,438
   Do you often keep rectangular

as difficult as possible.

   Some of the rub we just made.

593
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,981
Throw some cheddar cheese in.   

594
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,782
Milk, knock this together.      

595
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,518
   See, Hunter, this is the kind
     of stuff you need to learn.

596

597
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,790
           Okay.                
                 Good talk.     

598

You get the raw jalapeño.       

601
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,998
Take some of the popper filling,
a little bit of bacon here,     

602
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,467
wrap this up nice and good.     

603
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:32,270
   These get done in the smoker,
             45 minutes at 250? 

604

                 for Hunter.    

606
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:38,742
               I'm just kidding.
          Ah, come on.          

607
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,611
                 Delicious.     

608
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,813
     If you're really interested
              in the integrity  

609
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,282
    of the flavor of the pepper,
              you're interested

          you like crispy bacon,
              that's your boy.  

612
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,422
    I think my favorite part    
    about that is the bacon.    

613
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:53,223
   A lot of times when you get  
       a pepper like that       

614
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,759
and it's stuffed and the bacon's
  wrapped, it's kind of chewy.  

615
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,561
         You pull it off        
     and it unravels itself.    

616
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:58,762
        Yup.                    

617
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,031
      That was done right.      
      I bit right into it,      

618
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,365
     I could bite it in half    
        and it was clean.

      He'll really eat them all.

624

  The poppers are really good.  

625
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,843
    They're not overly spicy.   

626
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,046
  The bacon is perfect because  
  of the way that it's smoked.  

627
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,181
  And the cheese in the middle  
          is so creamy.
