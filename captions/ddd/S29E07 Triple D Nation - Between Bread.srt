1
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:02,868
     You know, folks ask me     
          all the time,         

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:03,936
      "Hey, Guy. That place     
  you went to in that one town  

3
00:00:03,938 --> 00:00:05,204
   "that served that one dish,  

4
00:00:05,206 --> 00:00:06,538
    how are they doing after    
          'Triple-D?'"          

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,807
  You know what? I don't know.  
       Let's check it out.      

6
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:12,744
   This is "Triple-D Nation."   

7
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:15,547
    Over the years, I've seen   
       and tasted it all.       

8
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,216
       This is ridiculous, dude.

9
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:19,484
  But it turns out it was only  
          the beginning         

10
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,687
       because "Triple-D"       
  joints have been blowing up,  

11
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:22,888
   and we're going back to see  

12
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,424
         what's cooking,        
       like on this trip.       

13
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:26,958
Do you guys think at home       
   I want a fork?               

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,160
   Absolutely not.              

15
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:30,362
      A neighborhood diner      
     in Denver, Colorado...     

16
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,564
Where's my California           
representation, huh?            

17
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,099
What's up with that?            

18
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,967
     ...cooking up favorites    
   from all over the nation...  

19
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,569
     Prime time.                

20
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:38,904
   ...in Nashville, Tennessee,  

21
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:41,106
          a food truck          
      putting down roots...     

22
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,708
         Was that? Nah.         

23
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,776
   ...and upping their grilled  
         cheese game...         

24
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,311
Way to rock the house.          

25
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:49,047
    ...a family seafood joint   
 still going strong in Miami... 

26
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,182
Nothing wrong with that.        

27
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:51,850
            ...and in           
     Northern California...     

28
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,853
This has changed dramatically   
from when I came here as a kid. 

29
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:57,990
    ...I'm letting you all in   
    on a Fieri family secret.   

30
00:00:57,992 --> 00:00:59,924
That's sandwich technology, son.

31
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:04,195
Old friends, new places and more
     off-the-hook flavors...    

32
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:08,133
     That's all right here,     
 right now on "Triple-D Nation."

33
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,676
So Hunter and I are about       
an hour north of Sacramento,    

34
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,678
 where Interstate 5             
  hits Highway 20.              

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,813
Now, Hunter, when I was a kid,  
we would come through here      

36
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,081
and stop at this place,         

37
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,616
   and it was just              
a little sandwich counter.      

38
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:26,018
Now, it's a sandwich counter    
  and a restaurant              

39
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,219
  and a sports bar,             
and then they throw in gelato,  

40
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:29,554
and they got their own bakery,  

41
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:32,223
and they got a gift shop        
you would not forget.           

42
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,093
Now, the name of the town       
    is Williams,                

43
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:37,029
but they should really call it  
    Granzella's.                

44
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:39,231

46
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,534
        Go to Granzella's       
       for the experience,      

47
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:43,969
       but definitely stay      
          for the food.         

48
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,771
     Classic sandwiches here    
          are amazing.          

49
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,107
  FIERI: Now, you've never seen 
    this joint on "Triple-D,"   

50
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,642
      but when I was a kid,     

51
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:53,912
   we stopped here every year   
   during road trips to Tahoe.  

52
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:54,980
         Order for Kyle!        

53
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,314
             FIERI:             
  So now I'm letting you in on  

54
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,518
       one of my favorite       
       family traditions.       

55
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,387
This has changed dramatically   
from when I came here as a kid. 

56
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,990
They got a grocery store now.   

57
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,257
         I don't think I've ever
              been here before. 

58
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,526
 You have been here.            
      I swear.                  
                           When?

59
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,128
We went dirt bike riding, and we
came here on the way back.      

60
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,463
       Might have been too small
              to remember, now. 

61
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,998
  That looks good.              

62
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,133
Granzella's opened back in 1976.

63
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,135
       -How you been, man?      
        -Nice to see you.       

64
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:17,469
  Long time no see.             

65
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,472
      And this is the man,      
Dino McCarty, whose grandfather,

66
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,674
         Jim Granzella,         
       started the joint.       

67
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,344
     Over the years, we got     
 many generations of the family 

68
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:29,214
 that are here, aunts and uncles
    and cousins and sisters,    

69
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,815
   hustling to make this run.   

70
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,284
      We're on a road trip,     
       and we were just --      

71
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,485
     We're driving through,     
         and they said,         

72
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,953
       "Where do you want       
        to stop and eat?"       

73
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,421
   And I go, "Oh, Granzella's   
        is right around,        

74
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,156
  you know, coming off the 20." 
         So we made it.         
                    You're here.

75
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,425
   Sorry for the short notice,  
    but thanks for having us.   
                           Yeah.

76
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:41,760
   Tell us what we should get.  

77
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,228
         The muffaletta sandwich
               is really good.  

78
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,896
     The muffaletta you guys    
     are known for, though.     
                           Yeah.

79
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,832
      FIERI: And muffaletta     
      just ain't muffaletta     

80
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,366
    without the olive salad,    

81
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,503
        which these guys        
       make from scratch.       

82
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,038
            McCARTY:            
 We use a blend of giardiniera, 

83
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,241
        Sicilian olives,        
 Kalamata olives, sliced garlic,

84
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,443
    Greek peppers, seasoning,   

85
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:03,848
 which gives it some nice zesty 
 flavor, canola, and olive oil. 

86
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,651
   Now we're gonna go through   
         the processor,         

87
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:08,520
     do a nice smooth grind.    

88
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,323
 My grandfather and grandmother 
       started this recipe      

89
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,624
          35 years ago.         

90
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,526
    We're one of the largest

91
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,328

93
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,000
     This has a rich, briny,    
         garlicky flavor        

94
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,002
         that goes well         
    with all the deli meats.    

95
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,738
        Use Genoa salami,       
       Italian mortadella,      

96
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,610
       which is a bologna       
      and provolone cheese.     

97
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:32,878
     That's the muffaletta.     

98
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,081
 So this is the chopped-up olive
      and vegetable spread.     

99
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,082
        I find this a lot       
         in New Orleans.        

100
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:41,286
 Mmm. It's all that pickled veg 
      and all that crunch.      
                           Yeah.

101
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:43,689
     This is what I remember    
    getting when I was a kid.   
Oh, yeah.                       

102
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:46,024
  -But we'd get get a huge one. 
         -That is good.         

103
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,160
   And I would eat it halfway   
     on the way up to Tahoe     

104
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:50,028
  and then eat it the next day. 

105
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,363
   What I like is,              
  when you bite it,             

106
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:54,566
   it doesn't all               
 come out the back.

107
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,168
That's sandwich technology, son.

108
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,036
 That is ridiculous.            

109
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,771
     And how many different     
     sandwiches you guys do?    

110
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,441
                     30.        

111
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:03,841
        Is that a Reuben?       

112
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:07,112
             That is the Reuben,
   and that's on the marble rye.

113
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,648
       Been making this sandwich
             over 40 years now. 

114
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,383
   It's one of our best sellers.

115
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,251
   So a Reuben is mayonnaise,   
        mustard, pickles,       

116
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,654
     peppers and traditional    
           corned beef          

117
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,522
  and sauerkraut, Swiss cheese. 

118
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:19,658
  We throw that in the panini,

349
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:08,086
to some crazy brined chicken.   

350
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:10,555
            So we're gonna truss
   and brine some whole chickens

351
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:11,755
           before we roast them.

352
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,892
Truss and brine, I like it.     

353
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,893
  Wings go back across the legs.

354
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,829
The more you keep this          
    all together,               

355
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:18,963
the better it's gonna cook      

356
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,297
 and the more you're            
gonna hold in the juices.       

357
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,766
  And then let's make the brine.

358
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,568
  We get some brown sugar, salt,

359
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,570
             some whole cloves, 
        whole black peppercorns.

360
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:26,971
Go for it, a little bay leaf.   

361
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,307
   -And then a grip of water.   
            -A grip?            

362
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,242
        It's about five gallons,
                 then whisk.    

363
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,643
         It goes over the birds.

364
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,379
These things are just gonna be  
   full of flavor.              

365
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:37,382
So they're brined 24 hours,     
give them a little shake dry.   

366
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,984
   In the oven about 40 minutes.

367
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,186
    Look at that.               

368
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,055
And right there, my friend,     
prime time bird, man,           

369
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,456
     prime time.                

370
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,124
  Nashville hot fried chicken.  

371
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,860
    FIERI: Nowadays, the bird   
         has flown south        

372
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:52,730
 with their Nashville hot fried,
 and they've gone international 

373
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:55,600
   with their French-inspired   
          Monte Cristo.         

374
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:57,735
  The Monte Cristo just really  
         hits everything        

375
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:59,203
       that Steuben's is.       

376
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,272
   It is classic comfort food.  

377
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:04,542
 You know you're being a little 
bit naughty, but it's delicious.

378
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,877
   Two slices of white bread,   
        one side you get        

379
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,813
   Swiss and the roasted ham.   

380
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:12,450
       On the other side,       
American cheese, roasted turkey,

381
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:15,419
   dipped in the egg mixture,   
      put it in the fryer,      

382
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,154
       just enough to get       
        that golden brown       

383
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,957
    and a little bit of that    
   crispiness, powdered sugar,  

384
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,894
    and then it's served with   
a house-made raspberry preserve.

385
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:25,429
     Monte Cristo, table 12.    

386
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:28,165
 Sweet exterior with the batter,
         powdered sugar,        

387
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,700
            and then            
    the nice savory interior    

388
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,769
    with the meat and cheese,   
       and it's delicious.      

389
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,170
      And with this jelly,      
       and you dip it in,       

390
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,306
     and it's getting salty     
      and sweet and golden,     

391
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:38,443
      and it's so amazing.      

392
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,311
FIERI: With so many stops around
           Flavortown,          

393
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:42,180
    I just had one question.    

394
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:44,449
Where's my California           
representation, huh?            

395
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:45,583
What's up with that?            

396
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,318
A taco. I mean, come on.        

397
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,786
Now, they didn't give me a taco,

398
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:51,923
  but they did add chilaquiles  
          since I left.         

399
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:56,527
 We start with the roast chuck, 
gets seasoned, oregano, parsley,

400
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:00,564
 basil, garlic powder, and then 
    into the oven 20 minutes.   

401
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,199
   So while we're getting that  
         sear on there,         

402
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,670
 we're working on the mirepoix, 
         celery, onions,        

403
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,805
    carrots, bay leaf, thyme,   

404
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:11,342
   pour it all over the roast   
  with red wine and beef stock. 

405
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:12,677
  And then it goes back in for  

406
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,679
       three to four hours      
         on a slow cook,        

407
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:17,148
 and then we start to shred it. 

408
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,683
 And then we add the salsa roja.

409
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,885
        We cook together,       
 and then we add the tortillas. 

410
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,620
     We add the eggs any way    
         you want them.         

411
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,288
     I like them over easy.     

412
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,491
Then we garnish it with avocado,

413
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:29,427
             cotija,            
    and a little green onion.   

414
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,162
   Order of chilaquiles for you.

415
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,830
          I grew up in          
      Southern California.      

416
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,899
           Chilaquiles          
       reminds me of home.      

417
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:37,568
   The beef is really tender.   
          It's amazing.         

418
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,903
          Chilaquiles,          
      it's got some spice.      

419
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,171
      It's got great meat.      

420
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:43,975
  The egg on top, the avocado,  
     nice textured flavors.     

421
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,776
So since the original Steuben's,

422
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,112
  we opened up Steuben's Arvada 
           right here.          

423
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,447
          Now, we have          
      our two food trucks.      

424
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,915
           And your gravy fries.

425
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,051
     We added breakfast when    
  we opened up here in Arvada.  

426
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,319
   Traffic jam, in the window!  

427
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,188
   We make our ice cream here.  

428
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:01,792
  And we're hopefully gonna be  
   out at the airport someday.  

429
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,329
Gentlemen, I'll tell you,       
funky joint, fun joint.         

430
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,931
Everybody seems to be having    
     a good time                

431
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,132
when they come to Steuben's.    

432
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,934
          -Absolutely.          
 -Save me a table. I'll be back.

433
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,469
           -Right on.           
   -Okay? Thank you, brother.   

434
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,738
           -Thank you.          
          -Good times.          

435
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,273
     Opening at the airport?    

436
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:20,411
    Just what I like to hear,   
 going the extra mile in Denver.

437
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,013
        Now, coming up...       

438
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,147
     I'm gonna get kicked out of
  the culinary club on this one.

439
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,015
   ...a seafood joint in Miami  

440
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,818
         running a risk         
       with their lobster.      

441
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,220
  And spoiler alert, it ends up 
      paying off big-time.      

442
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:33,458
When you get back after this    
commercial, you get to see this.

443
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,961
                     ♪♪         

444
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:41,365
    In Miami's Little Havana,   
  I found this funky family-run 

445
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,568
           Cuban joint          
    dishing out seafood like,   

446
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,037
 now wait for it, fried lobster.

447
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,039
And you had to eat on your feet.

448
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,774
        Well, it's still        
       standing room only,      

449
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:51,642
     but that's just because    
         of the crowds.         

450
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:56,180
         This is the one        
     and only La Camaronera.    

451
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,582
        Been coming here        
 since I was about 10 years old,

452
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,518
     and the same good food     
         since day one.         

453
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,985
     It's so wonderful now.     

454
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,921
 Now, you can actually sit down 
     and have a nice lunch.     

455
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,324
  It's always had the freshest  
        seafood in Miami.       

456
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:07,858
 That's why I keep coming back. 

457
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,260
        Minuta, table 11!       

458
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:10,794
             FIERI:             
 When I first met David Garcia, 

459
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:14,265
    he was just a young buck    
 serving up Cuban family recipes

460
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,401
  alongside his dad and uncle,  

461
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:18,002
the guys who started this place.

462
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:20,671
          -[ Whistles ]         
     -Florida lobster here.     

463
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:21,873
So where's the claws?           

464
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,275
    Florida lobsters do not have
                  the claws     

465
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,810
         like the Maine lobster.

466
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,011
           -Seriously?          
             -Yeah.             

467
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:28,146
             We're gonna prepare
              this lobster up.  

468
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,681
               What we do is,   
            we get the tail out.

469
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,150
 We just split the tail in half.

470
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:34,218
        Wow.                    
It's got a pinkish meat         

471
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,887
  versus the white              
we see in the Maine.
