00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,825
                   WOMAN:       
             Steak stuffed pita.

339
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,893
 The steak shawarma             
   is very tasty.               

340
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,896
 I like the chili zhoug because 
    it brings out the flavors   

341
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,430
   of everything put together.  

342
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:14,699
     And it's all wonderful.    

343
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,101
Can't go wrong with the Beestro.

344
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,302
         FIERI: And why Beestro?

345
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,304
The bees are a good model       
  for how we should             

346
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,638
   live our lives.              

347
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,839
Give more than you take.        

348
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,440
             So you have nothing
              to do with bees?  

349
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,510
No, I'm actually allergic.      
 It's my Kryptonite.            

350
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,645
I get my power from it,         
 but it can kill me.            

351
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:28,847
                 Okay, good.    

352
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:29,980
   It's also about              
 local communities,             

353
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,715
 support your local             
  farmer's market.              

354
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,452
He uses a lot of locally sourced
     produce, it's organic.     

355
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:37,055
Is part of the attraction       
to have it the way you want it? 

356
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:40,125
 I think it's really great to be
    able to customize a meal.   

357
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,594
   Today I ordered the Salmon   
     Souvlaki with the rice,    

358
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,595
       where you can have       
   really nice falafel balls.   

359
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,397
             Next we're getting 
      into the souvlaki machine.

360
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,333
        So a good friend of mine
     gave me a souvlaki machine,

361
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,000
               just like this.  
      I usually do it with lamb.

362
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,336
          You do it with salmon?

363
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,538
   A little lemon,              
house ground pepper.            

364
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,873
Build this Jenga tower          
     of salmon.                 

365
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,142
On goes the top.                
 This is going to press it down.

366
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,612
And then we just put            
on these little doohickeys.     

367
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,147
     Ooh. The doohickeys are on.

368
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,882
Just make sure you get your     
 "wompilator" valve             

369
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,350
on there really tight.          

370
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:06,751
        Your "wompilator" valve?

371
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,019
And now we're going to skewer.  

372
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,021
      Then you come through with
    the knife and start slicing.

373
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,689
We're going to crosshatch.      

374
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:15,426
  Take off the wompilator valve.
             Now, to the grill. 

375
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,361
    So, falafel.                
  How do you feel?              

376
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,629
            I feel like I'd like
                 a falafel.     

377
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,030
What we have here are           
       some...                  

378
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,432
          Rehydrated chick peas?
    Yeah.                       

379
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:24,169
In baking soda, cilantro,       
      parsley,                  

380
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,637
 diced white onion,             
and this is baking powder.      

381
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,038
    -Little leavening agent.    
         -That's right.         

382
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,508
Kosher salt, black pepper,      
chopped garlic, jalapeño,       

383
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,511
cumin, coriander, cardamom.     

384
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:36,180
         -There you go.         
  -And smoked Spanish paprika.  

385
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,715
    We're just going to put this
         through a meat grinder?

386
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,050
  Just let it rip.              

387
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:42,520
Now we have a mixture           
ready to ball up, to fry.       

388
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:43,721
           Let's get down to it.

389
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:46,324
Basmati rice with some          
salad greens on here.           

390
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,259
   Cucumber salad,              
 little beet salad,             

391
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,861
roasted grilled eggplant,       
   carrot ribbons,              

392
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,997
  pickled turnips,              
our lemon wedge here,           

393
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,333
put a little tabouli on there,  
grilled salmon, za'atar.        

394
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,601
               Little za'atar   
             and a little sumac.

   Falafel balls.

            It's just beautiful.

398

     I think the salmon souvlaki
           presents really nice.

All right, so how long          
are they going to steam?

   your tamales...

00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,822

           So let me just try it
             without any queso.

     You get a really nice ratio
              of meat to masa.

      When you can eat a tamale,

576
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,171
 nothing added to it, that means
       you got everything right.

577
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,307
   You got your seasoning right,
     you got your balance right.

578
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,308
I mean, it's just trial         
and error, and then finally --

       The pork is tender.      
    It mingles with the masa    

584
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,187
        and makes it just       
         a perfect bite.        

585
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,322

I want to come and see where all
  the tortillas are coming from.

              There's not many

       Not very many, no.
