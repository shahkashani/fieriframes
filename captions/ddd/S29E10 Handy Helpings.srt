1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,267
         Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,535
I'm Guy Fieri, and we're rolling
         out looking for

3
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:07,039
   America's greatest diners,
      drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,441
          This trip...
Come on, look at that!

5
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,043
    No knife and fork today.

6
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:12,244
                 You eat it
              the way you like.

7
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:13,946
     [Laughs]

8
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:16,949
 'Cause we're literally grabbing
       some gangster grub.

9
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:19,551
  That's raindrops
in Flavortown, folks.

10
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,420
  Like legit tacos in Atlanta.

11
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:23,155
  You'll love this.

12
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:25,557
     And prime-time burgers
          in Salt Lake.

13
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,459
    Oh, my gosh!

14
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,628
    Plus, we're getting crazy
       with the kolaches.

15
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,130
   Three, two, go.

16
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:32,498
     And feeling the need...

17
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,433
 What in the world?!

18
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:35,768
          ...for speed.

19
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,269
  You're an animal.

20
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:38,871
     That's all right here,
           right now,

21
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:41,340
 on "Diners, Drive-ins & Dives."

22
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:48,447
                     ♪♪

23
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:53,685
                     ♪♪

24
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:56,522
   So "Triple D" is all about
      finding the funky mom

25
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,590
         and pop joints
     all around the country.

26
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,793
   Well, now I guess it's kind
  of like all around the world.

27
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:02,628
 So I'm here in Salt Lake City,
              Utah,

28
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,531
 where three buddies are living
     the all-American dream.

29
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,066
    You see, they're sitting
         around saying,

30
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:09,368
       "Hey, one day, man,
    let's open up a brewery."

31
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,870
  "Yeah, and right next to it,
 we'll open up a burger joint."

32
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,439
     Well, these three made
           it happen.

33
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:15,641
 This is Proper Burger Company.

34
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:20,179
    I'm gonna start dropping
          more burgers.

35
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:21,380
        Food's fantastic.

36
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:23,515
     I mean, they have such
      a variety of burgers.

37
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,084
   Vegan Bollywood, order up!

38
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:26,919
    And the beer is amazing.

39
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,387
   FIERI: I got a melting pot
         of people here,

40
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:29,988
         everybody likes
        burgers and beer.

41
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,958
   Which is why brothers Liam
   and Rio Connelly and buddy

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,229
Andrew Tendick doubled down with
 their side-by-side businesses.

43
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,497
               You make beer.

44
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:39,531
    You sell the beer over there
                 in the bar.

45
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:40,866
    Then you also take the beer,

46
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,034
       ad you bring it over here
           to the burger company

47
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:43,235
                 and use it
            in the recipes here.

48
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:44,536
              Yep.

49
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,638
  FIERI: And their burger boss
    is Chef Jeff Springer...

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,640
    Swinging two pork cities.

51
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:49,975
   FIERI: ...who's definitely
          not sticking

52
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:51,710
    to the same old same old.

53
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,412
    Double rarebit order up!

54
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:57,483
   The rarebit has house-made
  beer-cheese -- super unique.

55
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:58,784
Chef, what are we making.

56
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,252
             Today, we're making
             our rarebit sauce.

57
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,687
And what do you know
about rarebit sauce?

58
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,355
       It's a beer-cheese sauce.

59
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,157
           They believe it comes
               from the Welsh.

60
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,892
 He had me at hello
   with that one.

61
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:09,528
   We're gonna heat up our milk,
 and then this is our amber ale.

62
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,796
       Got it.

63
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:11,964
  Then we're gonna bring this up
                 to simmer.

64
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,198
  Simmer down now.

65
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,466
               Now we're going
              to make the roux.

66
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,934
             Bacon fat, butter.

67
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,670
This is a bikini-weather sauce
if I've ever seen it.

68
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,739
              Sweat some onion.
             All-purpose flour.

69
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:23,008
       The Worcestershire sauce.

70
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,210
Worcestershire sauce.
           Worcestershire sauce.

71
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,378
             White wine vinegar.

72
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,046
Hurry up before I eat
   all the cheese.

73
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:29,948
                    Salt.
            Whole-grain mustard.

74
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,216
                   Thyme.

75
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,551
             Now we're gonna add
              our melted beer.

76
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:35,354
This is the European version
  of nacho cheese.

77
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:37,422
         I'm gonna transfer this
              into a 22-quart.

78
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,725
           Add our Irish cheddar
             and the gorgonzola.

79
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:41,460
We're gonna put this burger
    together now?

80
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:42,961
                    Yep.
              Two patties down.

81
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,163
    Two patties?

82
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:47,399
  Never frozen, locally sourced,
                 grass-fed.

83
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,901
            Just kind of warm up
                 the bacon.

84
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:49,968
 That fry is legit.

85
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,703
       The house-cut double fry.

86
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:52,938
       Yes.
                  Oh.

87
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,439
  Imagine that with some rarebit
                 on it, too.

88
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,041
  I don't even have
   to imagine it.

89
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,609
                 [Laughs]

90
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,946
That rarebit sauce is everything
I love in a cheese sauce.

91
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:02,281
 It's got the tang.

92
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:05,384
You get the underlying notes
   of the mustard.

93
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:06,852
  Oh, that's good!

94
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,620
    We've got a really good sear
             on the burger now.

95
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,222
 Look at that crust.
      Gorgeous.

96
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,090
       I'm gonna stack these two
                   on top,

97
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,293
   and we're gonna add the bacon
           right on top of this.

98
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:15,494
        Okay.

99
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,429
            Whole-grain mustard,
              sliced tomatoes,

100
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,566
        red onion, rarebit sauce
             right over the top.

101
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:22,301
       And that's all she wrote.

102
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,738
     Delicious.

103
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,307
I just want to taste
 the meat by itself.

104
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:30,075
It's seared super-hot
     so you get

105
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:32,177
this really nice caramelization
   on both sides.

106
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,346
 And then it's still
  tender and pink.

107
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:36,915
        Mmm!
The rarebit sauce is money.

108
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,918
All day long, money.

109
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,287
   I want a gallon
for the rarebit to go.

110
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,522
 Dynamite job, Chef.

111
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,591
     Got the rarebit burger.
      Really hits the spot.

112
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:46,892
Everything you want in a burger.

113
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,360
         All the flavors
    go really well together.

114
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,095
If I could just drink the sauce,
            I would.

115
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,997
          But I can't,
    so I drink the beer, too.

116
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,298
 How did these guys
 do with their beer?

117
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,200
      Some of the best beer
          in the state.

118
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,869
  The styles that they do here
 is something totally different.

119
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:01,173
 They do a gose, that's a salted
   beer, which is pretty fun.

120
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,775
      Their experimentation
 with the beer is also reflected

121
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:06,211
    in their experimentation
 in the burgers that they make.

122
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:07,613
Hipster burger, order up!

123
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:10,349
      I mean, you don't get
   a Pork City just anywhere.

124
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,950
   Here we have the Pork City.

125
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:14,152
 MAN: They've got house-made ham
        and bacon on it,

126
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,487
     and what's not to like?

127
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,489
What are we gonna do now?
          The brine for the ham.

128
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:18,824
                   First,
         we do some brown sugar.

129
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:20,292
                    Salt.
                Curing salt.

130
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,561
             Cumin, fennel seed,
              juniper berries.

131
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,296
Nice.
        And some cinnamon stick.

132
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,430
             The water goes in.

133
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,798
How long is the brine
    gonna simmer?

134
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,333
                Five minutes.

135
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,335
Now the ice is to cool it down
so we don't poach the ham

136
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,637
when it goes in the brine.
       Got it.

137
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,405
                    Okay.
     This is a deboned shoulder.

138
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,306
Boning these yourself?
                           Yep.

139
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:36,775
         Tie 'em myself as well,
                    so...

140
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,243
 Well done on that.

141
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,946
       Brown our ham 10 days and
  smoke it for about four hours.

142
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:45,284
    Pull it out and braze at 275
    to 300 for about five hours.

143
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:47,185
        Wow.
 Mayo gone wild, eh?

Every bit that they had
 in Salt Lake City.

145

              We're gonna make
               our beer aioli.

146
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,458
               Chopped garlic,
               roasted garlic.

147

                Lemon juice.

148
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,662
        Proper beer that we used
               in the rarebit.

149
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:59,431
     Salt and some black pepper.

150
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,433
Get it!
            Right into the mayo.

151
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,402
         Chopped parsley on top.

152
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:04,569
 I'm standing back.

153
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:08,573
If that thing comes out,
it's gonna paint the room.

154
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,042
Oh, that's dynamite.

155
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:11,376
You get that beer, but you gotta
love the roasted garlic

156
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,944
and the fresh garlic,
  without question.

157
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,514
Now we are going to take our ham
                and slice it.

158
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,015
     Four slices
 on this one burger?

159
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,517
           We'll do three slices
               on the burger.

160
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,419
Oh, you did four so you and
I have something to snack on.

             Yeah, yeah, right.

It don't get any better
     than that.

163
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,956
Nice little hit of smoke,
       tender.

164
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,026
             Third-pound patty,
 a little smoked ham, and bacon.

                 It is.
       Wow.

269
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:02,874
  Oh, you make this
     look easy.

270
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,710
        In the cooking over for,
              like, 30 minutes.

271
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,212
    Let's hit it.

272
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,847
So we are making the sausage for
  our sausage and gravy kolache.

273
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,916
      Okay.
                Onion powder.

274
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,217
             Granulated garlic.

275
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,152
      Salt, fresh-ground pepper.

276
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,587
                   And then...
Fresh-cut sage.

277
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:18,156
                    Yeah.
 And this is just pork and beef.

278
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,658
          Little water in there.

279
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,192
Start cooking that down,
and then we're gonna make

280
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,361
the gravy right in with
the sausage right now as we go?

281
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,596
                    Yeah.

282
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,398
Salt, pepper, flour,
a little bit of milk.

283
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,799
                      Yep.
   Let that cool.

284
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,100
And then stuff it.
                       Mm-hmm.

285
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,769
     So you just take your dough
                 and fill it

286
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,170
              with the sausage
             and gravy filling.

287
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,939
Whoa, that's a good portion.
                       Pinch it.

288
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:36,341
Set it down on the pinch.
How long are they gonna bake?

289
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,276
             Roughly 20 minutes.

290
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:42,514
    Heavy.
              It's pretty heavy.

291
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:44,316
 And is there a way
 that you eat them?

292
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:45,650
        Everything's with hands.

293
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:48,386
         Just wait for it to not
             burn your face off.

294
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,321
    A little hot.

295
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,022
                [Laughing]
               Yeah, I like...

296
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,457
 It's delicious.
                     Thank you.

297
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,893
The dough is yeasty.
                         Yeah.

298
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,161
That's what I really
   like about it.
                         Yeah.

299
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,730
It's light, it's airy,
but it's hearty enough

300
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,700
 that it really does
give you enough texture.

301
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:04,369
The gravy with the sausage,
it's tender, it's moist.

302
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:05,737
There's a lot of depth
     of flavor.

303
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:06,838
That's a full meal.
                      Thank you.

304
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,708
And especially on the run.
   It's fantastic.

305
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,277
        All right, we got
       sausage and gravy.

306
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,546
    Rich, delicious gravy --
           I love it.

307
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,047
  You get all kinds
 of flavor profiles,

308
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,716
    and it's all
in one tight little package.

309
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,217
                And the dough
                 is so good.

310
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,186
   -Going in the oven for 10.
            -Perfect.

311

 WOMAN: It's a really fun place
        to come and eat.

312
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,256
 The owners are always so happy
          and friendly

313
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,625
     when you come in here.

314
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,293
                    Whoo!
                    Okay.

315
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,794
Was that a little sing?
                         It was.

316
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,762
  Was that a little
   singing there?

317
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:31,997
                 I just make
               sound effects.

318
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,264
     You have --
    evidentially.

319
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:34,732
I'm putting together
    a soundtrack.

320
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,201
                    Aah.

322
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:39,404
                    Ooh.
                    Psst.

323
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:42,741
I can't even do that.
     [Laughs]

324
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:44,075
  This is more fun.

325
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,710
  I don't even know
if we're making food.

326
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,078
             [Laughing] Okay.

327
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,780
     FIERI: But, seriously,
 this place is getting after it,

328
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,849
 putting out plenty of fillings
         to choose from.

329
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,217
 So we're gonna make
  a sweet one next.

330
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:53,351
                    Yeah.

331
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:54,686
           All right,
     we got raspberry cream.

332
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,721
  FIERI: Getting a taste, well,
      that's another story.

333
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,923
     [Laughs]

334
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:01,793
These are great, but the
comedy show is hysterical.

335
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,399
What is the sound effect right
now when we're doing the...

 "Triple D" in Salt
  Lake City, Utah,

341
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,678
hanging out at Hruska's...

342
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,912
                  Kolaches.

 Hruska's Kolaches.
                       Mm-hmm.

344
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,483
You know what, I love the fact
that you made the name so easy

345
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:26,718
 for people to say.

346
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,421
             Yeah, strange name,
               delicious food.

347
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:32,257
       Kolaches are Czech,
  and it's kind of nice to get

348
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,526
 a little bit of Eastern Europe
       in Salt Lake City.

349
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,627
          What can we do for ya?

350
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:37,529
Kolache is a buttery,
    yeast break,

351
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,164
and then you can stuff
    or top them.

352
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,232
   Traditionally,
 kolaches are sweet.

353
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,101
A raspberry cream cheese,
       please.

354
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,436
                    Okay.

355
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,037
       Raspberry and cream
     is kind of always good.

356
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,606
  It's just got a nice balance
   of kind of sweet and tart.

357
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,041
FIERI: All right, so now
 what are we making?

358
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,876
          Our raspberry filling.
 Okay.

359
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,979
   So we're gonna start off wish
         some lemon concentrate,

360
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:57,115
             apple concentrate,
            crushed raspberries.

361
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,283
       Sugar.

362
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,584
      Once this comes to a boil,

363
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:02,120
           then we add Clear Jel
         of corn starch isolate.

364
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,855
Let this tighten up,
    let it cool.

365
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,390
               Yeah, we put it
              in a piping bag.

366
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,492
     All right,
 what are we making?
       Our cream cheese filling.

367
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,527
         We start off with cream
              cheese and sugar.

368
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:10,562
              We're just gonna
                cream it out.

369
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,630
        And then we're gonna add
               our egg yolks.

370
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:14,599
I love when the yolks
     make it in.

371
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,501
            Once we got that all
              creamed together,

372
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,570
                 we're gonna
          put in cottage cheese.

373
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:19,904
        Mmm.

374
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,840
              Which is a really
      traditional Czech filling.

375
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,508
 Same dough.
                 Same dough.

376
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,909
                 We're gonna
             stomp 'em all out.

377
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,478
You want me to time you?
                           Sure.

378
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,612
How long do you think
    it takes you?

379
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,180
             Less than a minute.

380
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,049
I'm gonna stomp, I'm gonna fill,
               I'm gonna fill.

381
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:32,550
You're gonna do all that
    in a minute?

382
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:35,620
                     Yeah.
 Three, two, go.

383
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,056
    What in the--

384
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:39,724
     13 seconds.

385
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:42,193
             I'm going too fast,
          I'm making these ugly.

386
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:45,029
     27 seconds.

387
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,966
     34 seconds.

388
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,834
 What in the world?!

389
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,069
             Those are so ugly,
                   though.

390
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,637
  You're an animal!

391
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,938
Now how long will this
    take to bake?

392
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,273
               Eight minutes.

393
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,341
      I actually like these ones
          right out of the oven,

394
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:57,642
           just a couple minutes
                   cooled

395
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,511
        so the cream cheese sets
             just a little bit.

396
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:01,045
  'Cause right now,
     that's a--

  gringo portions.

531
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,995
          [Laughing] Yes, sir.
Oh, just one more bite.

532
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,132
      Dos tacos Veracruzana
         in the window.

533
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:50,168
        Very hearty meal.
        It's very juicy.

534
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,669
   How about the fried avocados?
             What do you think?

535
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,538
        -They're amazing.
           -Very good.

536
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,473
     Dos carnitas up there!

537
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,909
  These's a lot of competition
   for tacos here in the city,

538
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,745
      and I really believe
     this place stands out.

539
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,213
     Why R-real?

540
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,715
  Rreal because of my last name,
                 Villarreal.

541
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:07,351
And to people go "R-Real Tacos"?
       R-Real?

542
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:10,755
R-Real Tacos are the most common
             or just Real Tacos.

543
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,824
      Nobody goes "Rreal Tacos."
           That does not happen.

544
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:14,959
       I'm talking on the phone,
I'm not gonna say "Rreal Tacos."

545
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:15,827
            No?
                    No.

546
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,161
      Why not?

547
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:18,229
       Nobody's gonna understand
          where I'm coming from.

548
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,832
[Rolls tongue] "Rreal Tacos.
    Rreal Tacos."

549
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,067
       I think Rreal Taco
       is really special.

550
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,002
 My favorite is the Pork Trompo.

551
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,771
   Trompo Taco in the window.

552
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,873
       It's crispy in all
         the right ways.

553
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,174
        MAN: They cook it
        fresh every day.

554
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,709
They cut it right off the stack.

555
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,010
 Why do you call it
    Trompo taco?

556
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:34,178
           That's how we call it
               where I'm from.

557
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,114
            And most people know
                it as pastor.

558
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,048
  So start it off.

559
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,783
            So guajillo peppers,
                   clove.

560
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,151
 Brown sugar?
                   Mm-hmm.

561
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,753
     Some salt, vinegar, garlic,
             and annatto seeds.

562
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,188
Gives that nice red hue.

563
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,358
            Some cumin, oregano,
                and epazote.

564
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,493
 Okay.
          A little bit of water,
              a little bit of--

565
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,128
 A little tequila.
                   Yes, tequila.

566
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,462
              That came before.
      Yes.

567
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,897
                    Yes.
                 Let it rip.

568
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,365
    "Let it rip."

569
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,868
Did you ever play the football
game when you were a kid?

570
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,902
  You had a little
   football game,

571
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:59,737
  those little guys
  vibrated around.

572
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,873
Let's see which one wins.
Which one are you gonna take?

573
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,041
                        Oregano.
I'll take the epazote.

574
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:05,376
     Here we go.

575
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,944
      Come on!
    Look at that!

576
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:09,080
      Epazote!
     [Laughs]

577
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:10,581
               I did not win?

578
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,816
 Easily entertained.

579
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,885
    Hi, I'm four.

580
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:15,820
So I'm gonna take this.
            A little extra salt.

581
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,288
We're using pork butt?
                           Yes.

582
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,589
      Give it a couple of hours.

583
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:21,092
   Stack these up
 and build a trompo.

584
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:22,693
You're gonna love this.

585
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:25,696
             From here, straight
            into the rotisserie.

586
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,302
                Look at that.
   That's the goods right there.

587
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:33,571
            You definitely taste
                the guajillo.

588
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,406
        Yes.

589
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,842
I like that crispiness when it's
          so close to the flame.

590
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,111
  Gives it a little reminiscence
         of a little chicharron.

591
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:42,413
     Yeah.
                 All right,
             let's make a taco.

592
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:45,283
These are house-made
     tortillas.

593
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,985
         We got the pork trompo,
                  cilantro.

594
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,021
  Okay.
             You got your limes.

595
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:55,326
                     ♪♪

596
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,028
    I don't know,
Chef, what I like better,

597
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,230
the flavor of the tacos
   or the passion

598
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,631
    that you have
  for what you do.

599
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:01,999
                 Thank you.

600
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,902
You treat this with the same
 level of expertise

601
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:08,239
that most people would expect
a Michelin restaurant to have.

602
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,641
If you want authentic
     flavors...

603
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,910
     done right,
these are your tacos.

604
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,512
                Here we have
             your Trompo Tacos.

605
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,581
          It's so fresh
     and it's so flavorful.

606
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:20,284
   Stuffed with a lot of meat,
        a lot of spices.

607
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,789
         -Out of bounds.
        -That's my line.

608
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,357
              Cut this guy out.

609
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,192
        [Speaking Spanish] Go!

610
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:31,195
  When I come in here, I really
    feel like I'm in Mexico.

611
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:33,898
When you called it Rreal Tacos,
  you backed it up.

612
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,366
                 Thank you.
Nicely done.

613
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:36,801
      This guy.

614
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:41,105
      So what that another
  righteous road trip, or what?

615
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,407
     But don't you worry --
    we got plenty more joints

616
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,109
 to find all over this country.

617
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:46,877
     I'll be looking for you
          next week on

618
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:49,280
  "Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives."

619
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:50,181
  Okay, watch this.

620
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:51,983
                    Okay.

621
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:54,252
    Yeah, we still got ghosts --
                  awesome.

622
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,220
It's a ghost that can't see
     very well.
