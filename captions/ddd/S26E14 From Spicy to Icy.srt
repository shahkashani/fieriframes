         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:06,071
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:06,939
          This trip...          

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,940
            -Hit it.            
              -Bam!             

5
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,476
        ...we're grabbing       
         a little ice...        

6
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:13,011
 I'm going to need this in, like
   a big, Styrofoam trucker mug.

7
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:15,147
There you go.                   
 ...and a whole lot of spice... 

8
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,348
            Nice big hit of that
               up there, yeah.  

9
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:19,350
           ...like in           
  Cathedral City, California... 

10
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:20,886
  Yeah, that'll do.             

11
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:23,555
 ...where sandwiches should come
      with a smoke alarm...     

12
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:26,024
Now we're warming up.           
     Here we go.                

13
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,559
    ...and at a Maui spot...    

14
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,695
 I don't know if I should eat it
   or take a picture of it, huh?

15
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:32,030
    ...mixing Southern hearty   
       with island party.       

16
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,231
        It's like you're working
            at the carnival,    

17
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,901
         like you run the Zipper
              or something.     

18
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,036
    Plus, a taste of New York   
          in Norfolk...         

19

I got 12 wings, Buffalo Soldier.

56

     I'm a new member of        
the Buffalo Soldier brigade.    

57
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:09,795
  Do you get a T-shirt for that,
         or do get to...?       

58
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:10,929
   I'm wondering.               

59
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,597
 It's his take on Jamaican jerk 
         barbecue sauce,        

60
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,932
   and it's really delicious.   

61
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,334
   All right, let's get into it.
             What are we making?

62
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,068
Buffalo Soldier sauce           
   for our wings.               

63
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:18,937
We're going to sauté            
the habanero peppers,           

64
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,405
and then I'm going to add       
   some minced garlic.          

65
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,608
And then we're just going       
to take tomatoes, green onions. 

66
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,944
Then I'll just add the peppers  
and minced garlic in there.     

67
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,812
         Bet a nice big hit     
     of that will clear you out.

68
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:29,548
I take the seeds out            
so it's not too bad.            

69
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,283
Then just in the pot,           
hot sauce, melted butter,       

70
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,486
some lime juice, soy sauce.     

71
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:36,421
          The kid from Rochester
           just added soy sauce?

72
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:37,956
   Dude, you sound              
    like my dad.                

73
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:41,360
  Dude, it's good!              
 I'm off the walls.             

74
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,427
              I don't even know 
             what that just was.

75
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:43,695
     All right,                 
all right, all right.           

76
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,297
And then we're going to add     
some apple cider vinegar,       

77
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,699
    brown sugar,                
Jamaican jerk spice,            

78
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:50,235
    ground thyme,               
  ground allspice,              

79
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:52,638
   minced ginger,               
some salt and pepper.           

80
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,373
     And here's                 
 our pureed veggies.            

81
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,907
  We're just going to           
bring it up to a boil.          

82
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:57,509
             And let it reduce, 
               and that's it.   

83
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,444
  Boom!                         
     There you go. There you go!

84
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,246
       Talk to me about the type
            of wing we're using.

85
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,781
They're fresh, never frozen.    

86
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,182
As big as I can get the wings,  
        I'll get them.          

87
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,717
             Like Pterodactyl.  
   Yeah!                        

88
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,653
               What type of oil?
As best an oil as I can get.    

89
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:10,188
The oil in the fryer should look
       like that. I'm impressed.

90
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:11,523
     What temperature we cooking
            the wings at?       

91
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,191
350, about 16 minutes.          

92
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,060
So, we got our 12 wings         
     ready to go.               

93
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,529
              I pride myself    
           as a wing aficionado.

94
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,231
 I mean, if I'm not getting funk
      and crunch, I'm a walking.

95

Dude, I'll take that challenge  
all day of the week.            

96
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,403
             This I'm liking.   
You got to paint it.            

97
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:25,937
             'Cause if the wings

         they're still absorbing

99

102

             The non-frozen wing

   To be really honest with you,
 I don't see it hardly anywhere.

104

           The wings are tender.

00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,375
     and all kinds of beer.     

117
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,177
    FIERI: Which, of course,    
    goes great with football.   

118
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,446
    Every Sunday, it's packed   
    in here with Bills' fans.   

119
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,715
      FIERI: And sometimes,     
    even former Bills players   

120
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,450
 like Hall-of-Famer Bruce Smith.

121
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,452
First-round draft pick          
       in 1985.                 

122
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:19,124
The man that has 200            
quarterback sacks, 11 Pro Bowls.

123
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,326
How's Russ doing down here      
    with Dirty Buffalo?         

124
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,728
             SMITH: He's legit. 

125
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,529
   If you want a buffalo chicken
             wing, go to Buffalo

126
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:25,930
        or you got to come here.

127
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,399
     And the Northeast feast    
      just keeps on coming.     

128
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,534
    So, in upstate New York,    

129
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,936
     they have what's called    
       the garbage plate.       

130
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:34,072
Russ brought it down here, added
  his own special recipe to it. 

131
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,007
      I got a dirty chick,      
         Cajun buffalo.         

132
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:38,476
 Something you would never think
to put together with hash browns

133
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,079
     and the mac n' cheese,     
      and then the chicken.     

134
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,747
   -What are we making first?   
     -It's the sauce first.     

135
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:43,881
             -Okay.             
    -So, we're going to take    

136
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,150
         some hot sauce,        
      heat it up to a boil.     

137
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,352
    Take some melted butter,    
          orange juice.         

138
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:49,221
                Come on down    
             to Russ' Diet Barn.

139
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:52,824
Ketchup, some brown sugar,      
a little bit of water,          

140
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,427
  granulated sugar,             
apple cider vinegar,            

141
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,963
   some dry mustard,            
yellow mustard, honey,          

142
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,431
and some barbecue sauce.        

143
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,166
           Some Cajun seasoning.
             Mix this all up.   

144
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,268
              Let it reduce.    
     Yep.                       

145
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,569
  Boom, boom, boom!             

146
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:07,372
              Aah!              
         He's an animal!        

147
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,840
Now we're going to dredge       
the chicken tenders.            

148
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,242
Pop it in the fryer.            

149
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:11,443
            Now we're going to  
           make a mac n' cheese.

150
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:12,644
 We're going to make            
 our cheese sauce --            

151
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,781
heavy cream in first, salt,     
    granulated garlic,          

152
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,782
  granulated onion,             
    white pepper.               

153
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,384
    And then we'll just         
whisk that in really good,      

154
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,451
and then bring it up            
     to a boil.                 

155
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,720
               Now the American?
    Yep.                        

156
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,455
                That's a lot    
             of American cheese.

157
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,390
  Sharp cheddar.                
          Slowly add the cheese.

158
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:26,792
    Don't go want to go too fast
          with the melting      

159
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,126
             or it'll clump up. 

160
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:29,861
We're just going to add a little
bit of water to the skillet,    

161
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,596
    throw the pasta in          
that's already been cooked.     

162
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,331
Then we're just going           
to add cheese sauce.            

163
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,599
                Mac 'n cheese   
               is ready to go?  

164
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,534
        Yep.                    
Take our home fries,            

165
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,536
put the mac n' cheese           
  on top of there.              

166
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:42,273
Take our chicken tenders,       
add our Cajun buffalo to it.    

167
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,409
       Does Bruce Smith eat this
           when he comes in?    

168
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:46,210
    Dude, he eats               
   a lot of wings.              

169
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:48,813

That's the dirty chick.         

170
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,082
   I mean, I think the challenge
      is, is can you cut into it

171
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:53,151
           without having it all
         go shoot off the plate.

172
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,621
Hence the dirty plate.          

173
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,022
            That's a really good
                   tender.      

174
00:05:58,092 --> 00:05:59,024
                It's got        
         a great breading to it.

175

    dirty chick for you, sir.   

180
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,369
       The Cajun buffalo's      
       my favorite sauce.       

181
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,638
        It's really spicy       
      and thick and great.      

182
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,306
              I could eat this  
             three meals a day. 

183
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,509

          -Ahi samurai.         
-Ahi samurai is an awesome dish.

229
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,265
   It's absolutely delicious.   

230
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,466
             What are we making?

231
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,401
 Our avocado hummus that        
goes on the ahi samurai.        

232
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:53,405
First we just have tahini,      
garbanzo beans or chickpeas,    

233
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:56,007
100% olive oil, lemon juice.    

234
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:58,676
The only thing left is          
just fresh island avocados.     

235
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:01,078
         So, this is hummus with
            pieces of avocado   

236
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,947
       versus and avocado mousse
             you got here.      

237
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,215
      Exactly.                  

238
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,551
Here is half an ahi loin that   
we got in earlier today.        

239
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,086
                    Gorgeous.   
Let's take off the belly portion

240
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,888
 just so we can get             
that saku block out.            

241
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:10,689
                  S-a-k-u?      

242
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,357
S-a-k-u -- saku block.          

243
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,958
             Just the prime-time
                 loin of it.    

244
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,227
      Exactly.                  
                      Got it.   

245
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,896
Next step, kosher salt          
and coarse, ground black pepper.

246
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,297
And all we're really            
   looking for is               

247
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:20,698
    just to coat                
  both sides of it.             

248
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:21,699
                    Okay.       

249
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:22,901
  And then the last             
   finishing touch              

250
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,436
       is just taking           
a little bit of the furikake,   

251
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:27,171
    which is nori               
and Japanese spices.            

252
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:28,907
     A hot flat top             
with a little bit of oil.       

253
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,742
          And just hot and fast.
   Really quick.                

254
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,110
Just crusting both sides.       

255
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,445
I still want it completely raw  
for the majority of it.         

256
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,847
                        Okay.   
Now, we're going to take        
the toasted baguette,           

257
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,918
 that avocado hummus            
that we made earlier.           

258
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:43,588
     Down goes the ahi,         
on-island red pickled onions,   

259
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:46,724
    wasabi aioli,               
   clover sprouts.              

260
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,327
And then the last is            
just a balsamic reduction.      

261
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:50,729
And there's the ahi samurai.    

262
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,130
 I don't know if I should eat it
   or take a picture of it, huh?

263
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,534
                     ♪♪         

264
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:59,003
     When you get ahi like that,
          you sear it perfectly,

265
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,471
             you can't beat it. 

266
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:01,806
                    Mmm.        

267
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,075
 Contrast of the pickled onions,
        loved the little hummus.

268
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,877
      You really do want to take
      that and smash it together

269
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,211
         and make it a sandwich,
            let me tell you.    

270
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:08,479
             Now, we are calling
             this an appetizer? 

271
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,548
         We're calling this a...
Calling this an appetizer.      

272
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,417
Another thing we kind of        
brought from the South          

273
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,285
   is we like people            
leaving full and happy,         

274
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:17,022
       so we still someone      
 a substantial amount, for sure.

275
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,623
   Substantial it is, my friend.
Thank you very much.            

276
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,224
                Nicely done.    

277
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,493
          -Ahi samurai.         
  -You get the wasabi in there  

278
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,829
  with the aioli, the balsamic  
 gives it a little bit of tang. 

279
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,698
    Really fresh, local food.   

280
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,899
    FIERI: There's also known   
     for their local drinks.    

281
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:30,902
   So, as I'm doing all the hard
         work in the back,      

282
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,971
       Reno's been here sampling
           all of the beverages.

283
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,105
    So, when you                
   come to Hawaii,              

284
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,907
    you've got to try           
some traditional drinks.        

285
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,241
             How's the Mai Tai? 
                Is it legit?    

286
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:38,242
This is the real deal           
     right here.                

287
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:39,711
          How's the pina colada?

288
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,246
This colada good, brudda.       

289
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,513
           This coldada is good?

290
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:45,183
     And you can pair it up     
with the guys' top-selling dish.

291
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,718
      MAN: Lobster and crab     
         grilled cheese.        

292
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:50,321
     Lobster, crab, cheese,     
 amazing Hawaiian sweetbread -- 

293
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,989
     what more can you want?    

294
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,526
          Okay. That sounds like
        really swimsuit weather.

295
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:55,993
      Oh, yeah.                 

296
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,196
So, I start by just making      
the lemon Beurre Blanc sauce.   

297
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:02,667
Oil in the pan, garlic,         
shallots, Chablis cooking wine. 

298
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,135
                 Chablis?       
   Chablis.                     

299
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,804
         Oh, only the fine wine!

300
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:08,139
Put a little lemon juice        
in there, heavy whipping cream. 

301
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,674
Butter -- one little block      
         at a time              

302
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,743
to make sure the sauce stays    
 together and doesn't break.    

303
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,111
               Doesn't break?   
               Pinch of salt.   

304
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,945
           All right, next step?
We build the sandwich itself.   

305
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:18,216
First, a little crab claw meat  
and Maine lobster claw meat.    

306
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,818
         All the way from Maine.
All the way from Maine.         

307
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,319
      All the way to the island.
All the way to the island.      

308
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:22,554
             Don't you guys have
          lobster on the island?

309
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,089
We have spiny lobster           
   on the island.               

310
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,624
The quality difference          
   is night and day.            

311
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,226
           I'm timing you to see
        if you can get this done

312
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,894
                before I eat    
               all the fries.   

313
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,496
               I don't know     
           what's going on here.

314
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,831
A little Cajun blend spice.     

315
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,299
            Those are dangerous.

316
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,101
Now we're just going to warm    
this up on the sauté pan.       

317
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:37,168
  It comes cooked.              
                Just to warm it.

318
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,703
      Yes, sir.                 

319
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,038
     So now that                
that's good and hot,            

320
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,107
     we can slice               
the Hawaiian sweetbread         

321
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,041
to about an inch thickness.     

322
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,910
    A little bit                
of the whipped mayo.            

323
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,246
Make sure we get a good,        
    nice toast going.           

324
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,049
    Put down the slices         
of American, Monterey jack      

325
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,116
 and cheddar blend.             

326
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,652
The lobster and crab,           
 I just pile it on.             

327
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:57,055
      That doesn't look like one
   person's eating that anyways.

328
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:58,056
  Got our cabbage.              

329
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,190
              That's odd. Okay. 

330
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,391
     Just gives it              
a little bit of crunch.         

331
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,861
Diced tomatoes, and then we have
that Beurre Blanc sauce.        

332
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,063
Once it's grilled both sides,   
it's time for plating.          

333
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:06,130
            It's a monster, bro.

334
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,698
We just add a little bit        
     of lava sauce.             

335
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:08,933
          What's the lava sauce?

336
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,936
Mayonnaise, Sambal chili paste, 
sweet Thai chili sauce,         

337
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,938
 fresh lemon juice,             
 and white vinegar.             

338
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,741
 Take the sandwich,             
 cut it in quarters.            

339
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,676
           I'll check the fries.

340
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,145
          That's a nice plating.
 Thank you.                     

341
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,346
Then we finish it with a little 
bit more of that lava sauce     

342
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:24,215
just 'cause it complements      
everything on there.            

343

washyoursister sauce?           

571
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,325
                 Some sage.     

572
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,862
Paprika, chili powder,          
 and a little cayenne.          

573
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:51,996
               You've got it.   

574
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:52,996
Let that chicken marinate       

575
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:54,331
in this barbecue sauce          
     for how long?              

576
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,666
                   Over night.  
Into the smoker.                

577
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,068
                   Yes.         
     Got it.                    

578
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,803
Next thing we're going to do    
is a beautiful-looking brisket  

579
00:18:58,805 --> 00:18:59,870
   with nice bark.

00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:00,872
               I don't suppose  
             you want to try it.

581
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,807
         Well,                  
in the name of science.         

582
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,010
Mm. That's a competition        
brisket right there.            

583
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:08,012
Tender, pulls apart.            

584
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:09,814
   You want to try              
a bite of that, huh?

           Yep.                 
The hand says he likes it.      

587
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,018
              Get a little bit  
                of the pork.    

588
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:16,820
             Then we're going to
             pull some chicken. 

589
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,155
So, it's mixed together.        

590
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,823
Now we're ready to make the slaw
       that's going on top      

591
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,359
of the the three-meat --        
what did you call it?           

592
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,360
                 Three-meat     
             barbecue sandwich. 

593
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,628
 How did you come up            
   with that name?              

594
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:25,763
     Start with some mayonnaise.

595
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,765
            Apple cider vinegar,
              pineapple juice.  

596
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,032
That's an interesting one.      

597
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:34,438
      Heavy cream, salt, pepper,
         celery seed, and sugar.

598
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,372
 That is very thin.             

599
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:36,640
              It's very light.  

600

602
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,578
                Then we take    
              our three meats.  

603
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:42,313
Add the barbecue sauce.         

604
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:43,647
         We got our toasted bun.

    Didn't know.                

609
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:53,191
    A little bit of our chipotle
          sauce, fresh jalapeño.

                There you go.   

611
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,462
 You're giving them             
all kinds of flavor.            

612
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,998
The slaw's really tasty         
with the pineapple juice.
