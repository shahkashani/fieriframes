SO NOW WE'RE GONNA DO THE ONION,
   ZUCCHINI AND YELLOW SQUASH.  

484
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,977
SEE, I THINK THIS IS NEAT       
    WITH THE SQUASH,            

485
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:09,046
     THROWING SOME VERY         
INTERESTING TEXTURE IN THERE.   
              AND AS WE GET MORE
             AND MORE VEGETABLES

486
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:11,048
       AS THE SUMMER ROLLS ON...
KEEP KNOCKIN'                   
IT OUT, YEAH.                   

487
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,050
   WE ADD A LITTLE MORE OF THAT,
          A LITTLE MORE,        

488
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:15,052
   AND IT GETS NICER AND NICER. 
     NOW WE GOT THE PEPPERS--   

489
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:16,654
       THE POBLANOS, ANAHEIMS...
ANAHEIMS.                       

490
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:19,257
                   AND JALAPEÑO.
     AND JALAPEÑO.              
AND THE CILANTRO, RIGHT?        

491
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,993
     THEY JUST ALL GO TOGETHER. 
     CHICKEN STOCK TO START OFF.

492
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:24,127
RIGHT OFF THE BAT.              
                AND TOMATO JUICE

493
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,129
             FROM THE TOMATOES  
          WE MADE THE PICO WITH.

494
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,133
V8 JUICE, AND THAT ADDS A LITTLE
    BIT MORE OF THE TOMATO--    

495
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:31,135
               A LITTLE BIT MORE
                  VEGETABLE.    

496
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,936
       THEN WE ADD OUR POTATOES,
             OUR CHICKEN,       

497
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,738
       WHICH IS NICELY CHOPPED, 
          AND NOW THAT PICO.    

498
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,807
  WE GOT A LITTLE MORE CILANTRO,
     A LITTLE SALT AND PEPPER.  

499
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,809
            THAT'S GONNA SIMMER 
           FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES.

500
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:41,345
                IT DOESN'T TAKE 
               VERY LONG AT ALL.

501
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,347
I LIKE THE CONFETTI             

502
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,549
      OF THE ONIONS             
AND THE SQUASH IN THERE.        

503
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,485
THAT REALLY LOOKS NICE.         

504
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,888
  THEN ON TOP OF THAT, GOT A FEW
    CHIPS AND A LITTLE AVOCADO. 

505
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,157
              WOW, THAT'S GOOD. 

506
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,892
        THE FLAVOR IS SO FRESH. 

507
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,894
          ALMOST LIKE A HOT     
     PICO de GALLO CHICKEN SOUP.

508
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:59,163
     I MEAN, IT'S JUST--IT'S NOT
      ONE THING, IT'S MULTIPLE. 

509
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:00,765
            OH, IT'S GOOD, MAN. 

510
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,701
                  EVERY DAY     
             THAT'S ON THE MENU?
    EVERY DAY                   
THAT'S ON THE MENU.             

511
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,636
WE MAKE ENOUGH                  
 FOR ONE DAY.                   

512
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,905
 IT DOESN'T SIT AROUND,         
AND WHATEVER GOES, GOES.        

513
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,907
          YEAH, SO IF IT'S DONE,
                IT'S DONE.      
IT'S DONE.                      

514
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,509
YOU ORDER SOMETHIN' ELSE.       

515
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:15,512
         SO IF YOU WANT TO WIN  
       HERE AT THE DIXIE QUICKS,

       FRESH GARDEN TASTE

   ALONG WITH THE SPICINESS.    
         CONSISTENTLY DELICIOUS.

518
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:23,054
AMAZING FOOD                    
EVERY TIME.                     

519
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,589
  I WANT THEM TO HAVE THE BEST  
FOOD THEY'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME.

520
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,792
NO MATTER WHAT YOU ORDER,       

521
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,928
  YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS          
GOING TO BE VERY SPECIAL.       
              YOU'RE A FANTASTIC
                  CHEF, MAN.    

522
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:33,998
              IS IT OKAY TO PICK
             OFF PEOPLE'S PLATE?
  WELL, IT'S NICE               
IF YOU ASK, BUT...              

523
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,667
                   IS THAT--    
              DID YOU DROP THAT?

524
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,737
   NICE. YOU WERE IN ON IT, TOO.
            I LIKED IT.         
      YOU LIKE THAT, HUH?       

525
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,806
          'CAUSE YOU GAVE THE...
                THE GLANCE.     

526
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,475
       SO IS THAT A MONEY       
       ROAD TRIP, OR WHAT?      

527

 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

528
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,081
         WHY COULDN'T LESS SPICY
                BE SPICY,       

529
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,083
        MORE SPICY BE MORE SPICY
             THAN THE SPICY,    

530
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:54,085
                BUT HOME-STYLE  
               BE THE NON-SPICY,

531
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,089
            SO SPICY, LESS SPICY
               IS THE MIDDLE?   
I FEEL LIKE I JUST              
BOUGHT THE STREET.
