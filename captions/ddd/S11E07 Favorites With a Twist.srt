               JUST WORKIN' OUT.
LET ME TRIM IT UP               
  A LITTLE BIT.                 

153
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:06,164
   I JUST LIKE IT               
A LITTLE MORE SQUARE.           
       THIS IS GOING TO THROUGH 
       THE FLAVOR-TOWN CAR WASH.

154
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,367
         (makes swishing noises)
   IT LOOKS LIKE                
A BAD SQUID MOVIE.              

155
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,369
 WE'RE GONNA SPREAD             
SOME BUTTER ON THERE.           
                    I LIKE THIS.

156
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:14,038
 IT'S ACTUALLY                  
KINDA SOOTHING.                 
        ESPECIALLY WITH THE BABY
          HEART MONITOR GOIN'.  

157
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,240
    I KNOW, RIGHT?              
SO WE ADD BROWN SUGAR.          

158
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,977
I MIX CINNAMON IN THERE,        
 AND I LIKE A LOT OF IT.        
                      (whistles)

159
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,647
 AND I JUST KINDA               
SMEAR IT ON THERE.              
      DOESN'T IT LOOK LIKE A BIG
        CINNAMON TOAST BLANKET? 

160
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:25,082
 AND I'M GONNA ROLL

                    THIS THING  
                   IS CRAZY BIG.
NOW WE'RE GONNA CUT IT          
INTO OUR ROLL PORTIONS.         

162
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,456
       LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT.
          THAT'S RIDICULOUS.    

163
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,458
NOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE            
  OUR CARAMEL SAUCE             

164
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:34,926

     OF THE PAN.

00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,796
PUT IN OUR BUTTER,              
    CORN SYRUP.                 
                    ALWAYS MAKES
                     IT BETTER. 

166

 I THINK WE'RE GOOD AND COVERED.
      NOW WHAT I LIKE TO DO     

173
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,417

           NOW LET'S PLATE UP   
         THIS BUBBLE AND SQUEAK.
EGGS ARE ALWAYS TRYING          
  TO CRACK THE PARTY.

00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,935
                 KIND OF MAKE UP
                  FOR THE EGGS.

POT LIKKER GRAVY ON IT.         

282
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:15,473
DON'T BE SHY WITH THAT NOW.     
                  AND FINISH IT 
                 WITH A BISCUIT.

283
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,475

288
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:28,352
MIX THEM WITH A LITTLE POTATO,  
 PUT A LITTLE PAN-FRY ON THEM,  

289
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:30,955
        THEN HIT THEM           
WITH THIS POT LIKKER GRAVY--    

290
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:33,892
 THE SIGN OUT FRONT SHOULD JUST 
SAY "HOUSE OF POT LIKKER GRAVY."

   ARE PARTICULARLY DELICIOUS.  

295
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:46,037

                SO WE START OFF 
              WITH SHRIMP STOCK.
SHRIMP STOCK                    

376
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,421
THAT'S GOING FOR THE TABASCO    
GRAVY FOR THE SHRIMP & GRITS.   
                      THAT'S IT.

377
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,824
GOT IT.                         
          SHRIMP SHELLS, FENNEL,
               MOSTLY ENDS,     

378
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:56,093
     THE STALKS, OREGANO, ONION,
     BAY LEAVES, CHOPPED GARLIC.

379
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:59,563
 THAT AND SOME WATER--HOW LONG  
YOU GONNA LET THAT SIMMER FOR?  
                 30, 45 MINUTES.

380
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,632
 AND THEN STRAIN IT,            
AND THAT'LL BE GOING            

381
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,568
INTO THE TABASCO GRAVY?         
     AND THEN WE MAKE THE GRAVY.

382
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,170
     I'M GONNA ADD A FAIR AMOUNT
       OF BUTTER TO THIS ONE.   
THERE YOU GO.                   

383
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,172
    I'M GONNA ADD CHOPPED ONION,
          RED BELL PEPPERS,     

384
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,108
     SOME MORE FENNEL--SOMETHING
      ABOUT FENNEL AND SHRIMP.  

385
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,976
WORKS FOR ME.                   
         WE GET THAT STIRRED IN.

386
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,312
         LET THAT SIMMER        
 A LITTLE BIT, KIND OF DEVELOP. 
OKAY.                           

387
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,314
       WE WANT TO ADD GARLIC,   
     AND THEN THE REASON I ADDED

388
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:19,384
       A LOT OF BUTTER TO THIS--
          WORK SOME FLOUR IN.   
AND MAKE YOUR ROUX              
 RIGHT OUT OF IT.               

389
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,185
                RIGHT OUT OF IT.
TRADITIONAL METHOD. OKAY.       

390
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,987
        THAT'S SOMETHING THEY DO
              IN LOUISIANA.

00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,989
              BAY LEAVES, THYME,
                   OLD BAY.     
WE TAKE THAT.

        AND A LITTLE EXTRA ROUX.

395
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,531
I LIKE THAT TECHNIQUE.          
                ISN'T THAT GOOD?

396
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:36,067
       JUST TO MAKE SURE WE GOT 
      ENOUGH THICKNESS IN THERE.

397
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:39,136
       WE'LL LET THAT THICKEN UP
      A LITTLE BIT, AND WE GOT--
TABASCO, HENCE THE NAME

THERE YOU GO.                   

402
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,479
     WE'RE GONNA LET THAT SIMMER
        FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES.   
LOOKS GOOD.                     

403

                ADD OUR         
      STONE-GROUND YELLOW GRITS.

408
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:00,424
 YOU CALLED ME UP FOR GRITS,    
AND I AM A GRIT-EATIN' FOOL.    

409
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,094
  SIMMER FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF.
         ADD FRESH BUTTER.      

410
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,296
   OF COURSE BUTTER HERE        
AT AUNT MARY'S BUTTER BARN.     

411
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,932
            POUR THE GRITS      
       INTO THE PAN. HERE WE GO.
WHAT ARE WE MAKING NOW?         

412
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:09,834

           THE PASILLA PEPPERS. 

416
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:19,710
               I'M NOT A BIG FAN
                OF GREEN BELLS, 

417
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:21,779
              SO I USE PASILLAS.
     NO, THEY GOT               
AN INTERESTING FLAVOR.          

418
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,515
    THERE YOU GO.

                     RED ONIONS,
                     WHITE WINE.

419
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,984
THAT'S A FIRE.                  
        WE GOT ROASTED TOMATOES.

420
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,987
