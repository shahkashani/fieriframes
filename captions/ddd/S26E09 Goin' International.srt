I just got the habanero.        

544
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,746
                  There we go.  
 The habanero's hot.            

545
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,382
                      Good.     
  You sure deliver              
 on a burrito, man.             

546
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,051
       I mean,                  
  that's real deal.             

547
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,852
     Hey, guys. Here you go.    

548
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,254
          The shrimp is         
       just really tender.      

549
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:51,656
      It's not overcooked.      

550
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:54,125
Right amount of spices          
  build perfectly.              

551
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:55,859
            It's just           
     a really good burrito.     

552
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,195
           Mango shrimp ceviche!

553
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,730
      After a big, long day     
        of sun and surf,        

554
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:00,932
    we love to come back here   
            and dive            

555
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,333
    into that fresh seafood.    

556
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,468
 FIERI: And people are diving in
         all night long.        

557
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,203
 We never close.                
                    24/7?       

558
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,072
This place has maybe two or     
three slow hours in the morning,

559
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,741
   and that's it.               
 This place is busy.            

560
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,410
        It's a great spot       
       to just grab a bite      

561
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:13,944
       while you're going       
          to the beach.         

562
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,213
   Fajita nachos!               

563
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,948
     An amazing little hole     
           in the wall          

564
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,949
    that serves awesome food.   

565
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,618
None of it makes sense --       
photographer, Toronto,          

566
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,086
less than 5,000 bucks,          

567
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,288
serving up big burritos.        

568
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,957
But this nonsense equation      

569
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,626
      turns out                 
a hell of a burrito, dude.      

570
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,229
       I mean,                  
that's a lot of burrito.        

571
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,631
I will be back, brother.        
You're a man of the people.     

572
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,366
                 That's it.     
              I'm giving back.
