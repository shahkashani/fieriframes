   WHAT DOES CINCINNATI HAVE?   

197
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,084
         THAT'S RIGHT--         
     CINCINNATI-STYLE CHILI.    

198
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,086
  NOW CINCINNATIANS GO THROUGH  

199
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,755
   MORE THAN 2 MILLION POUNDS   
         OF CHILI A YEAR        

200
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:40,425
           TOPPED WITH          
 OVER 850,000 POUNDS OF CHEESE. 

201
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,427
        NOW THERE'S BEEN        
         A BIG DEBATE--         

202
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,429
        WHO MADE IT FIRST       
     AND WHO MAKES IT BEST?     

203
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:45,963
         WELL, EVERYBODY        
       HAS THEIR OPINION,       

204
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,566
    BUT A LOT OF YOU WROTE IN   
     AND SENT ME TO A PLACE     

205
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,969
 THAT I'D NEVER EVEN HEARD OF-- 
         BLUE ASH CHILI,        

206
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,306
  15 MILES NORTH OF CINCINNATI, 
  AND MY ONLY QUESTION NOW IS,  

207
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,774
        AM I'M GONNA HAVE       
      A 2-WAY, 4-WAY, 5-WAY     

208
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,843
    OR, AT THIS JOINT, 6-WAY?   

209
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:01,779
          GOT A 6-WAY.

214
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,857
 YOU GO ANYWHERE IN CINCINNATI, 
   YOU SAY, "I WANT A 5-WAY,"   

215
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,659
         I'M GETTIN' SPAGHETTI,

         IT'S TERRIFIC.         

225
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,817

226
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,218
       I KNOW THAT YOU'RE EITHER

227
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:45,090
            OR WE ARE GONNA MAKE
              A MESS OF CHILI.  
ABSOLUTELY.                     

228
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,826
WELL, WE'RE GONNA START OFF WITH
ABOUT 100 POUNDS OF GROUND BEEF.

229
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,227
                     100 POUNDS!
YEP.                            

230
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,828
     FRESH GROUND, NEVER FROZEN?
CORRECT.                        

231
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,697
          FILL IT UP WITH WATER.
WE'LL JUST STIR                 
INTO A SLURRY.                  

232
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,565
NOW WE ADD SALT,                
 GARLIC POWDER.                 

233
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,434
                   HOW LONG     
             IS THIS GONNA COOK?
TWO HOURS.                      

234
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,637
    YOU'VE NEVER SEEN 100 POUNDS
            OF MEAT BOIL.       

235
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,706
    THAT'S ON GOLDEN MEAT POND. 

236
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,109
    IT IS. IT'S GOTTA BE        
AROUND 250 DEGREES AT LEAST.    

237
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,578
            SO NOW WHAT GOES IN?
NOW WE PUT IN THE ONIONS.       
      TOMATO PASTE.             

238
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,447
     THAT'LL PUT SOME NICE COLOR
               IN THIS.         
AND THEN CHILI SPICE MIX.       

239
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:12,517
         PAPRIKA, TOMATO POWDER,
          CUMIN, BLACK PEPPER,  

240
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,118
                 CINNAMON, SALT.

241
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,587
           BUT YOU WON'T TELL ME
               THE PORTIONS.    
GOT THAT RIGHT.                 

242
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:19,190
 <i> OR THE LAST TWO INGREDIENTS.</i>  
   AND ALL WE DO                
IS JUST STIR IT UP.             

243
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,859
          HOW LONG DOES THIS GO?
       THAT'S GONNA GO          
FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF.   

244
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,861
NOW WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD        
   AND OPEN UP THE LID          

245
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:26,931
AND PUT IN THE SLURRY MIX.      
     NOW THE SLURRY MIX IS WATER
          AND CRACKER MEAL,     

246
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:29,267
           AND THAT'S GONNA HELP
           TIGHTEN THE CHILI UP.
CORRECT.                        

247
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,937
RIGHT NOW WE'LL GO AHEAD AND SET
   IT FOR ANOTHER 45 MINUTES,   

248
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,405
AND THAT'LL STEEP OVERNIGHT.    
         STAYS ABOVE 140 DEGREES
              SO IT'S SAFE.     

249
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,741
RIGHT.                          
        AND IT JUST SITS THERE  
      AND MELDS ALL THE FLAVORS.

250
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:40,145
CORRECT.

   TURF WARS HERE IN CINCINNATI,

    I THINK WE HAVE

265
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,308

266
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:12,243
               THE CHILI        
       HAS A UNIQUE SPICE TO IT.

267
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,779
 THE ONIONS ARE NICE AND FRESH,

269
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,783
      HAVING THE BEANS IN THERE,
          THERE'S THE TEXTURE   

270
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,785
                THAT YOU EXPECT

271
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,987
            BUT THE BEANS

RIGHT.                          

272
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,390
THEN YOU PUT A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT
        OF CHEESE ON IT.        

273
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,392
             THAT'S A GREAT WAY

274
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,461
          I COULD EAT THAT      
     SIX OR SEVEN TIMES A WEEK.

00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,602
    THE TEXTURE AND THE TASTE   
       OF THE TANGINESS--       

278
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,604
            IT'S GOT            
  THE REAL CINCINNATI FLAVOR.   
                          6-WAY.

279
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,539
      JALAPEÑOS REALLY ADDS     
          A KICK TO IT.         

280
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,607
TONS OF CHEESE.                 
           AND WHAT ELSE DO YOU 
          LIKE TO HAVE CHILI ON?

281
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,478
PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING.           
    TWO CHEESE CONEYS PLAIN,    
           TABLE ONE.           

282
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,546

       ONIONS AND MUSTARD.      

283
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,081
      GOT A CHILI LASAGNA.      

284
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,016
THE CHILI TASTE REALLY COMES OUT
      AND IT'S REALLY GOOD.     

285
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,018
     I'VE NEVER HAD LASAGNA     
      THAT HAD NO NOODLES.      

286
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:56,621
       THEY'RE TORTILLAS.       
(Nick) SIX LAYERS.              
   IT'S UNIQUE.                 

287
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:57,956
                     IT'S CRAZY.
IT'S GOOD.                      

288
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,958
           WHAT ELSE COULD YOU  
         POSSIBLY DO WITH CHILI?

289
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,560
