00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:02,133
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,601
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:06,538
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:08,206
          This trip...          
  Wow!                          

5
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:10,342
     ...we're hitting dishes    
     that really stack up...    

6
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:11,877
             That's ridiculous. 

7
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,012
          ...on the bun         
     and between the bread.     

8
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:15,280
            Flavortown overload.

9
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,882
     In Colorado Springs...     

10
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:18,550
                There you go.   

11
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,819
           ...a funky           
   family-owned burger stop...  

12
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,020
  Really impressed.             

13
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:24,223
      ...getting outrageous     
       with the toppings.       

14
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:25,290
     Keep an eye                
    on this one.                

15
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:26,424
       In Atlantic City...      

16
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,492
     That's just                
    what I need.                

17
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:28,961
        ...a joint rising       
    from the flood waters...    

18
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,162
       Bang.                    

19
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,497
       ...and sailing way       
     beyond basic bar food.     

20
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,299
     You're getting             
very cosmopolitan on us.        

21
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:36,168
   Plus, in Washington D.C...   

22
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:37,302
              Keeping it real.  

23
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,171
           ...big-time          
       culinary creations.      

24
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,372
             Easily four pounds.

25
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,107
         ...packed into         
       serious sandwiches.      

26
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,376
         Dude, this is, like,   
      flavor explosion over here

27
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:46,111
              in hoagie heaven. 

28
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,113
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

29
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:50,783
     on "Diners, Drive-Ins,     
           and Dives."          

30
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,396
          So, I'm here          
       in Washington D.C.,      

31
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,198
      about 10-minute walk      
       to the White House       

32
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,133
        in an area known        
        as Dupont Circle        

33
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:10,335
      to check out a joint      
   everybody's talking about,   

34
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:11,669
   where a family from Philly   

35
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:14,072
         is offering up         
     a real hoagie hotspot.     

36
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:17,843
     This is Bub and Pop's.     

37
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:19,344
                Half Italian    
             with French Onion. 

38
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,146
   The food here is fantastic.  

39
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,882
      It really is a taste      
  of Philly in Washington D.C.  

40
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:27,152
   FIERI: Brought here by chef  
   and Philly native Jon Taub,  

41
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:30,889
  who opened this joint in 2013 
    with his mom and step-dad   

42
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,892
          but named it          
   after Grandma and Grandpa.   

43
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,894
           Everybody called them
                 Bub and Pop.   
           Everybody.           

44
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,095
         What kind of restaurant
                is this?        

45
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,865
ARLENE: We're chef-driven,      
 and we cook from scratch.      

46
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,901
        His training            
is in classic French cuisine.   

47
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:44,436
          My boy tow truck here?
 Yep.                           

48
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,505
                       This guy?
    MAN: He's just brilliant    

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,906
         with the ideas         
     that he comes up with.     

50
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,775
The sandwich plays center stage.

51
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,176
             Large Jewish hoagie
                  for here.     

52
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:52,978
        The Jewish hoagie       
      is a loaded sandwich.     

53
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:56,448
     It's packed with turkey    
  and corned beef and brisket,  

54
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,450
        and it's just got       
     this delicious coleslaw    

55
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,052
          piled on top.         

56
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:02,320
       What are we making first?
The brine for our corned beef.  

57
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,456
                      Okay.     
  Water. Onion.                 

58
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,391
  Carrots. Garlic.              

59
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:07,726
    Kosher salt.                
       Celery.                  

60
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,661
     Fresh thyme.               
                       Okay.    

61
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,196
                 Honey.         
                 Thank you, sir.

62
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,598
                    [ Laughs ]  
    Thank you for this.         

63
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,998
    Appropriate spatula.        

64
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,068
          [ Laughter ]          

65
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,802
      Allspice.                 
   Coriander seed.              

66
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:19,238
                      Okay.     
      Pink salt.                

67
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,139
      Black peppercorns.        
      Dried bay leaves.         

68
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,540
      And mustard seed.         

69
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,676
  I literally just bring it     
to a boil and kill the heat.    

70
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:26,411
I let it cool down overnight.   
          So, all those flavors,

71
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,279
            they're gonna marry.
   Yep.                         

72
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,481
          Brisket's ready to go.
Mm-hmm.                         

73
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,416
      Put holes                 
all over the brisket            

74
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,418
  just so the brine             
  can seep into it.             

75
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,086
       How long are we gonna let
      it sit there in the brine?

76
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,022
   14 days.                     
                  14 days?      

77
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:38,157
      14 days.                  

78
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,624
         Then when it comes out,
           how we cooking it?   

79
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,492
        We put it in            
a roasting pan with mirepoix,   

80
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:44,029
a little bit of water,          
plastic wrap, aluminum,         

81
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,763
      and then                  
 we just braise it.             

82
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:48,566
And once it's cooled down,      
  we slice it real thin.        

83
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,836
          Okay, Thousand Island 
        is on the Jewish hoagie?

84
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,704
            Yes, sir.           
This is our homemade mayonnaise.

85
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,105
 It's basically like            
a roast garlic aioli.           

86
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:55,173
                   Okay.        

87
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:56,308
      You make your own ketchup.
Yes, sir.                       

88
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:57,643
  And these are our             
kosher dill pickles.            

89
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,244
 We make these, too.            
               Is there anything

90
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,179
               you don't make?  
We don't make the water.        

91
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,648
              Keeping it real.  

92
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,249
                    Okay,       
      let's build this sandwich.
Okay.                           

93
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,850
      So I'm gonna put          
a nice little layer of Dijon.   

94
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,053
     A little bit               
of the Thousand Island.         

95
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,388
    Swiss cheese.               
   Kosher salami.               

96
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:11,789
               We're stacking   
             this thing up, huh?

97
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:12,991
       Yep.                     

98
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,793
Homemade corned beef.           
       That melts in your mouth.

99
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,194
       Turkey breast.           
       Okay.                    

100
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,596
              There's more meat 
                  going on?     

101
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:20,065
 This is our braised brisket.   
Just a little bit of coleslaw.  

102
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,000
    Not too much.               

103
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,402
             Easily four pounds.

104
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,803
                I don't know    
                 what to do.    

105
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,606
      Just bite                 
   the top of it.               

106
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:30,942
     [ Laughs ]                 

107
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,878
      Oh, God.                  

108
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,946
   What you need?               

109
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,015
 Beer? Napkin?                  
                  Beach towel?  

110
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,751
                  Got you, man. 

111
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,753
          I love big sandwiches.
              I love hoagies.   

112
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,488
      But you guys have a whole 
    different attitude about it.

113
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,556
             It's really great. 

114
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,757
         And I love how you take
            that corned beef    

115
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,025
               and treat it     
          with all that respect.

116
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,493
                That's a real   
               tasty sandwich.  

117
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:49,761
             Good job, brother. 

118
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,496
        Mom, sandwich up.       

119
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,832
        Big sloppy mess,        
      and it's really good.     

120
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,034
I happened to run into one      
 of my buddies Stevo here       

121
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,302
who plays in the NFL.           

122
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,770
What do you think about         
  this sandwich, man?           

123
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,305
             Man, this is great.

124
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:01,907
         There's just so many   
      different flavors in here.

125
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,576
     This, to me, is kind       
of a nondescript little place.  

126
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,977
     You'd just                 
  be walking along,             

127
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:08,246
you'd pass right by it.         
             Yeah. That's true. 

128
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,449
 Here at lunchtime, it's packed 
     and it's quite crowded.    

129
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:12,117
How would you find it?          
    You'd have to be walking by.

130
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,585
              You'd have        
       to know a local, I guess.

131
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,786
              MAN:              
     Everything's fantastic.    

132
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,922
          The freshest,         
       the best, homemade.      

133
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,523
   JON: Roast pork broccoli rabe
             for here.          

134
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,058
  It's a very savory sandwich.  

135
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,459
      The gremolata sauce,      

136
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:24,863
          it just adds          
      a really nice touch.      

137
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:27,065
    What are we into now, buddy?
       This is                  
our roast pork sandwich.        

138
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,199
                Okay, this is   
                 pork belly,    

139
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,600
        so we're into porchetta,
                  baby.         

140
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,469
  Okay. I'm gonna scour         
the inside of the belly.        

141
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:34,873
  This basically is gonna let   
some of those seasonings go in. 

142
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,541
Flip the pork belly.            
                        Okay.   

143
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:38,143
            I'm gonna poke a lot
            of holes in this.   

144
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,612
   Now we're gonna rub it.      
   First thing, salt and pepper.

145
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,814
              Ground and toasted
              fennel seed.      

146
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,349
               I like the fact  
            that you toasted it.

147
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,684
   All right, this              
  is garlic confit.             

148
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,552
 This is just garlic            
 slow-cooked in oil.            

149
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:48,553
               Roasted garlic.  

150
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,088
  This is the juice             
    and the zest                

151
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,489
of one orange, one lime,        

152
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:52,691
 and one lemon.                 
                      Okay.     

153
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,960
I want to get that in everywhere
on this, all right?             

154
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,962
            Very, very serious  
          about what he's doing.

155
00:04:58,032 --> 00:04:59,297
 Very serious, Guy.             

156
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,698
      Making a sandwich --      
 I didn't know he could hear me.

157
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,033
 Picked rosemary.               
                      Okay.     

158
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,769
      Same thing with the thyme?
 Yes, sir.                      

159
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,903
  Fresh sage.                   
                      Okay.     

160
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,773
This is my favorite part.       
    Pecorino Romano.            

161
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,174
          Dude, this is like    
      flavor explosion over here

162
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,376
              in hoagie heaven. 

163
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,712
So, now we're gonna add         
    our pork loin,              

164
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,714
          and then              
we're gonna tie the porchetta   

165
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,315
so we can roast it off.         

166
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:19,917
        All right,              
now onion, carrot, celery,      

167
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,920
  black peppercorn,             
     star anise,                

168
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,855
whole garlic cloves.            
            Now a little water? 

169
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,590
           A little bit of water
           to create the au jus 

170
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,125
           Now we're gonna roast
           it up, okay?         

171
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,127
Four hours and 20 minutes.      
                         Got it.

172
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:30,595
              Then the next day,
              we rub the skin   

173
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,597
        with really good        
        olive oil, salt, pepper.

174
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,000
            And then we blast it
            in this pizza oven  

175
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,202
             at 600, 700 degrees
             until we crisp it. 

176
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:38,603
                Let it rest for 
                like 30 minuets,

177
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,871
          then we slice it down.

178
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,339
           What are we into now?

179
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:43,008
This is our hazelnut            
  gremolata sauce.              

180
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,943
     This right here,           
this is basically parsley,      

181
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,078
     olive oil, salt,           
and pepper just blended up.     

182
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:48,146
     Scallions.                 

183
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,415
     Hazelnuts,                 
roasted and crushed.            
                        Okay.   

184
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,284
               Red onion.       
               Red wine vinegar.

185
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:54,219
             Roasted jalapeño,  
             pealed and chopped.

186
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,222
   Garlic.                      
                 This is so     
             not under-seasoned.

187
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,623
             Orange, lime,      
             and lemon.         

188
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,092
        The same                
        that we put on the pork.

189
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,694
             And fried capers.  
             Voilà.             

190
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,895
             That's it, man.    

191
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,897
       [ Spoon clatters ]       

192
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,698
     [ Laughs ]                 

193
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,701
             That's ridiculous. 
 Thank you, sir.                

194
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,169
 Now we got to assemble it,     
 all right?                     

195
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,371
 Gremolata --                   

196
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:13,638
 get a nice, even amount.       
 Got the broccoli rabe in there.

197
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,106
  So you got a little bitterness
         coming in there.       

198
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:17,375
   Yep. Roast pork              
   in the au jus.               

199
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,044
 Now take the roll,             

200
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,945
and we're gonna slice           
    that bad boy.               

201
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,714
     Nice pieces                
 of sharp provolone.            

202
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:25,583
 And that's it, man.            

203
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:26,852
                Look at that.   

204
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,122
                    Wow.        
            Flavortown overload.

205
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,058
             Flavors are so big 
                and so rich.    

206
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,794
                This sandwich   
              eats like a meal. 

207
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,466
What you offer in that porchetta
  sandwich is really generous.  

208
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,268
              And I don't mean  
            in the portion size.

209
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,602
      I just mean in the effort.
                I mean,         

210
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:49,341
     it just makes you step back
     for a second and go, "Wow."

211
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,610
           The flavor           
   of the pork is phenomenal.   

212
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:55,013
  The gremolata sauce just adds 
this nutty, hearty flavor to it.

213
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,280
      MAN: If I could pick      
          my last meal,         

214
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,949
   it would be a large hoagie   
       from Bub and Pop's.      

215
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,618
Everybody talks about this place
      with such enthusiasm.     

216
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,286
            You got to stop in, 
          and you got to try it.

217
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:03,555
               You killed it.   
                Outstanding.    

218
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:06,358
     Thank you.

Those fries are gangster.       

221
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,764
      ...an out-of-the-box      
         burger spot...         

222
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:13,898
Break all the rules.

00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,368
       is standard issue.       

225
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:19,037
We're doing it all here         
at the Skirted Heifer.          

226
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,672
                 Oh, my God.    
              That is so good.  

227
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:29,147
   So, I'm here in the center   
           of it all,           

228
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,483
         right downtown         
 in Colorado Springs, Colorado, 

229
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,485
 right across from Acacia Park. 

230
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,821
   Now, I'm here to check out   
   a funky, funky burger joint  

231
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,423
     owned by a local family    

232
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,758
         that has a name        
   that you just won't forget.  

233
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,928
   This is the Skirted Heifer.  

234
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,500
            I've got the double 
          build-your-own burger.

235
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,167
   These are gourmet burgers.   

236
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:51,703
          I can't think         
       of anything better.      

237

                Gobble Gobble   
              Turkey Burger up. 

238
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,508
 I've probably gained 10 pounds 
       since they opened.       

239
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,643
             FIERI:             
     That's just since 2014,    

240
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:01,980
when long-time restaurant owners
    Kevin and Suzette Megyeri   

241
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,248
    opened this burger joint    

242
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,717
          and named it          
   after their signature item.  

243
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,652
      Ready for                 
that skirted heifer.            

244
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,721
    MAN: Real unique the way    
  they melt the cheese over it  

245
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,390
        and make it look        
   like it has a skirt on it.   

246
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,926
     How did you learn about it?
     By watching your show.     

247
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,261
                There you go.   

248
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:20,465
             FIERI:             
  But the skirt's just one page 
  in the playbook around here.  

249
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,734
  They're very unique with all  
  the different type of burgers 

250
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,002
       they come up with.       
                     All right.

          There's your Hangover.

00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,472
     It's got cream cheese.     

253
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,140
   It's got peach wood bacon.   

254
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:31,943
   And the Bloody Mary sauce.   
    It's an excellent burger.

00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,212
       FIERI:                   
So, what are we making now?     
             SUZETTE: All right.

256
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,548
             We're gonna make   
          some homemade ketchup.

257
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:39,016
Why make your own ketchup?      
            The homemade ketchup
                  is a base     

258
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,552
         for a lot              
         of our homemade sauces.

259
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:41,819
    Okay.

      old-fashioned white sugar.

          Dissolve it with      
          a little bit of water.

262
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,958
          Okay,                 
so we go on the flattop.        

263
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,893
          And then tomato puree.

264
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:51,630
               White vinegar.   
                    Salt.

00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,097
                   Garlic.      
                White pepper.   

266
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,633
   Okay, how long               
   will this cook?              
             About a half-hour. 

267
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,969
   Can I try this               
  wild concoction?              

268
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,371
             I hope you like it.

269
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,440
     Very good.                 
 It's very tomato-y.            

270
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,976
 Not quite as sweet             
as processed ketchup.           

271
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,177
     That's what                
 you're looking for.            
                         Good.  

272
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,379
           The Bloody Mary sauce
              has everything    

273
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,382
          that you would put in 
         your Bloody Mary drink.

274
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:11,849
I don't put ketchup in my --    
     except maybe vodka.        

275
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,184

   It's been nice.

      You're not light          
on the horseradish, are you?    

284
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:29,934

00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:48,553
         With our focaccia salt.
           We've got egg, too.

         Applewood smoked bacon.

442
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,814
           I candy is with      
    a little bit of maple syrup.

443
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,616
Okay.                           
        And fresh-ground pepper.

444
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:22,887
      Go in the oven 450 degrees
      for about 15 minutes.     

445
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:26,290
Looking good. All right,        
give me a breakdown here.       

446
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:27,759
                 Start off      
           with the pulled pork.

447
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,427
       Got it.                  

448
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,628
            Next we're gonna add
                the brisket.    

449
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,563
          Bring this up to temp.
Okay.                           

450
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,233
Add the mango                   
barbecue sauce.                 

451
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,701
Locally-made brioche bun.       

452
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,770
                    Yes.        
                 Pork first.    

453
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,171
              Then the brisket. 

454
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,307
        Next, the candied bacon.

455
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,111
          We're gonna top it off
             with a lime slaw.  

456
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,646
I like the little stamp         
       on there.                

457
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,615
           Our house-made fries.

458
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,654
    When I think                
about Atlantic City,            

459
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:58,656
      I do not think            
about barbecue sandwiches.      

460
00:15:58,658 --> 00:15:59,791
But I got to tell you,          

461
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,192
this would be a home            
   away from home               

462
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:05,697
      for a lot of folks        
that want some great barbecue.  

463
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,801
     Mmm. Smoked,               
nice tang, good season.         

464
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,005
Making the slaw counterbalancing
       with a little acid.      

465
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:16,273
   That's a great sandwich.     
That's a really great sandwich. 

466
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:17,542
            Thank you very much.
Well done.                      

467
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:18,810
       Barbecue three-way.      

468
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,012
    The mango barbecue sauce    
       makes the sandwich.      

469
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,546
         The maple bacon        
    that they have on there,    

470
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,015
        it kind of, like,       
   takes it to another level.   

471
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,349
        It's kind of ridiculous.

472
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:26,750
    Caramelized onion burger.   

473
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,485
  Obviously, you're gonna come  
          for the food,         

474
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,955
    but you walk in the door,   
   and you just love the vibe.  

475
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,623
         Tommy and Elvis        
     have done a great job.     

476
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,225
             FIERI:             
    Which was no small feat.    

477
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,427
         Hurricane Sandy        
    did a ton of damage here.   

478
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,563
        Three feet underwater   
    right where you're standing.

479
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:39,963
So, literally, where we're      
  standing there's water        

480
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,432
   this high?                   
                      Yes.      

481
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:42,900
              MAN:              
   They put it back together.   

482
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:44,969
           Since that,          
  everybody's been coming here. 

483
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:47,238
               And this place   
             has the best food. 

484
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,841
     ELVIS:                     
Tequila shrimp bangers up.      
  It's lightly breaded shrimp.  

485
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:51,843
        MAN: I'm not sure       
  how Elvis concocts the sauce, 

486
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:53,644
       but it's very good.      

487
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,046
Why is it tequila banger?       

488
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,981
                 The heat,      
          the tequila, the bang.

489
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,716
 Oh, so like "bang!"            
                        Yes.    

490
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,318
Got it. First we're gonna       
     make the sauce?            

491
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,452
               Gonna start off  
               with the mayo.   

492
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:03,053
              Thai chili sauce. 

493
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,856
                  Sriracha.     

494
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,323
 Little sesame oil.             
                            Yes.

495
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:08,126
                 Cayenne pepper.
                 Garlic powder. 

496
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,594
     Next up?                   
                    Tequila.    

497
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,130
  I love this sauce             
   more and more.               

498
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,932
 Adobo seasoning.               
             And a little aqua. 

499
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:17,334
                Quick whisk.    
   All right.                   

500
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,604
Let's do the shrimp.            
  We're gonna dredge the shrimp.

501
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,606
  And then we're gonna flash-fry
    them for about two minutes. 

502
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:25,143
          Spring mix tossed in  
        a raspberry vinaigrette.

503
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:28,446
 We add the tequila banger sauce
         to the shrimp.         

504
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,750
      So, it's like             
a fried shrimp cocktail.        

505
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,087
That's just what I need.        

506
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:38,823
Not too much breading.          
     Little spice.              

507
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,358
     Little kick                
out of that tequila.            

508
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,760
     And you get                
a little salad in it.           

509
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,294
It's a great presentation.      
   Well done, my friend.        

510
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,097
                      Thank you.
             ELVIS:             
     Tequila shrimp bangers.    

511
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,031
             WOMAN:             
   They're absolutely bursting  
         with flavor --         

512
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,367
       perfect zesty zing.      

513
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:52,570
  The chefs here do a great job 
    at taking normal bar food   

514
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,638
      and putting their own     
       unique twist on it.      

515
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,641
  FIERI: And putting out dishes 
      you'd normally never      

516
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:57,908
          see in a bar.         

517
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,109
       Turkey apple Brie.       

518
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:00,912
          On a cranberry walnut.

519
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,647
  A cranberry walnut?           
              Cranberry walnut. 

520
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,115
Okay, when I pull up            
  to the Vagabond,              

521
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,716
   I'm not thinking             
about any walnut bread.         

522
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,119
                      [ Laughs ]
              MAN:              
    If you're a turkey lover,   

523
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:10,054
       you can wait around      
        for Thanksgiving,       

524
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,256
   or you can come to Vagabond  
     and get this sandwich.     

525
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,891
    FIERI: When we come back.   
This better be good.            

526
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,264
FIERI: Hey, welcome back        
     to "Triple D."             

527
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,932
  Hanging out here              
  in Atlantic City,             

528
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,734
right down the street           
   from the strip               

529
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,869
where my restaurant is          

530
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:26,804
    to check out                
  a guy named Elvis             

531
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,539
  that owns a joint             
 called the Vagabond            

532
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,541
  that was flooded              
 in Hurricane Sandy.            

533
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,411
     This place underwater.     
         It was closed.         

534
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:34,545
              MAN:              
    And they brought it back    

535
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:37,081
         and really made        
    a nice place to hang at.    

536
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,984
 The best local spot            
here in AC, for sure.           

537
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,020
Favorite thing on the menu?     

538
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,355
             Turkey apple Brie, 
                 hands down.    
 Seriously?                     

539
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:45,689
                  Oh, yeah.     

540
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,225
  Turkey apple Brie             
   in the window.               

541
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,027
   It's like a gourmet grilled  
   turkey and cheese sandwich.  

542
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:52,296
      It's on a nice walnut     
        cranberry bread.        

543
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,899
        Smokey pepper jam       
     brings out the flavor.     

544
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:55,900
         It's very good.        

545
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:58,102
          The turkey apple Brie.

546
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,970
Oh, so now we're just gonna     
  get down to some Brie.        

547
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,505
           Just some Brie, yeah.

548
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,541
            So we're gonna make 
          the smokey pepper jam.

549
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,576
Let's get it.                   
                 Raspberry jam. 

550
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:06,710
                 Sriracha.      

551
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:07,778
     You're not mild            
on the spice around here.       

552
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:10,247
   Very good.                   
            Apple cider vinegar.

553
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,383
             Crushed red pepper.
  Little chili powder?          

554
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,051
              Just gonna whisk  
               this together.   

555
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:15,652
      Step one.                 
    What's next?                

556
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,054
       Turkey breast -- skin on.

557
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,190
       And we're gonna start off
        with some kosher salt.  

558
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,324
                Rub it down.    
   Next?                        

559
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,658
   Fresh pepper.                

560
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:22,927
    Little water?               

561
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:26,063
                Little aqua.    
                Cover it up.    

562
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:27,932
                In the oven,    
             350 for four hours.

563
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,267
       Got it.                  

564
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:30,867
       Okay.                    

565
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:32,436
                 So, next       
           we're gonna start off

566
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:35,473
                with butter,    
            turkey on the grill.

567
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:36,741
       Okay.                    

568
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:40,210
              A few slices      
         of Granny Smith apples.

569
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:41,345
                Brie cheese.    

570
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,080
   And you're getting           
very cosmopolitan on us.        

571
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,349
          This is my version of 
          Thanksgiving, I guess,
          all year long.        

572
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,218
          Cranberry walnut toast
              off the grill.    

573
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:48,419
    Gorgeous.                   
                 Top it off     

574
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,087
       with a little bit        
       of the smokey pepper jam.

575
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:52,356
   And top that off             
   with the oven-roasted turkey,

576
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:55,359
        the Granny Smith apples,
        and the Brie cheese.    

577
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,661
 Look at this thing.            

578
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,234
It's a Thanksgiving sandwich,   
     I mean, completely.        

579
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:05,403
You get a lot of Brie           
 right off the bat.             

580
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,307
    Apple's still               
  nice and tender.              

581
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:12,977
     Turkey's not dry.          
Nice acidity from the jam.      

582
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:17,982
 Spot-on.                       
              Turkey apple Brie.

583
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,917
         It's delicious.        
          It really is.         

584
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,586
       Very creative twist      
      on a turkey sandwich.     

585
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,120
                 Pick up --     
                  table 61.     

586
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,655
  It's a great friendly place.  

587
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,291
  If you're coming to hang out, 
you're probably gonna come back.

588
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,795
Show me a little texture,       
    a little culture            

589
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,797
      of AC, this is            
where you come to find it.      

590
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:34,798
           Absolutely.          
                     Absolutely.

591
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,400
              Nicely done, guys.

592
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,669
 So, that's it for this edition 

593
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,270
     of "Diners, Drive-Ins,     
           and Dives."

         I'll be looking        
        for you next time       

597
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,946
     on "Diners, Drive-Ins,     
           and Dives."          

598
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,080
      You see?                  

599
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,883
                Oh, I've got    
             a few more tricks. 

600
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:55,953
           But I have gloves on,
                   so...        

601
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,022
Oh, I'd give anything           
      for that.
