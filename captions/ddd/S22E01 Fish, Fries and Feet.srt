       FIERI: Which means       
       putting that smoker      

338
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:28,078
  to use on one of his southern 
      seafood specialties.      

339
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:30,214
      WOMAN: A catfish cake     
       of collard greens.       

340
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,550
   Mike does an incredible job  
          with catfish.         

341
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:35,153
  WOMAN #2: Just when you bite  
     into the catfish cake,     

342
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,155
      it's a little crunchy     
         on the outside,        

343
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,191
   and then you can just taste  
  the vegetables on the inside. 

344
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:42,961
Now we're into making...        

345
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:44,895
      Smoked catfish cakes.     
 Let's get into it.             

346
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:51,235
Onion, celery, fresh red pepper,
        poblano chilies.        

347
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:54,038
               You want a nice  
               smoked catfish.  

348
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,775
      I like 'em kind of chunky.

349
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,176
               Into the bowl.   

350
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,644
All right, so we're loaded up   
        with catfish.           

351
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:03,047
     We've got ground coriander,
     black pepper, dried basil, 

352
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:07,986
    ground cumin, a little salt,
     Creole mustard, mayonnaise,

353
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,787
              and add a couple  
                of egg yolks.   

354
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,656
 Are we gonna bring             
   the veg in now?              

355
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:14,259
             That'd be awesome. 

356
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:15,994
   So, there we go.             
We put it all together.         

357
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,862
      Break it down,            
still leaving some texture.     

358
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,196
                  Yeah,         
         I like the nice chunks.

359
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,532
  Yeah, all right.              
 Put this together.             

360
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:21,733
Are we gonna do this            
      in a pan?                 

361
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,601
    We're gonna build that right
          on the flat top.      

362
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,136
And what's this gonna get       
      served with?              

363
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,672
         Organic collard greens.

364
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,874
Gonna use any pig fat           
      in there?                 
                        Yep.    

365
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,077
      A little tarragon vinegar,
              some onion.       
Nice.                           

366
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:36,548
   Dark brown sugar, fat cap off
     the smoked pork shoulder.  

367
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:37,481
    And how long                
are those gonna cook?           

368
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:38,950
                 45 minutes.    

369
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,119
       Dig it.                  

370
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,022
Here's the cornbread.           

371
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:48,226
               Now the greens.  

372
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:49,794
A little of the remoulade.      

373
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:52,797
                    Wow.        

374
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,037
                    Mmm.        

375
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,172
       Delicious greens, tender,

376
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,573
        and they got a nice bite
                 to 'em,        

377
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,441
   a little bit of that tarragon
      vinegar coming through.   

378
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:08,446
 Those are just humongous chunks
           of catfish.          

379
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,784
               It's delicate.   
              It's big flavor.  

380
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:13,918
          You couldn't make that
                any better.     

381
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,453
It's absolutely my favorite     
    thing to eat here.          

382
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,322
       That's about as real deal
             as it comes.       

383
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:18,189
Thank you.                      
               Well played.     

384
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:22,526
   The catfish is really juicy  
           and meaty.           

385
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:25,797
 They do an incredible job here 
    with the collard greens.    

386
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,999
They get some of the smoked meat
            mixed in.           

387
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,600

  WOMAN: If somebody's visiting 
      here the first time,      

389
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:32,470
 this is the place that we like 
        to bring them to.       

390
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,907
         You just leave         
     in a good mood, always.    

391
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,141
       You put a lot of yourself
               in this.         

392
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,143
I want to put it on a plate     
like I'd like to eat it.        

393
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,979
               Nice job, man.   
                Really nice.

  Atlantic City, New Jersey...  

395
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:46,885
            Let's jump in there.

00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,153

      some new discoveries.     

397
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,220
              You eat the skin  
               and everything?  

398
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,889
   We eat it all.               
  You suck it down.

00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,290
     From a southern turkey     
          specialty...          

400
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,492
          This is the first time
            I've ever seen it.  

401
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,561
 ...to my trial run at trotters.

402
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:57,829
           I just wrapped it up 
           with some pigs' feet.

403
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:58,930
       I'm sorry, some trotters.

404
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,907
     Got to love coming down    
        to Atlantic City.       

405
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:11,242
  Always a good time down here, 

406
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,444
    and I'm about a mile away   
       from the boardwalk,      

407
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,513
    also where my restaurant,   
       The Chophouse, is,       

408
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:18,316
  to check out what I hear is a 
 real-deal southern restaurant. 

409
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:21,019
     This is Kelsey & Kim's     
         Southern Café.         

410
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,590
   It's just all-around good.   

411
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,526
    Fried white meat chicken.   

412

   Put the soul in soul food.   

413
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,395
              MAN:              
  Rib over waffle and chicken!  

414
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:32,864
           So, this is my buddy,
                  Robert.       

415
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,432
              He's the valet    
           at the Bally's Hotel,

416
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,000
                actually,       
         where my restaurant is.

417
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:37,701
               This guy's been  
              doing it forever. 

418
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,136
          He's saying this place
                 is legit.      

419
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,138
Kelsey's number one.

        down here in '09.       

426

There's all kind of flavors just
   coming out of that kitchen.

428
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,756
   How do you describe soul food
       restaurant to people?    

429
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,292
Food that you was raised up on  
like collard greens,            

430
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,294

           What's a turkey chop?

432
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,763
        Freeze                  
a whole turkey breast,          

433
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,499
 and slice it down on a band saw
         and make chops.        

434
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,634
   Okay, I have been in the food
       business all my life.    

435
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:11,836
       I mean, that's all I know

436
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,637
            is how to cook      
      and how to do restaurants.

437
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:14,772
             I have never heard 
               of turkey chop.

   a turkey chop?

     Did you try                
  the turkey chop?

             She's not sharing.

She doesn't look like           

445
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,783
she has such a small,           
petite portion, either.

      one of my favorites.

for the turkey chop.

449
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:33,390

We're gonna brown our roux.     

452
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:36,994
              All right,        
       we're getting this going.

453
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:40,331
Onions, gonna whisk that        
      in real good.             

454
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,533
 Now we're gonna add            
 our chicken stock.             

455
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:43,934
                 So, there's    
              the gravy for it. 

456
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,269
       Gonna add                
a little black pepper.          

457
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:48,606
   And a little kitchen bouquet,
      some nice color. Okay.    

458
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,342
    Next up, time for the turkey
       chop, and that is, man.  

459
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,343
                You're right.   

460
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,477
 Now we're gonna do             
   our seasoning.               

461
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,946
A little seasoned salt,         
  granulated garlic,            

462
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:58,282
  Cajun seasoning,              
  and black pepper.             

463
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,483
                   Gotcha.      

464
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,952
Mix it nice and good,           
add it to the flour.            

465
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:04,288
                   Gotcha.      

466
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,890
               And that's it.   
            No wash or anything,

467
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:07,358
     just putting a little light
           coating on 'em.      

468
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,493
Light, nice little coating      
          on 'em.               

469
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:09,760
  And they're ready             
   for the fryer.               

470
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:11,095
                   Dig it.      

471
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,896
         How long they cook for?

472
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,899
   3 to 5 minutes               
    in the fryer.               

473
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:20,304
Now we can sauté our onions     
and our turkey chops.           

474
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,706
    Now we add some of          
our homemade gravy we made.     

475
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,641
     Sure love your onions, man.

476
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:25,843
Yeah, nice onion flavor.        

477
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,578
   Let that simmer              
    for a minute.               

478
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,712
  And they're ready             
    to be served.               

479
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:31,249
  Some rice pilaf,              
    string beans.               

480
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:36,254
Smothered turkey chops.         

481
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:41,191
       Mmm. That's the real deal
         right there, brother.  

482
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,860
                 Tastes like    
             a light pork chop. 

483
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:45,596
                    Mmm.        

484
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:48,065
    Breading's not too heavy,   
nice little bit of onion flavor.

485
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,667
        You do like your onions.
Yes.                            

486
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,137
               Mmm, nice job.   

487
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,472
          This is the first time
            I've ever seen it.  

488
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,808
            Nicely done, Kels.  
Thank you.                      

489
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,408
             WOMAN:             
     Smothered turkey chops.    

490
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:01,145
 The turkey chops are very good,
          very tender.          

491
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,280
   The smothered gravy brings   
      everything together.      

492
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,349
    I love the onions on it.    
      They're really great.     

493
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:08,685
    It's just to perfection.    
Kelsey & Kim's is where it's at.

494
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,755
        Liver and onions        
    and a fried onion entrée!   

495
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,556
       They just give you       
        so many options.        

496
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,025
    I loved the candied yams,   

497
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
   black-eyed peas over rice.   

498
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,763
             FIERI:             
   And one soul-food specialty  

499
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,865
that just dances on your tongue?

500
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,633
      MAN: Trotter platter!     

501
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:23,767
   The trotters are pig feet.   

502
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,102
       They're delicious.       

503
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:25,970
              You eat trotters? 

504
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:26,971
     Absolutely,                
   grew up on it.               

505
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,639
                 Here we go.    

506
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,107
       You call 'em trotters,   
     or you call 'em pigs' feet?

507
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,642
  The same thing --             
 pig feet, trotters.            

508
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,512
      Gonna have some pigs' feet
       on "Triple D," trotters. 

509
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:35,646
              How do we do it?  

510
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,114
   First you start off          
with some clean pig feet.       

511
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,783
                  Good idea     
            on the "clean" part.

512
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:39,984
  Got to clean 'em.             
 Cut in half, split.            

513
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:43,054
I'm just gonna parboil 'em.     
We gonna start 'em up.          

514
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:44,255
     How long are they gonna go?

515
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,123
Cook 'em like this for like     
45 minutes to an hour.          

516
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,725
            Drain the water off.

517
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,059
             So, that takes all 
             the impurities out.

518
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,727
    There you go.               
                         Got it.

519
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:53,331
Now we're gonna start off       
with some nice ham stock.       

520
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,198
Add some celery in here.        

521
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,466
                Eat the skins   
               and everything?  

522
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,000
   You eat it all.              
  You suck it down.             

523
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,870
A little chopped garlic,        
a little crushed red pepper.    

524
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,071
I like a little spice.          

525
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,207
    Okay, guess what we're gonna
            put in next.        

526
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,942
   Onion, mm-hmm.               

527
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:06,477
Then we're gonna throw in       
   some green peppers,          

528
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,879
 and then finish off            
 with some vinegar.             

529
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:12,082
And we're gonna let these cook  
for, like, another hour,        

530
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:14,085
hour and a half until           
the trotters get tender.        

531
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,686
  Bam, they ready.              

532
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,155
              Was that a "bam"  
                you just did?   

533
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,089
          I'm gonna call Emeril.
[ Laughs ]                      

534
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,926
The trotters are nice           
     and tender.                

535
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,764
            I've had pig tails, 
           pig ears, headcheese.

536
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,232
               I've had snout.  

537
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,234
          I think I've had      
    about every part of the pig,

538
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,169
and, ooh, you're just loading it
         up, aren't you?        

539
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:35,173
                I'm gonna get   
             some of the stock. 

540
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,908
                Nothing like    
            a little foot juice.

541
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:38,843
    There you go.               

542
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,913
   Wasn't Kevin Bacon in a movie
        called "Footjuice"?     

543
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,650
    Some parsley.               

544
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,585
             Just jump in there.

545
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,620
That piece right there.         

546
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,658
                     Oh.        

547
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,793
            They're delicious.  
Yes, they are.                  

548
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:59,130
      Tastes like pork butt.    
  Kind of got that same texture.

549
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:00,130
       Mm-hmm.                  

550
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,199
                     Mm.        
             It's super tender. 

551
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,868
     The broth is great with it.
       They're dynamite, man.   

552
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:07,071
      I've enjoyed all the parts
       of the pig now, I think. 

553
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,006
           I just wrapped it up 
           with some pigs' feet.

554
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,007
       I'm sorry, some trotters.

555
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,074
   Some trotters.               

556
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,209
Here's your trotters.           

557
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,812
             Spices,            
 everything is done just right. 

558
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,548
  Just the texture, the taste.  
     You can't mess up here.    

559
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,217
         Order up,              
smothered liver and onions!     

560
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:21,619
 A little off the beaten track, 
     but it's worth finding.    

561
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:24,088
           Soul food,           
   it brings people together.   

562
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,424
       Everybody's family.      
We appreciate all our customers.

563
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,693
 I think that's just how you are
          as a person,          

564
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,429

      coming over for dinner.

00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:32,630
     That's me.                 

566
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,465
                  Good man.     
              Enjoyed it, man.  

567
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:38,435
        So, that's it for       
   this Flavortown road trip,   

568
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:39,970
      but don't you worry.      

569
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:41,772
   There's plenty more joints   
     all over this country!     

570
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,173
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

571
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,043
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

572
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,644
             Doctor?            

573
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,580
          [ Laughter ]          

574
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,449
             Doctor?            

575
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,520
          [ Laughter ]
