WHO GETS THIS FUN JOB?

           (laughter)           

250
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:15,086
       THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR  
    MAKING FUN OF MY POPEYE ARM.

251
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,888
(laughs) AHH!                   

252
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,692
        NOW WE HAVE TO SALT IT, 
       THEN WE HAVE TO TASTE IT.

253
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:23,028
WOW. THAT TOASTED

254
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,763
            SO NOW WE HAVE TO DO
                 THE CURRY.     

255
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:28,499
CHICKPEAS. OH, HANDS DOWN,      
   ONE OF MY FAVORITES.         

256
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,967

257
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,636
"GET MORE VEGETARIAN            
  INTO THIS KID?"               

258
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,237
    WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?       
IS THAT LIKE AN INTERVENTION?   

259
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,306

260
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,708
           I CAN'T TELL YOU.    
       YOUR MOM MADE ME PROMISE.

262
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,645

ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.            

263
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,313
                GONNA SOAK THESE
                   OVERNIGHT.   

264
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,450
        WATER. GARLIC. CILANTRO.
              FRESH THYME.      

265
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,318
A LOT OF THE SAME CHARACTERS.   
                 CHOPPED ONIONS.

266
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,388
        SCALLIONS. BAKING POWDER
              TO SOFTEN IT.     

267
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,457
    A LITTLE BIT OF SOYBEAN OIL.
        MIX IT ALL TOGETHER.    
LET IT--LET IT SIT OVERNIGHT.   

268
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,393
       AND THEN POP IT          
IN THE PRESSURE COOKER FOR...   

269
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,728
                     25 MINUTES.
GOT IT.                         

270
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,330
           SO THIS IS MY SPECIAL
              BLEND OF CURRY.   

271
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,532
        ADD SOME GARLIC. ONIONS.
 MMM!                           

272
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,802
                 CILANTRO.      
          THEN WE ADD THE WATER.

273
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,870
             GONNA MAKE A LITTLE
                PASTE WITH IT.  
 MMM!                           

274
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,538
CHICKPEAS ARE GOOD.             

275
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,141
          SO NOW WE ADD THE OIL.
WHOA!                           

276
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,077
    GETTIN' ALL                 
WITCH DOCTOR ON ME.             
                        (laughs)

277
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,344
I DIG IT.                       

278
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,813
      YOU HAVE TO LET THE WATER,
         UM, ABSORB IN THERE,   

279
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,281
                  AND THAT COOKS
                 THE CURRY DOWN.

280
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,150
              CURRY CAN ACTUALLY
                  TASTE RAW.    

281
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,485
OH, I'VE HAD IT RAW             
  TOO MANY TIMES.               
                           YEAH.

282
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,021
      WE ADD THE GARBANZO BEANS,
               OR CHANA.        

283
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,489
OH, IT SMELLS GREAT!            

284
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,424
         THESE ARE RAW POTATOES,
                  AND--         
OH, MY GOODNESS.                

285
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,961
                 ADD SOME WATER.
    ALL THE FLAVOR              
GETS ABSORBED INTO IT.          

286
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,296
AWESOME.                        

287
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,164
        WE'LL LET THAT COOK DOWN
          FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES. 

288
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,166
            SO THIS IS THE DOUGH
               THAT I NEEDED.   

289
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,035
                 MAKE IT INTO   
              LITTLE DOUGHBALLS.

290
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:39,570
       OPEN IT OUT A LITTLE BIT.
WHAT'S IN THE DOUGH?            

291
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,106
            BAKING POWDER, SALT,
                 AND SUGAR.     

292
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,710
   WE'RE MAKING A WELL SO WE CAN
    DO THE FILLING OF THE DHAL. 

293
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,712
            WE PULL IT TOGETHER.
OH, LOOK AT THAT LITTLE         
   TWIST THE BASKET.            

294
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:48,713
                    THERE WE GO.

295
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,381
             AND NOW WE'RE GONNA
                ROLL THAT OUT.  

296
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,117
                THAT'S HISTORY  
              RIGHT THERE, BABY.

297
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:55,320
THAT CAME FROM TRINIDAD.        
THAT'S OVER 30 YEARS OLD.       

298
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,722
ROLL IT.                        
                 GENTLY, WITHOUT
                   POPPING IT.  

299
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,058
                    OH, MY GOSH.
AND YOU STRETCH.                

300
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,262
         JUST STRETCHING IT OUT.

301
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,132
   SO NOW WE HAVE TO TAKE IT    
         TO THE TOWER.          

302
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:08,933
      FIRST WE HAVE TO OIL      
           THE TOWER.           

303
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,401
I GOTTA GET ONE OF THOSE.       

304
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,870
        NOW WE SLAP IT ON THERE.

305
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:12,937
OHH!                            

306
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,806
TORTILLA PIZZA DOUGH            
     GONE WILD.

00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,376
            THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW
              YOU NEED TO TURN. 

309
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,078
WHERE HAS THIS BEEN             
   ALL MY LIFE?                 

310

IS THIS VEGAN?                  
                            YES.

312

459
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:54,645
         CRUSHED RED PEPPER.    
     THEN ADD SOME YELLOW CURRY.

460
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,581
          SALT. AND A LITTLE BIT
                OF PEPPER.

EVERYTHING TOGETHER.            

464
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,722
 THAT KIND OF WORKS             
AS THE BINDER ITSELF.           
                  IT DOES. YEAH.

465
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,724

A LITTLE TIME TO SET UP.        

466
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:09,527
 I'M GONNA PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE,
  WE'RE GONNA KEEP IT OVERNIGHT.
OKAY.

           (sizzling)           

469
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,065
LET IT START TO CRUST UP        

470
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,601
SO IT STAYS TOGETHER.           
                          RIGHT.

471
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:18,636
      (sizzling continues)      

472
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,806

     OF THE SPICE.              

477
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,891
  PROBABLY THE UNDERLYING TONE  
OF THE WHOLE THING IS THE CURRY.

478
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,292
                          RIGHT.
MMM!                            

479

      THE GARLIC...             

482
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,505
(mouth full) JUST A LITTLE BIT  
   OF HONEY. CAN'T BEAT IT.     

483
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:55,706

    JIMMIE VAUGHAN              
SITTING AT THE COUNTER.

               QUAIL AND EGGS.  

494
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,860
QUAIL YOU DON'T GET EVERYWHERE, 
   SO IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS   

495
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:18,262
         TO COME HERE.          
  IT'S LIKE A BETTER CHICKEN.

              UH, WE'RE GONNA DO

498
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:23,868
         SOME HOMEMADE BISCUITS 
       FROM SCRATCH--BUTTERMILK.

499
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,670
     IF YOU DON'T MAKE          
A SCRATCH-MADE BISCUIT HERE,    

500
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:27,671
YOU PROBABLY GET                
RUN OUT OF TOWN.                
                        EXACTLY.

501
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,874
    I SAW THAT POSTER.          
OKAY, GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN.      

502
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:32,343
                  UNBLEACHED    
             ORGANIC FLOUR HERE.
OF COURSE.                      

503
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:36,347
 I'M GONNA ADD MY BAKING POWDER.
       BAKING SODA. SUGAR.      

504
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,616
                 SALT. GONNA ADD
                MY BUTTER CUBES.

505
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,219
  AND THAT'S SO WE DIVERSIFY    
THE FAT THROUGHOUT THE BISCUIT  

506
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:43,020
SO YOU GET THE FLAKINESS.       
                        CORRECT.

507
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,688
                  MASH IT UP    
              JUST A LITTLE BIT.

508
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,824
BUT NOT ENOUGH THAT YOU         
START TO BREAK IT DOWN.         

509
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:50,361
 IF YOU MELT THAT BUTTER, YOU   
JUST DON'T GET THAT SEPARATION. 

510
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,362
                        EXACTLY.
OKAY.                           

511
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,765
               NOW I'M GONNA ADD
                 MY BUTTERMILK. 

512
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,101
                 MIXING THAT UP.
        (clattering)            

513
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,569
      GONNA FLIP THIS BOWL OVER.

514
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,038
  WE'LL GET IT                  
HAND-PATTIED OUT                

515
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,306
AND START HITTING IT            
    WITH THE...                 

516
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:06,043
(makes whooshing sounds)        

517
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,179
                  LINING 'EM UP.
                    ALL RIGHT.  

518
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,780
400. HOW LONG?                  

519
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,982
               ABOUT 20 MINUTES.
                 HOT AND FAST.  

520
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,184
WHAT ARE WE MAKING?             

521
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:15,586
               DOING SOME QUAIL.
BIRD IS THE WORD.               

522
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,721
MOST TIMES WHEN I COME TO TEXAS,
     I CAN GET GOOD QUAIL.      

523
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,590
             GONNA GRILL SOME   
         ON THE GRILL RIGHT NOW.

524
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,725
             SALT AND PEPPER IT.
        (sizzling)              

525
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,327
ALL RIGHT, SO THE BISCUITS      
        ARE DOWN.               

526
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,795
THE QUAIL'S COOKING.            
    WHAT'S NEXT?                

527
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,129
                  I JUST PULLED 
                MY POACHED EGGS.

528
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,799
 NOTHING I LIKE MORE THAN       
PULLING SOME POACHED EGGS.      

529
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,535
        MY FRESH BAKED BISCUITS.

530
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,806
                  TAKE THAT OUT.

531
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,608
IS THIS A STAPLE?               
                 AT THE COUNTER?

532
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,809
YEAH.                           
                       OH, YEAH.

533
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,077
                 QUAIL AND EGGS.
