1
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,068
   Hey, there. I'm Guy Fieri,   
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,803
      looking for America's     
        greatest diners,        

3
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:06,538
           drive-ins,           
           and dives.           

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,540
          This trip...          
Drop the clutch.                

5
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:11,210
...we're taking an eclectic road
         to Flavortown.         

6
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:13,145
                 I just want    
               to eat it all.   

7
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:15,480
        With some twists        
    and turns along the way.    

8
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:16,815
              I'm doing exactly 
             what you're doing. 

9
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:17,816
                  You gotta     
               be kidding me.   

10
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,485
       Like a decades-old       
         family joint...        

11
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:21,153
         Mm!                    
  You'll love this.             

12
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:24,289
    ...cooking classic Creole   
   right in the heart of L.A.   

13
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,358
It's like a little hidden       
gem in the neighborhood.        
                           Yeah.

14
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,826
  And a Minneapolis butcher...  

15
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:31,229
The turkey was dynamite,        
but the pastrami is legit.      

16
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,898
      ...cranking out cold      
      cuts minus the meat.      

17
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,700
   I'm impressed.               
    I'm trippin'.               

18
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,770
         And in Maui...         
              Getting after it, 
                 aren't ya?     

19
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:40,039
   ...a funky noodle joint...   
                 Delicious.     

20
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,440
                   Really,      
              really delicious. 

21
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:44,442
     ...serving up something    
   that just rocked my world.   

22
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,912
                    Whoa!       
                New favorite!   

23
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:49,114
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

24
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:52,017
 on "Diners, Drive-ins & Dives."

25
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:06,731
         You know how I         
      always say slow down      

26
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,266
     and take a look around?    

27
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,668
   Well, that might not apply   
          for this next         

28
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,069
      "Triple D" location.      

29
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,337
   Well, unless you're in Maui  

30
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,473
      over on the west side     
           in Lahaina.          

31
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:16,475
      And you happen to be      
   driving through some random  

32
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:17,843
        industrial park,        

33
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,344
       and you're looking       
      for a fantastic place     

34
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:21,213
       that scratch makes       
       all their noodles.       

35
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:24,016
    Well, then you're in luck   
  because this is Star Noodle.  

36
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,555
 How's that                     
  frijole?                      
              It's just got it, 
                  you know.     

37
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:31,023
             It's just amazing. 

38
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:33,025
          Picking up            
         kimchi wings.          
                          I love
                     this place.

39
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:34,693
               One of the best  
      restaurants in the island.

40
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:37,295
    Hey, guys. Bacon and eggs   
          here for you.         

41
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,364
         When we arrive,        
       it's kind of unpack      

42
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,166
    and rush to Star Noodle.    

43
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,701
    FIERI: But it's not just    
          for tourists.         

44
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:45,170
       When Michael Moore       
         opened in 2010,        

45
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:47,372
       he knew how to draw      
     in the locals, as well.    

46
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:50,709
We wanted food that local people
          especially knew about,

47
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,978
         but we try to amp it up
                a little bit.   

48
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:55,514
               I need tempura.  

49
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:58,183
   Asian-inspired,              
Island, Pacific Rim.            

50
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,518
                You have the    
             "Hapa Ramen" here. 

51
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,854
      The ramen                 
    is wonderful.               

52
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,190
         The pork inside        
           is tender.           

53
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,791
                And they make   
             their own noodles. 

54
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,261
   FIERI: Chef Ivan Pahk preps  
     the scratch-made dough,    

55
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:13,065
 and Lorilei Aloha Aguiar fires 
       up the 80-year-old       

56
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:15,267
    Japanese noodle machine.    

57
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:16,935
         Oh, I want one.        

58
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:17,936
  FIERI: All right,             
 let's get into it.             

59
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,605
                 Over here,     
             we just have water.

60
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:21,607
                 Egg whites,    
                salt, sugar,    

61
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,208
                and potassium   
                 carbonate.     

62
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,411
  That's gonna give it the chew,
             that stretchy part.

63
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,880
All right, Lori, he got me      
through the real difficult part 

64
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,482
      of mixing                 
everything together.            

65
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,483
                  Oh, totally.  
       But now                  
       he says                  

66
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,018
    that the pro                
   has to come in.              

67
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,686
           So you take the flour
           and the wheat gluten,

68
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,623
           put it in the hopper,
                 turn it on.    

69
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,291
Drop the clutch.                
                Pour the liquid.

70
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,560
Okay, so everything's in there. 
How long is that gonna mix?     

71
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:44,163
      Three minutes. Then we put
    the crumbles in the sheeter.

72
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,830
              We got the gauges 
                  all good.     

73
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,765
      Organize                  
 the flux capacitor.            

74
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,169
             And then we roll it
        through to make a sheet,

75
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:52,104
           and we put it back up
                on the roll.    

76
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:53,839
And then we're gonna go         
into the cutting process.       

77
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,375
                     Mm-hmm.    
That's beautiful.               

78
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:59,110
Let's go cook those, Chef.      
     You ready?                 
             Yep.               

79
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,912
  So we're gonna brine the pork 
       for the Hapa Ramen.      

80
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:05,650
Water. Garlic. Maui onion, salt,
       green onion palms.       

81
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,520
    Peppercorns,                
 brown sugar, honey,            

82
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,657
  bay leaf, ginger,             
   and lemongrass.              

83
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,391
                     Oh.        
     Bring this                 
     to a boil.                 

84
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,993
                          Okay  
   And then we'll               
pour it right in here.          

85
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,394
      Shock it.                 

86
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,397
 After we shock it,             
then we squeeze the lemon,      

87
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:21,066
     and we pour                
    it right in.                

88
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:22,934
      And this is gonna marinate
                for 24 hours?   

89
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,469
  24 hours.                     
                   Then we      
                roast it off.   

90
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:25,938
   375 for 1 hour.              

91
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,672
  Then we cover it,             
then 300 for another 2 hours.   

92
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,341
          And then low and slow.
                   Got it.      

93
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,809
                 Okay, Chef.    
         Roasted cold pork butt.

94
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,544
   Break it apart,              
we cut it into chunks.          

95
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,946
              And we want a lot 
                of that fat.    

96
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,615
                 That's part    
                of the deal.    

97
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,283
 Enriches the dish.             

98
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,684
So then we resteam it.          

99
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,154
           Okay. Next up, that's
         the ramen that we made.

100
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:45,757
    Yeah.                       
              Now we take some  
            of the steamed pork.

101
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,492
  In the broth, oh.             

102
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,560
               And then we get  
               some kamaboko.   

103
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,829
And what is kamaboko?           
     Fish cake?                 
                     Fish cake. 

104
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:52,898
                Bamboo shoots   
             that we stewed down

105
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,433
                in soy sauce    
                 and dashi.     

106
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:55,701
     Okay.                      
                   A bunch      
               of green onion.  

107
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,502
    Some blanched               
      bok choy.                 

108
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:00,038
         And then your favorite.
             A soft-boiled egg. 

109
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,240
 Yeah, you're                   
real funny, Chef.               
                    [ Laughs ]  

110
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,642
   And then we put              
   the pork stock.              

111
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,911
So the pork stock is            
an emulsification of fat.       

112
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,379
 We got pork bones,             
a bunch of vegetables,          

113
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:08,913
    some apples,                
  Chinese cabbage.              

114
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,116
             You pour it -- Oh! 

115
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,251
               Two more things  
          we gotta put on there.

116
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,787
    The aka miso, which is miso,
                some soybean,   

117
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,122
                 some sugar,    
              we cook it down.  

118
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:20,792
    And then we have mayu, which
     is garlic and sesame paste.

119
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,428
That's our signature            
  bowl of noodles.              

120
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:31,736
       It's a funky little joint
             next to a boatyard,

121
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,305
              and you're making 
             this kind of food. 

122
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,075
                 Delicious.     
       Really, really delicious.

123
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,744
             I love the noodles.
             Fantastic texture. 

124
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,880
          I love all the goodies
       that you put along there,

125
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:45,817
the bamboo shoots, the bok choy.
             The pork is great. 

126
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,619
                It's tender,    
               a little fatty,  

127
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,154
               lots of flavor   
                   in it.       

128
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:52,891
        But that broth, homey --
                 outrageous.    

129
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,158
          Pick up Hapa.         

130
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,963
So many different explosions    
of flavor mixed together.       

131
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:01,166
      I just want to eat it all,
                but I can't.    

132
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,567
               I'll be asleep.  

133
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:03,835
              There's more show 
                   to do.

   And more menu to dig into.

        Vietnamese crepe.       

136
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,240
        Pork                    
with shrimp mixture.            

137
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:11,376
  Super-good herbs,             
a really nice crunch.           

138
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,378
       Crepes in an Asian       
          noodle joint?         

139
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,514
      Now, that's something     
          I gotta try,          

140
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,215
       when we come back.       

141
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,557
                Welcome back.   
          We're hanging out here

142
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,159
              on the west side  
                   of Maui      

143
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,827
              at a funky joint  
             called Star Noodle.

144
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,363
 Now, I can guarantee, you would
        never drive by the place

145
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,164
             'cause it's kind of
            on the dead-end side

146
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,233
          of an industrial park.
Mm-hmm.                         

147
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:37,035
             So you will need to
   get directions, but trust me.

148
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,904
             It is so worth it. 

149
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:42,040
    Lots of different flavors   
 to try every time you come in. 

150
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,575
          We have our Vietnamese
                 crepe here.    

151
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,645
The Vietnamese crepe            
probably are our favorite.      

152
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:49,180
           The inside           
       is pork and shrimp,      

153
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,383
         and the outside        
       is a crunchy shell.      

154

out of it with lovely herbs.    

155
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,054
   It's delicious.              

156
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,389
                   Get after it,
                       Chef.    
     So, we got                 
   some hot water,              

157
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,791
      and then                  
  some rice flour.              

158
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,193
           So, that'll batter up
  pretty good right off the bat.

159
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,995
Then got some cold water,       
     some salt.                 

160
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:04,863
   Turmeric.                    
                  Turmeric.     

161
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,197
                 Really nice    
               color in this.

163
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,335
   And then we got              
   some limestone.              

164
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,202
                  Limestone?    
   Limestone.                   

165
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,337
      It makes                  
  it super crispy.              

166
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,805
  Then we're gonna              
 immersion-blend it.            

167
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,875
So we got a hot pan.            

168
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,943
So, while that's cooking,       
we're gonna do the filling.     

169
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,345
      So we get                 
   some loco pork.              

170
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,213
               Some loco pork?  
   Mm-hmm.

  What are you putting in there,
     before it burns both of us?

175
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,955
The shallow fry.

                 in the pan,    

179
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,162
              which that batter 
              has a ton of it,  

180
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,432
              and then you add  
        some more hot oil to it,

       Is that gonna get crunchy
               like a wonton?   

183
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,505
     Yeah.

    off the pork.               

185

    white pepper,               

186

193
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:04,990
       So then                  
   we take it out.              

194
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,324
                 And it goes

                   I don't know.

   a lettuce wrap.

                It's crunchy.   

206
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,158
    The shrimp, the bean sprout.
  Love the bean sprout in there.

207
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,425
               Having the Thai  
               basil available  

208
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,162
              and the cilantro, 
                 the crepe.     

209
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,764
               I want to have   
                crepe chips.    

210
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,567
                 Mm. Mm, mm!    

211
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,502
             It's so good that, 

212
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:52,236
      if this was the only thing
               you got to come  

213
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,505
               and have to eat  
  in your whole visit to Hawaii,

214
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:55,841
              it'd be worth it. 

215
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,511
                  Mm! God,      
                that's good!    

216
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:02,180
     Crepe going                
in the window, Chef. Herb.      

217
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:03,714
      It's an amazing dish.     
        It's my favorite.       

218
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:07,051
This might be in the top        
25 most unique items            

219
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,587
   I've ever seen               
   on "Triple D."               

220
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:09,921
                 Pick it up     
              "Look Moore Fun"  

221
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,122
  Love this place.              

222
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,258
Do lunch and dinner here,       
it's really that good.          

223
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,260
You have lunch, go to the beach,
you come back for dinner.       

224
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:16,461
         It's the best.         

225
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:19,330
               The first time   
   you have this, I promise you,

226
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,532
                  you will      
               not forget it.   

227
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,934
                You're the bomb.
                   Nice job.    
Thank you, Chef.                

228
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,404
  FIERI: Coming up, a real-deal 
     taste of New Orleans...    

229
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:27,872
Oh, I'll just sit here          
 and eat it all day.            

230
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,274
   ...cooked up in Los Angeles  
        for generations.        

231
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,477
       This is                  
old school right here.          

232
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,086
    You know, on "Triple D,"    
   we have featured just about  

233
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,289
       every type of food       
        you can imagine.        

234
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,692
    But one that we don't do    
nearly enough, Creole and Cajun.

235
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,161
     So, guess where I'm at?    
 I'm in Los Angeles, California,

236
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,230
      in the Jefferson Park     
    neighborhood to check out   

237
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,865
a joint that I've been to before

238
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,232
     and you're gonna love.     

239
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,903
    This is Harold & Belle's.   

240
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,973
         One jambalaya.         

241
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,976
    Just totally unlike anything
        else you'll find in L.A.

242
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:07,178
     I have catfish nuggets     
       for the gentleman.       

243
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,981
           MAN: You want a touch
      or a taste of New Orleans,

244
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,516
             Harold & Belle's is
             the place to come. 

245
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:14,786
This restaurant has been        
 in the same family             

246
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,521
    for 47 years.               

247
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:19,924
   FIERI: Going back to 1969,   
   when Louisiana transplants   

248
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,127
           Harold and           
    Mary Belle Legaux opened    

249
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:25,196
           a dive bar           
  serving up gumbo and po'boys. 

250
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,599
        Now five decades        
   and two renovations later,   

251
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:30,335
      grandson Ryan's still     
     cooking up the Creole.     

252
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,070
     All four of my grandparents
           are from New Orleans.

253
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,472
            I have a very Creole
             last name, Legaux. 

254
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:35,674
                L-e-g-a-u-x.    

255
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,141
   The only people              
that have "X" in their name     

256
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,676
     are people                 
that come from Louisiana.       
                          Right.

257
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,346
I don't find much Cajun Creole  
food in the West Coast,         

258
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,014
 so when I came here            
 and I met this guy             

259
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,350
and I tried the food, I'm like, 
you're the real deal, brother.  

260
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,685
         Large gumbo.           
     The gumbo's                
one of my favorite dishes.      

261
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:51,188
Sausage, chicken, crab.         

262
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,425
    When I think                
of making true gumbo,           

263
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,826
    I'm thinking                
  of all the goods.             

264
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,495
 All right, buddy,              
    fire it up.                 
                  Seafood stock.

265
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,965
    Okay.                       
             What we're gonna do
     next is put in our trinity.

266
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,167
In the French cooking,          
 you have mirepoix,             

267
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:04,168
 which is the onions            
and celery and the carrots,     

268
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,570
and in Creole cooking,          

269
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:07,705
you have the peppers,           
the celery, and the onions.     

270
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,574
 Have you ever heard            
the term filet gumbo?           

271
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,575
This is the ground-up           
   sassafras leaf.              

272
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,177
              Creole seasoning. 

273
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,912
                Ground thyme,   
                ground basil,   

274
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,181
           dried parsley flakes.
             More black pepper. 

275
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,850
       We had some in our Creole
             seasoning already. 

276
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,918
                We like more.   
          More granulated onion,

277
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,453
         more granulated garlic.

278
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,123
      Okay.                     
                  I'm gonna     
             let that cook down,

279
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,791
            and then we're gonna
    add our roux. Thicken it up.

280
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,860
all that in there?              
                     Most of it.

281
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,995
The roux's the key, baby.       
      Next up.                  

282
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,398
          Some boneless/skinless
chicken thighs, seasoned with...

283
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,466
 Harold and Belle's             
  Creole seasoning.             

284
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,536
               Beef hot links.  
               Diced pit ham.   

285
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:41,005
               Smoked sausage.  
Really key.                     

286
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,207
      You know, a lot of recipes
               in New Orleans,  

287
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:43,942
             they use andouille,
    which is like a combination.

288
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,143
    Right.                      
              Spicy and smoke,  

289
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,944
              so we just do it  
    with two different sausages.

290
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,346
  Blue crab. This is another key
               for the flavor.  

291
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,349
         I'm gonna let this cook
  for probably about 45 minutes.

292
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:54,085
In the last 15 minutes before   
service, we'll drop the shrimp? 

293
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,487
                 We'll drop     
            the shrimp in there.
   Okay.                        

294
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,955
         Oh,                    
 it looks fantastic.            

295
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,091
               All right, Guy.  
       You ready for some gumbo?
Do it.                          

296
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,094
  Make sure we get you some blue
  crab and some shrimp on there.

297
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,496
               A little parsley.
    Look at                     
  this gumbo.                   

298
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,964
    It's not thin               
     like stock.                

299
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,367
   It's not heavy               
     like stew.                 

300
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,370
         Mm.                    
  That's fantastic.             

301
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,839
You pick up that seafood.       
Even though there was           

302
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,774
  just a little bit             
 of that blue crab,             

303
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,377
     you get --                 
         Mm!                    

304
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,179
   Velvety texture              
coming over your tongue         

305
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,748
from that sassafras,            
getting it from that roux.      
                  Right.        

306
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,852
Oh, I'll just sit here          
 and eat it all day.            

307
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,321
     A small filet gumbo.       
               MAN: The gumbo   
                 is amazing.    

308
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,524
                 The spices,    
                 the flavor.    

309
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,125
                    This        
              is Tara and Cara. 

310
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,660
                   Tara's       
            on the culinary team

311
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,328
                     for        
          "Guy's Grocery Games."

312
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,729
              And this is Cara, 
               who's actually   

313
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,665
             one of our editors 
     and helps develop the show.

314
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,201
             So, since you both 
            have such wide-range

315
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,503
          knowledge of the food,
                take it away.   

316
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,808
       So, the gumbo here       
    has two types of sausage.   

317
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,543
            And one's           
        light and fluffy,       

318
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,211
         and the other's        
     got, like, a nice bite.    

319
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,480
          I love both.          
 Having a little bit            
       of soul                  

320
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:58,016
and a little bit of spice       
in the heart of L.A.            

321
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,284
 is a nice balance.             

322
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:02,153
        MAN: Jefferson Park area
        was a stopping-off point

323
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,622
             for a lot of people
  that had moved from Louisiana,

324
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:07,025
        and Harold & Belle's was
              kind of an anchor 

325
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,359
                 for people     
              to come together. 

326
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:09,694
It's like a little hidden gem   
in the neighborhood.            

327
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,162
           Yeah, I wouldn't even
              know it was here. 

328
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:12,897
Good buddy of mine, Walt,       
one of our camera guys          

329
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,566
on "Guy's Grocery Games."       

330
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,567
Tell me what you think          
   of the food.                 
                It's incredible.

331
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,169
    Crawfish étouffée ready.    

332
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:21,840
Shrimp and crawfish smothered   
in this beautiful gravy sauce.  

333
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,374
   Okay, now we're              
 into the étouffée.             

334
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:24,909
                   Right,       
         we start with the roux.

335
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,510
           Canola and olive oil.

336
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,980
             Once the oil's hot,
  we're gonna stir in our flour.

337
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,882
       We want this roux to kind
         of be a brownish color,

338
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,317
          kind of like the color
              of peanut butter. 

339
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:33,717
              When the roux is  
             at the temperature 

340
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,320
               we want it at,   
    we're gonna add our trinity.

341
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:37,989
Our red and green bell peppers, 
our onions, and our celery.     

342
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,725
       Correct. Harold & Belle's
              Creole seasoning, 

343
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,994
              ground bay leaf,  
               minced garlic,   

344
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,396
                 hot sauce,     
             granulated garlic, 

345
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,665
              and more paprika, 
   cayenne pepper, not too much.

346
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,267
                   We have      
            some ground basil...

347
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,870
Okay.                           
         ...some parsley flakes,
             some black pepper. 

348
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,605
Worcestershire?                 
                  Yes, sir.     

349
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,807
               A little bit of  
         extra Creole seasoning.

350
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:56,941
                 We're gonna    
               stir it all in.  

351
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,609
 The roux's starting            
   to tighten up.               

352
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,077
               We're gonna add  
              some tomato soup. 

353
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,612
  I don't know that             
I've seen tomato soup,          

354
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,947
  but I'll give it              
       to you.                  
                   Shrimp stock.

355
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,216
     Okay.                      
               Let this simmer  
             for about an hour. 

356
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,285
And then...                     
                 We're gonna    
              add our crawfish. 

357
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,686
Ah, that's gonna work           
       for me.                  

358
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:10,555
         Let that cook down, get
   the crawfish flavor in there.

359
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:12,023
              About a half-hour 
       is all you need for that.

360
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,691
            Then we're gonna add
     the cream of mushroom soup.

361
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,760
And that's how it was           
 made 40 years ago?             

362
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:16,961
 This is old school             
     right here.                

363
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,163
        We cool it down and then
            heat it up to order.

364
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,965
'Cause if you held it hot,      
it would just sit there         

365
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,433
    and continue                
    to cook down.               

366
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:25,436
           Extra crawfish tails.
   Our étouffée is nice and hot.

367
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,238
          Gonna put it in a bowl
                for you, Guy.   

368
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,574
               We'll just put   
      a little parsley on there.

369
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,508
        Tight                   
 but not too tight.             

370
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,179
Mm. My buddy Kim Gardner --     
and this dude's Cajun.          

371
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,781
Kim, what's up, buddy?          

372
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:40,384
Uh, and this is the first time  
I had real étouffée.            

373
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,921
And there's so much flavor      
  going on in this.             

374
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,389
All the spices, I mean,         
you are just talking deep       

375
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,792
and rich and creamy.            

376
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:50,394
And you get nice, little,       
tender crawfish inside of it.   

377
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,663
Crawfish is an intensified      
    shrimp flavor               

378
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,333
and a great, meaty texture,     
kind of like lobster.           

379
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,869
        Mmm!                    
  You'll love this.             

380
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,604
       Shrimp and crawfish      
            étouffée.           

381
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,472
               Really, really   
            incredible crawfish.

382
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:04,075
     It's spicy,                
 but not<i> too</i> spicy.             

383
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,677
             It always delivers 
            every time you come.

384
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,078
   You're sticking              
 to the traditions.             

385
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,147
  You're upgrading              
the program where you can,      

386
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,415
   and you really               
    embody this.                

387
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,483
You really celebrate it.        
     Fantastic.                 

388
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:15,019
      This guy.                 

389
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,754
             FIERI:             
    Up next in Minneapolis...   

390
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,489
    That's crazy.               

391
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,358
         ...this deli's         
       laying it on thick.      

392
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,293
    You own this.               
    You own this.               

393
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,762
      But you won't believe     
    what they're leaving out.   

394
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:25,997
This is, like, groundbreaking   
  stuff here, bud.              

395
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:37,575
        So, what the show       
            is called           

396
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:38,843
     is "Diners, Drive-Ins,     
           and Dives,"          

397
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,446
     but what it really is,     
 it's just a trip to Flavortown.

398
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:42,647
          We're looking         
          for real food         

399
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,782
         by real people         
     all across the country,    

400
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,517
             and now            
      all around the world.     

401
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,653
         So here we are         
   in Minneapolis, Minnesota,   

402
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:51,589
  to check out the one and the  
  only that I've ever heard of. 

403
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,424
             This is            
    the Herbivorous Butcher.    

404
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,196
                Sliced meats    
                 everywhere.    
 I need some jerky.             

405
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,931
               But, of course,  
           it's all plant-based.

406
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,200
  This is the only vegan butcher
         shop I've ever been to.

407
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,002
             I feel like they're
             changing the world.

408
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:06,137
        But for siblings        
     Aubrey and Kale Walch,     

409
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,673
       it all started with      
      very personal changes     

410
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:09,674
      back in their teens.      

411
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,141
         For me, it was         
      for ethical reasons.      

412
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,478
                Ethical reasons.
Yeah, for me,                   
it was for health.              

413
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,213
                 Health reasons.
  My nickname                   
 was butterball.                

414
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:17,348
  FIERI: So they started making 
         meat-free meats        

415
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,816
    and cheese-free cheeses,    

416
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:22,086
     first selling at local     
    farmers markets in 2014,    

417
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,354
       and then, less than      
        two years later,        

418
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,089
          had their own         
         takeout joint.         

419
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,557
  They want people              
who eat meat to say,            

420
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,226
"This looks like what           
 I'm used to eating,            

421
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,161
and I can still eat it          
   and enjoy it."               

422
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,495
              CHEF:             
      Turkey dill Havarti!      

423
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,499
             The turkey sandwich
               tastes amazing.  

424
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:35,833
   So, what are we              
  gonna make first?             

425
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,368
                 This'll be     
              the vegan turkey. 

426
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,703
               I'll start with  
         the vital wheat gluten.

427
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:40,838
                 It's a 95%     
               protein flour.   

428
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,307
             This is traditional
yeast flakes, some onion powder.

429
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,109
And these are recipes           
that you just developed.        

430
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,778
        Yes. We've got sea salt,
         and this is some thyme.

431
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,580
  It's some thyme.              

432
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,448
  When is it gonna              
get the turkey flavor?          

433
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,984
          A lot of it comes from
 housemade chicken broth powder.

434
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:57,655
      We take nutritional yeast,
          thyme, sage, turmeric,

435
00:15:57,657 --> 00:16:00,992
        salt, mix it with water.

436
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,593
                Just like Mom   
                used to make.   

437
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:03,928
               Instant flavor.  

438
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,929
             Got some olive oil 
                    so it       

439
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:07,065
              doesn't turn out  
               like a sponge.   

440
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,933
          Soy sauce for a little
               bit more depth.  

441
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,902
              We're gonna pour  
            the liquid in there.

442
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,472
             This is the turkey.

443
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,474
               We will wrap it  
   in its cheesecloth home here.

444
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,876
    What do we do               
     with that?                 

445
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:21,813
    This goes into boiling water
   for about an hour and a half.

446
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,080
      Cooks it                  
all the way through.            

447
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,081
             Bake it for another
                ten minutes.    

448
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,616
    Dries it out                
    a little bit.               

449
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,819
      Then we add some soy sauce
     and olive oil on top of it.

450
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:28,953
       To give                  
it a little texture.            
                        Yeah.   

451
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,554
 Give a little color            
   to the outside.              

452
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,356
                        Yep.    
   And then you go              
and slice it from there.        

453
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,425
               Slice it ready.  

454
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,227
So, this is your deli           
  meat right here.              

455
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,062
                   That's       
              the deli turkey.  

456
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,098
  It's got texture.             

457
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,368
It's moist, and it's not rubber,
and it's not a sponge.          

458
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,104
   I'm impressed.               
   I'm trippin'.                
                     Let's do   
                    the cheese. 

459
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,972
     What are we                
     making now?                
                   Dill Havarti.

460
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,708
                We start with   
           the coconut oil base,

461
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,843
           soy milk, lemon juice
        in a white wine vinegar.

462
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,380
        It helps to emulsify it.
          Put that in a blender.

463
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:58,049
  Next up.                      
               We got tapioca   
       flour, Kappa carrageenan,

464
00:16:58,051 --> 00:16:59,584
                   so it's      
                 a seaweed.     
 Oh. I was..                    

465
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:01,853
              It helps solidify 
                 the cheese.    

466
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,322
       Nutritional yeast flakes,
                  sea salt.     

467
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:05,789
                 And that's     
               the white miso.  

468
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,725
  That's basically              
the flavor foundation.          

469
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:08,860
                Pretty much.    

470
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,798
Onto the stove.                 
                It's fresh dill.

471
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,600
     Heated up.                 
   Thicken it up.               

472
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:16,867
                 It cools in    
           the fridge overnight,

473
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,536
          and then it solidifies
             into a solid block.

474
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,473
        Wow.                    
    That's crazy.               

475
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:23,607
Okay, make a sandwich?          

476
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,475
                All right, yeah.
Let's do it.                    

477
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:27,478
                  We've got     
              our garlic mayo.  

478
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,148
             Got dijon mustard, 
     throw some turkey on there.

    [ Whistles ]                

480
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:35,619
  The dill Havarti, best part --
     throw some lettuce on here.

481
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,823
          Tomatoes and ze onion.

482
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,291
                 All right.     

483
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:41,259
      Jump in.                  

484
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,898
     I'd eat it

   Fresh veggies,               

486
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:51,368
a good amount of moisturizer    
with the vegan mayo.            

487
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,504
   We're eating it              
on a fantastic roll.            

488
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,305
 You definitely get             
the creaminess of the cheese.   

489
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,775
 You get that chew,             
you get that texture,           

490
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:01,179
 that meaty texture             
coming through from the turkey. 

491

     Fantastic.                 

492
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,316

                It's so good.

00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,985
        The dill Havarti        
        is off the hook.        

495
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:10,387

How do you get different        
textures in different meats?    

499
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,662
          It's different ratios,

500
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:19,397
                 and we use

501
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,831
                  to create

00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,500
nutritional yeast flakes,       
  red beet powder.              

519
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,369
Gives it a nice color,          
 a little sweetness.            

520
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,104
 This is agar-agar.             

521
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:01,772
   Another seaweed              
  like carrageenan.             

522
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,774
                 Agar-agar?     
  Agar-agar.                    
     Yeah.                      

523
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,109
          They just couldn't use
                  one agar?     

524
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,843
  No, it's so good,             
they had to name it twice.      

525
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:09,780
   Ground mustard.              
You've got basil and oregano.   

526
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:13,984
   Smoked paprika,              
sea salt, onion powder,         

527
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,254
   and the fennel               
  and peppercorns.              

528
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,055
          Mix all this together.

529
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:20,725
     Wow. Okay.                 

530
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,059
                  Right in.     
  Right in.                     

531
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,061
         Looks like ground beef.
                   Crazy.       

532
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:26,196
     Throw it on here. This will
        all go into the steamer?

533
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:27,398
  Yep.                          
               How long is it   
              gonna steam for?  

534
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,766
 Steams for an hour.            

535
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,270
Bakes for another half-hour,    
then you let it cool.           

536
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,604
                Bring it out,   
       and you slice from there.

537
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,006
        Yep.                    

538
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,941
 All right. Got that same garlic
      mayo we put on the turkey.

539
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,610
                  Oregano,      
          salt, and pepper here.

540
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:40,744
 Oh, I'm so excited.            

541
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,614
       So, we got that pastrami,
            capicola, salty ham,

542
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,216
            we got the pepperoni
               in there, too.   

543
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:48,886
      And this is our mozzarella
              cheese, lettuce.  

544
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,755
  Got some onions.              
                      Red onion.

545
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:53,557
               Cherry peppers,  
              oil and vinegar.  

546
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,692
             Let's see if I can 
             get this one shut. 

547
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,562
    You own this.               
    You own this.               

548
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,102
       No way.                  

549
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:06,704
   I'm picking up               
the notes of the smoke.         

550
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,172
    I'm picking up              
 the notes of the pepper.       

551
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,708
There's a good fat amount.      
    It's not dry.               

552
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,310
 You're the Columbus            
    of this, man.               

553
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:14,145
You guys are gonna dig it.      
      Trust me.                 

554
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:16,913
           Delicious.           

555
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,116
I, of course, drag one          
of my buddies in on this.       

556
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,651
      My buddy                  
   Craig Scanlon.               

557
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,653
I could not believe the texture,
    followed up with the flavor.

558
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,855
               It tastes like   
             a cold cut Italian.

559
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,390
        It's a little bit       
       of sweet and spicy.      

560
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,192
             They're definitely 
               onto something.  

561
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:30,394
 FIERI: I came here             
with my own level of skepticism,

562
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,929
 but I would not be             
 steering you wrong             

563
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,732
telling you to come in here     
    and try this.               

564
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,734
   It's fantastic.              
  Congratulations.              

565
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:37,969
                   Thanks.      

566
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:42,606
      So, was that another      
  righteous road trip or what?  

567
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,075
      But don't you worry.      

568
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,610
    We got plenty more joints   
 to find all over this country. 

569
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,212
         I'll be looking        
        for you next week       

570
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,614
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

571
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,282
 After we shock it,             
then we squeeze the lemon in.   

572
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,218
               Shock it? Like,  
              as in Chaka Khan? 

573
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,419
  Like Shaka-shaka.             

574
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,622
          BOTH: Shaka!          

575
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:58,923
          [ Laughter ]
