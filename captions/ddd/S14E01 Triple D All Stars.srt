212
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,563
HOW IMPORTANT IS KIMCHI         
  IN KOREAN CULTURE?            

213
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,099
        IT'S LIKE THE HAMBURGER.

214
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,836
 IN KOREA, YOU'LL FIND THOUSANDS
       OF YEARS OLD KIMCHI.     

215
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,104

00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,709
                 BERKSHIRE PORK.
                    AND SALT.   

218
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,378
            FRESH-GROUND PEPPER.
                   SUGAR.       

219
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,846
            FRESH-GROUND GINGER.
MMM.                            

220
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:30,448
GINGER SMELLS<i> AWESOME.</i>          
                 ISN'T IT GREAT?

221
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,716
I'M A GINGER JUNKIE.            
                        ARE YOU?

223
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,453
               AND THEN FINALLY 
              SOME KOREAN CHILI.

224
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,590
     AND MASSAGE THE INGREDIENTS
            INTO THE PORK.      
MASSAGE IT INTO THE PAN.        

225
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,792
 IT'S READY TO GO               
AS A NICE TOPPING.              
                        EXACTLY.

226
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,794
SO ALL OF THIS NOW--            
NOW WE BUILD THE PIE.           

227
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,395
                            YES.
LET'S ROCK 'N' ROLL.            

228
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,597
                      ALL RIGHT.

229
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,333

           PEAR TOMATOES.       

230
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:49,734
    SOME OF THIS KOREAN SAUSAGE.

231
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,936
                THAT KIMCHI     
           THAT WE MADE EARLIER.

232
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,538
                SERRANO PEPPERS.
                 FRESH SCALLION.

233
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,408
       AND THEN WE FINISH IT OFF
            WITH SESAME OIL.    

234
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,876
            CHICKEN IN THE OVEN.
YOU--YOU CALL IT                
  A PIZZA OVEN.                 

235
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:00,077
  ME--I CALL IT                 
A WOOD-FIRED OVEN.              

236
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:00,812
              AN ARTIST IN MAINE
                  CREATED IT.   

237
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,946
HOW MUCH WAS THE OVEN?          

238
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,815
              PROBABLY MORE THAN
             THAT CAR OUT THERE.

239
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:04,616
REALLY?                         
                          YEAH. 

240
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:08,019
I LIKE IT.                      
                  (laughs) YEAH.

241
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,554
YOU'VE GOT DIFFERENT HEATS      
        GOING ON.               

242
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,756
SHE WON'T PUT THE PIZZA IN      
 ON THE SAME SPOT AGAIN.        

243
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,625
 IF SHE PUTS IT                 
RIGHT BACK THERE,               

244
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:14,759
IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT          
OF A TEMPERATURE DROP,          

245
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,894
AND THAT COULD MAKE             
ALL THE DIFFERENCE.             

246
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,631
     THIS ONE'S JUST ABOUT DONE.
OH! YOU SHOULD SMELL IT!        

247
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,032
       THEN THE SOY CHILI GLAZE.

248
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:24,302
      TOP IT OFF WITH TOASTED   
   BLACK AND WHITE SESAME SEEDS.

249
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,271

253
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,213

00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,080
                       FLOUR IN.
IF YOU HAVE FAT,                

422
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,750
THAT'S WHEN IT STARTS TO WORK   
TOGETHER AND BUILD THE ROOT.    

423
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,819
   WHERE'D THE FAT COME FROM?   
THE FAT CAME FROM--             

424
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:49,487
ONE, WE STARTED WITH OIL.       
               RIGHT.           

425
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,822
NOW HE'LL SLOWLY ADD IN         
A LITTLE CHICKEN STOCK.         
                  CHICKEN STOCK.

426
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,825
        AND FINISH OFF WITH SOME
               WHOLE MILK.      

427
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:55,693
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU JUST          
SIT THERE AND LET THIS          

428
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,495
REDUCE A LITTLE BIT.            
        HOW LONG ARE YOU        
       GONNA REDUCE THAT?       

429
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:58,629
        MAYBE FIVE, SIX MINUTES.

430
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,965
   AND THEN IT'S GONNA SETTLE   
             AND...             

431
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,433
          YEP, TIGHTEN RIGHT UP.
      GET A LITTLE VISCOUS?     

432
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,835
                            YEP.
AND THEN WE'LL GET TO EAT.      
  THAT'S THE BEST PART.         

433
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,638
AND RACE THE CARS.              
THAT'LL BE LATER.               

434
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,308
                        (laughs)
BLOW THEM DOORS COMPLETELY OFF, 
          MELBA TOAST.          

435
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,511

436
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,379

READY TO ASSEMBLE THE CASSEROLE 

437
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,648
AND PUT IT IN THE OVEN.         
   I DON'T KNOW HOW THE WORD    
   "CASSEROLE" EXACTLY WORKS.   

438
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,450
"ENCHILADA STACK,"              
  OR SOMETHING?                 

439
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,385
             "CASHILADA." MMM...
CAS-- (laughs)                  

440
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,854
                LOOKS LIKE A BIT
                OF AN ENCHILADA.
         I KNOW.                

441
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:25,590
      I LIKE "CASHILADA."       
       I THINK CHANGE IT.       
CASHILADA? OKAY.                

442
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,258
  I'LL GO AND GET THE SHARPIE

LADLE THE SAUCE DOWN.           

445
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:34,332
        SO THE TORTILLAS        
 DON'T STICK AND DON'T DRY OUT. 
EXACTLY.                        

446
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:36,867

 UH, EVERYONE IN TEXAS          
HAS A DIFFERENT RECIPE.         

447
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,403

       THIS IS A STAPLE?        

448
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:42,006
YEP. DID YOU GROW UP ON IT? NO? 
              NO. MY MOM WAS NOT
                 A GOOD COOK.   

449
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,409
                SORRY, MOM.     
           YOU KNOW YOU WEREN'T.
         (laughter)             

450
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,010
