    and you know what I need?

00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:05,270
  I need you riding shotgun --  
  I'm on my way to Flavortown.  

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,540
   This is "Diners, Drive-Ins,

11
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:25,023

        You'll dig that.

          Plus, we're smokin'...

00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:37,836
         Great barbecue.

32
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,403

      to check out a joint      

33
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,606
 that looks like it came from my
home turf -- the wine country --

34
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:16,875
 and to meet a chef that's doing

35
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:18,410
           wood-fired.

      This is St. Francis.

FIERI: Just like the chef behind
   it all -- Aaron Chamberlin.  

43
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,563
       I grew up as a Boy Scout.

44
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,364
               I always cooked  
              on an open fire.  

45
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,634
  So, when he opened this joint 
             in '09,            

46
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,103
        he saw no reason        
    to do anything different.   

47
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:46,705
            I wanted to have    
         a big wood-burning oven

48
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,907
  so I could have my little fire

             FIERI:             
   Including this top seller.   

52
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,580
           Pig dip up.          

53
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,450
Just like a French dip,         
    but pork style.             

54
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:02,120
First thing we're gonna make    
is our brine for our pork.      

55
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:03,655
   Water goes in.               

56
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,657
So, bringing that up.           

57
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:08,193
Second thing, star anise.       
               Very strong.     

58
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:09,327
    Fennel seed.                

59
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:11,063
      Bay leaf.                 

60
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,065
Toasted coriander seed.         
       Of course you toasted it.

61
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,099
    Ancho chili.                

62
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:16,868
      We go on to               
the fresh ingredients.          

63
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:19,805
 We got thyme there             
 and fresh rosemary.            

64
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,072
    Kosher salt.                

65
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,875
 You got the sugar.             
        Boom.                   

66
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:27,212
Bring this up to boil,          
and we let it sit and marinate. 

67
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,948
 We have our brine,             
 just off the stove.            

68
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,284
      We strained all the spices
        and herbs out of there. 

69
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,086
       I have some ice that I...

70
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:36,821
  Oh, that's nice!              
        ...slightly cooled down.

71
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,289
             It's a good brine. 

72
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,825
 Mm! That star anise            
  is what really --             
              Comes through.    

73
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:41,960
                   Yeah.        
        Mmm!                    

74
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:45,364
           And we stick our pork
              right in there.   

75
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,432
Overnight -- 12 hours.          
                Overnight.      

76
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:50,636
          We put salt and pepper
                 on it...       

77
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,505
                and roast it    
              in the wood oven. 

78
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,240
      What temp                 
 does the oven run?             

79
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:57,376
             The oven right now 
             is at 616 degrees. 

80
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,646
             Our roast is ready,

81
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,448
        and you can see how nice
          and beautiful it is.  

82
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:07,252
      I just come right in here.

83
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:08,920
Oh. That rack of ribs.          

84
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:10,455
    Yeah, you can smell that guy
            right there.        

85
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:12,724
   Are you talking              
about<i> this</i> guy, or...           

86
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,526
             Well, no, the pork.
    Okay.                       

87
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,261
           So, we have the chine
               right there,     

88
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:17,596
             and then what we do

89
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:20,465
          is we just slice nice,
           little, thin pieces. 

90
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,734
        Layer our sandwich here.

91
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,338
     Put applewood smoked bacon,
      Gruyère cheese like that. 

92
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:27,806
Back in the oven?               
               Back in the oven.

93
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,007
               Let that melt.   

94
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,341
            We're gonna assemble
                the sandwich.   

95
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,744
         Fennel-onion marmalade,
        a generous amount of it.

96
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,713
               Dijon mustard    
           for a little picante.

97
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,349
               Melted cheese.   

98
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,151
               Just slide this  
                right off...    

99
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:42,620
   Oh, gosh.                    
               ...onto that.    

100
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,756
 We add prosciutto -- That's one
     thing we don't cook --     

101
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,892
              and the top bun.

       Hello, Flavortown?       
 Yeah, my pig meter's going off.

Smoky, crunchy, creamy.         

108
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,044
I haven't even dipped           
   this thing yet.              

109
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,680
Now we're gonna take            
this bad boy for a test drive.

          WOMAN: It's delicious.
            Nice, salty flavor. 

118
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:33,338
                  The sauce     
               is really good.  

119
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,474
           The bread is crunchy,
              but not soggy.    

120
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,208
All the perfect things          
   about a sandwich.            

121
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:38,210
        Ohh.                    

122
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:39,645
One of the best dips            
   I've ever had.               

123
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,483
      This place definitely     
   stands out within Phoenix.   

124
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:45,750
              It's just amazing.

125
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,886
    This is like a vacation,    
    and it's just down          
    the street from us.         

126
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,355
   You don't play               
   anything safe.               

127
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:53,225
     Everything                 
 is touchdown bombs.            

128
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,492
      I've had                  
an incredible visit.            
                    Thank you.  

129
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,695
    You got to come             
meet this cat. Amazing.         

130
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,897
 So since we're all about pork, 

131
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,233
        you can't pass up       
  a classic cut we're grabbin'  

132
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:02,601
       on the East Coast.       

133
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,438
       We love coming           
       to North Carolina.       

134
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:09,307
   Every time we've come here,  
   we've got great food         
   experiences.                 

135
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,577
  Now I'm about 15 miles        
  outside of downtown Charlotte 

136
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:15,980
         on Highway 2427        

137
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,116
       at an old converted      
        1930s gas station       

138
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,519
    where two brothers          
    who started out slinging    

139
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,788
     hamburgers and hot dogs    
     at car shows               

140
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,123
    are now serving up          
    some new Southern dishes    

141
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,192
    here at Jake's Good Eats.   

142
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,593
  Let me get one more of those. 
                       Oh, yeah.

143
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,595
   We're going boom, and then   
   straight into that guy.      

144
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,864
             I love this place. 
             BLT.               

145
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,267
Feels almost like you're going  
to a friend's house for dinner. 

146
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,335
Bethany and Brice.              
     The food is phenomenal.    

147
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,404
       It's always unique.      
Venison quesadilla.             

148
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,539
   FIERI:                       
   All thanks to Jake Stegall   
               Double pork chop.

149
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,008
     and his brother Gordon     
  Don't forget about that mac --
  it's on.                      

150
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:47,279
   who opened this place to do  
   their childhood favorites    
   their way.                   

151
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,548
We put our twist                
on Southern cooking.            

152
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,483
    FIERI: And these guys       
    are putting in 80-hour weeks
        Crab cake down...       

153
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,552
      just to get it right.     

154
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,686
We love being in the kitchen,   
we love the insanity.           

155
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,289
     FIERI: Jake's even here    
     a couple of days           

156
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,491
  after running his motorcycle  
  into a tree.                  

157
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,561
      Ow, how's the tree look?  
Better than me.                 

158
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:05,096
         What are we gonna make?
Maple-glazed                    
double-cut pork chop            

159
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,098
with our roasted garlic         
mashed potatoes,                

160
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,900
candied apples,                 
and sauteed spinach.            

161
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,435
        It's the best pork chop 
        I've ever had.          

162
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,303
          You're gonna give us  
            a true double cut?  
Big boy.                        

163
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:13,638
                   Let's see it.

164
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,108
Get that fat off that bone      
 and just French these out      

165
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:17,776
and here's our pork chop.       

166
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:20,378
        You're basically making 
        two chops into one.     

167
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:22,047
    He did it real-deal way.    
    I'm in it now.              

168
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,515
   We're gonna come over here,  
   salt and pepper both sides.  

169
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,184
   Canola oil on that           
   to keep 'em from sticking.   

170
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,186
        We're going right       
     on the grill with this?    
            We're going right on
               the char grill.  

171
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,789
   We'll let that go            
   for three or four minutes,   
   get some marks on it.        

172
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:31,990
Dynamite.                       

173
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,325
  We'll take a gala apple here  
  and cut these into fours,     

174
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,794
  and I'm gonna core out this.  

175
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:38,396
Little canola oil in the pan,   
get these browning.             
              Okay.             

176
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:41,800
Turn these guys here            
  and now it's time             
 to add brown sugar.            

177
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,735
We just make it here,           
it's our molasses               
and sugar.                      

178
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,937
You make your own brown sugar?  
       You're darn right.       

179
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,539
Oh, I love to see it.           
        A little butter in here.

180
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:48,806
        You're almost gonna make
        a caramel that's gonna  

181
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,942
         go around those apples.
         Exactly right.         

182
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,477
  Now I'm gonna make our glaze. 

183
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:55,013
  Maple syrup                   
  and a little Creole mustard.  

184
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,615
 Our chops are getting finished 
 over here.                     

185
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:57,816
Looks nice.                     
            We're gonna glaze it

186
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,684
       with our maple and Creole
       mustard glaze here       

187
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,086
            and then finish that
            in the oven.        

188
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,754
Five minutes                    
so that candies up.             

189
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,489
     Add our sauteed spinach    
     and mashed potatoes,       

190
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,425
     candied apples,            
     and now our pork chop.     

191
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,094
  A little bit more glaze here  
   right on top of our apples,  

192
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,895
    right on top of the chop.   

193
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,964
                 Mmm, delicious.

194
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,834
         Buddy, I tell you what,
         you hit that in all    
         the right spots.       

195
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,768
     The thing                  
     that I'm so impressed with,

196
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,704
 you knocked out the temperature
 on point.                      

197
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,973
              All the juice.    
           The mashed are great,

198
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,041
     the apples,                
     I can still see real apple.

199
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,577
          And the chop --       
          the chop's legit, man.

200
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:28,113
              You'll dig that,  
              that's a top chop.

201
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,915
Here's your                     
maple-glazed pork chop.         

202
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,451
        Fresh pork chop         
        with a sweetness to it. 

203
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,452
       Cooked perfectly,        
       got a great flavor,      

204
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:35,987
      off-the-grill tasty.      

205
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,055
            Blackened flounder, 
            table seven.        
           Thank you.           

206
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,324
           I just love the food.
           All right,           
      we're ready to roll.      

207
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,993
We'll be back.                  
          Always, yes.          

208
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,528
   Here's the oyster po' boy.   

209
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,263
       They treat us            
       like we're family.       

210
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,732
  You really do appreciate      
   every person that comes      
      through the door.         
Absolutely.                     

211
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,534
Thank you.                      
               Great experience,
               congratulations. 

212
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,469
       Thank you, brother.

           turning on.          

218

 ...in their South-of-the-border
          specialties.

    right off the 22 freeway    
      on Harbor Boulevard.      

223
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:18,462
  I'm here to check out a joint 
where I hear this Mexican family

224
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:22,600
 put it all on the line to open 
  and own their own restaurant  

225
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,002
          and serve up          
     real-deal Mexican food.    

226
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,838
        This is Sabroso!        

227
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,476
         MAN: One torta.        

228
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,478
       I can't say enough       
  about how good everything is. 

229
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,881
      Chamorro ready to go.     

230
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,083
  Every bite is a magical bite. 

231
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,552
          It's perfect.         

232
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:42,620
Really has the sazón of         
the family, and you really --   

233
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,088
                The sazón.      
  Sazón.                        

234
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,024
The flavor of the family.       

235
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,759
             FIERI:             
 That would be the Muñoz family,

236
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,429
   with veteran chef papa Tito  
       leading the charge.      

237
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:53,030
          Have you always been  
         this close of a family?

238
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,498
                All the time.   

239
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,634
             We always did      
       a lot of things together.

240
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,438
     Like taking the plunge     
 and opening this joint in 2012 

241
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,108
           with a menu          
     based on Mom's recipes.    

242
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,044
 WOMAN: This food is delicious, 
   it's fresh, it's flavorful.  

243
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,845
     You just can't go wrong    
         with anything.         

244
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,748
      What's your favorite thing
             on the menu?       
           The tamale.          

245
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,651
       Pork tamale ready.       

246
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,652
         It's the best.         

247
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:17,656
       We're gonna make tamales.
        I'm gonna do the pork.  
   Pork tamale.                 

248
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,924
     So, we're gonna put in a --

249
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,726
        Pork butt               
that's been just cut up.        

250
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:24,528
            Cook it in the water
               with some salt,  

251
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,498
                some onions,    
              Mexican oregano.  

252
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,400
                   garlic,      
               and bay leaves.  

253
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,868
And we're just gonna            
    cook it down?               

254
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,003
                Cook it down.   

255
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,872
  The rest of this              
   goes in there?               
                          Yes.  

256
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,674
                Mexican oregano.
  Okay.                         

257
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,609
                   Black pepper.
 Black peppercorns.             
       Got it.                  

258
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,877
  The onion.                    
                 Onions. Garlic.

259
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,346
                          Cumin.
Cumin seeds. Got it.            

260
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,748
            Allspice.           
Then we're gonna put some water.

261
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,016
                Where's my --   

262
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,618
Well, why don't we put the water
        from the peppers?       

263
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:50,288
What does "Sabroso" mean?       

264
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,556
                 Delicious.     

265
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,291
      Sabroso.                  

266
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,096
               We're gonna add  
                the peppers.    

267
00:09:58,165 --> 00:09:59,163
      That's the guajillo and...

268
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,132
           California?          
         Chile de arbol.        

269
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,769
        Okay.                   

270
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,571
      Now we go                 
   to the hot oil?              
                         Yes.   

271
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,839
Got to strain it a little bit   
'cause there's some solid.      

272
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,642
          [ Sizzling ]          
              This is what      
            you want to hear.   

273
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,510
   Oh, that sauce.              

274
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,313
       My mouth is just --      
 the flavor jets are turning on.

275
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:16,514
How long is that gonna cook,    
            chef?               

276
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,982
                 20 minutes.    

277
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:20,352
And then we'll be ready to take 
and add it to the pork.         
                There you go.   

278
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:27,859
So, now we have the masa.       

279
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:28,926
                    Yes.        

280
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:30,528
             Gonna put the salt.

281
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:31,996
 Little baking soda.            
                         Yes.   

282
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,331
To puff it a little bit.        

283
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,933
       Add some more shortening.

284
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,403
     Now we're gonna put        
the pork stock into the masa.   

285
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,073
        Then we're gonna start  
      mixing it up all together.

286
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,475
 So, I got the pork.            

287
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:45,410
        Mmm!                    

288
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:47,211
      Oh, yeah.                 

289
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,580
      Sabroso.                  

290
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,349
       Skins.                   
                 The masa.      

291
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:52,550
        Okay.                   

292
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,419
You soften them in the water    
     so they're pliable.        

293
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,553
                There you go.   

294
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:58,289
        Okay.                   

295
00:10:58,358 --> 00:10:59,490
        Over?                   
                   Just roll it.

296
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,758
                There you go.   

297
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,094
                  You know      
            how to make tamales.

298
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,762
I've made a few tamales         
      in my day.                

299
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:07,365
This is a tamale pot.           

300
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,768
See how that sits above         
the water as they cook?         

301
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,040
  All right, chef.              
      We ready?                 

302
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,276
        Whoa!                   

303
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,179
                Look at that.   

304
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,786
    They're delicious.          
The masa has great texture.     

305
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:28,986
The pork is delicious.          

306
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:30,455
   Not too spicy.               

307
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:31,923
And you got a good ratio.       

308
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,592
It's not a bunch of masa        
and a little bit of pork inside.

309
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:36,695
 This is like a nice            
       50/50.                   

310
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:39,397
 Just the right amount of sauce.

311
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:40,498
             WOMAN:             
      Hot but not too hot.      

312
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,200
 It leaves a nice little bite   
        in your mouth.          

313
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,468
   WOMAN: Everything you order  
        is gonna be good,       

314
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,937
       so it's really fun       
    to try different things.    

315
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,471
         Chamorro plate.        
            It's hot.           

316
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,074
This is the Chamorro plate.     
     It's super yummy.          

317
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,809
     It has meat                
 with the red sauce.            

318
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,012
          It's magical.         

319
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,547
                 Chamorro.      
       Yeah.                    

320
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,281
             What does it mean  
                in English?     
 The shank.                     

321
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,550
             That's the shank?  
   Uh-huh.                      

322
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:01,019
              Big shank.        
       Go ahead. Get me started.

323
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,954
                 Okay.          
      We're gonna salt it first.

324
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,155
                     So,        
            I have to sear them.

325
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,557
FIERI: Oh, we're gonna          
sear them off on the flattop.   

326
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:07,892
                    Yeah.       

327
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,094
While those are searing?        

328
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,961
      We're gonna make the salsa
           for the Chamorro.    

329
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,764
     We have all the ingredients
             over here.         

330
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,833
               We have cloves,  
                 bay leaves.    

331
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,434

443
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,223
 About three, four              
minutes on a side.              

444
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,958
        Okay, the little crust. 

445
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,026
             All right, I'm down
             with where we are. 

446
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:38,830
Put some more oil in the pan.   
 Gonna sauté my vegetables.     
Yeah, I love the red onion.     

447
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,431
   Did you see that getting used
      predominantly in Italy?   

448
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,233
In Florence where I was --      
      only red onion.           

449
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,035
    Carrots, celery.            
A little salt and pepper.       
                         Celery.

450
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,303
Throw in some garlic,           

451
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,238
    my favorite -- rosemary     
and thyme -- I just love that.  

452
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,439
I give it a stir.               

453
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,575
       I'm just gonna put       
a little bit down on the bottom.

454
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,709
         Now I'm just gonna put 
          the osso buco on top. 

455
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,711
         I'm gonna put the rest 
          of the vegetables in, 

456
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:56,713
                just everywhere.
It's like garden madness.       

457
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,382
                          It is.
A little tomato sauce?          

458
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,251
          A little tomato sauce.
So far, so great.               

459
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,453
                  A little wine.
Oh. 375 degrees                 
 for how long?                  

460
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,588
Two and a half hours.           
                   I can't wait.

461
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,791
          Nuggets of happiness. 

462
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:09,594
     I can just touch it        
and just see it's falling --    

463
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,596
pan's hot.                      

464
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:14,532
Came out of the oven.           
         Oh.                    

465
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,735
  Okay, so now we're gonna make 
the pasta that complements this?
              Yes.              

466
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,404
  A little oil, a little lemon, 
        a little parsley.       

467
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:22,406
We put the pasta in,            
  give this a toss.             

468
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,609
           Oh, that fresh pasta 
                just rocks.     

469
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,611
Look at that.                   
            Beautiful drippings.

470
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,680
Look at the way it just pulls   
 right away from that bone.     

471
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,617
  Anytime you can cook the meat 
   next to that big of a bone,  

472
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:35,486
the flavor's gotta be           
    just intense.               
                           Yeah.

473
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,422
Mmm. Wow.                       

474
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,625
That's so super flavor.         
       Oh, man.                 

475
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,560
     I never had it             
with pork shanks before.        
                             No?

476
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:45,163
 Wow, what a treat, and a little
     bit of the mirepoix --     

477
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,365
the carrots and the celery --   
   really nice. Delicious.      

478
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,767
   Boy, you sure brought        
some gems back from Italy.      
                           Yeah.

479
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:53,104
      It's just delicious.      
    It is always really good.   

480
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:55,106
       Cindy, table four.       
         Always just really nice
            coming back here.   

481
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:56,640
     We know we're gonna get    
          a good meal,          

482
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,309
         and we're gonna        
        enjoy ourselves.        

483
00:17:58,311 --> 00:17:59,177
    ALL: Chin chin.             

484
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,312
            It's a total dream. 
           I love the clientele.

485
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,247
                   So much fun  
                 and satisfying.

486
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:04,982
   I think that's               
the musician in you.            

487
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,783
  This time you're just         
playing your masterpiece        

488
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,719
on the canvas                   
of the plate.                   
                      Thank you.

489
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:11,255
Wow.                            
              Wow.              

490
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,126
I'm out on that.                

491
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:18,329
     FIERI: Now we're going     
   from Italian to digging in   

492
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:19,530
        to some Southern.       

493
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,498
           So I'm here          
 in Charleston, South Carolina, 

494
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:23,734
        on the very busy        
        Savannah highway        

495
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,270
just a few miles out of downtown
      to check out a joint      

496
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,139
 where a couple has been working
            for years           

497
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,540
   to put this diner together.  

498
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,008
   They got it all completed.   

499
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,144
    All they needed to do was   
      come up with a name.      

500
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:35,480
          [ Chuckles ]          
      Oh, and did they have     
    some doozies. Let's see.    

501
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,749
  They had "The Rusty Bucket,"  
  "The American U.S.A. Diner,"  

502
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:41,819
    or my personal favorite,    
   "Dexter's House of Gravy."   

503
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,888
 well, they finally figured out 
   what they're gonna name it,  

504
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:47,357
        and here it is --       
      the Early Bird Diner.     

505
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,959
  Order up. Open faced turkey.  

506
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:50,528
     Southern comfort food.     

507
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,097
                   Bowl o'grits.

508
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,265
MAN: I think I probably eat here

509
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:55,633
 almost more than I eat at home.
        I'm normally here       

510
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,968
      early in the morning      
       and late at night.       

511
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,971
             FIERI:             
  And this dude's got company.  

512
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,172
 We come to the Early Bird Diner

513
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,307
   usually around 2:00 or 3:00  
         in the morning,        

514
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:06,443
 not necessarily for breakfast. 

515
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,245
      FIERI: That's right.      

516
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,847
           Since '08,           
    owners Dexter Haigler...    

517
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:12,316
   Order up. Shrimp and grits.  

518
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:13,650
     ...and Nicole Morris...

   their fryer frying late...   

521
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,589
  [ Chuckles ] and I mean late. 

522
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:19,656
    Biscuits and gravy bacon.   

523
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,459
      Friday and Saturday,      
         we go 8:00 a.m.        

524
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:22,593
    till 4:00 in the morning.   

525
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,828
          Eventually, I think   
      we do want to do 24 hours.

526
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,330
    We're building towards that.

527
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,397
That's called crazy.            

528
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,966
           [ Laughs ]           
                    Yeah, right?

529
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,202
     You know, we wanted to have
      a place where we could do 
          whatever we want.     

530
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:33,136
       We're just trying to make
       simple food really well. 

531
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:36,607
   FIERI: Here "simple" means   
  this scratch-made top seller. 

532
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:37,674
                Fried pork chop.

533
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,809
           Thank you.           
That looks good.                

534
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:39,877
WOMAN: The pork chop is so good.

535
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,746
I love the sweet and spicy jelly
            with it.            

536
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:44,949
   I get it on everything that  
    I get here at the diner.    
           [ Laughs ]           

537
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,351
What are we making?             
               Uh, pepper jelly 
              for the pork chop.

538
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,819
And what do we get              
the pectin out of?              

539
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,354
           It comes from apples.

540
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,222
 When we talk about jelly,      
what's gonna<i> jellify</i> it --      

541
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:53,457
so this is actually apple?      
                           Yeah.

542
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,892
    Yeah, it's made from apples.
Apple. Good. Cool.              

543
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,560
              Start with        
       our, uh, pineapple juice,

544
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,228
                 pepper vinegar.
Pepper vinegar?                 

545
00:19:58,264 --> 00:19:59,563
    We take apple cider vinegar.

546
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,099
     We chop up, uh, hot chilies
        and put it in there.    

547
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:04,168
             Over time, it gets 
            spicier and spicier.

548

      fire-roasted bell peppers.

550

             Now I'm gonna puree
                the peppers.

00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:14,979
               Now I'm gonna add
              my frozen peppers.

555
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,248
  These are gonna be what are   
gonna actually cool this down?  

556
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:18,983
                           Yeah.
        Looks like              
a bunch of bell peppers --      

557
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:19,917
red, yellow.                    

558
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:21,586
           And, uh, a little bit
               of jalapeño.     

559
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,055
       This should give us      
 a nice, spicy red pepper jelly.

560
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,856
                Mm-hmm.         
      It's gotta cool overnight.

561
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:29,193
 All right. This is, uh, this is
  what my pork chops look like  

562
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,260
             when they get here.

563
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:31,728
The chine bone has not been     
        taken out?              

564
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,731
           No. I actually like  
         the extra bone on there

565
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:34,865
               'cause we make   
             our own pork stock.

566
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,600
So if you're gonna buy it,      
   buy it with the bone         

567
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,001
because the flavor's            
    in the bone.                

568
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,403
You won't see that              
    every day.                  

569
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,005
                      All right.

570
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:43,674
You're gonna pound this down,   
      tenderize it up.          

571
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:46,543
               Sorry. [ Laughs ]

572
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,212
Now the dredge?                 
                       Yes, sir.

573
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:50,347
           Got A.P. flour,      
     a little bit of blackening,

574
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,883
    a little fresh ground black,
      and a little kosher salt. 

575
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:55,218
So we're gonna flour,           
 buttermilk, flour.             

576
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,620
         Then it's in the fryer.

577
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:57,754
Canola oil at 350?              

578
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,156
                       Yes, sir.
Right on.                       

579
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,691
              Pork chop's ready.

580
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:01,959
Pork chop maximus.              

581
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:04,094
        Finish this up with     
  our fire-roasted pepper jelly,

582
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:05,496
             and that's         
    with a little mac and cheese

583
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:06,831
              and some          
     fresh collard greens there.

584
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,499
        I need to get           
some pepper jelly to go, man.   

585
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,633
Look at that.

587
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:12,969
 [ Mouth full ]                 
It's real simple.               

588
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:16,306
The chop is not over-seasoned,  
  not over-fried, not greasy.   

589
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:19,109
You get a little bit            
   of that crunch.              

590
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:21,245
With that pepper jelly,         
  real pepper flavor,           

591
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,913

        Nice job.

                      Thank you.
Mmm.

                     Fried chop.

594
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:29,320
Got pepper jelly right here.    
 Order up. Fried pork chop.     

595

Well, what did you have?        

596
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,189
                  Oh, the, uh,  
                fried pork chop.

597
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:34,258
How was it?                     
               It's mostly gone,
                but delicious.  

598
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,893
    You got this great crunch   
          in the crust,         

599
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,995
      but the pork chop is      
          still moist,          

600
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:39,397
  and the pepper jelly gives it 
        just a little bit       

601
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,865
   of sweet, spicy kick to it   
        right at the end.       

602
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:42,933

 from generation to generation.

 we get one with a little twist,

      in Buffalo, New York,

 a little more sugar than salt.

 measure this?

00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,288
        Yeah, we're gonna need  
       to add a little bit more.
Is it a little soupy?           

659
00:23:44,357 --> 00:23:45,756
                           Yeah.
        Is this                 
starting to look right?         

660
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:47,023
 Yeah, it's starting            
to look a lot better.           

661
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,758
We're ready to get it out       
      of the bowl.              

662
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:51,428
   We set it right up on top,   
tie it up, let the heat rise it.

663
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:56,099
      So we'll let this proof.  
    Oh, this thing looks like...
Balloon ready to pop.           
Gonna take this off.            

664
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:58,168
  We'll just pull enough        
to start off with one pan.      

665
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:00,437
Gonna flour it a little bit.    
          You're just rolling it
               into itself.     

666
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:03,106
Yeah, folding it over.          
                I mean,         
      very slightly kneading it.

667
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:04,975
    You don't want              
to overwork the dough.          
                             No.

668
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,777
     Because the yeast might    
  just get destroyed, you know? 

669
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,380
Here we go. We gotta oil our pan
so the bread don't stick at all.

670
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:11,248
             Pop it in there.   
          Two loaves in one pan?
Yeah.                           

671
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,183
                 Look at that.  
               That's beautiful.

672
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:16,120
   Let it rise. So now we're up,
    we're puffy. Looking good.  
Yep.                            

673
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:17,988
                Oven's set      
           at some temperature. 

674
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,557
Yeah, hot enough.

675
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:23,060
 You just pop it in --          
half-hour, 40 minutes.          

676
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,728
And that's it.                  
                           Done?

677
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,597
        Yeah. We're ready       
  to rock 'n' roll. Here we go. 

678
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,266
That's the finished loaf.       
              So how long are we
              gonna let it rest?

679
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:31,067
We can cut that right now.      

680
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:34,004
     You get the freshest --    
 the fresh bread. Get 'er going.
                         Cut it.

681
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,006
Still really hot,               
    you know?                   

682
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,008
          Oh! Did you see that? 

683
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,344
     The steams                 
just awes everybody.            
                             Oh!

684
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:42,947
You gotta be real careful.      

685
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:44,548
                 That's awesome.
Yeah?                           

686
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:46,150
      I mean,                   
it was just ba-jaw.

00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:50,754
  Slice me off                  
a piece of this.                
         All right. There we go.

689
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:52,689
Mmm! Can you smell that?        

690
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:54,158
Look at that!                   

691
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,894
            No drawn butter.    
         We want the real thing.
Mmm!

       the crust is!

Did you understand that         
    in bread-inese?             

694
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:04,234
                           Yeah.
Oh! Bread's fantastic.          

695
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:06,370
  It's the best bread in town,  
        that's for sure.        

696

      a combination.

 and a little higher.           
              That's ridiculous.

 Mustard on here. And that's it.

The bread's money. It's crunchy.

The reason I come back          

720
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:08,432
is because there's love         
     in the food.               
   Two open beefs. I love it.   

721

that are reinventing themselves,

732
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:35,759
     like the second-oldest     
   restaurant here in Atlanta,

         The Colonnade.

     the Southern classics,     

736
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,733
      but wait till you see     
  what else they're cooking up. 

737
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,869
I'm having kangaroo,            
 and it's delicious.

           Fantastic.           

739
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,205
They mixed it up                
  a little bit.                 
                     It's magic.

00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,615
      The mac and cheese--      
      now that's Southern.      

745
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:01,018
      And yet they still keep up
         with some new things.  

746
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,020
  FIERI: Like blackened halibut 
     with blue cheese butter

It's too good to waste.         
     Just trying to keep up     
         with the times.

        All right, guys,        
         are you ready?         

754
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:22,306
 ...keeping the place the local 
 favorite it always was...      
       Fantastic dish.          

755
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:25,375
  ...when her dad, Paul Jones,  
     bought it back in '79.     

756
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:27,377

       pretty straightforward--

00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:30,447
             good Southern food.
Fried chicken's gonna be        
 the same for 30 years,         

758
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:33,984
    but we needed               
something different.            
       So they brought in       
    a culinary school grad...   

759
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,719
                 Fresh tarragon.
         Chef Ryan Cobb.        

760
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:37,153
       The owners told me       
       on my first day --       

761
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:39,122
  they said, "Okay, here's your 
  apron. This is your kitchen.  

762
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,657
       Make it yours."          

763
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,326
             FIERI:             
  And get a load of what Ryan's 
  doing to classic pulled pork. 

764
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:45,262
                  Redneck sushi.
          Never seen it         
           in my life.          

765
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,197
Quite interesting.              
                          It is.

766
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:50,067
              It's a great twist
                   on sushi.    
  You got to be in it           
to win it on that one.          

767
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:51,601
This is a boneless shoulder?    
                            Yes.

768
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:54,004
        I like to use a dry rub.
Paprika.                        

769
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,006
          You got garlic powder,
               onion powder,    

770
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,607
               salt and pepper, 
                  oil blend,    

771
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:59,143
              just a touch      
         of apple cider vinegar.

772
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:01,078
Apple cider vinegar.            
                Gonna whisk this
                 together here. 

773
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:03,681
          Just gonna rub it here
               on the plate.    
  Now do we have a smoker       
that we're gonna work with?     

774
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:07,084
           Homemade smoker, yes.
What, out of a refrigerator?    
    Take everything out?        

775
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:10,020
              Let me see this   
          contraption you built.
It's got the woodchips          
      underneath,               

776
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:11,554
perforated pan.                 
                           Nice!

777
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,090
It works.                       

778
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:15,693
It's fairly concentrated.       

779
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:18,028
    You smoke it                
for about 45 minutes.           
              Wow. Look at that.

780
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,964
       Wrap it in some plastic  
    so it kind of sweats itself.
  Kind of like                  
a little steamer.               

781
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:24,434
Put belly-to-belly option       
         on two.                
           Belly-to-belly option
                  on two.       

782
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:25,969
                         Hut.   

783
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:28,772
              I like this.      
         Look at all that juice.

784
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,774
That looks great.               
  Look at that.                 

785
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,243
It just falls right off         
of there. You're on it.         

786
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:36,179
     So you just do             
a little pull like this?        
         Toss it in a little bit
           of barbecue sauce.   

787
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:38,181
Then we'll start                
making the sushi?               
                           Yeah.

788
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,183
              I've got some     
         cooked sushi rice here,

789
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:41,718
                 barbecue pork, 
                 fresh scallion.

790
00:28:41,754 --> 00:28:44,655
                     We'll roll.
                     Tuck it in.
Got it.                         

791
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,923
   FIERI: And then get this --  
      they'll batter it...      

792
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:49,392
And then you're gonna           
deep-six this thing?            
         ...and fry it.         

793
00:28:49,462 --> 00:28:52,128
                 She's ready.   
              There you have it.
What do you think?              

794
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:54,264
Great barbecue.                 

795
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,399
I mean, for a countertop        
    thing like that,            

796
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,001
I was really leery.             

797
00:28:58,037 --> 00:29:00,470
 The onion's a nice little kick.
   The chipotle mayo's great.   

798
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:03,474
A little heat on that.          
 Good, man. I like it.          

799
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:04,942
          It's scary, but good. 

800
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:07,611
My very first sushi.            
   Are you ready?               

801
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,813
It's wonderful.                 

802
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:11,815
 I've been eating here 60 years.

803
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:14,818
  I don't care what you order,  
    dear. It's gonna be good.   

804
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:16,887
                        Tray up.
 This is the place              
you got to come to.             

805
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:18,755
 FIERI: For the old favorites...
         It's the best.         

806
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:22,359
     ...and the new ones.       
         It's delicious.        
    You never get a bad meal.   

807
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:25,295
                 Kind of like   
              walking into home.
  Good drinks                   
and good food.                  

808
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,030
    What else                   
can you ask for?                

809
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:30,100
 Every Friday night, you know,  
there's gonna be, like, bison.  
                     Right, elk.

810
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:33,470
                   Raccoon,     
              opossum, squirrel?
No, not yet.                    

811
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:36,773
         FIERI: Up next,        
         Mexican comfort        

812
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:38,041
      in Jackson, Wyoming.      

813
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:41,178
            Mm! Snap!           

814
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:42,646
        And in Chicago...       

815
00:29:42,715 --> 00:29:43,847
                     I dig this.

816
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:46,783
      ...a funky fresh spot     
 ampin' up a breakfast favorite.

817
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:47,851
                 Rock-star dish.

818
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:56,260
                              ♪♪

819
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:58,195
          So, I'm here          
      in Jackson, Wyoming,      

820
00:29:58,197 --> 00:30:00,063
     and I'm about two miles    
     from the center of town    

821
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:01,665
         over in kind of        
        the locals' area.       

822
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:04,001
 Now, when you think of Jackson,
      what do you think of?     

823
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,535
Well, of course, outdoor sports.

824
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:07,537
   But when it comes to food,   
       what kind of food?       

825
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:10,073
   Well, one of the first that  
   would come up is wild game.  

826
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,608
         Then you'd have        
        some steakhouses.       

827
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,076
        But do you think        
        of Mexican food?        

828
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:14,812
         Well, you don't        
    until you try this joint.   

829
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:16,113
         This is Pica's.        

830
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:21,685
                  MAN:          
         Marinated shrimp tacos.

831
00:30:21,754 --> 00:30:23,153
          You can tell          
    that what they're making,   

832
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:25,021
     they're making because     
  they love what they're doing. 

833
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,290
 Chicken mole plate.            

834
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,158
       You know, it's like      
   when you go down to Mexico   

835
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:31,361
  and someone fixes you a dish  
 in a place you'd never expect. 

836
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:32,896
    That's what you get here.   

837
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:35,832
   FIERI: That someone is chef  
    and owner Andy Parazette,   

838
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:38,101
          a So-Cal dude         
    who left behind the surf    

839
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:41,371
    to open up this mountain    
        taqueria in 2001.       

840
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,439
      Were you always           
in the restaurant business?     

841
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,441
               After college,   
              I started cooking 

842
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,309
                 and learned    
              different dishes  

843
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,312
            from different parts
                 of Mexico.     

844
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:50,313
          Posole verde.         

845
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,249
          Posole, for me, is    
       a comfort food, you know?

846
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:53,917
             WOMAN:             
      It's extremely fresh.     

847
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:56,319
     The cabbage, the pork,     
      everything is just --     

848
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,921
          it's amazing.         

849
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,257
            So, we're gonna do  
          the pork posole verde.

850
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:01,591
       And so, what we have here

851
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,193
             is fresh tomatillos
               and jalapeños.   

852
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,596
             Next we take water 
                and fill it.    

853
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:09,466
            They're gonna cook  
           for about 25 minutes.

854
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,735
    We're gonna take a sauté pan

855
00:31:11,804 --> 00:31:15,004
       and take julienned onions
              and garlic.       

856
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,406
And let that just sit           
and caramelize down.            

857
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:18,242
                Yep.            
    So, we're gonna strain this.

858
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:22,446
And then we'll puree them.      
                            Yes.

859
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:27,417
               And then we add  
               a little cumin.  
Ground cumin.                   

860
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,886
    Let 'er rip.                

861
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,024
So, now we're gonna take        
the blended-up tomatillo        

862
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:36,492
and jalapeños and refry it      
        in the pot.             

863
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:39,096
Then we're gonna add            
  the chicken stock             

864
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:41,030
and our salt and pepper.        

865
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,968
While that's cooking,           
I'm gonna cut up our pork.      

866
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:49,172
         And we're gonna cook it
         in this pan with what? 

867
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:51,108
Yellow onion and garlic.        

868
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:54,377
    And cook that               
for about 45 minutes.           

869
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,512
     All right.                 
 Pork's ready to go.            

870
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,781
                PARAZETTE:      
          Everybody in the pool.

871
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:58,515
     Big splash.                

872
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,484
               And our hominy.  

873
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,255
        And we let it cook for  
       another 20 to 30 minutes.

874
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:06,323
                 All right.     

875
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:12,529
             So, fresh cabbage. 

876
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:13,730
                Fresh onion.    

877
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:14,865
               Mexican cheese.  

878
00:32:14,867 --> 00:32:15,932
               Fresh cilantro.  

879
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:17,734
               Twist of lime.   

880
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,469
         And the fried tortilla.

881
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,073
Got a little hot sauce?         

882
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,608
         Mm.                    

883
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,143
And not that this needs         
      hot sauce,                

884
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,746
but there's just something about
all the times I've had posole   

885
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,548
    that I got to have          
a little bit of that tang.      

886
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:38,689
 It's the freshness             
   of the cilantro              

887
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,924
and the crunch of the onion     
     and the cabbage.           

888
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:44,962
And the pork is ridiculous,     
    fall-apart tender.          

889
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:47,097
        Mmm!                    

890
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:48,765
        Snap!                   

891
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:51,168
   There's your posole verde.   

892
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,702
     It's kind of addicting.    

893
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:55,972
            The spicy           
    with the sweet and tangy.   

894
00:32:56,041 --> 00:33:00,176
 When you live in a destination 
    resort like Jackson Hole,   

895
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:03,179
  one of the places you always  
      recommend is Pica's.      

896
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:04,381
And I'm gonna tell you          
    something, man.             

897
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:06,717
This would be outstanding       
     in California.             

898
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:08,318
 This is remarkable             
all the way out here.           

899
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:09,920
     Great job.                 
                   Thanks a lot.

900
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,924
     FIERI: Now we're going     
   from mountains to Midwest,   

901
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:17,260
        where the pork's        
      spicin' up breakfast.     

902
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:19,262
   I'm here in the Bridgeport   
     neighborhood of Chicago    

903
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:21,831
        about a mile away       
  from where the White Sox play 

904
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:24,067
      to check out a place      
   that I hear has great food   

905
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,602
       and a great story,       

906
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,938
      about a family of six     
     that lived above a bar     

907
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:30,540
   that they eventually turned  
    into their own restaurant   

908
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:33,076
     that's serving organic,    
   farm-to-table comfort food.  

909
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:35,012
          This is Nana.         

910
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:37,347
        Chicken sandwich,       
          farm greens.          
           It's just phenomenal.

911
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:41,218
             We have the shrimp 
             and oyster po' boy.
      Today, I'm having         
the duck biscuits and gravy.    

912
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,886
              Oh, I love Nana's.

913
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:45,355
             FIERI:             
  And there really is a Nana... 
 I named it                     
after my mom.                   

914
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:48,425
 ...Mexican-born Maria Solis... 
                     Hi, ladies.

915
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:51,261
         ...whose 4 kids        
   opened this joint in 2009.   

916
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:53,230
       That would be Omar,      
                          Ready?

917
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:54,363
          Christian...          
              Breakfast burrito.

918
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,498
            ...Marco,           
Side of bacon, please!          

919
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,233
          and Michelle.         
            Chilaquiles.        

920
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:59,036
Basically, all we've done       
 is taken a lot of these        

921
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:01,638
 comfort dishes inspired        
by mom's home cooking...        

922
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,373
   FIERI: And gave the recipes  
  to high-end Chef Guy Meikle.  

923
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:08,178
        Huevos ranchero.        
He is on the par with all       
the great chefs in town.        

924
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:10,981
   FIERI: And now he's putting  
 the Nana spin on comfort food, 

925
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:13,249
      like this top seller.     
          Nanadict.             

926
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:14,718
                       The what?
The Nanadict.                   

927
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,654
   Variation on eggs benedict   
          with chorizo.         

928
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:19,722
             We're gonna make   
          the chorizo ourselves.
Correct.                        

929
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:22,125
         I dig this. Okay, so we
          rehydrate the anchos. 

930
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,927
Yep.                            
               So you pull seeds
                and stems now?  

931
00:34:23,996 --> 00:34:26,262
Mm-hmm.                         
             There we go. Hit it
               with the water,  

932
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:29,098
    and just let 'em steep there
              for what?         
About 20 minutes, just till     
  they get nice and soft.       

933
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:31,267
    Yep, they're steeped. You're
     gonna purée 'em right now. 

934
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:33,537
           So now that's puréed.
Right.                          

935
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:36,272
                Now we're making
                    the cure.   
      Fresh garlic,             
fresh thyme, cinnamon...        

936
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:38,542
      That's a mess of cinnamon.
Ground cloves, cayenne,         

937
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:40,676
    dry oregano,                
smoked sweet paprika.           

938
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:42,345
                      So all in.
Our ancho purée.                

939
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,747
                   To the stove.
So we cook off the spices       
    for ten minutes.            

940
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:47,217
                         Got it.
Need to chill it down           
   in an ice bath.              

941
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:50,086
    'cause we can't mix the warm
       product into the cold.   
Ground pork.                    

942
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:52,155
       Where's this coming from?
This is from Gunthorp Farms.    

943
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:54,357
      All right. All of that in.
Mm-hmm.                         

944
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,827
    Okay, we'll let this cure up
          for about a week?     
Yep.                            

945
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:58,761
            So you're constantly
                making this.    
Yeah.                           

946
00:34:58,831 --> 00:35:01,497
                    What's next?
We're just gonna sauté it,      
        olive oil.              

947
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,967
              We add a splash   
          of white wine vinegar.
Cool.                           

948
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:05,769
That's it.                      
       Okay, what are we making?

949
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:08,572
Making poblano cream sauce --   
   fresh poblanos roasted,      

950
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,173
        2 quarts                
of heavy whipping cream.        

951
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:11,641
The whole milk also?            
                            Yep.

952
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:13,176
Doctor.                         
                        Scalpel.

953
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:14,777
How about tomatillos?           
     Tomatillos -- that'll work.

954
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:16,847
I didn't have any scalpel.      
                     Tomatillos.

955
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:19,449
S and P.                        
             A little bit now,  
          little bit at the end.

956
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,985
Okay, so we let this come up    
         to a boil?             
                   Yep. So now  
                 we're gonna add

957
00:35:22,054 --> 00:35:24,320
       our sour cream, cilantro,
         and salt and pepper.   

958
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:26,789
          Hit it                
with the immersion blender.     
                  Mix it all up,
                  and that's it.

959
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:28,191
       Okay, what are we making?
Pupusas.                        

960
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:30,060
                 I see the masa,
                 harina de maiz.
Yep.                            

961
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:32,728
    FIERI: That's corn flour.   
        This is a cheese pupusa?

962
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:35,665
Yep, cheese pupusa, raw milk,   
   jack cheese, olive oil,      

963
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,267
water.                          
                           Okay.

964
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:39,469
Little bit of kosher salt.      
             Okay, so you mix   
          the pupusa thoroughly.

965
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:41,471
            A little extra salt.
Black pepper.                   

966
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,072
         So now you form it out.
2-ounce ball.                   

967
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:44,807
           Now you hit the mold?
Yep.                            

968
00:35:44,877 --> 00:35:48,144
                    There we go.
 Drop the pupusas and home fries
       in the deep fryer.       

969
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:49,879
Little bit of salt.             
                           Okay.

970
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:53,150
Two deep-fried pupusas, home    
 fries, house-made chorizo.     
                      Of course.

971
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:56,019
               Two poached eggs.
Here eggy, eggy, eggy.          

972
00:35:56,088 --> 00:35:57,621
            Poblano cream sauce,

973
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:59,422
wild arugula and spinach        
with orange vinaigrette.        

974
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:02,025
        First, I got to just try
         this chorizo by itself.

975
00:36:02,094 --> 00:36:04,561
       Mmm, tons of flavor. Mmm.

976
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:07,029
      The crunch and the texture
           of the pupusa --     

977
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,631
          mmm -- rock-star dish.

978
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,034
            I knew this guy     
      was gonna be able to do it

979
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,569
           with a name like Guy.
                 Come on.       

980
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:14,103
         The Nanadict --        
         it's fantastic.        

981
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:16,105
 It's the best chorizo          
I think I've ever had.          

982
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:19,308
               Their food       
         just speaks for itself.
        Organic and local       
        sustainable food        

983
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,778
  was something that we wanted  
        to be a part of.        

984
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:24,581
 Chicken sandwich, farm greens. 
       This place does it       
      really, really well.      

985
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:27,250
     It's home-style cooking    
 that is worth leaving home for.

986
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:29,119
  I like coming here.           
This is perfect for me.         

987
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:32,722
 What you have going on in here 
 is what everybody really wants.

988
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:35,191
        Congratulations.        
  Thank you very much.          
Appreciate it. Thank you.       

989
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:37,861
        Nana, thank you.        
            Nice job.           
                         Thanks.

990
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:40,597
        FIERI: Comin' up,       
   we're stickin' to Chi-Town

   for more of mom's recipes.   

992
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:43,867
         Can I kiss you?        
                Congratulations.

993
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:45,401
         Oh, boy, I knew this...

994
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,737
   This time, Italian-style...  

995
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,273
      It's like a real-deal     
     Italian ham and cheese.    

996
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:51,741
         ...and all in.         

997
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:53,977
 You're like a blackjack dealer 
    at the Flavortown casino.   

998
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:04,821
                              ♪♪

999
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:07,356
   So I'll tell you something   
   that happens to me           
   all the time.                

1000
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,625
  Friends will call me and say, 

1001
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:10,627
  "Hey Guy, man, I'm stuck      
  at this airport on a layover  

1002
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:13,029
 "you got any 'Triple D' joints 
 that are close by?"            

1003
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:14,965
    Well I've got one for ya.   

1004
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,234
 I'm about a 15-minute cab ride 
 from Chicago O'Hare            

1005
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:20,370
     and I'm here               
     on North Harlem Avenue     

1006
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:22,705
     to check out               
     some real-deal Italian.    

1007
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,808
   This is Rex Italian Foods.   

1008
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:29,378
               Muffaletta pie.  
This is genuine Italian food.   

1009
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:32,315
             Tortellini salad.  
The best Italian food           
I've ever had.                  

1010
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,517
You feel like you're in Italy   
when you come in here.          

1011
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,787
  FIERI: From the scratch-made  
  food Pina Pinello grew up on  
  back in Sicily                

1012
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:40,457
     to the look and feel of    
     an Italian home.           

1013
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,792
Everybody come in the store     
is like my family.              

1014
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:44,928
 If you're looking for something
that's homemade, made with love,

1015
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,063
  then you've definitely found  
  the right place.              

1016
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:48,264
 FIERI: That's Anthony Pinello, 

1017
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:50,333
        who started out         
        making deliveries       
        in high school.         

1018
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:51,735
         I've got nine sausages 
         going up.              

1019
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:54,137
  FIERI: Now he's cranking out  
  his mom's family recipes      

1020
00:37:54,206 --> 00:37:55,872
             The Arancini is up!

1021
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:58,675
       and rolling out          
       his own creations        
       like this bad boy.       

1022
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:00,209
          Sicilian schiacciata. 

1023
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:03,546
 It's like                      
 this great ball of amazingness.

1024
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:05,815
    If a pizza met a sandwich   
    and had a baby,             

1025
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:07,416
        boom, you've got        
        your schiacciata.       

1026
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,484
Schiacciatas?                   

1027
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,886
                   Schiacciata, 
 it means flattened in Italian. 

1028
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:12,288
All right, let's go.            

1029
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:13,957
       So here we're gonna make 
       our wet ingredients      
       for our dough.           

1030
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:16,826
Okay.                           
                 We put our salt
                 and our sugar  

1031
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:18,228
         and then we put        
        our fresh yeast.        

1032
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:19,963
A bunch of it.                  
                       Mm-hmm.  

1033
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:22,498
   We have our water,           
   we add half to this bowl...  

1034
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:25,301
    Half to the other           
to let that dissolve.           
            Exactly, whisk it.  

1035
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:27,170
It smells great.                
                Combine those.  

1036
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,639
         Then we add            
         our Italian olive oil. 
Whoa!                           

1037
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:31,641
  That's the secret ingredient. 

1038
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,977
So all this goes together       
into the mixer with the flour?  
                        Right.  

1039
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,179
Okay.                           
               Okay, so now     
           let's make the dough.

1040
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:38,114
              Durham flour,     
              high gluten flour.

1041
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:41,918
              Potato granules,  
   also known as potato flour.  
Really?                         

1042
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:43,453
              Yeah, don't ask me
              why we use it,    

1043
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:44,788
     it's just my Nona's recipe.

1044
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:46,856
And you don't question Nona,    
just go with it.                
                 That's right.  

1045
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:50,860
           And now we'll add    
           the wet ingredients. 

1046
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:52,795
We mixed it up,                 
it had a chance to rise.        

1047
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,330
       Then we'll punch it down 
       a little bit.            

1048
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,631
      Now we'll portion it out. 

1049
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,134
      We use about three pounds 
      for one schiacciata.      

1050
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,869
It smells great,                
that fresh yeast.               

1051
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:01,538
         So we put              
         a little flour in here,

1052
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,739
     put a little semolina flour
     into our pan, too.         

1053
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,408
It keeps it from sticking.      
                           Yeah.

1054
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:07,410
   Just once through the top,   

1055
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:09,745
once through the bottom.        
                    That's it.  

1056
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:12,615
Lay it out,                     
pull it to the corners.         
                    That's it.  

1057
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,283
Are we gonna let this proof     
before we top it?               

1058
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:16,886
          Yeah, we let it rise  
                 a little bit.  
Okay, dough's out.              

1059
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:18,621
           So we start building 
           our schiacciata.     

1060
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,490
        Take the mozzarella...  
What are you doing?             

1061
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:23,626
You don't do it on both sides?  
              No, what you do,  
      we're gonna close it up.  

1062
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:26,695
It's a giant calzone?           
    That's a good way to put it.

1063
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:28,231
It's a pizza strudel, basically.

1064
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,099
   This is Italian              
   prosciutto cotto.            

1065
00:39:30,102 --> 00:39:32,168
Cooked prosciutto.              
    Cooked prosciutto, right.   

1066
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:33,903
   Every one knows the dried,   
   cured prosciutto,            

1067
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,173
     that's the one             
     that's kind of like        
     its more famous cousin.    

1068
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:39,376
 In the States we call that ham.
                        Right.  

1069
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:41,511
   Okay, then after that        
   we put the pepperoni down.   

1070
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:44,581
You're like a blackjack dealer  
at the Flavortown casino.       
                   Yeah, right. 

1071
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,717
  And then some fried peppers.  
You fried 'em?                  

1072
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:49,385
Hm-mmm, we use a deep fryer.    

1073
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:51,654
It gives it a little color,     
gives it a little texture,      
and then we add...              

1074
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,456
More cheese.                    
            More cheese, yeah.  

1075
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:55,524
                 Then we just...
     You just put it to bed.    

1076
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,460
         ...fold it over, yep.  
      Press the edges over here.

1077
00:39:57,529 --> 00:40:01,131
This is like,                   
stromboli gone wild.            
 Then we put a little egg wash, 

1078
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:03,400
          we throw a little more
          semolina flour on top 
          and that's it.        

1079
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:04,801
             Then we go straight
            to the oven with it.

1080
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,069
What temp?                      
   450, for about 20 minutes.   

1081
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:08,538
For 20 minutes?                 
                           Yeah.

1082
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,874
Okay, so now it's out of        
the oven, it's cooled down.     
                        Right.  

1083
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:13,409
Now for service?                
   We take it out of the pan.   

1084
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:15,879
     We're gonna cut it         
     in our eight strips.       

1085
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,683
Holy ham and cheese.            

1086
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,952
 Then those strips individually 
 get tossed on the panini grill 

1087
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:25,221
   to give it the grill marks   
   and warm everything          
   else up inside.              

1088
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:27,423
 I can hear the snap, crackle...
Yeah, you can hear the sizzling.

1089
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:29,426
          It's ready to come off
          the panini press.     

1090
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:32,562
      You just cut that in half,
      there you go.             

1091
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:35,765
     Italian ham and cheese     
     with some peppers          
     and some pepperoni.        

1092
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,734
                         Yeah.  

1093
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,771
  Mmm, you've got               
that semolina flour             
  on the outside                

1094
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,307
which gives that nice,          
little, crusty texture.         

1095
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,576
The pepperoni and the ham       
and the peppers                 

1096
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,511
infuse that flavor              
into the dough.                 

1097
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,848
Mmm, prosciutto cotto           
is nice and tender              

1098
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:54,050
and not too salty.              

1099
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:55,918
You know, the fried peppers     
coming in there.                

1100
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:57,854
I mean, mmm, excellent.         

1101
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:00,189
It's like a real-deal           
Italian ham and cheese.         

1102
00:41:00,192 --> 00:41:01,991
        A ham and cheese,       
        Sicilian-style.         

1103
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,127
Sicilian schiacciata.           
        You can't describe it.  

1104
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:06,128
You have to come in here        
and experience it for yourself.

       Brittany Arancini!       

1106
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:09,165
 I'm always torn                
with what to get,               

1107
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:11,134
cold food, salads,              
hot food,                       

1108
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,937
even stuff to take home         
and make yourself.              

1109
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:16,072
I actually grew up with a lot of
the products they sell,         

1110
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:17,740
       and a lot of it          
       you can't find anywhere. 

1111
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:19,408
          I never knew          
          where my nony got it. 

1112
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:21,877
   It's awesome that I have     
   the stuff available to me.   

1113
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:24,480
The passion that the employees  
have for the food               

1114
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:26,149
goes right into the food.       

1115
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:28,351
And to me                       
that makes it great,            
no matter what you have.        

1116
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:30,686
          Sicilian schiacciata. 

1117
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:32,689
Thanks for lettin' us come here.

1118
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,424
       Now on the camera,       
       can I kiss you?          
                Congratulations.

1119
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,758
          Oh boy, I knew this...

1120
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:38,161
   You guys gotta come down here
   and see them.                

1121
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:41,096
So that's it for this road trip,
        but don't worry,        

1122
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:44,433
    we got plenty more joints   
 to find all over this country. 

1123
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,435
     I'll be lookin' for you    
          next time on

1125
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:51,241
     You can see that I was     
        waddling into it.
