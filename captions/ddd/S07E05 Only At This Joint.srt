              IT'S REALLY EXACT 
             ON THE MEASUREMENT.

95
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,223
YEAH, OH, DEFINITELY.           
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.          
             I'M PRETTY         
    MUCH GONNA HAVE TO TRY THAT.

96
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,759
          NOW DO YOU LET        
   THE FLAVORS MARRY FOR A DAY? 

97
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:50,162
 IF IT SETS FOR A LITTLE WHILE, 
    IT GETS A LITTLE BETTER.    

98
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:52,164
       NICE, FRESH, A LITTLE BIT
          OF HEAT, NICE JOB.    

99
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,566
            DO YOU PICK AND EAT 
           OR DO YOU PILE IT ON?

100
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,568
                 WHAT DO YOU DO?
  YEAH, I TEAR OFF              
A QUARTER LIKE THAT.            

101
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,570
     MMM, I THINK THAT THE SALSA
       TOTALLY ACCENTUATES IT.  

102
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,572
               SALSA GETS BETTER
                 BY THE MINUTE. 
YEAH.                           

103

     THE MOTHER-IN-LAW          
WILL BE HAPPY WITH YOU NOW.     

104
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,976
 I THINK YOU'RE MORE INTERESTED

         I'VE EVER HAD.         
     AARON,                     
I GOT TABLE TEN,

         FOUND THIS PLACE AND...
YOU'RE HOME.                    

110
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,590

113
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,530

      BUT THE LAMB IS GOOD.

                   WHY LAMB RIB?

115
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,435
        THERE'S ONE TOWN        
IN CENTRAL TEXAS NAMED GONZALES.

116
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,471

  THEY WOULD LOVE YOU ON MY SHOW
         "GUY'S BIG BITE."      

127
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:59,364
       I ALWAYS GET COMPLAINTS--
        "TOO MANY INGREDIENTS!"

  TROUT ARE JUST                
SO POPULAR UP HERE,             

141
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:32,798

GOOD SMOKED, SO...              
                        WHY NOT?

142
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,133
      SO IT'S JUST A LITTLE

144
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:40,605
AND FOLD IT OVER.               
            OKAY, SO YOU ARE    
       SMOKING IT WITH THE SKIN,

145
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:43,541
   BECAUSE OTHERWISE THAT FLESH 
   WOULD JUST ABSORB THAT SMOKE 

146
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,544
          SO FAST, YOU WOULDN'T 
          HAVE ANY FISH FLAVOR. 

147
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,546
            AND HOW LONG ARE

152
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,359
              I THINK THAT SKIN 
            IS WHAT PROTECTS IT.

 YOU CAN SEE THE BIG SMOKE RIGHT

              SELF-RISING FLOUR,

285
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,440
              TILL YOU GET      
         THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY, 

286
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,442
         ALMOST THE CONSISTENCY

287
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,444

 THE FLOUR STICKS TO IT.        
                      THAT'S IT.

292
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:31,055
     WE HIT IT AGAINST

     NICE, SUCCULENT, FRESH.    

307
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,293

461
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,811
     OKAY, NOW WE GOTTA         
GET WORKING ON THE FLAT TOP.    

462
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,280
 I'M THINKING                   
HOT DOG, BACON.                 

463
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,482
       I THINK SOME RED ONIONS, 
          GREEN BELL PEPPER,    

464
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:41,351
          JALAPEÑOS, OLIVES,    
       OH, SOME ANAHEIM CHILIES.

465
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,554
                SEE THE WAY     
           IT'S COMING TOGETHER?

466
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,757
         CAN YOU FEEL THE MAGIC?
MAYBE A BURGER PATTY            
       ON TOP.                  

467
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,692
I GOT ONE MORE TRICK            
    UP MY SLEEVE.               

468
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,694
  WE GOT BACON                  
MIXED INTO THAT,                

469
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,096
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO GET      
A LITTLE FUNKY WITH THIS.       

470
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:56,234
LIKE A LITTLE                   
BACON BLANKET.                  
              THIS IS A NEW ONE.

471
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:59,170
SERVE THIS UP WITH A REALLY NICE
   ROLAIDS CREAM SAUCE ON TOP.  

472
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,338
ANY OTHER INGREDIENTS           
  I HAVE NOT SEEN?              

473
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,307
           WHAT ABOUT THE CHEESE
              ON THE BURGER?    

474
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,977
           WE COULD HEAT UP     
       SOME OF THE CHEESE SAUCE 

475
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,845
               AND POUR THAT    
          OVER THE DICED BURGER.
I LIKE THE WAY                  
  YOU ROLL.                     

476
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:10,847
    LET'S GET STAT              
ON SOME MAC AND CHEESE          

477
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:12,849
'CAUSE WE'RE READY              
   TO ASSEMBLE.                 
                      ALL RIGHT.

478
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:14,851
                  THUNDER PLATE.
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.              

479
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:17,855
  GO. THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME. 
OKAY, BRING ALL THE WARRIORS IN.

480
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,924
                OH, I THINK     
           A TORTILLA CHIP BASE.

481
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,393
          OKAY. I THINK         
  WE SHOULD START WITH THE MAC. 

482
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,395
               WONDERFULLY DONE.
                 THEN PATTY...  
YEAH.                           

483
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,397
                    AND A LITTLE
                   CHEESE SAUCE.
SOUNDS GREAT.                   

484
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,732
                EXCELLENT.      
         THE SWEET POTATO FRIES.
     GONNA ADD                  
SOME NICE COLOR.                

485
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,734
                        IT DOES.
    I THINK                     
WE GO WITH THIS.                

486
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,736
         SOME OF--SOME OF THAT. 
               FANTASTIC.       

487
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,406
   DROP IN SOME BIG RINGS AROUND
    THE TOP. MORE CHEESE SAUCE? 
SURE.                           

488
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,408
                           YEAH.
    YOU CAN ALWAYS              
USE MORE CHEESE SAUCE.          

489
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,610
       ALWAYS MORE CHEESE SAUCE.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL GARNISH.       

490
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,013
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING
THESE DAYS ABOUT EDIBLE GARNISH.

491
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,749
 TO ME, THAT SAYS EDIBLE. WHERE 
  ARE YOU AT WITH THIS, COWBOY? 

492
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:47,084
   STILL GOT                    
A HOT DOG LEFT.                 

493
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,487
         OHH, WE DO. I LIKE WHAT
          YOU'RE THINKING THERE.
MORE CHEESE SAUCE?              

494
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:51,555
              OH, NICE MOVE.    
           READY FOR THE SECRET?

495
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:54,425
UH-OH.                          
        LITTLE BIT OF CHEETO    
    RIGHT UP ON THE TOP OF THAT.

496
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:57,361
      RIGHT THERE, NOW THAT'S   
  MAC AND CHEESE GONE WILD, HUH?

                I GOT THE BACON.

499
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,767
               I TOP IT OFF WITH
               A LITTLE CHEETO. 

500
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:06,236

     THAT'S A CHAMPIONSHIP BITE.
SPREADIN' IT AROUND.            

501

           (laughing)           

502
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,376

            THIS IS RIDICULOUS. 

503
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,378

00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,275
