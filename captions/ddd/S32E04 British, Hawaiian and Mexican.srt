             Yeah, let's do it. 
                Add some oil.   

54
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,121
              Bit of garlic.    
A lot of bit of garlic.         

55
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,723
  And this has been

Got it.

68
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,810
              So, we're taking  
            this sushi-grade ahi

69
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,411
                 that we use    
            on the sushi line...

70
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,947
 Correct.                       
    ...and we're gonna make this
           for the teriyaki ahi?

71
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,416
      Yes, sir.                 
                   Alright.     

72
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,685
  Cut it into about             
 1/2-pound portion.             

73
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,153
         How long is it gonna go
              in the marinade?  

74
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,623
     Six hours.                 

75
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,024
     Oh, I'll have more of that.

76
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,225
      So, you don't want to have
         too much marinade on it

77
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,026
              to where you lose 
       the flavor of the tuna...

78
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,162
      Yes.                      
             ...but enough that 
              it works with it. 

79
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,665
     Absolutely.                
Onto the grill -- medium rare.  

80
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,700
              That's as simple  
       and as clean as it comes.

                Lemon and...    

82
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,370
It's a drawn butter.            
    It's salted.                

83
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:53,104
   That's what I'm talking about
                right there.    

84
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,773
  I don't get any teriyaki sauce
                on the side?    

85
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,174
   Oh, no.                      
    "You're killin' me, Smalls."

86
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,043
    It's straight               
with the drawn butter.          

87
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:01,112
           When I cut into this,
         it is perfectly seared.

88
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:04,415
     It is literally cold in the
center -- exactly how I like it.

89
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,652
       Little bit of rice to it.

90
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:08,720
             And the butter has 
     that little kick of salt...

91
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,989
Oh, yeah, absolutely.           
     ...a little bit of the fat.

92
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,924
      That is the way to have it
         right there, my friend.

93
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,126
              You weren't lying 
                on that one.    

94
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:15,928
        I wouldn't have done it.
  Glad you like it.             

95
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,395
              Here's the thing  
        that I'm happiest about.

96
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,465
               You didn't take  
     that delicious piece of ahi

97
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,200
         and hammer the marinade
         all the way through it.

98
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,203
    Without question, you really
          get the taste of fish.

99
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,073
     I can see why this has been
          on the menu that long.

100
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,542
                 Well done.     
 Thank you so much.             

101
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,810
        Teriyaki ahi up.        

102
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,811
      It's perfectly cooked     
          and seasoned          

103
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,948
          and has that          
    juicy tenderness inside.    

104
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,115
     I don't think it needs     
           the butter.          

105
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,217
         It's that good.        

106
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,351
      But with the butter,      
     it definitely gives it     

107
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:40,885
   a little something special.  

108
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,020
   What's your favorite thing   
          on the menu?          

109
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,822
                Teriyaki ahi    
               is really good.  

110
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,556
How about yourself?             
     I love the sushi here.     

111
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,959
 This reigns supreme            
as sushi in this area?          

112
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,361
      Because once you have     
         the fish market        

113
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:52,497
       with the sushi bar,      
      you can't beat that.      

114
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,365
  This isn't, like,             
the everyday fish market.       

115
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,835
                         No.    
So, you're bringing whole fish  
in and breaking them down?      

116
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,371
               That's correct.  

117
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,773
This is about a 200-pound       
     local ahi.                 

118
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,108
                    Yellowfin?  
     Yellowfin.                 

119
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,776
                 I'm quick.     
               It's a monster.  

120
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,579
             FIERI:             
   But it's turning bite-sized  
    in this Hawaiian classic.   

121
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,648
     Two avocado poke bowls.    

122
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,184
 It's the most special poke bowl
I've ever had in my entire life.

123
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,788
  The perfect blend of spices,  
 of fresh, fresh fish, and rice.

124
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,124
   If you're an avocado lover,  
       this is your dish.       

125
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,391
         Why aren't you cutting?

126
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,993
    Well, Jared's one of the    
    best cutters we got here.   

127
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,795

128
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,130
         For the big 200-pounder
              that's in there,  

129
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,664
       how long will it take you
             to break that down?

130
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,000
    2-3 minutes.                

131
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:30,135
                 Seriously?     
         I almost said, "Hours."

132
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:32,938
          Why doesn't Jared have
           a cape like Superman?

133
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,140

              like it's butter. 

134
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,741
    Now that we've processed    
            our ahi,            

135
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:40,211
we're gonna be ready to assemble
      our ahi-avocado poke.     

136
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,413
                 Okay, Chef,    
               let's see this.  

137
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,281
      Avocado.                  
  Some white onion.             

138
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,749
Little bit of sea asparagus.    

139
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,952
               Nice, crunchy,   
    just a little touch of salt.

140
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,487
And then we got a little        
kukui nut and green onion.      

141
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,089
   And then we got              
 some Hawaiian salt.            

142
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,958
           That's about as fresh
                as it comes.    

143
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,425
Wasabi aioli on top.            

144
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,961
And then some unagi sauce.      

145
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,028
      People can get this to go.

146
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,297
           They can get it here,
             out of the market. 

147
00:04:58,299 --> 00:04:59,764
Absolutely.                     
               They can get it  
              at the sushi bar. 

148
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:00,832
               They can get it  
                at the table.   

149
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,901
   You can get it               
     everywhere.                

150
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:06,838
              It just wrecks it 
              for everybody...  

151
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,842
   when you have poke in Hawaii,
     how night-and-day different

152
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,377
                    it is       
     from the rest of the world.

153
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:16,247
We take a lot of pride in our   
local fish here, for sure.      

154
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,850
The little sea-asparagus crunch,
               creamy avocado,  

155
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,852
          sharpness of the onion
             with the tenderness

156
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,120
             and the creaminess 
                of the ahi...   

157
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:25,724
              And you know what 
     the other little kicker is?

158
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,658
          As you're biting down,
      you got this soft texture,

159
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,461
         and you get this little
     explosion of that sea salt.

160
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:30,929
  It's really good,             
     local salt.                

161
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,331
               I can't eat it   
                fast enough.    

162
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,732
    Glad you like it.           
                    Mmm!        

163
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,467
                  Like it?      
       Can I try the sesame one?

164
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,869
     Absolutely.                

165
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,537
                Oh, nothing,    
          just moving the spoon.

166
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,006
   When people come in, you give
 them a little taster like this?

167
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,074
       We do.                   

168
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,342
We give them a little bite      
     with that.                 

169
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,343
          That's the wrong thing
             to tell me, buddy. 

170
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,277
        How many sticks you got?

171
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,080
All the sticks you need,        
     my friend.                 

172
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:50,215
           That one was awesome.

173
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,751
      Ahi-avocado poke bowl     
          for table 7.          

174
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,019
         It's delicious.        

175
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,554
  I make the mistake of eating  
        the ahi so fast.        

176
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,089
             WOMAN:             
    Flavors are just awesome.   

177
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,158
       The wasabi gives it      
         a little kick.         

178
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,960

 poke on the island.            

179
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,028
The way they're doing it --     
what makes it so different?     

180
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,030
     It's just local-style,     
          family-style.

224
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,691
             FIERI:             
   And that work ethic is how   
  Chuy Gaytan and his brother,  

225
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,960
    Armando, like to roll --    
             first,             

226
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,828
       moving from Mexico       
       to finish school...      

227
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,964
          How long have you been
               in the States?   
10 years.                       

228
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,633
       ...then eventually,      
along with Chuy's wife, Marcela,

229
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,435
  hitting their goal of opening 
          a restaurant          

230
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:53,104
  serving their family recipes. 

231
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:56,775
  The spices, the way that it's 
  presented is just like home.  

232
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,109
         Chuy's burrito.        

233
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,911
    Chuy's burrito's awesome.   
     The carnitas is great.     

234
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:02,781
     And the unique thing is    
the chili rellenos that's in it.

235
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,583
               So, my buddies   
          Josh and Billy here --

236
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,184
              have you ever had 
   a chili relleno in a burrito?

237
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,519
   I have not.                  
             What do you think? 

238
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,853
     I love it.                 

239
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,455
           Let's get after this.
     Pleasurely.                

240
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,590
    Some carnitas               
for the Chuy burrito.           

241
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,392
      Did your mom make carnitas
    at home when you were a kid?

242
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:15,593
        Yeah.                   
  Yeah, my father.

00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,062
        Lard.                   
    Orange juice.               

244
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,530
        Salt.                   
       Garlic.                  

245
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,131
                     Beer.      
   And the onion.               

246
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,066
How long is this gonna go, Chuy?
    Three hours.                

247
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,868
     So, while that cooks, we're
   gonna make the chili relleno.

248
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,802
 The chili relleno.             

249
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,203
                We start off    
         with the fresh peppers.

250
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,472
      And then                  
put them in the fryer.          

251
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:28,739
          Put them in the fryer?
        Yes.                    

252
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,675
               Just enough to --
 They start peeling.            

253
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,277
             Because if you make
              the chili relleno 

254
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,012
              with the skin on, 
            it's just too tough.

255
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,279
   Exactly.                     
     You got to bite through it.

256
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,514
Just make a little hole.        

257
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,083
         And what kind of cheese
                  is this?      

258
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:39,283
      How many pieces of cheese?

259
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,952
   Three or four.               
             I'm gonna be done. 

260
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,353
      You got to hurry up, Chuy.

261
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,955
     Come on.                   
         Now we go to the flour?

262
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,490
   Just flour up.               
                  Next up?      

263
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,091
  Make the batter.              
     Egg whites.                

264
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,760
            So, we're gonna make
              a meringue first. 

265
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,094
       Flour.                   
               And the yolks.   

266
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,363
  The whole thing.              
    Don't worry.                

267
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,230
                    All of it?  
     Yeah, yeah.                

268
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,898
          God, you're an animal,
                    Chuy.       

269
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,700
               Nice and light.  
             Float it in there. 

270
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,235

              Once it's done... 

271
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,502
      Make the burrito.         
                    Okay.       

272
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,237
     Carnita.                   
                Very strange.   

273
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,841
 I've never seen a chili relleno
                in a burrito.   

274
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:03,908
Throw on the tortilla.          

275
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,112
                [ Whistles ]    

276
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:08,179
            The guacamole sauce.

277
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:11,249
    And wrap it.                

278

279
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,253
                Chuy, I know    
         it's hard to believe --

280
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,590
         I've had a few burritos
                 in my day.     
   [ Laughs ]                   

281
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:19,991
                  I've had      
             peppers and onions.

282
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,994
But having the chili relleno and
the texture inside of a burrito,

283
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,996
               I've never had.  

284
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,932
             This is a great way
             to incorporate it. 

285
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,333
                  I see why     
           you call it the Chuy.

286
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,134
     You don't look like you eat
                any of them.    

287
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,536
    Oh, come on.                

288
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,471
  You get a lot of chili flavor,
         a good balance of meat.

289
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,140
  It's not overloaded with meat.

290
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:36,875
      Nice, fresh pico de gallo.

291
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,877
                    Mmm!
