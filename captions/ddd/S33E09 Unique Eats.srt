    South India is more based   
       on rice and lentils      

277
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,088
 and the spices are more subtle

      I have a masala dosa.

00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,181
     Add a little salt, tumeric,

379
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,583
         and it cooks for, like,
                 15 minutes     

380
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,987

   paste, and then the tomatoes.
