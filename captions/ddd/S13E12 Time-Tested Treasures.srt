MM-HMM.                         

109
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,425
           RODRIGO, WHAT ARE WE 
               DOIN', CHEF?     

110
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:47,759
RIGHT NOW WE'RE DOING,          
     UH, GUARACHE.              

111
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,361
       GUARACHE! MEANS LIKE     
   FLIP-FLOP, MEANS LIKE SANDAL?

112
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,897
A SANDAL.                       
             GIVE US A RUNDOWN. 

113
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,031
CORN FLOUR.                     
                           MASA.

114
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,566
MASA. AND A LITTLE BIT          
       OF WATER.                

115
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,168
             NOW YOU MIX THIS   
           WITH YOUR FEET, JOE. 

116
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,502
             AND A LITTLE SALT. 
A LITTLE BIT OF SALT.           

117
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,504
         YOU WANT TO GET THIS   
       JUST TO THE RIGHT POINT. 

118
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,972
            IT'S NICE AND LIGHT 
                 AND FLUFFY.    
YES.                            

119
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,442
REFRIED BEANS.                  
           MAKE A CUP. FILL IT. 

120
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,642
THAT'S--                        
                       FOLD IT. 

121
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,311
         THAT LOOKS LIKE        
       A LITTLE FOOTBALL.       

122
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,180
         EVERYTHING LOOKS LIKE  
      A LITTLE FOOTBALL TO YOU. 
       (laughs) IT DOES.        

123
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:10,081
    NOW YOU JUST ROLL THIS OUT, 
 AND THEN WE'RE GONNA COOK THIS 

124
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,582
   ON THE FLATTOP WHILE WE COOK 
          THE AL PASTOR?        

125
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:12,718
                       CORRECT. 

126
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,388
LOOK AT THOSE GUARACHES,        
          MAN!                  

127
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:20,325
 OAXACA CHEESE. AND THIS CHEESE 
   RIGHT HERE COMES IN A BALL.  

128
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,393
    AND YOU PEEL IT OFF.        
IT'S KIND OF LIKE MOZZARELLA.   

129
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,263
                     AL PASTOR. 

130
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:26,732
OKAY.                           

131
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,402
A LITTLE PARM CHEESE.           

132
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:31,469
                    PARMESAN?   
               IN MEXICAN FOOD? 

133
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:32,937
YEAH. (laughs)                  
                         OKAY.  

134
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,072
JALAPEÑO SAUCE.                 
                           OKAY.

135
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,007
                     SOUR CREAM.

136
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:38,143
     NOW YOU GOT YOUR RED SAUCE.

137
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,878
AND AVOCADO.                    
                    THE KEY IS, 

138
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,881
      YOU'VE GOTTA SEASON IT    
   CORRECTLY, COOK IT CORRECTLY.

139
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,082
           IT'S GONNA HAVE THAT 
                 CHAR TO IT,    

140
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,018
    SO COOKING IT ON THE FLATTOP
    IS CRITICAL.                

141
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:50,021
THE MEAT IS TENDER ENOUGH.      
   IT'S NOT OVERCOOKED.         

142
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:51,089
YOU TASTE THE CHEESE.           

143
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,191
THE AVOCADO GIVES IT            
  A NICE FRESHNESS.             

144
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,427
 THE SALSA GIVES YOU            
THAT LITTLE BIT OF...           

145
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,763
(sniffles) MY NOSE IS RUNNING.  

146
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,164
                   LISTEN. YEP. 

147
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,566
        WHAT YOU JUST HEARD     
   IS GUY FIERI'S CAREER ENDING.

148
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,802
           THERE'S NOT TOO MUCH 
              OF ANY ONE THING. 

149
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,639
   (mouth full) I MEAN, THIS IS 
    THE REAL DEAL. I'M SERIOUS. 

150
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,775
AND I EAT A LOT OF MEXICAN FOOD.
          OUTSTANDING.          

151
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,046
ANY RESTAURANT                  
THAT CAN GET BY                 

152
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,313
WHERE THERE'S NO PLACE          
TO SIT DOWN, REALLY--           

153
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:16,315
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE FOOD.        

154
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,782
         OH, YOU GOTTA LOVE IT. 
OH, YEAH.                       

155
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,718
            (Rodrigo)           
       TACOS, ENCHILADOS.       

156
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:21,386
           GUY, JOE!            
          (Joe) WHAT?           

157
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:23,555
     WE'RE COMIN', WE'RE COMIN'!
        YOU WANT A LAMB TACO,   

158
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,724
       HE MAKES YOU DO THE WORK 
              AROUND HERE.      
    HAVE US RUNNING AROUND.     

159
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:26,925
                  COME ON, JOE. 

160
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,526
    OF COURSE I GOTTA ALWAYS    
        GET THE BACK END.       

161
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,929
      THANK YOU VERY MUCH.      
                 RODRIGO,       
         WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT? 

162
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,730
WE'RE ABOUT TO DO               
SOME LAMB TACOS.                

163
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,132
  WE'RE GONNA CHOP IT UP        
AND ROAST THE WHOLE THING.      

164
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:38,070
 (Joe) NO PROCESSED STUFF HERE. 

165
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,404
             SO YOU GOT THE LAMB
                BROKEN DOWN.    

166
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,606
   SO DO YOU HAVE A CERTAIN WAY 
   THAT YOU STACK THIS IN HERE? 

167
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,208
  WE WANT TO MAKE SURE          
THIS MEAT IS EXPOSED SO--       

168
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,810
AND MAKE SURE IT'S COOKED.      
                           NEXT?

169
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,811
 PUTTING THE--                  
THE VEGETABLES.                 

170
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,480
         SO YOU GOT SOME ONIONS 
           AND SOME TOMATOES.   

171
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,281
AND YOU USE A LITTLE BIT        
     OF BEAN PASTE.             

172
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,017
                BASICALLY WE'RE 
                   BRAISING IT. 
CORRECT.                        

173
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,418
(speaks indistinctly)           
          THIS IS THE REAL KEY. 

174
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,220
      NOW<i> THESE</i> YOU HAVE TO GET 
     SENT IN FROM MEXICO, RIGHT?

175
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,021
YES, THEY'RE FROM MEXICO.       
           AVOCADO TREE LEAVES. 

176
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,290
           YOU WON'T RECOGNIZE  
       THE FLAVOR SPECIFICALLY. 

177
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,426
   IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE GONNA   
 HAVE A LEAF FROM AN ORANGE TREE

178
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,094
         OR YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE
         TO SMELL IT LIKE THAT, 

179
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,830
                  BUT IT IS     
             REAL UNIQUE FLAVOR.

180
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:06,365
                 A LITTLE SALT? 
A LITTLE SALT.                  

181
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,433
     THESE BANANA LEAVES, MAN-- 
       THIS IS THE WAY TO GO,   

182
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,702
          BECAUSE THEY'RE WAXY. 
         IT HOLDS THE MOISTURE, 

183
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,772
 AND THIS WAS YOUR PLASTIC WRAP 
           IN MEXICO.           

184
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:16,841
I NEED THE FOIL.                
        WHAT TEMPERATURE ARE WE 
        GONNA COOK THIS OFF AT? 

185
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,444
 AT 450 DEGREES                 
FOR 4 TO 5 HOURS.               

186
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,579
WE'RE GONNA GET                 
 THE LAMB OUT.                  
               YOU LOOKED AT ME 

187
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:22,914
                WHEN YOU SAID   
           TO GET THE LAMB OUT. 

188
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,248
                         UH--   
   YES. YEAH.                   

189
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,117
      HERE. GIVE ME THIS.       
ARE YOU READY?                  

190
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,653
   I GOTCHA. YOU DIDN'T HAVE    
     TO SAY ANYTHING MORE.      
                     (laughing) 

191
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,255
                 I JUST THOUGHT 
                THAT THIS WAS-- 
     ME AND YOU, RODRIGO.       

192
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,723
              THIS IS MORE--    
           YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS. 
 (speaking indistinctly)        

193
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,991
         I MEAN, THIS IS YOUR-- 
        WHAT--WHAT KIND         
       OF A POSE IS THAT?       

194
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,794
         I DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST 
        TRYING TO GET YOU DOWN. 
       WHAT IS THIS?            

195
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,462
                 I DON'T KNOW.  
              YOU--YOU SHOW ME. 
       ARMS EXTENDED.           

196
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,264
                     YES. OKAY. 
      A LITTLE BIT. NOT--       
    NOT WITH YOUR KNEES OUT.    

197
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,665
    YOUR KNEES HAVE TO GO       
    STRAIGHT AHEAD.             

198
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:41,732
                STRAIGHT AHEAD? 
          THERE IT IS.          

199
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,334
        I GOT IT. I GOT--       
WHERE YOU GOING?                

200
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,469
       NO, WE GOTTA GET--       
    WE GOTTA GET THE HANDLE.    
GET THE HANDLE.                 

201
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,070
I GOT FLIP-FLOPS.               
THIS IS NOT GOOD.               

202
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,272
                  HANG ON.      
WATCH IT.                       

203
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:48,806
           ALL RIGHT?           
(speaks indistinctly)           

204
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:51,009
     HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING     
        MORE RIDICULOUS?        

205
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,611
           THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
         WHAT DO YOU DO         
      WHEN WE'RE NOT HERE?      

206
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,345
IT WAS A BIG LAMB.              
 IT'S A BIG LAMB.               
        IT<i> IS</i> A BIG LAMB.       

207

519
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,069
(laughs)                        
            ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO 
                FRY SOMETHIN'.  

520
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,271
ALL RIGHTY.                     

521
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:28,606
OKAY, SO A BUNCH                
 OF THE BATTER.                 

522
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,941
AND YOU WATER IT DOWN?          
                     JUST A BIT 

523
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,543
                  TO THIN OUT   
             JUST A LITTLE BIT. 

524
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,745
    IT GETS A LITTLE TOO HARD   
 IF YOU HAVE TOO THICK A BATTER.

525
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:37,147
JUST GETS TOO HARD              
   OF A CRUNCH?                 
                           YEAH.

526
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,415
          AND SOME PLAIN FLOUR. 

527
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:41,619
OKAY.                           
                  SALT, PEPPER. 

528
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,487
   I LIKE THAT YOU'RE           
LIBERAL WITH THE PEPPER.        

529
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,756
AND WHOSE RECIPE WAS THIS?      
              MY GRANDPARENTS', 

530
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:48,759
           AND HAS BEEN KIND OF 
               PASSED ON--      
BUT YOU HAVEN'T MESSED WITH IT? 

531
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,295
         NO. WE--WE TRY TO DO IT
              THE SAME WAY.     

532
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,430
     GET A FEW PIECES OF CHICKEN
          IN THERE FOR YOU.     

533
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,633
SO IT GOES INTO THE WASH,       
STICKS TO IT A LITTLE BIT.      

534
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,368
                MOVE IT AROUND. 
SO NO WET HAND/DRY HAND         
     ON THIS TEAM?              

535
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,370
                      NO.       

536
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,639
               YOU JUST WHEEL IT
                  RIGHT OVER?   

537
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,641
YEP, GET IT RIGHT               
INTO THE GREASE.                

538
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,175
    THIS THING LOOKS A LITTLE-- 
SHAKY? (laughs)                 

539
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,979
        YEAH! "SHAKY" WOULD BE  
       THE WORD I WAS GONNA USE.

540
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,447
           (sizzling)           
AND THAT'S IT. 17 MINUTES--     

541
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:11,848
             HOW MANY--HOW MANY 
               PIECES WOULD--   

542
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,251
           17 MINUTES? (laughs) 
YES.                            

543
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:15,253
               WHAT TEMPERATURE 
            IS THAT RUNNIN' AT? 
315.                            

544
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,521
     COOKS SLOW SO IT COOKS     
 THE CHICKEN ALL THE WAY THOUGH,

545
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:18,990
        THEN IT GETS IT NICE    
     AND CRISPY ON THE OUTSIDE. 

546
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,123
CORRECT.                        

547
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,725
              IT'S GONNA BE     
       SOME GOOD FRIED CHICKEN. 

548
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,529
                       WE DONE? 
YEAH. WE'RE READY.              

549
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,732
         PUT IT TOGETHER        
  WITH COLE SLAW, POTATO SALAD. 

550
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,467

HAS A BREAST...                 

551
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,202
A THIGH...                      
   EVIDENTLY, HE HAS NO FEELING 
          IN HIS FINGERS,

554
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,074
         THERE'S A SHORT-LEGGED 
                CHICKEN?        

555
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,408
          WHO WALKS IN CIRCLES. 

556
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,211
 A LOT OF PEOPLE CALL           
THIS THIGH SHORT LEGS.          

557
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,346

AND SOME HUSH PUPPIES FOR YA.

561
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,089
            WHEN YOU COOK IT    
         LOW AND SLOW LIKE THAT,

562
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:54,559
           YOU COOK THE FAT OUT,
            YOU COOK THE MEAT.  

563
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,894
                       MMM!     

564

       WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL,

577
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,589

578
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,058
           SORRY, MOM.
