IN LASAGNA SURGERY HERE         

147
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,009
AT FLAVOR TOWN MEMORIAL.        

148
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,877

     I EXPECT A FULL RECOVERY,  

156
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,894
               PROBABLY WITHIN

           ALL OVER THE COUNTRY,

383
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,300

 FIRST THING WE'RE GONNA PUT IN 
   IS BUTTER, THEN THE LEEKS.   

404
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,618
 WE'LL LET THESE JUST SWEAT DOWN
          A LITTLE BIT.

415
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,712
       AND THEN WE JUST LET THAT
         COME BACK TO A BOIL.   

416
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:23,714
  RIGHT NOW THERE'S

IT'S ALL FRESH.                 

472
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,546
KIND OF REMINDS YOU OF GRANDMA  
COOKING SOMETHING ON THE FARM.  

473

       <i> AND AROUND HERE,</i>

         <i> FAMILY RECIPE.</i>        

475
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,154
WELL, WE'RE GONNA USE           
SOME YELLOW CORNMEAL            

476
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,022
THAT IS LOCALLY GROWN.          
                         OH, OH!

477
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:48,091
          SELF-RISING CORNMEAL, 

478
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,093
       SO THERE'S SOME LEAVENING
         AGENTS ALREADY IN IT.  

479
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,030
YES, AND SALT.                  
             THAT'S A GOOD START
            WE DID RIGHT THERE--

480
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,099
                 DIDN'T COME OUT
                    OF A BOX.   
ADD SOME FLOUR                  

481
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,767
AND SOME SUGAR.                 
                      (whistles)

482
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,302
SEE? IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.        

483
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:01,238
MY SECRET INGREDIENT.           
            IT'S A SAVORY SPICE.

484
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,375
ALL RIGHT, THEN WE'RE GONNA PUT 
     EIGHT EGGS IN THERE.       

485
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,912
                 NOW MUCH MILK  
              ARE WE PUTTING IN?
MOST OF THIS.                   

486
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,914
WE'LL STIR IT AND SEE.          
                YOU'RE GAMBLING,
                  AREN'T YOU?   

487
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,649
MM-HMM, STIR THIS UP.           

488
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,918
          IS THAT THE CREAMINESS
         THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR?
WE ARE RIGHT AT IT.             

489
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,920
        AND WE'RE GONNA PUT THIS
            IN A HOT SKILLET.   

490
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,990
THAT SKILLET'S                  
DONE SOME TIME.                 

491
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,058
WE'RE GONNA PUT SOME...         
            BUTTER-FLAVORED OIL.

492
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:23,995
WE'RE GONNA FILL IT UP.         
     LOOK, IT'S ALREADY STARTING
          TO FORM UP CRUST.     

493
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,997
MM-HMM.                         
   THAT PAN IS SO HOT RIGHT NOW,
            YOU CAN'T--         

494
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,332
 MY HANDS FROM HERE--IT'S STILL 
     TOO HOT TO BE NEXT TO.     

495
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,735
THEN WE'RE GONNA TOP IT         
WITH SOME BROWN SUGAR.          

496
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:33,938
    NOW HOW LONG,               
AND WHAT TEMPERATURE.           
                          425...

           FOR ABOUT 25 MINUTES.

498

WHAT DO YOU THINK?              

499
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,410
          LOOK AT THAT. SO      
     WHAT ARE THOSE OVER THERE? 

500
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:44,348
WHAT?                           
            OH, I GUESS NOTHIN'.

501
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,284
             LOOK AT THE STEAM  
          COMIN' OFF THAT THING.

502
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:49,353

              A PIECE OF THIS.  
LIKE THAT CRUNCHY STUFF.

          MMM, THAT TASTES GREAT
              JUST BY ITSELF.   

504
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,891
             IT'S MOIST,        
     A LITTLE BIT OF SALT TO IT.

505
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,426
                     MMM, SWEET.
SWEET.                          

506
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:57,161
            I GET SOME OF THAT  
           BUTTER NOTE FROM IT, 

507
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:58,762

                  MMM.

            SO SWEET ON THE TOP,

509
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,233

             SUGAR NUGGET I GOT,

510
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,968
             THAT'S ALMOST LIKE 
             A DONUT OR A SCONE.

511
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,970

          FOR A BREAD.
