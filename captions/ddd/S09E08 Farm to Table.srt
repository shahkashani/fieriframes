THE OTHER FLAVORS.              

105
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,778
    I'M NOT KIDDING YOU,        
I'M GONNA TAKE ONE MORE BITE.   

106
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,715
 I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS,       
BUT I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU.     

107
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:13,585
 MMM. I WILL BE BACK,           
AND I WILL ORDER THAT.          
                        AWESOME.

108
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:16,521
       BIG BROWN BURGER.        
              BACON ON A BURGER,
                YOU CAN'T MISS. 

109
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,257
            AND THEN IT'S GOT   
        THAT CHEESE SAUCE ON IT.

110
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,792
                 IT WAS AWESOME.
   (man) IT'S ONE OF            
OUR MOST FAMOUS DISHES.         

111
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,662
PUTTING IT HERE ON A BURGER     
    IS JUST FANTASTIC.          
           CUBANO UP.           

112
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:27,332
   YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH      
ANYTHING THAT YOU ORDER HERE.   
    A LITTLE CHICKEN SAUCE.     

113
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,734
 <i> FROM FRESH FRIED CHICKEN...</i>   
       CRISPY.                  
IT TASTES WONDERFUL.            

114
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,803
   <i> TO SOUP AND CORNBREAD...</i>    
        FRESH, JUST LIKE        
        EVERYTHING ELSE.        

115
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,939
        <i> AND THREE KINDS</i>        
       <i> OF SANDWICH BREAD.</i>      

116
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,008
 WE MAKE A LIGHT RYE, A COUNTRY 
    WHITE AND A WHOLE WHEAT.    

117
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,811
               THE BREAD REALLY 
             MAKES THE SANDWICH.
 BREAD MAKES                    
THE SANDWICH.                   

118
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,081
SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA MAKE?      
            WE'RE GONNA MAKE    
       SOME COUNTRY WHITE BREAD.

119
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,750
              I'M GONNA THROW IN
               SOME WARM WATER. 
DRY-ACTIVE YEAST                

120
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,819
  AND THEN FEED IT              
WITH A LITTLE SUGAR.            

121
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,688
   NOW GIVE HER                 
A LITTLE MIXY-MIX.              
                           MIXY.

122
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,823
OKAY, SO THE YEAST IN THAT      
      HAS ACTIVATED.            

123
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,692
HOW MANY GALLONS OF FLOUR?      
                      3 GALLONS.

124
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,961
3 GALLONS OF HIGH GLUTEN.       

125
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,562
YOU WANT THAT ELASTICITY        
    WITH THE GLUTEN.            
                      SOME SALT.

126
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:58,897
            HIT THE GREEN BUTTON
                   FOR ME.      

127
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,099
SO THIS TAKES ABOUT FIVE MINUTES
        TO COME TOGETHER.       
ALL RIGHT.                      

128
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:04,235
SO WE'RE GONNA PULL IT OUT,     
    GET IT INTO A BOWL.         
     COVER IT WITH SOME PLASTIC.

129
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,839
WE LET IT PROOF.                
       WE'VE LET OUR DOUGH RISE.
             IT'S DOUBLED.      

130
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,509
SO SMACK IT DOWN.               
                       SMACK IT.

131
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:13,644
     I'M JUST GONNA LIGHTLY DUST
           THE AREA. WHOO.      

132
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,914
        SO WE'RE GONNA CUT THIS,
                WEIGH IT.       

133
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,782
      3 1/2 POUNDS              
IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING FOR.       
                   3 1/2 POUNDS.

134
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,252
THAT MIGHT BE CLOSE             
       TO ON.                   
            I THINK IT MIGHT BE.

135
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:23,555
  OKAY, LET'S SEE HERE.         
JUST OVER BY A 1/2 POUND.       
          JUST OVER, NOT SO BAD.

136
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,591
WELL...                         
                      YOUR TURN.

137

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.           

138
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,995
     OH, NO. NO, YOU'RE BENDING 
         YOUR FINGER ON IT.     

139
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,999
I WAS JUST KEEPING IT BALANCED  
          OVER HERE.            
               I KNOW THE TRUTH.

140
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,935
    WE'RE GONNA BUST 'EM OUT.   
WE'RE JUST GONNA KNEAD A LITTLE.

141
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,070
      WE JUST WANT TO MAKE IT   
   LONG ENOUGH FOR THE LOAF PAN.

142
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,672
YOU WANT ME TO SPRAY THAT?      
        NOW WE'LL PUT THE LOAVES
               IN THE PAN.      

143
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,876
  THOSE WILL PROOF UP.          
THAT'S GONNA TAKE ABOUT--       
              PROBABLY ABOUT 30.

144
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,611
    WHAT TEMPERATURE            
ARE WE GONNA BAKE IT AT?        
                            350.

145
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,945
IN FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES.        

146
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,615
   THEN WHEN WE PULL IT OUT     
OF THE OVEN, WE'LL LET IT REST. 
                        EXACTLY.

147
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,351
                      ALL RIGHT.
WHOA.                           

148
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,485
THAT IS MASSIVE.                

149
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:56,287
LOOK AT THAT.                   

150
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,357
CAN I TRY A PIECE?              
                      OF COURSE.

151
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,891
THAT IS DOWN-HOME GOODNESS      
       RIGHT THERE.             

152
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,560
  SO NOW THAT WE GOT THIS DONE, 
 WHAT ARE WE GONNA MAKE WITH IT?

153
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,429
PRETTY SNAZZY SELECTION

155
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,633
 DO YOU GUYS MAKE               
YOUR OWN PIMIENTO?              
     PIMIENTO CHEESE, OF COURSE.

156

I'M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING,   

166
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,459
YOU DON'T BUY PIMIENTO CHEESE

           THEN WE GET IN THERE 

297
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,024
   AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS  
DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE MEAT.

298
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,828
      THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART. 
     I LIKE THE TEXTURE OF THIS.

299
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,296
           IT'S KIND OF FREAKY, 
             BUT, YOU KNOW...   

300
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,032
NOW WE'RE GONNA TAKE THIS       
AND JUST COOK IT RIGHT UP?      
          YES, RIGHT TO THE PAN.

301
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,967
   SO WHEN YOU FRY IT, YOU DON'T
    HAVE TO FRY IT SUPER LONG,  

302
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,636
        AND YOU KNOW IT'S COOKED
          ALL THE WAY THROUGH.  
RIGHT. RIGHT.                   

303
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,839
              ONCE THIS IS DONE,
               WE COOL IT DOWN. 
YES, SIR.                       

304
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,175
           SO IT'S BEEN COOLING 
            FOR A LITTLE WHILE, 

305
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,909
   AND WE HAVE OUR COOKED RICE. 

306
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:54,779
           I'M GONNA MIX THIS UP
                 BY HAND.       
NO BINDER, HUH? JUST THE RICE   
    IS GONNA WORK ENOUGH.       

307
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,848
THAT AND THE FAT OF THE--       
           THE RICE AND THE FAT.

308
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,650
AND THAT'S IT.                  
 INTERESTING.                   
       THESE GO GREAT WITH BEER,
              BY THE WAY.       

309
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,052
NO. WHO WOULD THINK THAT?       
              THEN WE DREDGE 'EM
                IN SOME FLOUR   

310
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,122
                      AND SOME--
   THEN BUTTERMILK              
SETS UP ON THE FLOUR.           

311
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:06,791
                AND BREADCRUMBS.
   NON-SALTED BREADCRUMB.       
YEP, NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.   

312
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,527
             AND WE'LL FRY THESE
               AT 350 DEGREES?  
4 TO 5 MINUTES.                 

313
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:10,862
      BROWN UP ON THE OUTSIDE...
OUTSIDE.                        

314
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,332
    BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY COOKED.
ONTO MY LITTLE PAPER            
AND ONTO THE PLATE.             

315
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,136
   AND A LITTLE PARSLEY GARNISH.
           THERE THEY GO.       
  CRACKING INTO IT,             
IT'S LIKE A HILI BALL.          

316
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:20,538
        MMM. WOW.               
THERE IS SO MUCH FLAVOR.        

317
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,607
  YOU DID A NICE JOB            
WITH HOW YOU FRIED IT.          

318
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,609
IT'S NOT OILY BY ANY MEANS.     

319
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,878
THE RICE WASN'T OVERCOOKED,     
    SO IT STAYS TENDER.         

320
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,746
I THINK YOU'D REALLY SURPRISE   
      PEOPLE WITH THIS.         
    HERE'S YOUR FRITTERS.       

321
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,549
      GOOD TEXTURE TO IT,       
           GOOD ZING.           
          ONE ORDER OF BOUDIN.  

322
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,751
     THE RICE IS VERY FRESH,    
 AND IT'S A LITTLE TANGY TO IT. 

323
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,287
   THE FLAVORS ALL COMPLEMENT   
          EACH OTHER.           
                 TABLE 12.      

324
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:37,688
ALL THE FOOD IS VERY, VERY GOOD.

325
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,756
     TWO LOW COUNTRY BOILS.     

326

     WHATEVER'S ON THE MENU,    

327
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,694
     I KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL      
    GONNA HAVE A GREAT MEAL.    
GOOD ENERGY, NICE PEOPLE.       

328
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:45,563
             PLEASURE TO SEE YA.
                 YOU HAPPY?     

329

                 GOOD DEAL.     

330
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,833
YOU GOT IT GOING, MAN.          
            THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

       OF PING-PONG RESTAURANTS?
     NO, THIS IS THE FIRST.     

334
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,581
    ON TRIPLE "D," WE'VE SHOT   
        AT A GAS STATION.       

335
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,851
    WE'VE SHOT AT A CAR WASH.   
    SHOT AT A BOWLING ALLEY.

 IN THE BACK OF A LIQUOR STORE. 

337
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,189
          SO JUST WHEN          
     YOU MIGHT BE THINKING,     

338
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,524

          ITALIAN FLOUR,

     HIGH GLUTEN, REALLY SILKY, 

357

            WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR...
SO A LITTLE COLOR,              
A LITTLE TEXTURE.

               A BUNCH OF SALT,

STRAIGHT IN.                    
                   NOTHING ELSE.

360
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,245
    WE HAVE A SECRET INGREDIENT,
       DIAGNOSTIC MALT POWDER.  
REALLY?                         

361
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,579
        IT HELPS WITH THE RISE. 

362
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,648
           IT ADDS A LITTLE BIT 
              OF CHEW TO IT.    

363
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:11,715
                          WATER.
ROOM TEMPERATURE?

     COMBINE IT, THREE MINUTES. 

365
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:17,321
AND THEN KICK IT UP             
  ANOTHER LEVEL?                
          YEAH, AND THEN IT GOES
              FOR THREE MORE.   

366
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,589

PULL IT OUT.

A FLOURED 5-GALLON BUCKET.

YOU PUNCH IT DOWN TWICE         

371
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,333
AND THEN BRING IT OUT

SALT...                         
             RIGHT ON THE DOUGH.

396
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,454
A LITTLE BIT OF PEPPER,

THE AVERAGE TIME TO COOK        
     IN THAT OVEN?              
         JUST ABOUT TWO MINUTES.

404

             THE TEMPERATURE.   

410
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:57,621
           YOU DON'T EVEN NOTICE
            THERE'S NO CHEESE,  

411

                            YEP.

494
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:03,074
         IT'S SO HOT THAT       
   IT JUST CHARS UP ALL THE FAT.

495
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,609
THEN YOU PULL IT OUT,           
  FINISH IT OFF...              
       IN THE CONVENTIONAL OVEN.

496
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,679
      GET IT UP                 
TO WHAT TEMPERATURE?            
          THE MEAT WE DO TO 160,

497
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:11,615
    AND WHEN IT COMES OUT OF    
THAT OVEN, THE SKIN IS GORGEOUS.

498
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:15,152
NICE AND CARAMELIZED            
     ON THE TOP.                

499
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,421
MMM!                            

500
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,690
     I'M SORRY.                 
THAT'S NOT FANTASTIC.           

501
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,560
THIS IS GOING INTO WHAT?        
            THIS GOES INSIDE    
       OF A CALZONE--THE PHILLY.

502
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,297
THE PHILLY-ME-UP.               
                            YEP.

503
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,632
LET'S DO IT.                    
                 LET'S DO IT UP.

504
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,500
SALT, TINY BIT OF PEPPER.       

505
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:32,436
THEN A NICE BASE.               
         I LOVE THIS GARLIC OIL.

506
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:33,571
ROASTED PIECES OF PORK--        

507
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,572
     LAY THEM OUT               
INSIDE OF YOUR CALZONE.         

508
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,508
WE DO BROCCOLI RABE--           
    SAUTé IT UP--               

509
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,177
GARLIC, SALT, LEMON ZEST.       

510
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:40,444
STICK THOSE IN THERE.           

511
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,647
THEN TAKE SOME SLICES           
OF PROVOLONE CHEESE.            

512
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,649
           THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE?
THAT'S IT.                      

513
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,783
SO YOU TAKE THAT GUY,           
WRAP IT UP LIKE THIS,           

514
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,854
TRADITIONALLY FOLD IT OVER.     
          A LITTLE HOLE IN IT   
       SO IT DOESN'T STEAM UP...

515
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,390
YEP.                            
       CREATE A DOME, BECOME DRY
             AND CRACK OFF.     

516
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,858
                 NOT GOOD.      
           STICK IT IN THE OVEN.

517
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,394
NOW HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE       
      IN THE OVEN?              
    IT TAKES ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.

518
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,996
              READY? LOOKS GOOD.
(whistles)                      

519
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:02,333
           THAT'S A GOOD-LOOKIN'
                  'ZONE.        
SOME SAUCE IF YOU WANT.         

520
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,535
                         MMM!   

521
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:07,805
           OUT OF BOUNDS, MAN.  
        THE ROAST PORK IS CRAZY.

522
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,274
               THE WOOD-FIRED   
             PIZZA OVEN DOUGH-- 

523
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:11,742
          THAT'S OUT OF BOUNDS. 

524
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:13,544
      PICK YOUR OWN TOMATOES,   
   AND CAN 'EM--FRESH AND SWEET.

525
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:14,879
                 MMM! QUALITY   
               REAL INGREDIENTS.

526
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,747
       THIS IS HOW IT'S SUPPOSED
              TO BE DONE.       

527
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,749
               IF YOU LIVE NORTH
                OF THE EQUATOR, 

528
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:21,685
    YOU HAVE TO COME UP HERE.   
 I MEAN, THERE'S JUST NO EXCUSE.

529
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,687
             ANYBODY SOUTH,     
         YOU HAVE AN EXTRA DAY. 

530
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,691
             THIS IS THE PHILLY.
      VERY SMOKY FLAVORS.       
      IT'S JUST DELICIOUS.      

531
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,959
(man) COMING AROUND.            
     THE FOOD IS EXCELLENT.     

532
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,829
       AND THE PING-PONG        
            IS FUN.             
                 CALZONE, PIZZA,
                   YOU NAME IT. 

533
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,832
  THIS IS SOME OF THE BEST PIZZA
     I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.  

534
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,502
      BROTHER, I'VE HAD A BLAST.
        THANK YOU. AWESOME JOB. 
THANK YOU.                      

535
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,770

            NEXT TIME           

538

 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

539
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,379

                  ALL RIGHT?

541
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,917
   AND YOU ARE NOT GONNA FORGET 
          WHERE IT WENT.        

542
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,185
       YOU COULD WAX WITH THIS. 

543
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,355
           (laughter)
