00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,467
    NOT TOO MUCH.               

282
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:05,003

 YOUR HEART INTO IT.

           TWO SOFT-SHELL CRABS.

405
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,314
              THIS IS WAY MORE  
             THAN A QUESADILLA.

               THE MENU HERE?   

420

00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,540
AND WE'RE SO COMPETITIVE        
    WITH WHAT WE DO,            

422
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,742
WE NEVER REALLY COME            
  TO AN AGREEMENT.              

423
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:39,143

      OF FINGERS POINTING.      

431
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,088
             WELL, I GO MARCELO.

432

433
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,424
        HONESTLY.               
I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT.       

434
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,826
(smooching)                     
        NO, I'M SERIOUS.        

435
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:57,161

438
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:01,365
         I UNDERSTAND THAT      
   THERE'S A LITTLE COMPETITION 

439
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,368
                THAT GOES ON    
        BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU. 
JUST A LITTLE BIT.              

440

  YOU CAN DO IT, ROCKY.         

455
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,195
  YOU ONLY GOT                  
  FOUR MORE ROUNDS TO GO.       

456
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:32,796

             WE GO DOWN.        
     AND THE KEY IS THE PLASTIC.

461
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,076
PEEL IT OFF.

462
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,543
THROW IT ONTO THE FLAT TOP.     

463

AROUND THE BACK GILL.           

472
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,060
  CUT OFF THE HEAD.             

473
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,428

00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,098

WE'RE TAKING THE POBLANOS,      

537
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,666

 RIGHT ON THE CHARBROILER       

538
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:23,734
 AND START ROASTING.            

539
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:24,869
         WE'RE GONNA ROAST THEM,
               SWEAT THEM.      

540
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,336
PEEL THE ROASTED POBLANOS,      
       DE-SEED THEM,            

541
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:27,671
AND GIVE THEM A ROUGH CHOP.     

542
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,740
      AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA GO 
                 INTO THE...    
  PESTO.                        

543
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,075
       THIS IS A POBLANO PESTO? 

544
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,411
   YEP. ROASTED POBLANO

  SUN-DRIED TOMATO.

00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,947
                    CILANTRO.

551
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:44,155
 WE'LL KIND OF PUT THE OIL      
 IN THERE AS WE'RE MIXING IT.   

552
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,858

             GET A LITTLE TASTE.

554
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,361
       AND THAT'S GONNA GO IN...

555
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,495
   THAT'S GONNA GO              
    IN THE PASTA.               

556
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,097
               NICE BEGINNING.  

557
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,099
             HAVE YOUR GAME ON. 

558
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,968
 SEE YOUR WIFE STARING YOU DOWN 
           RIGHT NOW.           

559
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,836
                 (whistling)    
MY POINTS ARE COMING UP.        

560
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,437

  YES.                          

563
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:04,775
  IS THIS HOW YOU GET           
  YOUR SHRIMP HERE?             

564
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,243
WE CAN EITHER GET THEM          
HEADS ON OR HEADS OFF.          

565
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,778

RIGHT OUT OF THE SOUND.         

567
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,514
                SERIOUSLY?      
           YOU GUYS ARE SPOILED.

568
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,116
NOW I'M GONNA GO TO THE --      
        MUSHROOMS AND TOMATOES. 

569
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,451
 YEP.                           
          OKAY. LITTLE CREMINI.

                 I LIKE         
         THE WAY THIS IS GOING. 

572
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,588
TOSS THE PASTA IN THERE.        

573
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:20,457
       ROASTED POBLANO PESTO    
   WITH THE SUN-DRIED TOMATOES. 

574
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,459

               EVERYBODY.       

576

      (cheers and applause)     

577
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,931
LITTLE CHICKEN STOCK.           
                 CHICKEN STOCK. 

578
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,398
LITTLE DEGLAZE THERE.           

579
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,400
                  IN-HOUSE      
        BLACKENING SPICE AGAIN. 
YEP.                            

580
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,003
         DROP THOSE SHRIMP DOWN.

581
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,104
               LET THEM BUILD   
               A LITTLE CRUST.  

582
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,207
                LITTLE CREAM.   
              COOKING IT DOWN.  

583
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:36,941
                  MANCHEGO.     
     YEP.                       

584
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,542
     OH. YAHTZEE.               

585
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,144
     SOMEBODY WINS.             
     EVERYBODY WINS.            

586
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,614
     LOOK AT THOSE PAN SKILLS   
     ON THAT CAT.               

587
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,416
          LAST BUT NOT LEAST... 
SPINACH.                        

588
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,551
      WILT A LITTLE SPINACH.    
   HOLY MOLEY, SPINACH CAPTAIN. 

589
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:48,552
              THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. 

590
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,087
           TOMATOES, MUSHROOMS, 

591
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,223
                THE SAUSAGE,    
              THE LOCAL SHRIMP. 

592
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,224
  OKAY. IT'S READY.             

593
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,993
                 VERY NICE.     

594
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,363
                    MMM.        
               GREAT SAUSAGE.   

595
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,699
       WITH THAT PESTO IN THERE,
         YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT.   

596
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:04,368
     YOU DON'T GET A PASTA DISH 
      IN A MEXICAN RESTAURANT.  

597
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:05,636
     I THINK THAT'S REALLY NICE.

598
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,104
         AND THE SPINACH, TO ME,
          IS REALLY THE KICKER. 

599
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,040
         ADDS SOME GREAT COLOR. 

600
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,109
                GOOD BALANCE.   
                WAY TO DO IT.   

601
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,377
              THE QUESTION IS,  
                DID YOU WIN?    

602
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:14,445
    I DON'T KNOW.               

603
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,046
                  YOUR WIFE     
             BUTCHERED THE FISH,

604
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,048
                 AND THAT'S     
             THE WINNING POINT. 

605
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,783
       YOU'RE GONNA BE WASHING  
     A LOT OF DISHES, MY FRIEND.

606
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,252
                   GREAT PASTA. 
  ALL RIGHT.         THANK YOU. 
THANKS A LOT.                   

607
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,786
SHRIMP AND CHORIZO ALFREDO.     

608
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,187
  THE CHORIZO TASTES WONDERFUL, 

609
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,191
     AND THE CREAM SAUCE HAS    
 A REALLY PEPPERY FLAVOR TO IT. 

610
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,393
KIND OF BITES, AND IT'S AMAZING.

611
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:32,263
     I TREAT MYSELF TO THIS     
     EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.     

612
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,064
        IT'S REALLY GOOD.       
           I LOVE IT.           

613
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,865
      TEQUILA LIME CHICKEN.     

614
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,133
THANK YOU.                      
         YOU'RE WELCOME.        

615
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,601
THIS IS THE KIND OF FOOD        
    THAT GETS ALONG.            

616
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,802
  I MEAN, EVERYBODY DIGS THIS.  

617
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,205
     IT'S A HEART-AND-SOUL PLACE
               FOR ME.          

618
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:42,473
             YOU'VE GOT         
     A HUSBAND-AND-WIFE TEAM -- 

619
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,074
        ONE FROM NORCAL,        
        ONE FROM CHILE,         

620
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,077
                 THREE KIDS,    
              SOUTHWESTERN FOOD 

621
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:50,014
     IN A COASTAL SOUTHERN TOWN 
         IN NORTH CAROLINA.     

622
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,683
              I MEAN, THAT IS   
           A MADE-FOR-TV MOVIE. 

623
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,018
         GOOD JOB ON THAT FISH, 
               BY THE WAY.      

624
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,952
           THANK YOU.           
                OKAY. CHAMPION. 

625
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,420
          MAKE SURE             
          HE WASHES THE DISHES. 

626
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,157
          SO, THAT'S IT         
 FOR THIS FLAVORTOWN ROAD TRIP, 

627
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,492
      BUT DON'T YOU WORRY.      

628
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:04,028
   THERE'S PLENTY MORE JOINTS   
     ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY.     

629
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,296
     I'LL BE LOOKING FOR YOU    
            NEXT TIME           

630
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,898
     ON "DINERS, DRIVE-INS,     
           AND DIVES."          

631
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,966
  (Austrian accent)             
 GOOD JOB, CHAMPION.            

632
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:10,101
 YES, YOU DID GREAT.            

633
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,303
 IT'S WHEN YOU DID THE FINAL BIT
         WITH THE FISH,         

634
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:13,704
  AND YOU DIDN'T OVERCOOK IT -- 

635
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,305
THAT IS WHY YOU PREVAIL         
  OVER YOUR HUSBAND.            

636
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:17,141
           (laughter)
