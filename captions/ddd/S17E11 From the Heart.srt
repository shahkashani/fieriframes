        it takes me back.       

218
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,207
FIERI: 'Cause owner Mike Spirito

219
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,811
          is dishing up         
     the Italian he learned     

220
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:35,280
   in his family's restaurant   
   in Elizabeth, New Jersey.    

221
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,686
             This is            
 the old-school Italian gravies 

222
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,621
       and meatballs and pasta. 

223
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,357
 East-Coast Italian?            
            East-Coast Italian. 

224
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,827
   But after a SoCal vacation   
      in the winter of '78,     

225
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:52,497
  he brought his family recipes 
       to the West Coast,       

226
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,500
    like Pizza di Politana,     
    lasagna with meat sauce,    

227
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,969
         and of course,         
       the gold standard.       

228
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,303
      Spaghetti meatballs.      

229
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,973
       FIERI: Smothered in      
  the Spirito family marinara.  

230
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,574
             WOMAN:             
  They're thick, they're meaty, 

231
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,644
      and the sauce over it     
  just combines all the taste.  

232
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:06,911
What are we gonna make?         

233
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,913
        Our Roman meatballs     
   with the pignoli and raisins.

234
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,048
Pine nuts and raisins           
      in this?                  
                            Yes.

235
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,318
           Take the ground beef,
               add the eggs.    

236
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:15,720
              Italian parsley,  

237
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,722
             plain bread crumbs,
                not seasoned.   

238
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,924
             It's a combination 
              Parmesan/Romano.  

239
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,426
   Do it before I eat           
all those pine nuts, man.       

240
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:25,397
      Then we've got a little   
   black pepper, salted garlic. 

241
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,265
                  Raisins.      

242
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,735
       And half the amount      
 of the pine nuts that you need.

243
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,337
     Because you finished them. 
Because I've been eating them.  

244
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:37,608
        So, then we incorporate 
       all the ingredients here.

245
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:40,078
 And what size balls            
 are you gonna form?            

246
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,947
              We do 3.5 ounces. 
   Okay.                        

247
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:50,955
      Cook it off in the oven   
   for about 20 minutes at 400. 

248
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,224
                 We put some    
             right in the gravy.

249
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,425
        Okay,                   
 we're ready to go?             

250
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,694
             We're ready to go. 

251
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,962
                 All right.     

252
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:01,232
We got a couple of the meatballs
      soaking in the sauce.     

253
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,900
  How many meatballs            
you get with an order?          

254
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,636
           Whatever you want.   
         Some people like three.

255
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:05,703
      I'll take                 
   "tree" [three].              

256
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,105
                You want        
         "tree" [three] of them?

257
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,676
              A little Romano.  
              A little pepper.  

258
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,479
           That's all she wrote.

259
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:22,853
         That's                 
old-school Jersey gravy.        

260
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,389
    Not overdone,               
   not too spiced.              

261
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,857
Good amount of garlic,          
        though.                 

262
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:26,958
I'll tell you that much.        

263
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,362
         Look at                
the size of these things.       

264
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:33,398
        That's                  
a really nice meatball.         

265
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:34,466
                 Thank you.     

266
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,333
         I like it with         
  that little raisin in there,  

267
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,702
    a little bit                
  of the sweetness.             

268
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:42,273
   Nice job, boss.              
                     All right. 

269
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,012
   The garlic, the pine nuts,   
everything about it is fabulous.

270
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,681
     As good as the food is,    

271
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,618
    we come here just as much   
 to see Mike and the whole crew.

272
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,688
  WOMAN: He likes to talk about 

273
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:58,423
     his history in New York    
         and New Jersey         

274
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,690
       and all the things       
         that he's done         

275
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,826
    and the places he's been,   
     the places he's cooked.    

276
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:05,497
     FIERI: But he lets this    
 big seller do all the talking. 

277
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,098
     We've got the raviolis     
      with the meat gravy.      

278
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,501
             FIERI:             
   A dish his grandpa started   
   serving back in the '20s.    

279
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,837
                We're making    
              handmade ravioli. 

280
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,906
You really do this by hand      
       all the time?            

281
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,040
                  Yes.          

282
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,976
     It's nice, beautiful dough.
             Very soft.         

283
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,377
          Feel it. You feel it? 
No, I see it.                   

284
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:22,113
  It's nice and silky and thin  
      and not pulling back.     

285
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,715
           We're gonna work it. 

286
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,583
      Now we're                 
  cooking with gas.             
                           Yeah.

287
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:26,984
     All right.                 
    Looking good.               

288
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,453
  You almost got it             
   to the corner.               

289
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,321
        About I just drag       
 the sheets over the bed, boss? 

290
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,590
     All right.                 

291
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,792
So, now we're making the filling
for the cheese ravioli?         
                            Yes.

292
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:38,930
              We've got         
     the New York-style ricotta.

293
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,066
              And then we have  
                  Parmesan,     

294
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:46,204
 fresh, chopped Italian parsley,
     black pepper, the eggs.    

295
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:47,739
                   We'll mix it 
                  a little bit. 
 You're gonna do it             
  with your hands?              

296
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:51,176
     I'm gonna do a little bit. 
           Yeah, you know.      

297
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,680
   Hey, how, on the first one,  
 did you already get me with it?

298
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,248
            How? Because        
     your finger was in the way.

299
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:01,686
                There we go.    
             We got the filling.

300
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:04,088
            There we go.        
     Then we take the egg wash. 

301
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,458
So everybody sticks.            

302
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,694
                 We're gonna    
              put the filling.  
   Whoa!                        

303
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:12,130
              Yeah, these are   
           nice-sized raviolis. 

304
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,901
            And then we'll be   
         pulling the pasta over 

305
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,304
         to cover these babies. 

306
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,907
         Make the pocket there. 
                  Okay.         

307
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:25,043
It's like a doctor doing surgery
           right now.           

308
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,446
    Very rustic.                

309
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,047
  No out of a mold              
   with this one.               

310
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,082
                No. No molds.   

311
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,786
             We go straight into
                salted water.   

312
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:37,588
            They just take      
       about 5 minutes to cook. 

313
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:38,923
          Look at               
the size of these monsters.     

314
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:39,991
              Four to a plate.  

315
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,260
              Goes beautiful    
           with the meat gravy. 

316
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,331
             A little Parmesan, 
             Pecorino, Romano.  

317
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:49,467
            Serve it with       
     a little homemade foccacia.

318
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,736
         And you're ready to go.

319
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:54,806
All right. Let's look at        
 one of these monsters.         

320
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:58,009
         There's, like,         
1/4 cup of the ricotta in there.

321
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,078
      Oh, man.                  

322
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:04,015
  The pasta itself              
  is super tender,              

323
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:08,019
  and the ricotta inside of it  
    is just creamy as can be.   

324
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,221
      Mmm.                      

325
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,490
Good old-school meat sauce

   about this place.

     on old-school Mexican.

  in San Francisco, California, 

341
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,666
     in an area that I have     
 driven through a million times 

342
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,669
    on the way to the airport

      to cook his cuisine,      

357
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,373
       and so it was just       
        a logical choice        

358
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,575
      to open a restaurant

And then bay leaves.

Manteca, or lard.

 If you're gonna do it,         
you got to use the lard.        

376

 that is a carnitas paddle, man.

            with a little salt.

00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:50,915
 And then we're gonna dehydrate 
    it in the oven overnight.   

389
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,516
      Look at this.             
It's practically a chip.        

390

the less moisture that's in it,

the more it's gonna bloom up

FIERI: Welcome back.            

438
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,740
"Triple D" hanging out          
   in San Francisco             

439
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,176
     with Chef Gonzalo          
at the Nopalito restaurant.     

440
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,644
And I got to tell you something.
     The dude is real deal.     

441
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,046
The Mexican food is like        
you've never seen before.       

442
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,715
    And now we're               
   in to making...              

443
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,584
                      Pambazo.  
Oh, exactly.                    

444
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,785
                  Which is      
             a Mexican sandwich.

445
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:08,986
  Mexican sandwich?             

446
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,122
  I assume chorizo              
 is the foundation.             

447
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,590
                Chorizo's       
         one of the ingredients.

448
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:13,724
        All right.              
So, get us started, buddy.      

449
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,060
  Ground pork butt?             
                           Yeah.

450
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,596
                Fresh garlic,   
              coriander, cumin, 

451
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:23,067
        pinquito picante,       
 dried thyme, ginger, cinnamon. 

452
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,335
      Marjoram?                 

453
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:28,138
           Cloves, black pepper,
           nutmeg, dry oregano. 

454
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:29,339
  Pink curing salt.             

455
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,942
                Regular salt.   

456
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,743
                   Adobo.       

457
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,278
      And then                  
apple cider vinegar?            
           Apple cider vinegar. 

458
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:35,313
     Very nice.                 

459
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,352
       Take me                  
  to promised land.             

460
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,889
   Oh, talk to me.              

461
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,424
 So, this salsa is the same base
   that we use for the pozole.  

462
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:48,559
      Okay.                     

463
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,295
           So, we're gonna press
               a little bit.    

464
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:54,431
             You can see        
     it's crispy on both sides. 

465
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,833
               When I open it,  

466
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,437
 you can see some steam coming, 
       so it's hot inside.      

467
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,571
         Crispy on the outside. 

468
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,706
                  Chorizo.      

469
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,441
         While we wait for that 
               to get hot,      

470
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:04,976
              we're just gonna  
             build the sandwich.

471
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,110
             First, the avocado.

472
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,445
                Put some of     
           this salsa escabeche.

473
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:08,980
               Pico jalapeño,   
             so pico vegetable. 

474
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,348
      We've got                 
 Mexican jardiniere.            

475
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,383
And these are papas?            
               All right. Yeah. 

476
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,987
             Those are potatoes 
           with the same salsa. 
Ohh!                            

477
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,289
              Use some          
     before you finish them all.

478
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,225
                  Make sure     
              it's really hot.  

479
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,063
           Then we're gonna add 
               some cabbage,    

480
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:29,066
                 onions,        
         mixed with some crema. 

481
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,868
           Queso fresco on top. 

482
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,469
       And then on the top side 
           of the sandwich,     

483
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,470
           gonna put some crema.

484
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,606
           That's your sandwich 
               right there.     

485
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,741
    Oh, my gosh.                

486
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,043
So, you've got to eat this      
    with a beach towel.         

487
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,684
    Do I have any               
     on my face?                

488
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,085
             All over your face.

489
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,089
That was from one bite.         

490
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,291
 That's ridiculous.             

491
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:59,696
  This right here is a complex  
   dish made into a sandwich.   

492
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:02,033
        You get                 
that little jardiniere.         

493
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,035
    You get that salsa,         
a little bit of the vinegar     

494
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,837
  cutting some of the sweetness 
 of the potatoes and the queso. 

495
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,873
      Mmm.                      

496
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:11,976
It's not like any torta         
   I think I've had.            

497
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,977
There's a lot of depth.         
There's a lot going on.         

498
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,779
It's an excellent sandwich.     

499
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,515
   Nice job.                    
                     Thank you. 

500
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:22,253
In the category of Mexican food,
          this is wow.          

501
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,587
   Out of control.              

502
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:24,688
               Out of bounds.   

503
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,991
         This was an experience 
             and then some.     

504
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,260
                This guy        
         is incredibly talented.

505
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,496
           In the "wow" factor, 
            it's way up there.  

506
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,535
        So, that's it for       
this road trip, but don't worry.

507
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,539
    We got plenty more joints   
 to find all over this country! 

508
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,873
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

509
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,610
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

510
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,711
     Hi, diner guy.             
You lost fair and square.       

511
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:48,879
Where's the pink slip?          

512
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:49,880
             Got it right here. 

513
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:51,616
 How do I spell your last name, 
            Shirley?            

514
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,951
     Which one?                 
    W-e-l-t-o-n.                

515
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:57,088
Thank you very much.            

516
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,323
