123
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,907
 The crust on that,             
it's a meal in itself.          

124
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,043
             It's why you start 
            with the dough, huh?

125
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:08,180
 "Doughn't" [don't]             
     forget it.                 

126
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:10,048
             I've got a 20-inch 
                 Spicy Pig.     

127
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,050
            Just the right level
                  of spice.     

128
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:15,053
          You can taste that fat
  on the meat, it's really good.

129
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,321
            It coats your mouth.

130
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,389
       Got a sausage slice      
 and a veggie slice at the bar. 

131
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,126
I see that you've got a little  
bit of the New York pizzeria    

132
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,727
look going with the slices.     

133
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,729
            Yeah, this town kind
        of needed a slice house.

134
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,598
  I really like the atmosphere  
          around here.          

135
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,868
You can see the cooks           
in the back spin the pizza.     

136
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,869
    We need another grinder,    
        guys, on the fly.       

137
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,405
           I came for the pizza,
    but the meatball is amazing.

138
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,675
      Here's that meatball      
        grinder for you.        

139
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:40,545
Meatball is east coast, baby.   
That's why I come here.         

140
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,080
    What's the story, sister?   

141
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,948
  SHERMAN: We're gonna make some
 rolls for our meatball grinder.

142
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,752
 So, we're going to use the same
  dough as we did for our pizza.

143
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:47,953
             Lay a little flour 
               at the bottom,   

144
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,688
             and let them fruit 
       for about a half an hour,

145
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,690
          and then they're going
         to go in our steam oven

146
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:54,826
           at about 575 for five
             and a half minutes.

147
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:55,961
 All right, what are            
   we making now?               

148
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,162
              We're gonna make  
               some meatballs.  

149
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,398
      This is my mom's recipe --
               My Italian mom.  

150
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,832
           Some grated parmesan.

151
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,234
         House-made breadcrumbs.

152
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:02,968
                Some oregano.   

153
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,635
     Of course.                 

154
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,636
                  Sea salt.     

155
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,505
                   Garlic.      
          We add it to the beef.

156
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:08,039
            And we got our eggs.

157
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,708
 Be a super trooper             
and get your scooper.           

158
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,376
                  Perfect.      

159
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,177
Roast these in the oven.        

160
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,313
        About 26 minutes at 400.

161
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,114
     26 minutes?                

162
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,517
  We add them to our sauce after
      they come out of the oven.

163
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,917
 Okay, look at this.            

164
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,254
     We got our fresh bread roll
   brushed with some garlic oil.

165
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:24,188
 That's better than             
 most bakeries make.            

166
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,457
             Brush a little more
                 garlic oil.    

167
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,991
     Of course.                 

168
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,993
     Now we've got our meatballs
  and our homemade tomato sauce,

169
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,797
       top it with some parmesan
          and the shredded mozz.

170
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:34,533
       It's gonna go in our oven
          for about two minutes.

171
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:35,933
              It's ready to go.

  Here's our beef.              

472
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:40,778
       Now we're going to hit it
          with a mirepoix puree.

Our house vegetable stock.

      Going to give it a braise.

475
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:46,918
And then low and slow           
for five hours at 325.

                in the broth?   

478
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,255
 Exactly. All right,            
      next up,

    our coleslaw.               

480
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,059
We start with our mayonnaise,   
   Dijon mustard,               

481
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,262
then we go apple cider          
vinegar, and then honey.        

482
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:58,863
 We're going to take            
  that for a whisk,             

483
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:01,599
and then lastly, we hit it      
with some celery seed.          

484
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,067
Then we're going to go ahead    
 and mix our cabbage            

485
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,471
and our carrots together.       

486

             He clipped my hand.

487
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,274
And then we're going to add     
our coleslaw dressing           

488
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,275
into the cabbage mix.

          It's time to build it.

494
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,486
So we have our hot beef         
     going down,                

495
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,621
we take an applewood            
smoked thick cut bacon.         

496

                       Got it.  
Barbecue sauce going            
right over the top.             

497
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,159
     So it's everything you want
   in a barbecued beef sandwich.

498
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:31,562
So, we take our fries, half     
sweet potato and half regular.  

499
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:34,565
We get that beef right dead     
center there, barbecue sauce,   

500
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,701
coleslaw right on top,          
and that is the Sweet Lou's BBQ.

591

 We're going to make            
 our ranchero sauce.            

592
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:26,170
A little blended oil,           
   mirepoix again,              

593
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,906
green bell pepper.              
           So we're almost going
              holy trinity now? 

594

Yeah. Jalapeño again,           
     raw garlic,                

595
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,177
roasted red bell pepper,        
   diced tomatoes,              

596
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,378
all those aromatics.            

597

       "aromatics" a lot.       

598

600
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,851
So, we have our cayenne pepper, 
aged dark chili powder,         

601
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,119
and then lastly, our cumin.

00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,055
                        Okay.   
Our house hot sauce again,      
and then to end with,           

603
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,791
our acid, fresh lemon juice.    

604

 We're going to let

 Chilaquile filling             
   on the bottom.

right over the top, and then    
garnish with a green onion.
