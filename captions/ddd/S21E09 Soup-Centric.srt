00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,174
               I'm in Ireland,  
       bought all the furniture.

120
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,376
         But I don't have a name
            for the restaurant. 

121
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:05,644
                 So I said,     
              "Okay, sláinte."  

122
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,045
                 That means     
        "cheers to your health."

123
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:08,179
          I'm like, "I like it."

124
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,449
                   Is this      
            a typical Irish pub?

125
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:11,783
The food's very unique.         

126
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,719
       This is not what you find
              in an Irish pub.  

127
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,455
   Irish Bibimbap               
   in the window.               

128
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:19,791
 Kind of a Korean dish, but they
 add the local corned beef to it

129
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,526
        with a little bit       
    of an Irish flair to it.    

130
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,730
      We're corning some brisket
        for our Irish Bibimbap. 

131
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,465
                 All right,     
so we're gonna take our brisket,

132
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,733
           then we're gonna take
               some hot water,  

133
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,869
          and we're gonna mix up
              some brown sugar, 

134
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,805
              some kosher salt, 
             some garlic cloves,

135
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,741
               cinnamon stick,  
        and black peppercorns --

136
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:38,343
          I like to add a lot --
                   clove.       

137
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:41,479
            I do ground mustard,
              some bay leaves,  

138
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,948
         cure salt -- pink salt.

139
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,182
         Stir this up real good.

140
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,818
                 We're gonna    
               just pour that.  

141
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,621
How long are we gonna           
   let this brine?              

142
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,690
             Five to seven days.

143
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,825
        A lot of people boil it.
        We actually braise ours.

144
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,494
     Braise in equal parts water
                and vinegar.    

145
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,830
         Goes in the oven at 450
                for 4 hours.    

146
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,065
                Gonna pull it   
              out of the oven.  

147
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,033
                    Okay,       
             corned beef's done.

148
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,302
      MARQUIS:                  
   All the way up.              

149
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,104
Take our corned beef.           

150
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,105
                Look at that.   

151
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,306
With a joint like this,         

152
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,174
I expect the corned beef        
  to be righteous.              

153
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,443
                 All right,     
         chop it up real rustic.

154
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,311
There's someone trying to       
get your attention over there.  

155
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,379
                    Who?        

156
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,480
                    Nice.       

157
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,714
       All right, so we're gonna
                 take that.     

158
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:17,649
     [ Muffled ]                
   Wait a second.               

159
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,550
        Dude.                   

160
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,052
         Oh!                    

161
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,120
   The braising it              
     in vinegar                 

162
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,722
     puts it in                 
a whole 'nother level.          

163
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:25,990
   I mean, that is              
super-righteous corned beef.    

164
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,592
               We got to make   
            some Irish Bibimbap.

165
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,861
We need some screeching-hot pans
         for this dish, though. 

166
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:30,795
                A little bit    
                of this rice.   

167
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,732
           We want to get a char
                on this rice.   

168
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:34,666
     All right.                 

169
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,800
    Corned beef.                

170
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,535
We'll start adding veggies.     

171
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,072
Little green pepper,            
     red onion.                 

172
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,742
   Yeah, you want,              
 like, a nice sauté.            

173
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,212
So, we're gonna take            
  our crisped rice,             

174
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:48,680
   our little veggie corned-beef
                  stir fry.     

175
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,281
    FIERI: Crazy.               

176
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,617
       Take our pickled cabbage.
           Nice, little dollop. 

177
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:53,684
    What a dish.                

178
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,920
                   An egg.      

179
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:59,891
       A little bit of Sriracha.
Attaboy.                        

180
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:04,396
           Sesame, micro celery,
           and some green onion.

181
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,037
        Dude,                   
this is out of bounds.          

182
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,104
       You got                  
all kinds of things.            

183
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,639
   You got a play               
on sauerkraut going here        

184
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:15,640
with the pickled cabbage.       

185
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:16,908
  You got the rice              
     coming in.                 

186
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,710
 Look at the colors             
    from the egg                

187
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,046
to the variety of fresh veggies 
 to the corned beef,            

188
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,215
which is out of bounds.         
                    Thank you.  

189
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,420
     I love it.                 
That's a dynamite dish.         

190
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,124
  MAN: Combination of sriracha  
         and corned beef        

191
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:36,595
  is not something you'd expect 
  to work, but it's fantastic.  

192
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,730
 WOMAN #2: It's my favorite dish
          on the menu.          

193
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,732
    It's what I come back for   
           every time.          

194
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,601
     It's a real nice place     
 to hang out with your friends. 

195
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:43,802
      Sláinte.                  

196
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:45,403
      Nice job.                 
  What a fun joint.             

197
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,738
Thank you, man. I appreciate it.
                That's great.   

198
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,610
             FIERI:             
 Coming up, in Eugene, Oregon...

199
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:53,278
   Dude, come on.               

200
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,213
         ...we're taking        
     a worldwide journey...     

201
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,348
   That's straight              
  out of Compton --             

202
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,682
  Or, I'm sorry --              
straight out of Cairo.          

203
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,484
  ...at one soup-centric spot.  

204
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,753
That's Flavor City, which       
is right next to Flavortown.    

205
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,221
 It's a much bigger             
     population.                

206
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,532
     I'm here on High Street    

207
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,900
    in the Market District of   
         Eugene, Oregon,        

208
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,435
     about a mile and a half    
      from the university.      

209
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,371
         Now, I am here         
      to check out a joint      

210
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:21,973
        where a dude made       
 his restaurant dream come true.

211
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,375
   He started off with a cart,  

212
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:25,377
          selling soup          
     over at the university.    

213
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,779
         15 years later,        
  he's got his own restaurant,  

214
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,314
   and he's serving up exactly  

215
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,983
   what everybody in the cold   
    Pacific Northwest wants.    

216
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,118
      That's right -- soup.     

217
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,286
      This is Soup Nation.      

218
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,658
               STERN: Jamaican  
             red beans and rice.

219
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,059
          We crave it.          

220
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,461
  The soups here are fantastic. 

221
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:44,729
                  Hungarian     
         mushroom and potato up.

222
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:45,931
           It can get           
   fairly cool and rainy here.  

223
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,332
         There's nothing        
  that kind of hits at the bone 

224
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,200
        better than soup.       

225
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:49,467
                 Roger that.    

226
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,402
   Well, he puts some passion   
         into his food.         

227
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,405
   I really wanted              
to embrace world flavors,       

228
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:56,274
   not be bound by              
any one type of cuisine.        

229
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,609
  Figured soup was              
  a good vehicle.

     it's really comforting.

   to dipping it in the soup,

    The pork and quinoa soup    
          is delicious.         

347
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:13,164
    The quinoa gives a nice,    
 little earthy background to it.

348
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,899
       It's so flavorful.       

349
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,101
So, what are we making?         

350
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,303
            The pork stock for  
   the Peruvian pork and quinoa.

351
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:21,372
              Fresh pork bones, 
              carrots, celery.  

352
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:22,306
   Yellow onions.               

353
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,574
                 Bay leaves.    

354
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,976
            Whole garlic cloves.

355
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,846
     And a bunch                
   of peppercorns.              

356
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:28,846
Roast this in the oven          
      how long?                 

357
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,216
                375, 1 hour.    

358
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,319
   Take all that,               
drop it in the stock pot,       

359
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,054
and then start to make          
     the stock.                 

360
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:37,255
                 You got it.    

361
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,857
         Cover the bones and veg
                  in water.     

362
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,124
Totally gonna cook down.        

363
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,192
             And then strained. 

364
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,194
   And the reason               
we're calling it Peruvian?      

365
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,029
        It's the flavor profile.

366
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,931
          It's got roasted yams,
             it's got turmeric. 

367
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,065
        Okay.                   

368
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,000
        And, of course, quinoa, 
         grain staple of Peru.  

369
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,736
So, what are we making?         
                We're gonna make
                 our pork butt. 

370
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,404

     of the pig.                

371
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:54,272
               Yes. [ Laughs ]  

372
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,540
                 Pork butt.     

373
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:56,808
              Salt and pepper's 
              all it's getting. 

374
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,143
In the oven what temp?          

375
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:01,346
              We like this 250, 
                 overnight.

    [ Whistles ]

    Pork's done.                

378
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,417
            We'll dice it up    
         and crank up the flame.

379
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,552
                 Olive oil.

            turmeric, coriander.

383
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:16,093
             Let that cook down.

384
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,161
                 Next we got    
               the pork stock.  

385
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,763
    Look at that.

That's Flavor City, which       
is right next to Flavortown.    

387
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,967

              And lemon juice.

00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,510
Wow, look at that quinoa --     
just soaked it all up.          

394
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,446

    Okay, hit it.

That is a ridiculous            
   amount of soap.              

397
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,318
              A little cilantro 
                for you, sir.

     Okey-dokey.                

399
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,855
Now you can definitely smell    
the roasted pork.

   Dude, come on.               

401
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,929
The pork is roasted.            
   That's awesome.              

402
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,199
Then you get a little sweetness 
coming from the roasted yam.    

403
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,802
I think the key to this is      
the richness of that pork stock.

404
00:13:57,804 --> 00:14:00,471
  Just really adds              
  such depth to it.             

405
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:04,542
It's creamy and rich without    
having to be a cream-based soup.

406
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,778
Just really straightforward     
and incredibly good.

    Pork is really succulent.   

412

   It's like it's been stewed,  

413
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,224
  and the meat just falls apart 
    and melts in your mouth.

                  Ox tail,      
           got some femur bones.

461
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,700
        Wow.                    

462
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,569
                  Next up,      
       we add our brisket to it.

463
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,638
    So, we take our beef scraps,
     toss it in there, as well. 

464
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,472
        Okay.                   

465
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,307
           Kosher salt in there.

466
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,408
                 From here,     
              we add the water. 

467
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,644
             Now let it simmer. 

468
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,513
        Takes about three hours.

469
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,181
               Gonna pull out   
                the brisket.    

470
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,517
Like bobbing for brisket.       

471
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,986
               Now we're gonna  
             drop the tendon in.

472
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,588
Nothing says more yum           
    than tendon.                

473
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,523
             Let it sit in there
                 overnight.     

474
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,459
   How many hours               
to get a finished product?      

475
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:36,661
         We start at about 1:00 
     right after our lunch rush,

476
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,664
   and we finish it right before
      our lunch rush, at 11:00. 

477
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,399
   So, every day,               
you're playing leapfrog.        

478
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:42,600
              Got to live life  
                on the edge.    

479
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:43,667
    Yes, you do.                
      Next up?                  

480
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,136
              Roasted onions... 

481
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:50,541
 roasted ginger, roasted spices,
    and cinnamon, as well, too. 

482
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,811
             Sugar, kosher salt.

483
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,413
    Rock sugar.                 
         Rock sugar, rock candy.

484
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,614
                 Little bit     
          of mushroom seasoning.

485
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,550
                  And MSG.      

486
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,684
      And last                  
  but not least...              

487
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:05,222
                Little sieve    
   just to push everything down.

488
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,291
           Put the top back on, 
    come back three hours later,

489
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,292
             ready to plate it. 
    Okay.                       

490
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:09,427
             Fresh pho noodles. 

491
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,028
It's just a rice noodle.        
                        Yep.    

492
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,097
         About 30 seconds or so.
    Got it.                     

493
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,365
      Start placing the meat in.

494
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,435
      First we go with brisket, 
      then we got our meatballs,

495
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:21,172
  tripe, some tendon, and we got
     our rare eye of the round. 

496
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:22,439
Eye of the round.               
                        Yep.    

497
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,841
                 Little bit     
              of white onions,  

498
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,576
                green onions,   

499
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,044
         some cilantro, as well.
    Got it.                     

500
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,347
               And then ladle   
              the hot broth on. 

501
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,118
              Then we're gonna  
                 finish off     

502
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,254
              with a little bit 
         of black pepper on top.

503
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,293
 That's outstanding.            

504
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,997
        Mmm.                    

505
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,866
   Tender noodles,              
   great meatball.              

506
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,369
I think that there's            
so many components to it.       

507
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,537
The balance is great.           

508
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:54,939
The flavors are subtle.         

509
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:55,806
   Delicious, man.              

510
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,007
Great job, chef.                
                    Thank you.  

511
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,879
         Slightly salty,        
      full of beef flavor.      

512
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,615
      The smell of the pho      
     wafts across the block.    

513
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,550
   You can't<i> not</i> come in here.  

514
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,353
How long is a line to get into  
this joint on a Saturday?       

515
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:11,088
                  Uh, about     
             an hour and a half.

516
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,489
        No!                     
                    Yeah.       

517
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,692
   FIERI: Maybe that's 'cause   
      the specialties here      

518
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,761
  you just can't find anywhere. 

519
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,829
       Got a pork bánh mi.      
         Let's go, guys.        

520
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,698
             MAN #2:            
 Bánh mi's one of my favorites. 

521
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,100
    The richness of that pâté   

522
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,567
      cut with a little bit     
       of the pickled veg,      

523
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,503
      down to the richness      
      of the head cheese.       

524
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:27,705
     I've eaten                 
  a lot of bánh mi,             

525
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,041
  but I don't know              
that I've ever seen head cheese.

526
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:32,242
        This is, like, probably 
      the favorite in my family.

527
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,712
So, take all the leftover parts 
of the pig that you have...     

528
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,380
                        Yeah.   
...cook them down,              

529
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:39,383
throw them in a sandwich        
with some vinegary vegetables.  

530
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:40,851
                    Exactly.    
    Magic.                      

531
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,421
               So, first start  
             with some pig face.

532
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:45,590
    That's great.               

533
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:46,991
               We boil it off.  

534
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,026
                Take it out,    
     slice it into small pieces.

535
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:51,595
                 We're gonna    
           drop the pig face in.

536
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:52,930
Drop it like it's...            
                        Hot.    

537
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,533
               Got pork neck,   
             some ham, as well. 

538
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:57,935
        Okay.                   

539
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:02,673
           Black pepper, garlic,
              pink salt, sugar. 

540
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,208
 So, cook this down             
    for how long?               

541
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,676
                 30 minutes.    

542
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:07,211
Releases all the collagen       
and the juices and the fats?    

543
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:08,346
                    Yep.        

544
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,750
 Then you'll put it             
into a mold and let it cool?    

545
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:13,718
                    Yep.        

546
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,154
         Mm.                    

547
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,956
                It's all nice   
            and gelatinous here.

548
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,158
                Just slice it   
                really thin.    

549
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,094
        Mmm.                    

550
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,496
       I think                  
I'm having the knee.            

551
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,964
               Now we're ready  
          to build our sandwich.

552
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,432
  All right, buddy.             

553
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,501
               Start off with   
  a 7-inch baguette, open it up,

554
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,703
        and actually hollow out 
       a little bit of the core.

555
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,905
                Garlic mayo.    

556
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,039
              House-made pâté.  

557
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,108
Chicken liver?                  
                        Yep.    

558
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,910
            We're gonna go with 
           our head cheese next.

559
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,579
               Barbecue pork.   

560
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,914
All kinds of flavor.            

561
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,784
    And then the cha lua, which 
   is like a Vietnamese bologna.

562
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,719
             Our pickled carrots
                 and daikon.    

563
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:52,923
  Got some cucumbers, jalapeños,
    and cilantro to top it off. 

564
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,025
Gorgeous sandwich, man.         

565
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,198
    Great bread.                

566
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,666
I mean, there's just            
so many different components.   

567
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,535
The balance is great.           

568
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,469
                 Thank you.     

569
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,605
        Mmm.                    

570
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,873
As you chew it, you just get -- 
 "Oh, there it is."             

571
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,742
Oh, now I got some sour,        
now I got some heat,            

572
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:12,743
now I got a little jalapeño,    

573
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,411
now I got the freshness         
  of the cucumber.              

574
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,949
It just keeps trumping itself   
  as you enjoy it.              

575
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:19,483
                    Exactly.    
    I dig it.                   

576
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:20,284
                 Thank you.     

577
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,154
    The inside is so spongy.    

578
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:25,222
        It really absorbs       
     the flavor of the meat.    

579
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,459
 The pickled daikons and carrots
     gives it a good crunch.    

580
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,294
   I've never had head cheese   
       before. I like it.       

581
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,162
It's neat for people            
   to walk in here              

582
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,165
   and get a full               
cultural experience.            

583
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,633
                     Exactly.   
Outstanding, man.               

584
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,134
    Really.                     
                    Thank you.  

585
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,305
        So, that's it for       
this road trip, but don't worry.

586
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:44,442
    We got plenty more joints   
 to find all over this country! 

587
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:45,977
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

588
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:48,579
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

589
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,514
You guys still shooting?        

590
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,583
I'm just full feeding           
   at this point.               

591
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,185
    I don't need                
any more camera on me.          

592
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,720
If you want to go somewhere,    
   dude, whatever.              

593
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:57,722
              All right, cool.  

594
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:59,523
Skateboard or something.
