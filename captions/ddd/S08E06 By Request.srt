(woman)                         
THE PIEROGIS WERE NEW TO ME     
SO IT'S NICE TO HAVE THEM       
IN A SANDWICH.                  

106
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,112
OUTSTANDING.                    

107
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,015
         IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE. 

108
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,050
IT'S SO MUCH MORE               
THAN A GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH. 

109
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,252
     MY IDEA WAS TO TAKE A FOUR 
     OR FIVE-STAR RESTAURANT,   

110
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:18,156
      THAT QUALITY OF FOOD      
      THAT EVERYBODY'S USED TO. 

111
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:20,525
 (woman)                        
 EVERYBODY LOVES GRILLED CHEESE 

112
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,594
  AND THEY JUST DO A LOT OF     
  DIFFERENT, NEAT THINGS TO IT. 

113
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,596
      (Guy)                     
      LIKE HEY,                 
      YOUR BASIC TUNA MELT.     

114
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,598
NICE, BIG TUNA STEAK.           

115
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
IT'S THE BEST WAY               
TO DO A TUNA MELT.              

116
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,669
           NOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE 
           THE MARINADE FOR OUR 
           TUNA STEAK           

117
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,004
            FOR OUR TOKYO       
            TUNA MELT SANDWICH. 

118
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,073
OKAY, GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN.      

119
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,342
       SOY SAUCE,               
       SESAME OIL'S GOING NEXT. 

120
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,411
WHOA!                           
                   WHOA, BUDDY. 

121
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,413
                  VEGETABLE OIL,
                  COCONUT MILK. 

122
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,749
SO YOU'RE GOING                 
THAI ON ME NOW.                 
                       OH YEAH, 
                IT GETS BETTER. 

123
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,884
    BROWN SUGAR'S GOING IN NEXT.

124
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,753
   SAMBAL CRUSHED RED PEPPERS,  
   BLACK PEPPER, CHOPPED GARLIC,
   AND SOME WATER.              

125
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:51,423
            WE'RE JUST GONNA MIX
            THE WHOLE THING UP. 

126
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,425
        NOW WE'RE GONNA MARINATE
        OUR TUNA FOR 24 HOURS.  

127
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:55,360
       WE'RE TALKING SUSHI-GRADE
       YELLOWFIN TUNA.          

128
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,696
FOR A GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH,  
SOMETHING YOU SEE EVERY DAY.    

129
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:00,032
NEXT WE'RE GONNA MAKE           
THE WASABI GINGER DRESSING      
TO GO ON TOP OF THE TUNA STEAKS.

130
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,701
THE MAIN FOCUS FOR THE DRESSING 
IS TOFU, MY FRIEND.             

131
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,170
              PICKLED GINGER    
              IS GOING IN NEXT. 

132
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,372
           A LITTLE COLD WATER. 

133
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,507
       TURN THIS BAD MACHINE ON 
       AND THIS IS ALL GONNA    
       COME TOGETHER PRETTY.    

134
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,576
            NEXT WE'RE GONNA DO 
            OUR WASABI POWDER,  

135
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,779
 JAPANESE HORSERADISH,          
 COLD WATER, WHISK IT TOGETHER. 

136
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,913
       WE'RE GONNA ADD OUR TOFU 
       AND OUR GINGER.          

137
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,849
 WE'VE GOT LEMON AND LIME ZEST. 

138
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,851
SO A CREAMY SAUCE,              
NOW A CHUNKY SAUCE.             

139
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:22,120
                A CHUNKY SAUCE. 

140
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,589
  WE'VE GOT FRESH ORANGE JUICE, 
  FRESH LIME JUICE, SESAME OIL. 

141
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,258
YOU LOVE TO USE THAT.           
                 YOU KNOW I DO. 

142
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,928
     DOUBLE BLACK SOY SAUCE,    
     RICE VINEGAR, FRESH GARLIC,

143
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,198
          HONEY, KOSHER SALT,   
          CORIANDER, FRESH MINT.

144
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,600
I WANT TO GET SMOOTH AND CHUNKY.

145
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:38,403
AND THIS IS GONNA GO            
INSIDE OF THE SANDWICH?         
                            YES.

146
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:41,139
  THIS IS OUR BEAUTY RIGHT HERE,
  WE'RE GONNA COOK IT NICE      
  AND RARE FOR YOU.             

147
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,275
     WE'RE GONNA START OUR BREAD
     WHILE WE'RE DOING THIS.    

148
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,076
HERE'S THE THING                
I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT.          

149
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,012
HE BUTTERS ALL THE WAY          
TO THE EDGE.                    

150
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,548
      WE'RE GONNA TURN THIS GUY 
      AND MARK IT.              

151
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,017
WE'RE GONNA FLIP OUR BREAD OVER.

152
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,486
IS THAT HERMAN?                 
   THIS IS MUENSTER, MY FRIEND, 
               HERMAN MUENSTER. 

153
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,688
               FOUR SLICES.

     SMOOTH AND CHUNKY.         

155
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:01,025
               OUR YELLOWFIN,   
               CLOSE HER UP.    

156
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,962
           THAT WILL GO INTO OUR
           MELTIFICATION MACHINE
           FOR 3 1/2 MINUTES.   

157
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,432
(Matt)                          
THIS IS GONNA GET FINISHED      
WITH FRESH TOMATOES             
AND FRESH LETTUCE.              

158
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:09,768
CLOSE IT BACK UP.               

159
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,737
ALL RIGHT, GUY,                 
A TOKYO TUNA MELT.              

160
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,640
      THIS IS COOKED            
      AT THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE, 

161
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,509
                   REALLY RARE. 

162
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,511
  THE DRESSING WITH THE TOFU,   
  IT'S LIKE HEALTHY MAYONNAISE. 

163
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,579
YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE ALSO,      
THE LETTUCE AND TOMATO THING -- 

164
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,381
     THE CONTRAST               
     WITH THE COOL AND THE HOT. 

165
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,517
 THIS IS REALLY                 
 A GOURMET PRODUCTION           
 INSIDE OF TWO PIECES OF BREAD. 

166
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,786
YOU'RE MAKING SOME MAGIC, DUDE. 
THANKS MAN.                     

167
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,389
      TOKYO TUNA GOING UP.      

168
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,724
    IT'S GRILLED TO PERFECTION, 
    JUST A NICE CRUNCHINESS,    
    DYNAMITE.                   

169
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,393
YOU GET                         
THAT LITTLE HIT OF WASABI.      

170
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,128
IT'S LIKE A SPICY TUNA ROLL,    
BUT BETTER.                     

171
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,664
         I'VE TRIED             
         EVERYTHING ON THE MENU 
         AND I'M ALWAYS AMAZED. 

172
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,867
HOW ABOUT BEEF JERKY            
AND CORN MELTS?                 

173
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,469
       WE COULD DO IT           
       BUT I DON'T THINK        
       IT WOULD SELL VERY WELL. 

174
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,738
 I'M TRYING TO SELL SANDWICHES, 
 I'M TRYING TO PAY BILLS.       

175
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,274
OH, THIS IS A BUSINESS.         
                           YEAH.

176
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,209
THERE'S SOMETHING HERE          
FOR EVERYBODY.                  

177
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,545
 WELL THANK YOU FOR             
 THE RECOMMENDATION AUNT POLLY.

180
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,286
  (Guy)                         
  UP NEXT, WE'RE HEADING SOUTH  
  TO CHARLOTTE...               

181

SHAKE 'EM UP,                   
SHAKE 'EM UP, HELP ME.          

187

   WE'RE HERE IN CHARLOTTE,     
   NORTH CAROLINA TO CHECK OUT  
   A DRIVE-IN.                  

188
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,909
      THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR,     
      DOESN'T IT?               

189
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,177
   THE LAST TIME WE WERE HERE   
   WE WERE AT THE BAR-B-Q KING  
   ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN.   

190
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,312
      WELL TODAY WE'RE AT       
      THEIR FRIEND'S PLACE,     

191
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,582
  AT A JOINT THAT'S BEEN OPEN   
  FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY. 

192
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,584
     NOW IT WAS STARTED         
     BY THREE GREEK BROTHERS    

193
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,786
       AND STILL OWNED          
       BY THE SAME FAMILY       

194
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,055

196
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,194
I WANT A CHEESEBURGER.          

197
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,463
IT'S JUST AN INSTITUTION.       

198
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,665
PEOPLE IN CHARLOTTE             
KNOW IT AND LOVE IT.            

199
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:50,001
IT LOOKS LIKE                   
YOUR KIND OF PLACE, RIGHT?      

200
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,870
COOL CARS, COOL DRIVE-IN.       

201
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:53,938

202
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,007
                    ABSOLUTELY. 

203
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,009
BECAUSE...                      
                     IT'S GOOD. 

204
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,878
                IT'S DELICIOUS, 
                IT'S TERRIFIC.  

205
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,013
DID YOU GET THAT?               

206
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,615
         (woman)                
         I LOVE IT, IT'S GREAT, 
         CLASSIC DRIVE-IN FOOD. 

207
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,951
          I JUST GREW UP ON IT. 

208
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,087
        (Guy)                   
        SO DID THE OWNER        
        MARIA HOUSIADAS.        

209
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,689
   HER DAD AND UNCLE            
   STARTED IT ALL BACK IN '55.  

210
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,824
            DID YOU ALWAYS WORK 
            IN THE DRIVE-IN?    

211
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,826
EVER SINCE I WAS 14 YEARS OLD.  

212
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,029
 (Guy)                          
 NOW SHE AND HER HUSBAND GEORGE 

213
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,164
 ARE KEEPING                    
 THIS CHARLOTTE TRADITION ALIVE 

214
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:23,368
       FROM FRIED CHICKEN       
       TO ONION RINGS           

215
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,304
      AND THE BEST SELLER,      
      THE SUPER BOY --          

216
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,573
    A CLASSIC DOUBLE BURGER.    

217
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,842
      AND THEY DO IT            
      NORTH CAROLINA-STYLE      

218
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,177
     LOADED WITH SLAW           
     AND SCRATCH-MADE CHILI.    

219
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,647
WHO'S CHILI RECIPE IS THIS?     

220
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,716
           MY FATHER HAD        
           THE ORIGINAL RECIPE. 

221
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,584
  I JUST MESSED WITH THE SPICES 
  A LITTLE BIT.                 

222
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,720
      PUT A LITTLE OIL IN HERE, 
      GROUND ONIONS.            

223
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,788
I THINK THE OIL'S HOT.          

224
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,857
          NOW THE MEAT GOES IN, 
          GROUND BEEF.          

225
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,926
YOU'RE A DRIVE-IN               
OWNED BY A GREEK FAMILY         

226
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,061
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE       
LIKE, ANY LAMB?                 

227
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,996
           NO, THERE'S NO LAMB. 

228
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,065
OKAY, SO WE COOK THE MEAT DOWN  
AND NOW WE GO WITH THE SPICES?  

229
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,468
      SALT, CRACKED PEPPER,     
      PAPRIKA, A LITTLE GARLIC, 

230
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,536
    BLACK PEPPER, CHILI POWDER. 

231
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:01,005
YOU GOTTA HAVE                  
CHILI POWDER IN IT              
WHICH ISN'T FROM JUST A CHILE.  

232
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,074
             A LITTLE ALLSPICE. 

233
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,942
WHICH ISN'T JUST                
ALL THE SPICES,                 
IT'S A BERRY.                   

234
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,944
       WE'LL FINISH IT OFF      
       WITH A LITTLE HOT SAUCE. 

235
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,014
HOW LONG IS THIS GONNA COOK?    
             ABOUT THREE HOURS. 

236
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,151
TIME TO EAT IT?                 
                            YES.

237
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,622
MMM, IT'S REALLY GOOD.          

238
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:20,492
IT GOES OVER DOGS AND BURGERS.  
                         RIGHT. 

239
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,894
   THAT'S THE FAMOUS SUPER BOY. 

240
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,695
NOT FROZEN?                     
               FRESH EVERY DAY. 

241
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,631
HOW DO YOU KNOW                 
WHEN IT'S TIME?                 

242
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,499
             WHEN IT GETS WHITE 
             AROUND THE EDGES.  

243
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,568
SEE, THERE'S SOMETHING          
ABOUT THAT BURGER.              

244
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,504
LOOK AT THE CRUST               
THAT IT BUILDS UP THERE.        

245
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,305
 PUT A LITTLE SALT ON IT, BUNS. 

246
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,508
EVERY BURGER YOU COOK           
GETS A LITTLE...                

247
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,510
             GETS TOASTED, YES, 
             TOP AND BOTTOM.    

248
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:40,645
             WE'LL FIX YOU ONE. 
ALL RIGHT, DO IT UP BABY.       

249
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,914
MUSTARD, ONION, SLAW,           

250
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,849
AND WE MOVE OVER HERE           
FOR YOUR CHILI.                 

251
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,986
YOU'RE GONNA PUT                
THE CHILI ON THE...             
           CHILI ON HERE, OKAY? 

252
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:50,254
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT.           

253
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,457
YOU SURE IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO ON 
THE VEGETABLES?                 

254
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,458
IT'LL GIVE IT                   
A LITTLE BETTER FLAVOR THAT WAY.

255
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:57,061
             PICKLE, GO FOR IT. 
OOH, LOOK AT THAT.              

256
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,464
MMM, THAT'S GREAT.              

257
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:02,734
THAT HAS ALL OF THE KEY PIECES  
THAT A GREAT BURGER NEEDS       
TO HAVE --                      

258
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,936
THE COOL SLAW,                  
THE BITE OF THE ONION,          

259
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:07,005
AND THEN YOU GET THE CHILI      
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SPICE.     

260
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,474
THAT IS BURGER 101 RIGHT THERE. 

261
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,743
       WE DROVE HERE BECAUSE OF 
       THE TASTE OF THE BURGER. 

262
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,878
               (woman)          
               IT TASTES FRESH  
               AND IT'S REALLY, 
               REALLY JUICY.    

263
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,947
            (man)               
            IT'S EXCELLENT,     
            JUST A GOOD BURGER. 

264
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,751
BUT I CAN SEE WHY               
YOU'VE BEEN SERVING             
BURGERS SINCE '55.              

265
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,887
                WAS IT THIS WAY 
              BACK IN THE '60s? 
OH YEAH.                        

266
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,890
 (Guy)                          
 FROM THE BURGERS TO THE DOG TO 
 THEIR TAKE ON A FISH SANDWICH. 

267
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,159
                 FISH-O-BURGER. 

268
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,827
IT'S SUPER MOIST.               

269
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:32,163
IT'S GOT REALLY NICE,           
BIG TEXTURE.                    

270
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,565
   (Guy)                        
   AND THIS ALL-TIME FAVORITE.  

271
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,800
EVERYBODY COMES                 
FOR THE ONION RINGS.            

272
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,835
             SO 300 ORDERS OF   
             ONION RINGS A DAY? 

273
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,838
       NOW I'M                  
       AN ONION RING AFICIONADO 

274
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,241
         AND I'VE BEEN CROWNED, 
         BESTOWED, LICENSED,    

275
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,844
   AND BLESSED                  
   IN ALL FACETS OF ONION RING. 

276
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:49,247
        HOW DID YOU LIKE ALL OF 
        THOSE ONE-LINERS?       

277
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,316
  WHAT MAKES A GOOD ONION RING? 

278
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,584
HAVING THEM CUT EVERY DAY.      

279
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,653
  BECAUSE ONIONS WILL DRY OUT,  
  THEY WILL LOSE THEIR PIZZAZZ. 

280
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,455
            AND ALL THE CENTERS 
            ARE PULLED OUT,     

281
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,524
          WE'RE JUST USING      
          THE NICE RING PIECES. 

282
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:02,127
         LET'S GET GOING ON IT. 
1/2 GALLON OF MILK.             

283
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,528
              A COUPLE OF EGGS. 
SALT, PEPPER.                   

284
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,463
WATER, REALLY,                  
THIS IS INTERESTING.            

285
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,332
A LITTLE BIT OF FLOUR.          

286
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:11,202
THE BATTER HAS TO BE            
A LITTLE BIT ON THE THICK SIDE. 

287
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,471
          DO YOU WANT ME TO ADD 
          SOME MORE FLOUR?      

288
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,406
THAT LOOKS THICK ENOUGH.        

289
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,475
START PUTTING 'EM IN THE MIX.   

290
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,477
TURN THEM AROUND,               
PUT THE RINGS IN THE FLOUR.     

291
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,346
GIVE 'EM LOVE,                  
TOSS 'EM, TURN 'EM.             

292
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,548
         YOU GUYS LOOKS SO GOOD 
         IN THERE, YOU'RE GONNA 
         HAVE A GOOD DAY TODAY. 

293
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,617
SHAKE 'EM UP,                   
SHAKE 'EM UP,                   
HELP ME, HELP ME.               

294
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:29,554
         I'M GIVING 'EM         
         ALL THE LOVE I'VE GOT. 

295
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:31,756
SHAKE 'EM UP IN THE FLOUR,      
THAT'S ALL THEY NEED.           

296
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,359
NOW WE GO BACK OVER HERE        
AND I DIP 'EM BACK IN HERE.     

297
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,894
            BECAUSE THE FLOUR'S 
            ON THE ONION RING   

298
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,364
THE BATTER'S STUCK TO THE FLOUR 
AND NOW IT ALL GOES IN          
THE CRACKER MEAL,               

299
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,899
          WHICH IS A NON-SALTED 
          CRACKER MEAL.         

300
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,235
           I'M MINING FOR FOOD  
           IN FLAVORTOWN RIVER. 

301
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,704
   OH LOOK, IT'S AN ONION RING. 

302
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,840
ALL RIGHT,                      
LET ME GET THEM OUT NOW.        

303
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,242
WE DO NEED 'EM TO SIT AROUND    
FOR THREE OR FOUR HOURS.        

304
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,611
  TO LET THAT BREADING COAT UP. 

305
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,914
(Guy)                           
DO YOU WANT ME TO HOLD THAT,    
NO, SHE'S GOT IT.               

306
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,249
    (Maria)                     
    THEN YOU JUST PUMP 'EM OUT. 

307
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,650
PUT ANOTHER BASKET              
ON TOP OF 'EM?                  
                           YEAH.

308
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,653
YOU LET THEM GO                 
UNTIL THEY'RE GOLDEN BROWN.     

309
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,721
ARE YOU GOING TO SALT THEM?     
                 NO, THAT'S IT. 

310
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,456
        ALL WE DO NOW           
        IS PUT 'EM IN THE BOWL. 

311
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,592
THAT'S A REGULAR ORDER?         

312
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,527
    MAYBE I ADDED AN EXTRA ONE,

         SUPER BOY ONION RINGS.

150 MILES FOR 'EM?              
                    ABSOLUTELY.

      THIS IS HISTORY.

    TO HOUSTON...

IT'S SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE.    

331
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,309
        (Guy)                   
        FOR WHAT ELSE,          
        ENGLISH PUB GRUB.       

332
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,511
I LIKE TO HAVE MY FOOD          
TO HAVE A BEGINNING,            
A MIDDLE, AND AN END.           

333
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,614
DUDE, YOU'VE GOT MORE ACTS THERE
THAN SHAKESPEARE.               

334
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,554
      SO HERE I AM              
      BETWEEN THE MONTROUS      

335

     AND RIVER OAKS AREA OF     
     HOUSTON, TEXAS

WHICH MIGHT BE,                 
WELL NOT EXACTLY                
WHAT EVERYBODY'S THINKING IT IS.

340
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:27,572
 I THOUGHT I WOULD CRUISE DOWN  
 IN THE RED '67 TO THE RED LION.

341
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:30,040
IT'S A LITTLE TASTE OF BRITAIN, 
WE CAN GET OUR FISH AND CHIPS.  

342
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,777
      YOU CAN HAVE INDIAN FOOD, 
      IT'S FANTASTIC.           

343
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,647
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE KNOW       
HOW MUCH INDIAN INFLUENCE       
IN DISHES THERE ARE IN ENGLAND. 

344
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,715
OH, IT'S HUGE.

           PUNJABI EGG ROLLS    
           AND SHEPHERD'S PIE.

00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,119
  (Guy)                         
  SO WHEN OWNER CRAIG MALLINSON 
  LEFT ENGLAND                  

347
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:45,723
       AND DECIDED TO OPEN      
       A REAL BRITISH PUB       
       HERE IN HOUSTON.         

348
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:49,327

  ON THE MENU.                  

350
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:55,733
  IT'S VERY, VERY MUCH IN LINE  
  WITH THE PUBS IN ENGLAND.     

351
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:58,602
 I'M HAVING THE FISH AND CHIPS, 
 IT'S EXCELLENT.                

352
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,872
      THE FOOD IS FABULOUS.     

353
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,074
WHO EMAILED ME                  
AND TOLD ME TO COME HERE.

355
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,078
THE BREAD PUDDING WAS AWESOME.  

356
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:10,080
          WHAT'S THE BEST THING 
                   ON THE MENU? 
CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA.

I TAKE A CHICKEN BREAST         
AND THEN I CUBE IT.             

359

NOW I'VE GOT A MASALA.          
                    YOU CAN BUY 
         PREPARED GARAM MASALA.

     AND CUMIN, SALT,           
     WE HAVE GARLIC WITH GINGER.

361
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,692
         AND THIS IS FENUGREEK? 
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

362
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,629
         THAT'S AN HERB YOU SEE 
         IN A LOT OF CURRIES.   

363
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:27,598
 WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

        SO THAT'S ALL MIXED UP.

          PRE-HEATED OVEN, 450, 

367
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,041
          FOR WHAT, 20 MINUTES? 
25 MINUTES.                     

368
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:39,510
THIS IS OUR SAUCE

             MIX THIS UP FIRST. 

374

STICK IT IN THE COOLER          
AND LET IT COOL DOWN OVERNIGHT  

391
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,360

00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,682
KOSHER SALT, CAYENNE PEPPER.    

416
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,618
WE MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT HOTTER  
HERE IN HOUSTON.                

417
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,954
AND THEN THE REAL FLAVOR,       
TANDOORI MASALA.                

418
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,490
THIS IS WHAT YOU WOULD TYPICALLY
RUB ON CHICKEN WHEN YOU PUT IT  
IN THE TANDOOR ON A SKEWER.     

419
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,493
THEN I'M GONNA FLIP IT OVER,    
AND GUESS WHAT?                 

420
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:37,628
           YOU'RE GONNA PUT     
           PEANUT BUTTER ON IT. 

421
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,831
YOU DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN,       
ALTHOUGH PEANUT BUTTER GO NICE. 

422
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,033
              SO VERY LIBERAL   
              ON THE SPICE RUB. 

423
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,968
WE PUT LEMON JUICE ON THAT.     

424
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,104
  THEN WE'RE GONNA HIT THE OVEN 
                  AT WHAT TEMP? 
450.                            

425
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,706
        THIS IS ONLY GONNA TAKE 
              MAYBE 25 MINUTES? 
25 EXACTLY.                     

426
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,109
  AND THEN WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN? 
WE'RE GONNA PULL IT APART.      

427
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,712
OH, YOU'RE GONNA                
HAVE TO HURRY UP.               

428
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,647
NOW WHO'S KNIVES ARE OVER THERE?

429
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:58,916
JUST THE LINE'S,                
I NEVER SAW THAT COMING.        

430
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:01,385
I'VE NEVER SEEN                 
YOUR SHOW BEFORE.               

431
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,121
             I'VE NEVER SEEN... 

432
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:05,122
            THIS IS CRAZY GOOD, 

433
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,191
               I'D LIKE THAT    
               WITH SOME PASTA. 

434
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:09,327
WE'RE GONNA BUILD               
THE QUESADILLA.                 

435
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,395
LIQUID BUTTER, CILANTRO,        
SUN-DRIED TOMATOES,             
CHILI PEPPER.                   

436
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,330
LIKE THAT,                      
LIBERAL, LIBERAL, LIBERAL.      

437
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,266
            SOME SHREDDED MOZZ, 
            CHICKEN'S NUTS.     

438
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,668
         I'M ON MY NINTH PIECE. 

439
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,937
WE HAVE THE PICKLED PEPPERS     
AND JUST A LITTLE BIT           
MORE CHEESE.                    

440
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,273
WE'RE GONNA PLACE IT            
IN A FRY PAN TO SAUTE IT.       

441
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,275
(Guy)                           
LOOK AT THE SPARKS,             
IT'S LIKE FOURTH OF JULY.       

442
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,611
        YEAH, IT'S PRETTY COOL, 
        ISN'T IT?               

443
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,812
    WE PROBABLY CAN'T CELEBRATE 
    BECAUSE WE LOST.            

444
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:31,415
     THANKS FOR REMINDING ME OF 
     SUCH A PAINFUL EXPERIENCE. 

445
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:33,284
OKAY, DOWN IT GOES.             

446
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,153
FIVE MINUTES                    
IT'LL BE READY TO GO.           

447
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,021
(Craig)                         
LOOK AT THAT.                   

448
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,089
HABANERO RELISH --              
CARROTS, ONION, CUCUMBER,       

449
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,891
GARLIC, AND, OF COURSE,         
HABANEROS.                      

450
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,160
WE STEEP IT IN WHITE VINEGAR.   

451
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,229
DON'T BE SHY, YOU'LL TASTE      
THE CILANTRO, CUCUMBER,         
AND MINT.                       

452
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,698
   MMM, DELICIOUS, REALLY NICE. 
THANK YOU.                      

453
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,368
            THAT IS FLAVOR      
            ALL OVER THE BOARD. 

454
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,369
I LIKE MY FOOD TO HAVE          
A BEGINNING, A MIDDLE,          
AND AN END.                     

455
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,639
DUDE, YOU'VE GOT MORE ACTS THERE
THAN SHAKESPEARE.               

456
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:57,641
FIVE MINUTES                    
ON THE QUESADILLA.              

457
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,977
 (woman)                        
 THEY'RE PHENOMENAL,            
 BEST QUESADILLAS I'VE EVER HAD.

458
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,979
      THERE'S KIND OF SOMETHING 
      FOR EVERYONE.             

459
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,848
     IT'S TRULY                 
     A TRADITIONAL ENGLISH PUB. 

460
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,782
    (Guy)                       
    AND THAT'S GOTTA MEAN...    

461
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,052
SHEPHERD'S PIE,                 
JUST LIKE GRANDMA USED TO MAKE. 
             NO, MY GRANDMOTHER 
               NEVER MADE THIS. 

462
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,188
              (Guy)             
              WHEN WE COME BACK.

463
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:17,094
               (Guy)            
               AT THE RED LION  
               IN HOUSTON, TEXAS

464
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:20,431
      CRAIG MALLINSON'S DOING   
      THE BRITISH PUB GRUB THING
      FOR REAL                  

465
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,635
FROM INDIAN FAVORITES           
TO TRADITIONAL BRITISH CLASSICS.

466
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,705
(woman)                         
THIS IS THE BEST SHEPHERD'S PIE 
I HAVE EVER HAD.                

467
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
             (Guy)              
             NOW SHEPHERD'S PIE 
             ALWAYS HAS LAMB?   

468
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,909
LAST TIME I CHECKED             

469
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,911
SHEPHERDS DO NOT SHEPHERD CATTLE
THEY SHEPHERD SHEEP.            

470
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,847
          THAT WAS THE PROBLEM. 

471
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,781
          TRIM ALL THE FAT OFF, 
          BREAK IT DOWN,        

472
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:40,050
         WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, 
                       CUBE IT? 
NO, BIG SHANKS.                 

473
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,119
THE FAT AND THE BONE            
WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH IT,        

474
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:43,987
IT GOES IN A BIG STOCK POT      

475
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:46,190
AND WE'LL MAKE OUR OWN STOCK    
FROM SCRATCH AS WELL.           

476
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,991
    THAT'S AN IN DEPTH PROCESS. 
I LIKE GOOD FOOD,               
I LIKE FRESH FOOD.              

477
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,260
     (Craig)                    
     A LIBERAL AMOUNT OF OIL,   
     FRESH GARLIC AND ROSEMARY. 

478
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,129
YOU HAVE TO PUREE IT            
'TIL IT BREAKS DOWN             
REALLY EVENLY.                  

479
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,064
IT SMELLS SO GOOD.              

480
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,400
YOU WANT TO HIT                 
THOSE ONIONS QUICK?             
                    YES PLEASE. 

481
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:59,203
KEEP THAT GARLIC FROM BURNING   
AND NOW YOU WANT TO GO MEAT?    
             MEAT WILL BE GOOD. 

482
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,338
       NOW YOU'RE JUST GONNA PUT
       A BROWN ON IT.           

483
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,674
   LOOKING LIKE THE MINCED MEAT 
   WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE.        

484
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,743
              DEEP BASE,        
              CARROTS, TURNIPS. 

485
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,879
           WE'RE GONNA DO       
           THE POTATOES ON TOP. 

486
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,147
           MY FAVORITE, CELERY. 

487
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:12,283
WOULD YOU LIKE                  
THE BAY LEAF NOW TOO?           
                  NO THANK YOU. 

488
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,685
  I LIKE THAT LAST              
  LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER SHOWED ME.

489
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,687
             AND NOW WE'RE READY
             FOR OUR STAR.      

490
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,623
HOLY STOCK, BATMAN.             

491
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,491
YOU WANT IT ALL THE WAY, CHEF?  
                   ALL THE WAY. 

492
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,560
  HOW LONG ARE WE GONNA LET THIS
  SIT HERE AND SIMMER DOWN?     

493
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:25,029
           AT LEAST 45 MINUTES. 

494
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:27,865
OOH!                            
           NOW WE'RE A KITCHEN. 

495
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,568
       BAY LEAVES, COOK IT DOWN,
       LET IT COOL DOWN.        

496
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:33,037
           THEN LATER ON        
           WHEN IT'S SOLIDIFIED 
           AND IT COMES TOGETHER

497
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,972
        WE'RE GONNA PLATE IT UP.

498
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,441
                           (Guy)
                      NO STARCH 
     TO TIGHTEN THAT UP AT ALL? 
NOPE.                           

499
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,443
FRESH MASHED POTATOES.          

500
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,445
    YOU MAKE THE MASH YOURSELF? 
ABSOLUTELY.                     

501
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,447
SPRINKLE A LITTLE BIT OF        
CHEDDAR CHEESE ON TOP           

502
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,516
AND IN THE OVEN,                
FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES           
TO HEAT THE WHOLE THING THROUGH,

503
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,784
AND WE'RE JUST ABOUT READY.     

504
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,987
      LOOK AT THAT,             
      LOOK AT THAT STEAM        
      COME OFF OF THAT BAD BOY. 

505
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:52,023
             WHAT DO YOU THINK, 
             GONNA BE HOT?      

506
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,192
              MMM, THAT'S NICE. 

507
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:57,395
JUST LIKE                       
GRANDMOTHER USED TO MAKE.       

508
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,931
             NO, MY GRANDMOTHER 
             NEVER MADE THIS.   

509
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,332
       THE AMOUNT OF GARLIC     
       AND THAT ROSEMARY KICKER 
       THAT YOU PUT IN THERE,   

510
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,468
               I GOTTA TELL YA, 
               I'M DIGGIN' IT.  

511
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:07,471
        THE VEGGIES ARE TENDER, 
        THE LAMB'S COOKED DOWN, 

512
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,541
 A GRAVY THAT IS JUST FORTIFIED 
 WITH MASSIVE FLAVOR.           

513
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:14,212
      A COLD DAY IN HOUSTON     
      I'D ORDER THAT LIKE THAT. 

514
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,413
       SHEPHERD'S PIE UP.
