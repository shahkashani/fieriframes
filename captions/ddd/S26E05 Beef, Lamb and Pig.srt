 Let's do it.                   
                   Now, first,  
         what I'm gonna do is...

69
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,122
A little garlic down            
into some olive oil.            

70
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,125
      A little bit of red onion,

71
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:42,594
            Then we're gonna add
             a little beef base.

72
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:45,464
     Water. Let that reduce down
             for a little while.

73
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,332

74
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,534
               and thicken it   
       with a cornstarch slurry.

75
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:50,668
And that will be the sauce      
  for the cabbage?              

76
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,003
        It's the sauce that goes
               on the cabbage.  

77
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,138
On top of the cabbage?          
       Got it.

        Mmm.                    

113
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,878
You come into an Irish place,   
you're going to expect          

114
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,413
that they're going to have      
  a stuffed cabbage             

115
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,481
   and it's gonna               
   be really good.              

116
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,016
You guys did it right.          

117
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:13,151
            -Awesome.           
    -Everything's in balance.   

118
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:16,021
You still get a little          
bite out of the veggie.         
                       Mm-hmm.  

119
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:19,224
It hasn't cooked the lamb down  
so far that it's dried out.     

120
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:21,026
 'Cause by no means             
     is it dry.                 

121
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,295
I thought the cheddar cheese    
was a little bit weird,         

122
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:25,030
and I can't even find           
the cheddar cheese in here.     

123
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,497
But there's something           
      going on.                 

124
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,233
Maybe that's keeping            
some of the fat in there.       

125
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:31,169
It works really well.           

126
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,105
  I would come back             
and eat that every time.        

127
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,106
     Righteous.                 

128
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,707
                 Picking up     
             a stuffed cabbage. 

129
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,043
       It's really tasty,       
          and it works.         

130
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:40,779
    MAN: Just a really savory   
      comfort type of food.     

131
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,648
    You don't really find it    
   anywhere else around here.   

132
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,517
                 Fish cakes     
          for table one, please.

133
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,385
       Michael, being from      
      the west of Ireland,      

134
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,322
  he's brought back the taste,  
   the culture, the character,  

135
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:53,124
          and the look          
     of a real Ireland pub.     

136
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,527
     It's very festive here,    
         not party-like,        

137
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,529
   but just neighborhood-like.  

138
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,197
Okay. So, the first time        
I came to Louisville,           

139
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,465
        I ate                   
in this guy's steakhouse.       

140
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,467
Now, he's got a steakhouse      
   in Cincinnati.               

141
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,202
He's got one in Nashville.      

142
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,338
This, ladies and gentlemen,     
is the famous Jeff Ruby.        

143
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,674
So you're in the first Irish pub
restaurant in Louisville.       

144
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:10,875
               You know what?   
             This is good, too. 

145
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,678
        -Stuffed cabbage.       
           -Very good.          

146
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,413
  You know how many people don't
     make mashed potatoes right?

147
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:15,814
               These are good.  

148
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,483
 FIERI: And the potatoes top off
       this Irish staple.

151
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:23,955
 It's the ultimate comfort food.

170
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,064
          -First up...          
          -Little oil.          

171
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,867
            We're gonna add, uh,
       5 pounds of premium beef.

172
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,935
 -We're not seasoning the meat? 
          -No, not yet.

     Adding the carrots, celery.

   against onion?

00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:30,488
     Bunch of water to cover it.

 we seasoning this?             

188
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,427
       After it comes to a boil.
                  It works.

00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,229
           -Trust me.           
       -I'm trusting you.       

190

          Then, we been boiling.

191
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,766
           We're gonna add salt,
                white pepper,   

192
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,235
               some bay leaf,   
      a little bit of beef base.

             -Okay.             
    -Little bit of Guinness.

00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,307
            -Next up?           
-Now I'm gonna thicken the stew.

196
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:52,444
        We're gonna pour some of
         the stew and strain it.

197
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:55,247
You're mining for gold          
   in Flavortown.               

198
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,781
          And then I'm gonna add
              some roux to it.  

199
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,249
    Oil or butter               
    on that roux?               

200
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,918
       Butter, butter and flour.

202
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,055
               And then add it  
              back to the stew. 

203
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,190
And how long is that gonna go   
until we're ready to serve?     

204
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,792
     -Two or three minutes.     
         -And that's it.        

205
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,194
           -That's it.          
    -On to a big bread bowl.    

206
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,730
         Get you a good old bite
                   of it.       

207
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:12,998
 Now we're talking.

 gonna make it home.            

209
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:17,602
               Top it off with  
              a little taters.

        Cheddar makes it better.

211
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,440
              And here you have 
              the cottage pie.  

212
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,811

215
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:39,624

the seasoning timing.           

216
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,493
But right off the bat,

  incredibly well.              

221

00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,641
That's a nice cheddar           
    on top of it.               

224
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,843
I mean, this is just            
flat-out comfort food.          

225
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,111
I've had four bites.            

226
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,180
   And I'm already              
getting glossy-eyed.            

227
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,649
                    Yeah,       
           it's some good stuff.

228
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,651
    It just keeps               
 sucking me back in.            

229
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,186
        Come get one more of it.

230
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,422
Like a tractor beam.            
I just want one more.           

231
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,259
  You're a bad man.             

232
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:17,194
          -Cottage pie.         
           -Thank you.          

233
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,998
     Everything's delicious     
        about this dish.        

234
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,533
    It's tremendously hearty.   

235
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:22,867
              MAN:              
    I've had this in Ireland.   

236
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,403
   And this compares or beats   
      whatever I had there.     

237
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,272
Salmon potato gratin.           

238
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,740
 Irish Rover is the best place. 

239
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,009
 Comfort food, friends, family. 

240
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,612
  It's just a fun place to come 
      any time of the year.     

241
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,814
   People tell me,              
that have been in Ireland,      

242
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:38,950
and when they come here, say,   
"I think I'm still on vacation."

243
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,619
  So that's as good             
 as it gets for me.             

244
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,019
That's about as good as it works
                   for me.      
    Yes, sir.

           -Thank you.          

246
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:45,824

     and opened this joint.     

275
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,926
       I'm very particular about
        how we make the burgers.

276
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,462
      The beef has to be really,
            really good quality.

277
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,464
        We get it from La Frieda

278
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:02,267

     beefy flavor of the burger.

279
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,534
    Did you just use "yummy"?   

280
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,203
   Why don't you write a song   
       called "Bang Bang"?

        just so you know,       

296
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,097
we're gonna count how many times
        he says "yummy."        

297
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,732
   So we're at four right now.  

298
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,833
             So I'm starting out
   with some mayonnaise on here.

299
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,968
      I'm gonna put a little bit
        of Monterey Jack cheese,

300
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,439
     shredded American, and then
     some shredded Swiss cheese.

301
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:42,974
          Why the three         
       different cheeses?       

302
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,243
           Tastes good together,
                 not yummy.     

303
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,179
           Diced jalapeños here,
                  pimiento.     

304
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,582
             -Okay.             
   -A little bit of sriracha.   

305
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,584
       My mammy and gramps      
    are from North Carolina.    

306
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,653
        And when she made       
        pimiento cheese,        

307
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:57,789
        I don't remember        
  the sriracha being in there.  

308
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,858
 You grew up in the hill country
       of North Carolina.       

309
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,793
           -Sriracha?           
          -Not at all.          

310
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,528
          And then this is a mix
             of salt and pepper.

311
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,130
         What's the name        
       of your new album?       

312
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:06,731
  "Yummy Bang Bang              
   Country Music."              

313
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,365
      -Country and western.     
          -And western.         

314
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,801
         That's awesome.        

315
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,003
  Now, this gets better when it 
 spends a little time together? 

316
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,472
                 Yeah, it gets  
        a little bit more dense.
           Fantastic.           

317
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,875
So we're gonna go ahead and make
      the brine for our pickles.

318
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,275
          We have some hot water
            starting right here,

319
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,944
               garlic cloves,   
              whole jalapeños.  

320
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,078
            Jalapeño.           

321
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,546
                Brown sugar,    
               regular sugar,   

322
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,548
              some kosher salt, 
                peppercorns.    

323
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,883
           So now it has to cook
               for 10 minutes.  

324
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,886
            We're gonna go ahead
      and add our white vinegar,

325
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,220
       some apple cider vinegar.

326
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,621
    All right. So we're gonna   
       let this sit here.       

327
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:31,956
                Cook it down    
                a little bit.   

328
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,424
           You know, the flavors
             actually come out. 

329
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,627
 And then this is gonna go over 
the top of the sliced cucumbers.

330
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,762
      And how long are you      
       gonna let it brine?      

331
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,497
        Usually two, three days.

332
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:40,831
       How are they gonna       
    be served on the burger?    

333
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,700
    We're gonna go ahead and dip
         in some tempura batter.

334
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,636
           We're gonna fry them,
        get 'em a little crispy.

335
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:45,904
    What do those taste like?   

336
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,572
                   Yummy.       

337
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:48,573
                 All right,     
        now we're gonna go ahead

338
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,040
                and cook our    
          pimiento cheeseburger.

339
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,710
         Kosher salt and pepper.

340
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,512
             We get a great bun 
           from the local bakery

341
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,446
            called Duke's Bread.

342
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,715
               They're yummy.   
             They're delicious. 

343
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,584
              Add our homemade  
              pimiento cheese.  

344
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,919
            Got that right here.

345
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:05,390
             And then we garnish
 with our crispy, fried pickles.

346
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,792
   -That's all she wrote, huh?  
             -Yeah.             

347
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,527
    You know how to do this?    
             Own it.            

348
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,396
      -Really get in there.     
           -Yeah, man.          

349
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,134
          Great burger.         

350
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,670
       The La Frieda meat       
   definitely is a plus-plus.   

351
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,739
    Get a lot of beef flavor,   
        lot of pimiento.        

352
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,675
I think that that yummy pimiento
cheese on this is...            

353
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,010
        It doesn't count        
         if you say it.         

354
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,812
         -...is awesome.        
        -Really nice bun.       

355
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,681
   And I think that the fried   
      pickle is the kicker.     

356
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,015
   -That's what makes it work.  
           -It's good.          

357
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,350
         -Tasty pickle.         
         -They're yummy.        

358
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,418
          That's eight.         

359
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,752
         Those that are         
     playing along at home,     

360
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,088
        total data board,       
 we're at eight, going for 12th.

361
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,424
  The pimiento burger is great. 
      It's got good flavor.     

362
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,494
      It's some of the best     
 pimiento cheese I've ever had. 

363
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:44,361
     The deep-fried pickles     
        give it a crunch.       

364
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,763
     And you have the little    
       kick of the spices.      

365
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,566
     One ingredient doesn't     
      overpower the other.      

366
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,034
             -Nice.             
 -That's kind of like in music. 

367
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,036
      Well said.                
               You don't want   
              too much cowbell. 

368
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:52,970
              -No.              
            -Awesome.           

369
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,505
               Favorite burger  
                on the menu?    

370
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,641
          I really love         
        the Soul Burger.        

371
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,976
         -Gangnam Style.        
      -I got a burger bowl.     

372
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,512
 -You ordered the Cowboy Burger?
            -Mm-hmm.            

373
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:01,980
        MAN:                    
I'm a barbecue-sauce man.       

374
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,982
              Me and you both.  

375
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,716
     Today, I had the Fried     
    Sweet Potato Brie Burger.   

376
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,520
        It's got the Brie       
      with sweet potatoes.      

377
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:11,990
The maple-cranberry sauce on top
  really ties it all together.  

378
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:13,124
        All right, Chef,        
        what are we into?       

379
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,325
          Maple-cranberry cream.

380
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,527
           We've got sour cream,
                 mayonnaise.    

381
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,129
        Comes with a free       
         gym membership.        

382
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,864
             -Yeah.             
   -This is real maple syrup.   

383
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,132
            -B or A?            
               -B.              

384
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,134
             B has more flavor. 
              Dry cranberries.  

385
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,336
       So I'm gonna go ahead and
   blend this until it's smooth.

386
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,605
   I've seen some weird sauces  
        on burgers, Chef.       

387
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,942
      -Could take the cake.     
      -It's gonna be good.      

388
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,410
         I didn't think         
   that was going to be good.   

389
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,611
             -Yeah?             
      -That's really good.      

390
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,613
               Now, these are   
       the sweet-potato balls --

391
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,081
         roasted sweet potatoes,

392
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,418
     melted butter, maple syrup,
       diced prosciutto, chives.

393
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,754
        Go ahead and mix this up
       by hand and scoop it out.

394
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:44,222
   Put it in some tempura batter

395
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,690
           and some bread crumbs
       and drop it in the fryer.

396
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,893
 -Okay. Let's make this burger. 
           -All right.          

397
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,628
              These are burgers 
           that we just grilled.

398
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,297
         And there's Brie cheese
               on top of that.  

399
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:53,631
               A little sauce.  

400
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,967
               Now, these are   
         the sweet-potato balls.

401
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,368
       -That doesn't suck.      
          -That's good.         

402
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,036
        A little bit of arugula.

403
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,171
           Here we go.          

404
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,108
           -Oh, yeah.           
            -Mm-hmm.            

405
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,776
 -That's a pretty mature burger.
       -Yeah, that's good.      

406
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,111
          I don't want          
      to downplay the meat      

407
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,312
 'cause the meat's really good. 

408
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,381
 But it's the sweet-potato ball 
         is the kicker.         

409
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:11,515
                Adds a little   
           texture to it, right?

410
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,584
The burger is exactly           
  how it should be.             

411
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,186
     That's why                 
  that stands out.              

412
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,521
Let's do this again.            

413
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,855
                   Enjoy.       

414
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,258
   I have a Fried Sweet Potato  
        and Brie Burger.        

415
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,194
   It's just fun, almost like   
   Thanksgiving dinner party.   

416
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,930
  The sweet potato really, uh,  
      complements the Brie.     

417
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,131
      And it's outstanding.     

418
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,200
             If there was a word
      that you would describe it

419
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,802
      that started with a "Y"...

420
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:32,537
             Yummy.             

421
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,604
            Oh, boy.            

422
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,073
   I'm giving this place a 10.  

423
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,942
  The creativity that goes into 
   every burger really shows.   

424
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,410
         Nice job, Chef.        
            Nice job.           

425
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:40,545
                 Thank you.     

426
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,284
     Up next, we're staying     
         in Charlotte...

433

  We're trying to have a moment 
            over here           

434

00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,912
 to check out a barbecue joint. 

439

    You never heard that one    
    coming before, have you?    

440
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,382
       Well, it's not just      
       any barbecue joint.      

441
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:20,651
   No, this one's got kind of,  
   like, a funky Asian fusion.  

442

    Well, I guess that's why    
 they call it The Improper Pig.

00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,605
    held over from the joint    
       he ran here before.      

449
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,073
        It's just really        
      kind of a combination     

450
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,341
     you normally don't get.    

451
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:44,875
             FIERI:             
   From wok-seared green beans  

452
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,744
 and Southern-inspired egg rolls

453
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,345
     to this meaty mash-up.     

454
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:49,681
              Chaobao Taco up.  

455
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:51,548
The Chaobao Tacos are wonderful.

456
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,285
  And all the flavors together  
     are just so delicious.     

457
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,486
       FIERI:                   
Give me the breakdown here.     

458
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,554
         Well, we're gonna start
              with Will's Rub.  

459
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:57,822
It's called Will's Rub?         

460
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,490
         It's called Will's Rub.
          Will actually made it.

461
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,825
          -No, really.          
              -Yep.             

462
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:03,094
              So we have ground 
           celery seed, paprika,

463
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,430
            chili powder, cumin,
               brown mustard.   

464
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:06,631
            -Cayenne?           
           -Yes, sir.           

465
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,233
        Add, uh, ground oregano,
               garlic powder.   

466
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,902
         -Onion powder.         
   -Little bit of brown sugar.  

467
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:13,303
      -That's light brown.      
  -Think it's a Southern thing. 

468
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,107
             Some course ground 
      black pepper, kosher salt.

469
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,975
Mix that all together,          
 onto the pork butt.            

470
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,176
               Boneless butt.   

471
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,179
I like the way you rub.         

472
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,781
        Roll.                   
You know what I meant.          

473
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,750
  -We let it sit for 24 hours.  
             -Okay.             

474
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:28,385
             Then we'll smoke it
with hickory wood 12 hours, 220,

475
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,721
                till it hits    
             about 190 degrees. 

476
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,122
  All right, Chef,              
  what are we into?             

477
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,659
          Sesame-ginger dressing
         for our Asian coleslaw.

478
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:35,793
            So start with water.

479
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,327
    That's always               
my favorite ingredient.         

480
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,463
              Japanese vinegar, 
                 soy sauce.     

481
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,932
   Tons of ginger.              

482
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:42,933
                Black pepper,   
                brown ginger.   

483
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,268
               We're gonna put  
             our miso paste in. 

484
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,737
    Miso paste in               
  a barbecue joint?             

485
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,406
We're gonna get run out of town,
buddy, if you keep this up.     

486
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:51,742
     Honey, dried, fried onions,
          roasted, dried garlic.

487
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,744
         After that, we're gonna
                Bermix this.    

488
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,479
              I'm gonna slowly  
               add sesame oil,  

489
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,216
            a little bit of, uh,
                blended oil.    

490
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:00,184
  Better get union              
   scale for that.              

491
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,554
Oh, take some of that.          

492
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,222
             So our Asian slaw's
                Napa cabbage,   

493
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,958
               carrots in it,   
       fresh chopped "cilantra."

494
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,493
       -What did you say?       
           -Cilantro.           

495
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:10,661
Play that tape back.            

496
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:11,629
                 "Cilantra."    

497
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,230
He said, "cilantra,"            
     didn't he?                 

498
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,100
                 Scallions,     
             or the "scal-yons."

499
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:17,435
              Ginger dressing.  

500
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:18,703
Look at all the ginger          
  sitting in there,             

501
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,304
  that pulpy-ness.              

502
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,642
 Oh, that's awesome.            
I could eat the whole thing.    

503
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,144
          Next step, we're gonna
               pull some pork.  

504
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,313
What is that, kind of like      
the discount Wolverine?         

505
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,315
                   That is      
           a discount Wolverine.

506
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:35,052
The bark on this is gangster.   
  Nice and tender.              

507
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,521
  This is gonna go              
together for the bun?           

508
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,189
    We're actually gonna do this
       in the, uh -- in the wok.

509
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,525
   Okay. Wok out.               

510
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,259
           Just a good old chunk
              of pork in there, 

511
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,529
             spicy hoisin sauce,
                steamed bun.    

512
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:47,331
 -Where are we getting the buns?
  -We have a little Asian shop. 

513
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,133
      -Makes buns for you?      
    -And they make our buns.    

514
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:52,603
 Gonna drizzle the hoisin on top
             and the Asian slaw.

515
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,272
Oh, that's good. The pick is    
gonna really do something.      

516
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,008
   I tried the bamboo umbrellas.
              They didn't work. 

517
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,277
Yeah, that's ridiculous.        

518
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,481
There is nothing that           
I do not love about this.       

519
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:07,618
 That's really good.            

520
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,353
Is there a little spice         
   in your hoisin?              

521
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:12,756
       It is. It's, uh, roasted,
            uh, manzano peppers.

522
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,692
     Thanks, uh,                
for letting me know.            

523
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:17,495
  The spicy hoisin              
    is gangster.                

524
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:19,163
That's my favorite part         
 of the whole thing.            

525
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,098
The slaw is spot-on,            

526
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,035
the pork butt super tender,     
and a really good bun.          

527
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:27,171
For something like that         
to have that much flavor        

528
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,839
     to give me                 
 that kind of punch,            

529
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,174
  I'm down with it              
    all day long.               

530
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:33,044
        -Fantastic, Chef.       
           -Thank you.          

531
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:34,645
    I love the Chaobao Taco.    

532
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,780
    Has some ginger accents,    
      which I really love.      

533
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,049
     That whole combination     
   really works good together.  

534
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,319
 FIERI: But just because they're
     mixing in some Far East    

535
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:44,121
 doesn't mean they've forgotten 
      their Southern roots      

536
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,991
  'cause when it comes to 'cue, 
      they got you covered.     

537
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,459
                 We have six    
              different sauces, 

538
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,061
               everything made  
          from scratch in-house.

539
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:51,596
             WOMAN:             
   You can try something spicy  

540
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:54,131
    or if you want something    
  kind of mild and comforting.  

541
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,801
             FIERI:             
   And they all come standard   
 with this smoked meat sampler. 

542
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,402
    Improper Charcuterie up.    

543
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:01,005
 It's got ribs, smoked sausage, 
  pulled pork, and the brisket. 

544
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,540
          It's awesome.         

545
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:03,941
  All right, Chef,              
so what are we into now?        

546
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:06,343
   -We're gonna rub our ribs.   
      -So St. Louis-style.      

547
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,945
     And, uh, the rub we already
       made earlier, Will's Rub.

548
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,414
 Got it. Will's Rub.            
Will there be enough?           

549
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,749
           There will be plenty.

550
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,351
And with the brisket over here, 
  this monstrosity              

551
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:18,288
[Whistles] I guess that's where 
all the dinosaurs ended up.     

552
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,491
Let 'em go for 24 hours,        
 then in the smoker.            

553
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,159
             It's about 12 hours
                to 13 hours.    

554
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,694
         -Okay. At 220?         
              -220.             

555
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,629
Put it together, boss.          

556
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,898
              House-made slaw,  
pickled onions, pimiento cheese.

557
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,900
           We've got our grilled
        andouille sausage, ribs.

558
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,768
             -Okay.             
          -Pulled pork,         

559
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,304
               followed up by   
        the slow-cooked brisket.

560
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,840
           And then we finish it
              with house chips. 

561
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:39,043
Do you get a complimentary      
feed bag to put on or...        

562
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,245
              It'll definitely  
                fill you up.    

563
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:43,447
  Good-looking rib.             
    Look at that.               

564
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:47,251
  Some good smoke,              
     nice bark.                 

565
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,653
  You finish those              
    on the grill?               
                       Yes, sir.

566
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,523
Here's a little piece           
  of that brisket.              

567
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,859
Tender, a lot of smoke inside.  
  Pimiento's nice.              

568
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,595
    Dip the chip,               
  the whole thing.              

569
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:59,396
    When it comes               
 to this cornucopia,            

570
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,665
what's the Queen Bee?           

571
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:04,067
           Queen Bee is our, uh,
         house-made sweet sauce.

572
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,403
That definitely works.          

573
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,338
  Eastern Vinegar,              
this is all Carolina.           

574
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,275
This is what it's really        
  all about for me.             

575
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:13,010
Oh, yeah. And you cooked        
all the meats correctly.        

576
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,211
I mean, everything's            
 done the right way.            

577
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,746
 But to give people             
     the chance                 

578
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:18,015
to take it the next step        
      their way                 

579
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,950
 is, uh -- is pretty            
   smart business.              

580
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,086
 That's really good.            

581
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,887
        -Well done, Chef.       
           -Thank you.          

582
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,090
   MAN: Awesome barbecue ribs,  
          the brisket,          

583
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:27,557
  just the right amount of fat. 

584
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,493
       And then the sauces      
         are phenomenal.        

585
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:31,295
 The Improper Pig is wonderful. 

586
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,230
     When you come in here,     
      everything's a treat.     

587
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,032
   Well done, man.              
They're lucky to have you.      

588
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,368
                      Thank you.
    You did good,               
you and your "cilantra."        

589
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,773
  Was that a road trip or what? 
        But don't worry.        

590
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,576
   There's plenty more joints   
  all over this great country.  

591
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,445
     I'll be looking for you    
    next time on "Triple D."    

592
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,915
  -Favorite thing on the menu?  
 -Oh, the ice-cream sandwiches. 

593
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,117
             What? I'm over here
  talking to you about barbecue.

594
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,518
               And you give me  
             ice-cream sandwich?

595
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,953
I have a dessert problem.       

596
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,455
           Actually, this is not
        even really a food show.

597
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:59,056
             We're here to talk 
              to you about it.  

598
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,224
        You were actually scared
                for a second.
