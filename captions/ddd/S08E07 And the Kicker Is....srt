00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:58,704
             AND WHAT'S IN THIS?
FIVE DIFFERENT TYPES            
    OF CHEESE--                 

101
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:00,639
THERE'S CREAM CHEESE,           
PEPPER JACK, PARMESAN,          

102
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:03,908
BLUE CHEESE AND GOAT CHEESE.    
           THAT'S WHERE THE TANG
              IS COMING FROM.   

103
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:05,910
     I DID ACTUALLY TASTE IT    
         AHEAD OF TIME,         

104
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,913
            YOU KNOW,           
  JUST FOR SCIENTIFIC PURPOSES. 

105
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,314
           GREEN TOMATOES READY?
YEP.                            

106
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,049
           SO THE BURGER'S DONE.
AND THEN...                     

107
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,318
                   LOOK AT THIS.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STEAM IT      
    THAT MUCH, BUT...           

108
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:15,586
         THAT CHEESE IS SO SOFT 
       AND THAT BURGER'S SO HOT.
OH, YEAH.                       

109
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,789

FITS IN THERE PERFECTLY.        

116
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,805
 A LITTLE BIT OF THE BITTERNESS 
          OF THE TOMATO         

117
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,807

00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,277
  THAT CHEESE IS OUT OF BOUNDS. 
      LOOK HOW IT'S MELTED.     

119
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:39,811

      CREAMINESS.               

120
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,214
 A LITTLE SPINACH INSIDE OF IT. 
    THE BEAN SALAD IS GREAT.    

121
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:44,082

217
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,961
    I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT BREAD    
   WAS SUPPOSED TO TASTE LIKE   

218
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,362
    UNTIL I CAME TO SOPHIA'S.   

219
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,897
WHAT KIND OF BREAD IS IT?       
        IT'S JUST A TRADITIONAL 
              WHITE BREAD.      

220
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,167

221
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,035
YOU'RE NOT MEASURING IT?        
               NO, IT'S ALL EYE.

222
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:26,037
BAKING'S SUPPOSED TO BE         
A PRECISE ACT, BROTHER.         

223
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,839
       YEAH, WELL, WHEN YOU COOK
              WITH LOVE,        

224
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,841
    YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS ADD    
 A LITTLE MORE SUGAR THAN SALT. 

225
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,843
         ALL RIGHT, THERE WE GO.
              THERE'S THAT.     
A LITTLE YEAST.                 

226
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,945
                 A LITTLE YEAST.

228
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,915
   YOU ADD THE WATER, AND THEN  
 WE'RE GONNA START ADDING FLOUR.

229
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,385
DID WE AT LEAST                 
 MEASURE THIS?                  
               NO, WE USUALLY   
            TELL THE CONSISTENCY

230
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:43,455
          WHEN IT STOPS STICKING
               TO THE BOWL.     
   THAT'S HOW YOUR MOM          
TAUGHT YOU HOW TO MAKE IT?      

231
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:45,256
              PRETTY MUCH, YEAH.
THAT'S REAL BAKING, MAN.        

232
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:48,193
         YEAH, WE'RE GONNA NEED 
       TO ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE.
IS IT A LITTLE SOUPY?           

233
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,128
                           YEAH.
        IS THIS                 
STARTING TO LOOK RIGHT?         

234
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,130
 YEAH, IT'S STARTING            
TO LOOK A LOT BETTER.           

235
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:54,098
WE'RE READY TO GET IT OUT       
      OF THE BOWL.              

236
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:57,002
   WE SET IT RIGHT UP ON TOP,   
TIE IT UP, LET THE HEAT RISE IT.

237
00:08:57,137 --> 00:09:00,005
      SO WE'LL LET THIS PROOF.  
    OH, THIS THING LOOKS LIKE...
BALLOON READY TO POP.           
GONNA TAKE THIS OFF.            

238
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:02,006
  WE'LL JUST PULL ENOUGH        
TO START OFF WITH ONE PAN.      

239
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,409
GONNA FLOUR IT A LITTLE BIT.    
          YOU'RE JUST ROLLING IT
               INTO ITSELF.     

240
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,277
YEAH, FOLDING IT OVER.          
                I MEAN,         
      VERY SLIGHTLY KNEADING IT.

241
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,279
    YOU DON'T WANT              
TO OVERWORK THE DOUGH.          
                             NO.

242
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,348
     BECAUSE THE YEAST MIGHT    
  JUST GET DESTROYED, YOU KNOW? 

243
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,951
HERE WE GO. WE GOTTA OIL OUR PAN

244
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:14,819

   SOME WHITE CORNMEAL          

399
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:02,000
