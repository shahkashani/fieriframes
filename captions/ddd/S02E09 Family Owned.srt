                   WHAT ARE     
              THEY MARINATED IN?
BOURBON MARINADE SAUCE.         

216
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:05,083
      IT'S GOOD. GREAT TEXTURE. 

217
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,752

   THAN, LIKE, FAST FOOD.       

218
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,754

     ARE THICKER,               

219
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,689

220
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:14,358
   AWESOME. THE FISH IS ABOUT   
      AS FRESH AS IT GETS.      

221
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,628
    WELL, WE WANTED THE KIDS    
      TO HAVE AN EXPERIENCE     

222
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,629
  AND SEE WHAT A DINER IS LIKE. 

223
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,565
       DINERS ARE DINERS.       
     I ALWAYS LIKED DINERS.     

224
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:23,034
      FOOD'S GREAT. I MEAN,     
   IT'S, YOU KNOW, DINER FOOD.  

225
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,436
     (Guy) WAS YOUR GRANDFATHER 
     IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS 

226
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,906
       BEFORE HE GOT THIS DINER?
      (man) NO.                 
HE WAS A TRUCK DRIVER.          

227
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,641
BASICALLY, HE DROVE             
  THROUGH THE...                

228
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,310
AND HE THOUGHT, MAYBE THIS WOULD
  BE A GREAT PLACE FOR A DINER, 

229
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,779
AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW,        
  HE OPENED UP A DINER.         

230
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,716
     UH, I WORKED WITH MY FATHER
            FOR 26 YEARS,       

231
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,252

     BY MYSELF ANOTHER 26 YEARS.

266
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,388

272
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:04,536
IT'S KIND OF THE THING ABOUT

    IT'S MOSTLY ALL CORNED BEEF.
HOLY MOLY.                      

277
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,613

       INTO THIS OR--           

278

280
