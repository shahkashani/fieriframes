                 very often.

            I've been surprised.

             at the restaurant? 

44
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,767
Yes. Show what Mexico           
     really is.                 

45
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,169
 If you've never been to Mexico,

Four-corn tortillas.            

49
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,711
      I get excited looking     
   at the tortilla. [ Laughs ]

       I love that thing.       
         It's fantastic.        

51
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:55,647
                 All right,     
             what are we making?

52
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,117
The four-corn tortillas.        

53
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,984
 We're going to make            
the masa from scratch.          

54
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,921
       I've seen mortar pestles,
                 molcajetes.    

55
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,256
           I've never seen that.

00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:06,458
       Metate.                  
                    Metate.     

57
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,328
 We use it for corn.            
We use it for peppers.          

58
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,263
We use it for spices.           

59
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,465
   First, we take               
   the fresh corn,              

60
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,934
  and there we go.              

61
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,070
And this is what they say,      
      you know,                 

62
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:19,938
   the corn starts              
 crying or something            

63
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,739
 because it releases            
   all the water.               

64
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,341
This is called martajado.       

65
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,477
    It's broken,                
but it still has water.         

66
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,613
That's when it's ready to blend 
with the corn flour.            

67
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,984
   And then water.              
And then work with your hands.  

68
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,820
       Voilà.                   

69
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,888
 Okay, now, we're going to build
         the other three flavors

70
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,357
              of the tortillas. 

71
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,559
Yes, we're going to build       
 the black-bean one.            

72
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:43,762
   These have been              
previously refried with lard.   

73
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,331
                Where is this   
               traditional at?  
From Michoacan.                 

74
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,900
They make it for holidays,      
for different kinds of parties. 

75
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,769
              It's a specialty. 
It's a specialty.               

76
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:51,970
              I mean, I thought 
             I'd seen everything

77
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,171
      in the world of tortillas,

78
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,374
                 but that is    
           a whole nother world.

79
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:57,642
               Now the poblano  
             with the cilantro? 

80
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:58,710
       Mm-hmm.                  

81
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,245
 So, it's previously            
  blended together.             

82
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,514
                So, it's got    
            enough of the water.
Mm-hmm.                         

83
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,781
               So, now we have  
               the verde done.  

84
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,116
           And now the guajillo?

85
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,718
    The guajillo.               
This one, we have to strain.    

86
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,054
  In the world of dried chilies,
            this is my favorite.

87
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,055
                 And this is    
              a lot of the time 

88
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:11,189
                what you find   
             in enchilada sauce.

89
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,325
   No other pepper              
gives you this color.           

90
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:14,659
              Oh, this is going 
               to be awesome.   

91
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,861
           Now, what's the idea?
             Put them together? 

92
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,463
                Go to the press?
   Correct.                     

93
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,932
 We're going to take            
  our little balls.             

94
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,602
   Put them right               
   in the middle.               
                       Got it.  

95
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:25,904
Ever-so-useful plastic.

98
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,811
              That's gorgeous.  
            So, onto the plancha

99
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,746
             that's already got 
        its own seasoning to it.

100
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,348
      Mm-hmm.                   
        It doesn't need any oil.

101
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,883
                Look at that!   
              That is awesome.  

102
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,219
         Let's keep making them.

103
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,958
          What...in the world...
                  is this?      

104
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,892
 It's a liquid salt             
    from Yucatan.               

105
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,160
             In a squirt bottle.

106
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,429
It's called "rain salt"         
     in Mexico.                 

107
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,430
              Rain salt. Okay.  
     And what do you do with it?

108
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,166
Squirt on your tortilla         
     and try it.                

109
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,635

          Because this is weird.

111
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,441
                  So, just      
             spray this on here?
    Yeah.                       

112

  And then try it.              

113
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:08,247
   Try each flavor              
     by itself.                 

114
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:10,114
              This is awesome.  

115
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,849
                Look at that.   

116
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:15,586
              I'm telling you.  
               It's fantastic.  
   Mm-hmm.                      

117
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,856
                  Where --      
                Is this real?   

118
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,258
            That is the craziest
              stuff I've seen.  

119
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,263
       I want it in a foot pump.

120
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,998
You've got such a funky attitude
          and such a funky style

121
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,333
      with so much authenticity.

122
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,535
                Outstanding.    

123
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,004
  Here you have some tortillas. 

124
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:34,639
              The best tortilla 
               I've ever had.   

125
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,274
   WOMAN #1: Ever time I tried  
        a different bite,       

126
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,476
   it was a different flavor.   

127
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,945
  This is probably my favorite  
    neighborhood restaurant,    

128
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,480
         and I eat here         
       three times a week.      

129
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:44,215
       The tacos crujiente      
     is one of my favorites.    

130
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,718
   It's crunchy tacos stuffed   
     with hibiscus flowers.     

131
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,086
    WOMAN #2: You would think   
   it would probably be sweet,  

132
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,355
      but it's a wholesome,     
         creamy filling.        

133
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,023
We have our house salsa,        

134
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,893
and then we add a little bit    
  of Mexican cream.             

135
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:58,496
 The hibiscus flower            
and cream-cheese tacos.         

136
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,565
                   Ah-ha!       

137
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,334
   The hibiscus has a little bit
            of bitterness to it,

138
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,904
     but then the crema balances
 it out with a little sweetness.

139
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,839
      Correct.                  

140
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,307
             And then the salsa.

141
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,779
 It's burned peppers            
and burned tomatoes.            

142
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,448
              Wow. I mean, just 
            flat-out outrageous.

143
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,783
                  Hi, guys,     
         how're you doing today?

144
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,317
       I love this place.       

145
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,854
  I think I actually have eaten 
everything on the menu 20 times.

146
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,589
I have one more taco            
 I want you to try.             

147
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,125
                     Bring it.  
       Tacos chelo for 31.      

148
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,127
       Flavorful, crunchy.      

149
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,929
                Very unique.    
                Very unique.    

150
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:33,398
   FIERI: And I'm digging into  
   this dish after the break.   

151
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,500
              Top 10 best tacos 
               I've ever had.   

152
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,005
  FIERI: At Cuchara restaurant, 

153
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,941
          just outside          
      of downtown Houston,      

154
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:47,279
  owner Ana Beaven has steered  
clear of maracas and margaritas.

155
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,414
          You wouldn't call this
your typical Tex-Mex restaurant.

156
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,283
   No. Not at all.              
This is authentic Mexican.      

157
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,020
         From the decor,        
  the artwork that Ana's sister 

158
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,621
          has designed          
       for the restaurant.      

159
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:59,291
 All the little dishes that they
 brought over from Mexico City. 

160
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,893
   FIERI: Which is also where   
     this recipe comes from.    

161
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,228
          Tacos chelo.          

162
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,496
                   FIERI:       
      Okay, what is tacos chelo?

163
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,231
Well, I'm going to tell you     
 who Chelo is first.            

164
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,698
      Chelo is                  
  a super-mean lady             

165
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,167
    that has been               
 selling fried tacos            

166
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,770
on the streets in Mexico City   
 for like 40 years.             

167
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:16,040
           The best taco stands,
    a lot of times you go there,

168
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,308
         they don't talk to you.

169
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,110
      Exactly.                  
       They just make the tacos.

170
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,079
              But it's worth it 
 because the tacos are the best.

171
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,981
      Is that the kind of place?
That is the kind of place.      

172
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,784
 So, we have potato.            
It's already boiled.            

173
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:26,985
 We're going to add             
a little bit of butter.         

174
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,653
Some chopped epazote.           

175
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,722
         So, how do you describe
          the flavor of epazote?

176
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,523
Like an intense perfume.        

177
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,726
              It's got a tang,  
 a little bit of sourness to it.

178
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,528
  It's just magic.              

179
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,995
And then we have...             
                Raw onion....   

180
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,064
   ...onion. Yeah.              

181
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,665
A little bit of salt            
    with pepper.                

182
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,400
   So, we're going              
to take the tortilla,           

183
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,203
  put a little bit              
of the mix of the potato.       

184
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:48,173
 We're going to roll            
 them like flautas.             

185
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:51,543
               And that's it?   
              We fry those up?  

186
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,144
     Mm-hmm.                    
                    Okay.       

187
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,679
                Does the mean   
               Chelo lady know  

188
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,013
             that you have tacos
              named after her?  

189
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,549
 She actually smiled            
    a little bit                

190
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,351
   when I told her              
how popular they are.           

191
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:00,819
                     No!        

192
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,086
               Okay, next up?   

193
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,154
 We're going to make            
  the green salsa.              

194
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,422
               So, tomatillos.  

195
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,824
            These have just been
                cooked down?    

196
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,692
  These are boiled.             
                   Boiled, okay.

197
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:10,295
      Cilantro,                 
  boiled serranos,              

198
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,563
garlic, salt and pepper,        

199
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,633
    a little bit                
    of raw onion.               
                      Get it.   

200
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,236
                 And that's     
               all she wrote?   

201
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,304
      And then                  
 we have to cook it.            

202
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,573
         Oh, we're going to cook
                 this still?    

203
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,442
   Yep. Especially              
because of the raw garlic.      

204
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,510
                   Tasty.       

205
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,512
     So, we have                
  the tacos ready,              

206
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,981
 then lots of salsa.            

207
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,782
         Just because it's going
             to soak it all up. 

208
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:35,987
We add cotija cheese,           
and then we add raw onion.      

209
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,155
     All yours.                 

210
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,461
             That's phenomenal. 

211
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:46,130
    I've had so many great tacos
         so many different ways,

212
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,399
           and what you've made,
                 flavor-wise    

213
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,002
            and creativity-wise,
                 stacks up.     

214
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,005
              Top 10 best tacos 
               I've ever had.   

215
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,073
                    Wow.        
           That's all I can say.

216
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,142
            Anybody that watches
                 "Triple D"     

217
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:02,013
         knows I don't typically
           eat the entire plate.

218
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,149
          That takes the cake...
                or the taco.    

219
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,217
             It takes the taco. 

220
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,552
         The crunchiness        
         of the tortilla        

221
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:10,288
    with the creamy potatoes    
    in it is just fantastic.    

222
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,090
 So, my buddy, Mark,            
and his daughter, Kensley,      

223
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,758
from the great state            
      of Texas,                 

224
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,893
have you had anything           
  like that before?             

225
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,694
              It's very unique. 
                Very unique.    

226
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,230
     Good heat,                 
   though, right?               

227
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,832
        Mm-hmm. The right amount
          of heat. Unbelievable.

228
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,166
             WOMAN:             
    Just something different    

229
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,035
   from what you typically get  
           in Houston.          

230
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,838
             One of my childhood
          heroes, Dan Pastorini,

231
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,240
          played for the Oilers,
         played for the Raiders.

232
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,042
             This is like we are
            south of the border.

233
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,444
 Yes, it's special.             

234
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,246
It's a unique taste,            
you know, wonderful food,       

235
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:35,780
  great atmosphere.             

236
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:39,651
  It's like you're walking into 
your own private city of Mexico.

237
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,519
            I've been doing this
              for a long time,  

238
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,321
                   been to      
           a lot of restaurants.

239
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,123
           I don't get surprised
                 very often.    

240
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,325
                   Today,       
            I've been surprised.

241
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:48,726
             I think the beauty 
         of what this restaurant

242
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,462
          does is it reminds me,

243
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:53,198
          as a chef and as a fan
     of ethnic food and culture,

244
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,067
            that there's so much
         more than what we know.

245
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,069
       I just tried three things
         I'd never tried before,

246
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:01,072
    and I will tell you this has
  been an outrageous experience.

247
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,340
     Good.                      
              You are fantastic.

248
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:06,077
     Thank you.                 

249
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,679
             FIERI:             
     Coming up in Orlando...    

250
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,214
   I like the way               
this is rolling, boss.          

251
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,681
 ...a tricked-out food truck... 

252
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,683
You are really a scientist      
about what you're making.       

253
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,686
           ...gaining           
      some serious mileage      

254
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,087
           with their           
       Jewish deli dishes.      

255
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,322
Dude, that's no joke            
    right there.                

256
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:24,563
                     ♪♪         

257
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,431
  I'm here in Orlando, Florida. 

258
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,232
       I love this state.       
       Got great weather.       

259
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,234
        You've got a real       
     eclectic mix of people,    

260
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,837
    and with a mix of people    
 like that, you get great food. 

261
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,439
 So, when I hear there's a dude,

262
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,641
         and he is doing        
     New-York-style pastrami    

263
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:37,709
    out of an old tool truck,   

264
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,043
     well, you know I've got    
        to track it down.       

265
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,980
  This is The Pastrami Project. 

266
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:45,850
                   Good morning!
 I'd like a pastrami            
  sandwich, please.             

267
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:48,587
       This is a whole new      
   pastrami experience for me.  

268
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,255
                Reuben taco!    

269
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,657
   I ate one and brought home   
           three more.          

270
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:53,658
              Lox and a bagel.  

271
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,126
       George has brought       
      New York to Orlando.      

272
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,595
        FIERI: Literally,       
  because owner George Markward 

273
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,863
      and his wife, Debra,      

274
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,933
    make it a point to study    
  classic New York Jewish delis 

275
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,068
        and the tradition       
         behind them...         

276
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,071
            I went and looked up
                old recipes,    

277
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,805
         old ways and techniques
                of doing it.    

278
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,140
       Everything I'm doing here
                 is the way     

279
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,675
                 they did it    
               100 years ago.   

280
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:13,344
     All of George's dishes     
         are authentic,         

281
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,546
    remind me of growing up.    

282
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,881
 FIERI: ...with pastrami taking 
          center stage.         

283
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,551
  You bite into it,             
and it just melts in your mouth.

284
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,686
       Mm-hmm.                  
Something different about it.   

285
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,154
Okay. Let's do it.              
     We're going to make a brine

286
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,623
        for an approachable-size
             piece of pastrami. 

287
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,891
Approachable?                   
                    Yeah.       

288
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,827
         Not the 80 pounds I put
         in the brine at a time.

289
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,095
80 pounds in at a time?         
                     Oh, yeah.  

290
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,298
             We've got to start 
       with pink salt, allspice.

291
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,966
     Coriander.                 
                   Whole cloves,

292
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,836
         whole black peppercorn,
           nutmeg, mustard seed.

293
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:40,038
             We have bay leaves,
              red-pepper flake, 

294
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,972
              ginger, cinnamon, 

295
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,641
          a little bit of sugar,

296
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,044
                kosher salt,    
               garlic cloves.   

297
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,312
   Are we going to              
  let this simmer?              

298
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,513
                  We let it     
              simmer and melt.  

299
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,648
Okay, then we're going to ice it
or going to cool it?            

300
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,783
          We're going to ice it.

301
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,051
 Ice it so we don't             
   poach our meat.              

302
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,719
                  Exactly.      
      Got it.                   

303
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,254
    How long will               
the flat sit in here?           

304
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,722
                   A week.      
    Really?!                    

305
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:58,856
                   Mm-hmm.      

306
00:10:58,858 --> 00:10:59,924
                  Let's see     
               what we've got.  

307
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,859
     All right.                 
 Beautiful brisket.             

308
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,728
Then it gets a dry rub          
of black pepper and...?         

309
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,996
                     Coriander. 
Coriander. Got it.              

310
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,398
         I like a lot of flavor.

311
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,333
            We really rub it in.

312
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,801
Both sides or just one?         
                   All sides.   

313
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,404
    There we go.                
What are we smoking with?       

314
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:14,739
          Hickory, which is what
            they would have used

315
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,008
         up north 100 years ago.

316
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:17,942
  What temp are we              
  going to run at?              

317
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,878
                 About 225,     
              about 5, 6 hours. 

318
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,613
                This is hot.    

319
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,082
What are we serving on?         
                  Rye bread     
             with spicy mustard.

320
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,352
    Oh! I'm such                
 a pastrami junkie.             

321
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,287
  My mouth just --              

322
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:33,424
    You can hear                
the sirens going off.           

323
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,293
  Even Croc Dundee              
   would tell you               

324
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,560
 [Australian accent]            
   that's a knife.              

325
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,829
             That's what you use
           for cutting pastrami.

326
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,165
   See how there's              
a little bit of juice.          

327
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,635
That's a normal portion?        
                    Yeah.       

328
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:46,570
             That's pretty much 
              a normal portion. 

329
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,174
  Oh, my gosh!                  
                  Give it a try.

330
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:52,176
  See all the juice             
just come running out of that?  

331
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:55,046
 That's ridiculous.             

332
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,448
        Mmm!                    
    Very tender.                

333
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,850
You're not confusing it         
with a lot of other stuff.      

334
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,586
I was scared to death you were  
going to put that slaw on there.

335
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,588
  The key to it is,             
right inside of here,           

336
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,856
 all the fat's been             
 rendered down now,             

337
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,191
so it's just to the point       
 of being liquified             

338
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,260
to where the fat mixes          
   with the meat,               

339
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:13,497
and every bite you get is       
just creamy delicious.          

340
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,999
     Oh, my God.                
    It's so good.               

341
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,535
    I mean, like                
that level pastrami.            

342
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:21,005
   Excellent job.               
   Excellent job.               
                      Thank you.

343
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:25,343
It is tender, it has got a nice,
peppery taste to it.            

344
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,412
    MAN: The bread, the meat,   
        just the mustard        

345
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,080
     reminds me of back home    
          in New York.          

346
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,014
                 Come on up!    

347
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,415
            George is           
       an interesting guy.      

348
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,484
                 Absolutely.    

349
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:34,685
    He's very knowledgeable,    
         very creative.         

350
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,488
        FIERI: Especially       
   when it comes to his truck.  

351
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,956
  Did the Partridge             
  family have this?             

352
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,092
       No, this was a tool truck
             in its first life. 

353
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,293
             I built this thing 
                  by hand.      

354
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,494
   What did you do              
    before that?                

355
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,562
              I was an IT guy.  

356
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,431
  There's a variety             
of electronic components.       

357
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,032
              Well, I'm a geek. 
    You tinker?                 

358
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:49,701
                  Oh, big time. 
     Which means, of course,    

359
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:51,836
   you've got to tweak around   
       with the menu, too.      

360
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,504
         We take the ingredients
                 of a Reuben    

361
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,773
         and turn it into a taco
               or a egg roll.   

362
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,775
         But at the base        
       are the standards.       

363
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,844
           We have beef brisket,
                   latkes.      

364
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,379
       MAN: If I find him       
       for breakfast time,      

365
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,913
           I always go          
     for the bagel with lox.    

366
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,248
     The lox are very tasty.    

367
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,452
      It tastes like it was     
    swimming a few days ago.    

368
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,452
  All right, boss.              

369
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,387
               We're going to   
               make some lox.   

370
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,588
       Got it.                  
   Salt and sugar.              

371
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,823
               Equal amounts.   

372
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,457
             There's kosher salt
              and table sugar.  

373
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,526
       Please don't use anything
              but kosher salt.  

374
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,128
                 Table salt,    
             it will turn gray. 

375
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,395
What's going to happen          

376
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,731
  is this is going              
 to season the fish,            

377
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:21,399
but it's also going to          
pull the water out of this.     

378
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,267
                 Some lemon.    

379
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,870
            And then if you want
          the flavor of juniper,

380
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:29,007
               the easiest way  
              to do it is gin.  

381
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,342
  So, you drink it              
and then just pour it on?       

382
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,278
                     No.        
    Oh, okay.                   

383
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,545
How long is it going to go?     
     Seven days?                

384
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:35,680
                  36 hours.     
   That's it?                   

385
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,415
                 That's it.     
Okay, let's do it.              

386
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,549
          Salmon has come out...

387
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,451
    Rinse it off.               
   Nice and firm.               

388
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,554
       We've just got to get you
      a nice portion of it here.

389
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:45,089
I like this. You pulled all     
the pin bones, right?           
                        Yeah.   

390
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,290
     What are we                
  serving it with?              

391
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,592
                   A bagel      
             with cream cheese. 

392
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:52,497
             You do want capers 
                 and onions?    

393
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,432
   I like the way               
this is rolling, boss.          

394
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,039
Dude, that's no joke            
    right there.                

395
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,441
    It's no joke.               

396
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:04,709
Here's the beauty of it.        

397
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:06,778
There's not too much salt,      
 not too much sugar.            

398
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,713
You didn't overdo it            
with all the flavorings.        

399
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:09,981
                  Mnh-mnh.      

400
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,849
   You really get               
to taste the salmon.            

401
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,284
   I've had really              
good lox in my life.            

402
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,119
    To think that               
 you're making this             

403
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:19,590
    in three days               
here in the truck --            

404
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,993
  They're dynamite.             

405
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,861
       Absolutely supreme.      
        It was fantastic.       

406
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,663
       It tastes genuine.       

407
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:27,665
        It's like having        
      New York in a truck.      

408
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,400
   Great food, great company.   

409
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,268
 You take everything            
very lightheartedly,            

410
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,537
but you are really a scientist  
about what you're making.       

411
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,339
 I call the project

00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,536
    and went from dishwasher    
     to owning food trucks,     

440
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:41,672
  to opening up this brick and  
 mortar with his wife, Jesenia. 

441
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,541
        You guys, enjoy.        

442
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:44,742
         What kind of restaurant
          was this before you --

443
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,210
    It used to be               
     a pizzeria.                

444
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:48,145
             It was a pizzeria, 
       and now it's a pincharia.

445
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,348
It's a pincharia.               
                And what does   
                pinchos mean?   

446
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,350
Pincho means a skewer,          
  meaning a stick.              

447
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:53,551
                 On a stick?    
  Yes, sir.                     

448
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:54,819
Pinchos are ready to go.        

449
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,954
   FIERI: But they're not just  
      putting out pinchos.      

450
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,489
   They're firing up all kinds  

451
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,491
         of traditional         
       Puerto Rican fare.       

452
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,626
        Pick up of carne        
     frita mofongo, please.     

453
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,495
        Today, I'm having       
    the pork and the mofongo.   

454
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:05,896
       The pork is tender       
         on the inside,         

455
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,365
 yet it's crispy on the outside.

456
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:11,035
   Mofongo is mashed plantains  
   mixed with garlic and oil.   

457
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,236
   It's perfect all the time.   

458
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,370
                  What are      
              we going to make? 

459
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,839
We're making the mofongo        
 with the pork fry.             

460
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,440
               Mofongo first?   
 Yes, sir.                      

461
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,710
                 So, you get    
              the plantains in. 
We put in hot water.            

462
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:19,977
                 Makes them     
               easier to peel?  
    Yes.                        

463
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,579
            Nobody told me that!

464
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,113
That's why you're learning      
     here today.                

465
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,515
                Look at this!   
Look, that's it!                

466
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,117
So, we cut it in chunks,        

467
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,319
and then we fry them            
for like 7 or 8 minutes.        

468
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,587
              All right, Chef.  

469
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:30,721
 Now we're going to             
make the house mojito.          

470
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:31,923
 We take the garlic.            

471
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:33,257
          And we're going to use
        this to season the pork?

472
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,392
      Exactly.                  

473
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,260
Couple spoons of salt,          
 pepper, and garlic.            

474
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,396
                     It's adobo.
     It's adobo.                
I call it adobo, too.           

475
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:41,065
 So, we mash it down            
 like that together             

476
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,067
    and 5 ounces                
  of vegetable oil.             

477
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,536
              This is pork butt 
              that's boneless.  

478
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:46,737
  And then we do it             
     overnight.                 

479
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,473
            And then we're going
               to fry it off?   
  Yeah.                         

480
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:49,740
         All right, let's put it
               together, man.   

481
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,942
All right, each mofongo --      
two head of the garlic,         

482
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,011
a couple of teaspoons           
    of the adobo.               

483
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,814
      And then                  
  we mash it first.             

484
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:59,017
   Then we go with              
  the mojito again,             

485
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,352
   and then we get              
   the plantains.               

486
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,821
         I can already smell it.
Then we get the pork out.       

487
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,090
            Just give the onions
               a little kiss.   

488
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,826
Take it like this, and          
you go for it like ice cream.   

489
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,628
                Look at that.   

490
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,163
  It's not too wet.             
  It's not too dry.             

491
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:13,865
                      Got it.   
Put it right here.              

492
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,700
Then we get the pork,           

493
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,869
we drizzle a bit of it          
  with the mojito.              

494
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:21,239
 Tastes really good             
  with the onions.              

495
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,174
                       Mmm!     
   And then we got              
 two piece of bread.            

496
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:24,775
  And then you get              
your cilantro sauce,            

497
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,611
     and you get                
your mayoketchu sauce.          

498
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,115
      Mofongo.                  

499
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:33,918
                 Ah, that's     
            good mofongo, buddy.

500
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,586
             I've never seen it 
        with the cilantro sauce.

501
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,254
       So, just different people
            have different ways?

502
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,523
   Yeah, we don't               
play with the rules.            

503
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,792
                 Delicious.     
       Mofongo has to be pureed,

504
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,594
             but you still have 
             to have big pieces.

505
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,763
       So, you get soft, smooth,
             and then something 

506
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,833
           that's almost crunchy
          like a pretzel nugget.

507
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:52,136
      I really like a good piece
             of fried carnitas. 
    Yeah.                       

508
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,405
                  That has      
         a lot of texture in it.

509
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,940
             Nice job, brother. 
Thank you.                      

510
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,808
       The mofongo has got      
      a great consistency.      

511
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,544
 The pork is very, very crispy. 

512
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:02,680
    I literally feel like I'm   
 in Puerto Rico eating at home. 

513
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:03,814
                Here you go,    
                  tripleta.     

514
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,083
             And how do you get 
              into this place?  

515
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,817
  Because it looks like there's,
         what, maybe six tables.

516
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:07,885
           Just wait.           

517
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,753
        But stick around.       
     It's worth hanging out     

518
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,088
            for a few           
  to get some really good food. 

519
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,823
         What do you think makes
           the food so dynamite?

520
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,493
He just has a great product,    
  and he delivers.              

521
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,228
   Pastrami jibarito pick-up.   

522
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,363
       The jibarito, yes.       
           Wonderful.           

523
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,298
      It's like a sandwich,     
      but instead of bread,     

524
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,968
       you have plantains.      
 You have meat, lettuce, tomato.

525
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,769
       It's something that      
      I can't stop eating.      

526
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,105
              All right. Next,  
     we're going to make the...?

527
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,773
      Jibarito.                 
                   The jibarito?

528
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,508
        Yeah.                   
    Say it again.               

529
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,842
                   Jibarito.    
  Jibarito.                     

530
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,243
                  Jibarito.     
   Yeah.                        

531
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,778
  Basically, we're going to make
         bread out of plantains?

532
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,780
      Yes, sir.                 
These are going to take         

533
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,315
about 14 minutes to cook.       
                  14 minutes.   

534
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,516
   Yeah. So, we're              
 going to grab them.            

535
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,984
     So, we take Willie Pincho's
              ping-pong paddle. 

536
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,187
That's the best way to cut it.  
And then what we do,            

537
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:45,589
  we mash it down,              
and then we make that twist.    

538
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,391
               Why the twist?   

539
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,127
 You make it bigger.            
                        Okay.   

540
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,594
 So, now we put them            
 back in the fryer.             

541
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,396
         And this is going to be
   basically the bread for this?

542
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:53,864
     The bread,                 
      yes, sir.                 

543
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,998
                  Okay, so,     
               what do we got?  

544
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,269
So, we got some top round steak 
   kind of chuck.               

545
00:18:58,271 --> 00:18:59,537
  So, we would put              
  seasoning on it.              

546
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,205
           You just went through
          a tenderizing machine.

547
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,940
        Yeah.                   
So, we basically use            

548
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,542
   the mojito for               
 almost everything.             

549
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:05,876
Hey, give me some mojito.       
 Give me the mojito.            

550
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,144
         Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
There you go.                   

551
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,546
            Okay, how long do we
             let that marinate? 

552
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,080
    For 24 hours.               
                        Okay.   

553
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,749
Now, we're going to cook        
the marinated steak.            

554
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,151
     Beautiful.                 

555
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,952
 We put the pastrami            
  on the flat-top,              

556
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:18,222
and then we put some            
 more mojito on it,             

557
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:19,824
mustard, and then a little bit  
of cheese on the top.           

558
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,225
     We melt it.                

559
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,160
  Now, we're going              
to sample the jibarito.         

560
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,496
We've got the two plantains     
right there like a bun.         

561
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,232
  We go mayo first,             
put lettuce right here,         

562
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:29,633
  piece of tomatoes             
    right there.                

563
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:30,968
     Then we put                
  the mayoketchup,              

564
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,703
 and then we take it            
 from the flat-top,             

565
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,638
   and we make it               
    right there.                

566
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,442
             Who could eat this?
Oh, you will. [ Laughs ]        

567
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,646
We get the potato sticks,       
 the cilantro sauce.            

568
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,180
     Bada boom.                 
You could cut it in half,       

569
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,584
or I guess you could do that    
thing that you do, the hunch.   

570
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:47,852
                 The hunch?     

571
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,457
            It's very delicious.
         Pastrami is a nice kick

572
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:54,392
               because you're   
              not expecting it. 

573
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:55,993
              You're going for  
            these Latin flavors,

574
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,661
      and then, all of a sudden,
     you get this pastrami kick.

575
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,797
  Mm-hmm.                       
             The meat in itself,

576
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,666
                 top round,     
        has got a ton of flavor.

577
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:05,603
           The plantain, working
    as a bread, is really tasty.

578
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:10,474
   All of the sauces that you   
       make are delicious.      

579
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,608
                 You've got     
              more flavor here  

580
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,143
        than I think most people
              would anticipate. 

581
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,478
                 Fantastic.     
                  Good job.     

582
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,946
     Thank you.                 
 Pastrami jibarito.             

583
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,681
   The plantain that they use   
        is really crispy.       

584
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:18,815
     It's better than a bun.    

585
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,251
            WOMAN #1:           
 My favorite thing, I would say,

586
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,552
 would be the steak, especially 
   with the mayoketchup sauce,  

587
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,554
          which I love.         

588
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,755
            WOMAN #2:           
  Willie's is one of the good,  

589
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:27,158
  authentic Puerto Rican places 
        here in Orlando.        

590
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,493
              I think you cook  
           like you like to eat.

591
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:30,827
      Exactly.                  
That's why I make it.           

592
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,296
         Trust me. This might be

593
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:33,998
         my Puerto Rican brother
            from another mother.

594
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,966
     [ Laughs ]

600
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,513
       Is your real name Willie?
Yes, sir, William.              

601
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,916
                Doesn't sound   
        very Puerto Rican to me.
No, I know.                     

602
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,150
               You are really   
              from Puerto Rico? 

603
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:54,852
I am from Puerto Rico.          
    Straight up.                

604
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:57,387
Island flavor.                  
               Okay. [ Laughs ] 

605
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,790
                  Island flavor.
Island flavor, baby.
