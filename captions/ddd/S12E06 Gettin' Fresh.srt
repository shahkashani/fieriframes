   THOSE VEGGIES A LITTLE BIT.  

299
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,801
 AS IT'S COOLING, WE'LL ADD

MEAT LOAF AND MASHED MEDLEY.    

473
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,388
         WHEN THE MEAT          
      IS FRESH AND LOCAL,       

474
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,924
      YOU REALLY DO TASTE       
        THE DIFFERENCE.         
         WE'LL MAKE A MEAT LOAF.

475
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,794
                  WE START      
            WITH GRASS-FED BEEF.

476
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,662
            THE FARMER IS ABOUT 
            100 MILES FROM HERE.
CAN'T BEAT THE FARM-TO-TABLE    
       ON THAT, BABY.

                 SALT, PEPPER,  
              ITALIAN SEASONING.
EVERYBODY IN THE POOL.

               SPAGHETTI SAUCE  

486
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,486

       ADD THOSE TO BIND THAT UP

488
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,690
                   AND BREAD.   
                MIX ALL THAT UP.
