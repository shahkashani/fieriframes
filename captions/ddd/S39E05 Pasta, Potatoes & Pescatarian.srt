109
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,665

   Get the tortillas rolling?   

111
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,602
      [Clayton] We get them     
      delivered twice daily     

112

114
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:27,806
        So I get to split       
     one of the two tacos--     

115
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,874
  No, it looks like he's making 
     you your own taco now.     

116
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,677
  When Hunter co-hosts with me  
     he just gets a nibble.     

117
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,680
         Did I hear that        
   he's getting his own taco?

   a little bit of guac there.

        This whole thing

122

  [Clayton] That's it, brother. 
    Pickled pineapple salsa.    

123
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:44,422
      [Guy] Pickled onions.     

124
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:47,492
     Cholo sauce, scallions,    
      cilantro and radish.      

125
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
     [Guy] Way over the top.    

126
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,962
 Hit it with the lime for sure. 

127
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,631
         Lime is on time        
     now I'm gonna get mine.

   Lot of flavors popping out.  
          -Yeah, right?         

130
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,371
       The more you chew,       
  you get the warmth in there.  

131
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,772
             -Yeah.             
   -You get the cold in there.  

132
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,774
         And you taste a        
    little bit of everything    

133
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:03,775
           as you go.           

134
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,710
      Yo, just keep talking     
    I never get to just eat.    

135
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,379
            I always            
     have to talk about it.

     and the tempura batter,    

138
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:11,716
          is excellent.         

139
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,652
         We've got soft,        
    and tender, and crunchy.    

140
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,720
      And then you get that     
         creamy, subtle         

141
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,723
     delicious vegetable fat    
        from the avocado.       

142
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,458
     It's more than a taco.     
         It's dynamite.         

143
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:21,727
            [Clayton]           
  Fish tacos going down, guys.  

144
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:25,463
     This is one of the best    
    fish tacos I've ever had.   

145
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,532
    What I like best about it   
        is the pineapple,       

146
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,668
     cause that really pops.

           How do you           
  describe the food to people?  

149
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,207
        It's not Mexican,       
         it's not Cuban,        
         it's Ecuadorian.       

150
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,809
    South Florida on a plate.   

151
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,412
        All right, guys,        
       I got one order of       
     Rock Shrimp Ceviche up

          ready to go.          

153
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,748
 We get the Rock Shrimp Ceviche 
       every single time.       

154
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:48,620
       It's super citrusy       
         and super tangy        
         and delicious.         

155
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,620
     What's on the menu now?    

156
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,688
    It's ceviche de camaron.    

157
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,424
      We're gonna actually      
       poach this shrimp.       

158
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,492
   Bring some water to a boil,  
        dump the salt in.       

159
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,561
        A few peppercorns       
         and lime juice.        

160
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,696
     Fresh gulf rock shrimp     
    and turn that thing off.    

161
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:00,766
           Let it cook          
      for about 45 seconds      

162
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,701
     to a minute and a half.    
     Put it in the ice bath.    

163
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,636
     This little quick poach    
       that he did to it,       

164
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,906
         they don't lose        
     that real fresh flavor     

165
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,573
          and texture.          

166
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,908
           -Next step.          
        -Pickled pepper.        

167
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,510
   It's a cool touch in there   
       when you get a grip      
         of that pepper.        

168
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,579
      You gotta get a grip      
       so you don't slip.       

169
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,315
           -Ah, yeah.           
             -Yeah.             

170
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,716
  Yellow and red bell peppers,  

171
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,518
 little jalapeno for some heat. 

172
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,720
         And the brine,         
          same vinegar          
       that we had before.      

173
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:22,587
   We're gonna put that aside.  

174
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,456
      We want as much time      
       as we can on this.       

175
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,391
        -Put it together.       
    -We got our fresh shrimp,   

176
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:27,592

177
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:28,460
        shaved red onion,       

178
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,262
     cilantro and scallions,    

179
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:31,263
       a dash of ketchup,       

180
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,664
  oranges, some lime in there,  

181
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,265
     healthy amount of salt.    

182
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,533
    This is an ice cold bowl.   

183
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,268
  It's getting really icy here.

 This shrimp is not overcooked. 

192
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,547
           The crunch           
    of the red onion, money.    

193
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,815
 The pickle of the bell pepper, 

194
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,751
          the cilantro,         
   the green onion, boom boom!  

195
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,219
   And then the fresh citrus.   

196
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,620
 This is one of the most tender 

197
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,222
     well balanced ceviches     
         I've ever had.         

198
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,823
      Every week, we've had     
      ceviche in the house.     

199
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,359
      Hate to say it, Pops,     
      but this tops it all.

         shrimp ceviche.        

203
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,433
          It's amazing.

             -Yeah.

00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:03,288
    [man] House spinach pesto   
          for the win.          

234
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,023
          For the win.          

235
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,465
           I'm here in          
       Moorhead, Minnesota      

236
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,667
  which is right on the border  
     of Fargo, North Dakota.    

237
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:17,735
  I'm here to check out a joint 

238
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,938
          where they've         
       got a great story.       

239
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,672
        You know, to get        
  into the restaurant business  

240
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,673
         <i> as an owner,</i>          
    <i> it take a lot of time,</i>     

241
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,609
        <i> a lot of money,</i>        
       <i> a lot of energy.</i>        

242
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,810
             And one            
   of the great ways to do it   

243
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,613
    is when one of the owners   
     sells to the employees.    

244
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,482
   That's right, the employees  
       were working there       

245
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,017
   and now they own the joint.  

246
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,352
         This is Rustica        
       Eatery and Tavern.       

247

    Buttermilk fried chicken    
           going down.          

248
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,226
  Rustica is a wonderful place. 

249
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,627
    Spanish style meatballs.    

250
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,296
 They take really simple things 

251
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,565
 <i> and add certain flavors to it</i> 

252
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,433
     <i> that make it unique.</i>      

253
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:49,701
       [Guy]<i> They call it</i>       
         <i> American food</i>

    <i> to owners of the joint.</i>    

258
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,112
        So the restaurant       
       was up and running,      
       owners wanted out,       

259
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,448
         and they said,         
     "Boom, here's turnkey.     
         Pay us for it."        

260
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:04,916
             -Yeah.             
         -I had to open         
     quite a few restaurants    

261
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,651
    before they ever started    
       looking this nice.       

262
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,787
           You got the          
     bar concept on one side    

263
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,455
         and the dining         
    establishment over here.    

264
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,657
     You can find something     
   that'll hit your taste buds  

265
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,258
         no matter what.        

266
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,793
        Pasta chorizo up.       

267
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,628
           Their pasta          
        feels like home.        

268
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,265
             So what            
   are we making first, chef?   
       Are we doing pasta?      

269
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,466
   For the pasta chorizo dish,  

270
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:26,004
           oil, water,          
  egg yolk, flour, kosher salt. 

271
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,741
 Let this mix up 10-15 minutes, 
      let it rest an hour.      

272
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:32,277
            Knead it,           
   put it through the sheeter   

273
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,278
     then we cut it by hand.    

274
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,679
          -Sharp hand.          
             -Yeah.             

275
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:37,281
             So now             
 we have to mix up the chorizo. 

276
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,416
       80-20 ground pork.       

277
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:42,487
    Paprika, smoked paprika,    
  dry oregano, cinnamon, cumin, 

278
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:43,554
        salt and pepper.        

279
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:44,756
       And then over here       
          on out wet...         

280
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,426
     Sherry vinegar, water,     
      Worcestershire sauce      

281
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:49,894
     and some minced garlic.    

282
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,631
         Put the wet in,        
        and then the dry.       

283
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:57,702
  -[Guy] On to the sheet tray.  
  -375 for roughly 15 minutes.  

284
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,637
           -Next step?          
  -Make the house tomato sauce. 

285
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,707
          Oil, onions,          
     salt and pepper, basil.    

286
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,843
   Chef on your stress level,   
           one to ten,          
     where are we right now?    

287
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,512
      I'm always at an 11.      

288
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:08,980
        Just like a duck,       
           cool on top          

289
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,650
      but he just paddling      
          like a mother         
      underneath the water.     

290
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:12,783
    [Micah] Oregano, garlic.    

291
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,652
          [Guy] Deglaze         
     with a little red wine.    

292
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,654
      And then we'll add in     
    our diced canned tomato.    

293
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,658
   Chili flakes, white sugar,   
        balsamic vinegar,       

294
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,327
          tomato paste,         
     then we'll blend it up.    

295
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:22,860
         Let's build it.        

296
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,397
   Shallots, garlic, chorizo,   

297
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,731
     deglaze with red wine.     

298
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,400
       House tomato sauce,      
         chicken stock,         

299
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,269
   roasted garlic, some cream.  

300
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,537
      Fresh pasta going in.     

301
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:33,672
        Salt and pepper.        

302
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:34,805
              [Guy]             
  Where did you learn to cook?  

303
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,541
  I started at a nursing home.  

304
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,344
      I worked my way up to     
    full-fledged lunch lady.    

305
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,745
         Don't see that         
      on everyday resumes.      

306
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,681
             [Micah]            
 Mount it with a little butter. 

307
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,349
           Fresh moz,           
      house spinach pesto,      

308
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,552
        and toasted bread       
          for the win.          

309
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:48,553
          For the win.          

310
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:49,621
           [chuckling]          

311
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,423
           I like this          
       crown of the pesto.      

312
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,225
     I am a big chorizo fan.    

313
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,830
         This eats like         
  Mexican chorizo, being loose, 

314
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,833
       but it tastes like       
         Spanish chorizo        

315
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,569
     because of the paprika     
     and the smoked paprika.    

316
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,338
  The pasta is nice and tender. 

317
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:09,507
           Delicious.           

318
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:10,642
           -Oh, good.           
      -I mean really good.      

319
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,910
      Got a pasta chorizo.      

320
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:16,648
     That pasta, it's dense.    
   Yet it melts in your mouth.  

321
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,450
     The chorizo's distinct,    

322
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:21,519
 and you can feather that pesto 
        into every bite.        

323
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:22,520
    It's really quite lovely.   

324
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,789
           Two pizzas,          
          Haole, Decoy.         

325
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,857
              [Guy]             
  What else do you do for fun,  

326
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:26,925
             besides            
     work here all the time?    

327
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,327
         Before I really        
   got serious about cooking,   

328
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,662
           I was DJing          
          all the time.         

329
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,463
  Scratching on the turntables. 

330
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,465
     What was your DJ name?

333
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,670
       That's it. I quit.       

334
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,138
       I have to go home.

337

    I think everybody should

00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,063
     Came to me in a vision.    

346
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:12,470
   [Guy]<i> Triple D's parked in</i>   
      <i> Moorhead, Minnesota</i>      
          <i> at Rustica</i>           

347
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,739
      <i> in one of the towns</i>      
         <i> oldest spots.</i>         

348
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:18,142
          The building          
  was originally built in 1898. 

349
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,478
             -Okay.             
         -And it's been         
      a plethora of things.     

350
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:21,746
  [Guy]<i> But now, it's all about</i> 

351
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:24,281
          <i> fresh takes</i>          
      <i> on classic dishes.</i>       

352
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,550
       Poutine, going up.       

353
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:26,685
   Unlike traditional poutine,  

354
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,552
  <i> it has fingerling potatoes.</i>  

355
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:30,688
    The meat is like a roast.   

356
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:31,823
   Comfort food at its finest.  

357
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:36,293
        All right, chef.        
 Into one gigantic cut of beef. 

358
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,495
 [Micah] This is chuck shoulder 

359
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,564
   for our fingerling poutine.  

360
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:40,765
  -We're gonna braise all this? 
             -Yeah.             

361
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,767
            First we            
   gotta whack it into hunks.   

362
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,436
      [Guy] Wouldn't it be      
      a great arcade game?      

363
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:45,770
   Old Butcher Whack a Chunk.   

364
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,572
  Prime rib, boom! You're down. 

365
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,707
          Fillet, ding!         

366
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,841
  [Micah] Give it a good amount 
       of salt and pepper,      

367
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,577
             sear it            
    in a pan over high heat.    

368
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,379
              [Guy]             
    We'll hit all four sides?   

369
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,646
    Set up our braising pan.    

370
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,651
    Oregano, thyme, bay leaf,   
     add in the seared meat.    

371
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,854
       -You're sear-ious.       
         -I'm sear-ious.        

372
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:07,325
 Mirepoix, whole garlic cloves, 
       salt, tomato guts.       

373
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:10,862
  -Another fine culinary term.  
    -Red wine, chicken stock.   

374
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,463
         [Guy] And a lot        
      of red chili flakes.      

375
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,598
 We call it chili-braised beef. 

376
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,933
       [Guy] And how long       
  are we gonna roast that off?  

377
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,667
      -At least four hours.     
       -[Micah] At least.       

378
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,938
    -Shredding it up tender,    
   but not completely mushed.   
            -Correct.           

379
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:23,674
   Strain the jus, reduce it,   
          pour it over          
       the shredded meat.       

380
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,809
     [Guy] What are we doing    
           past this?           

381
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,745
  [Micah] We'll make some beef  
   gravy to serve on the side.  

382
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,147
    -Gravy goes on the side?    
           -Oh, yeah.           

383
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,682
     -Give you the pleasure     
   of pouring it over the top.  
    -Give me the... [laughs]    

384
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,484
     You, too, are a winner.    

385
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:36,755
       We got blended oil,      
     onions, oregano, thyme,    

386
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:39,958
 tomato paste, salt and pepper, 
      red wine to de-glaze.     

387
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,626
           Naturally.           
     Nice facial from that.     

388
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:45,563
     [Micah] Chicken stock,     
  beef base, balsamic vinegar,  
          chili flakes.         

389
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:46,965
   Tamari, but have it today.   

390
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:50,568
   Simmer, stain, add the roux  
       and it's finished.       

391
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,636
   -Last but not least, what?   
      -Fingerling potatoes.     

392
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:53,838
          -[Guy] Okay.          
    -Get them fried, crispy.    

393
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:56,174
    And why not just regular    
   french fries to make this?   

394
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:59,443
         Why be normal?         
      We put the chili beef     
          over the top          

395
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,512
      -with my own cheese.      
            -Hoo-da?            

396
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:05,383
    It's a cow's milk cheese    
    covered in paprika rind.    

397
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,385
  Move that to the salamander,  

398
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,120
         transfer it to         
        a serving plate.        

399
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:13,324
     Little parsley, bacon,     
         roasted garlic         
       and then the gravy.      

400
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:17,195
          Before today,         
      I'd never had a dish      
   made by DJ Super Birthday.   

401
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,797
            [laughs]            

402
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,933
       This right here...       
        I don't even know       
      if calling it poutine     

403
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,937
    is the right thing to do    
       because it's a very      
        elevated poutine.       

404
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:28,940
       Going to a regular       
        french fry potato       
     would have been simple.    

405
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,076
   You take it and mix it up.   

406
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,078
             Get it?            

407
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:38,082
  And throw in the fingerlings, 
      which is the royalty      
          of potatoes.          

408
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,686
   And then you make the gravy  
 that you really take some time 
        and energy to do.       

409
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,821
        This dish has got       
    a lot more sophistication   

410
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,958
       than you would find      
        in most poutines.       

411
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,359
        That is dynamite.       

412
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:49,760
   Poutine hitting the window.  

413
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,363
 The meat is rich, it's tender. 

414
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,698
  Gravy brings me back to home. 

415
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,366
          Folks tell me         
       you are the mayor.       

416
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:56,834
   I've been a fan of Rustica   
         for many years.        

417
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,502
        It brings a whole       
       new flavor to town.      

418
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,904
        -Did he just say        
         "flavor town"?         
            -[laughs]           

419
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:04,242
 Is this the mayor's subtle way 
       of trying to get me      
         out of office?         

420
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:05,710
       Scallops going up.       

421
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,044
       I love this place?       

422
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,847
    It's nice to have a place   
          to come where         
    I don't have to be picky.   

423
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:10,781
      Everything's perfect.     

424
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,319
     -Ladies and gentlemen,     
             DJ SB.             
            -[laughs]

      <i> in Marathon, Key...</i>      

426
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,592
  And yet there's more, folks.  

427
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,262
    <i> Serving up smash hits.</i>     

428
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,664
      Briny, salty, herby.      

429
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,967
        It's really good.       
    I mean, it's really good.   

430
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:35,873
    So, I'm here in Marathon,   
   Florida, down in the Keys.   

431
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,608
       And you know what?       
      I know how you feel.      

432
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,010
      You're driving though     
    a tourist area like this,   

433
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:41,478
           and you got          
      all these restaurants     
       jumping out at you.      

434
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,080
       And you don't want       
  to play restaurant roulette.  

435
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,750
     No, you're on vacation.    
     You only get to eat out    
          a few times.          

436
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,685
         And that's why         
        you got Triple D.       

437
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,020
      I'm out here finding      
       the joints for you.      

438
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:52,223
     You're gonna dig this.     
Herbie's Bar & Chowder House.   

439
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,960
 We got a whole-fry yellowtail. 

440
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,962
     There's no other place     
        here in the Keys        
  that I can get a better meal. 

441
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:00,698
      You know you're gonna     
  get kicked out of some joints 
      for saying that, now.     

442
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,301
  -It won't be the first time.  
         -[woman laughs]        

443
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,635
       Tuna tacos for you.      

444
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,437
    Hidden gem all day long.    

445
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:07,906
        It's one of those       
       mom and pop places.      

446
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:11,376
 [Guy]<i> And the mom and pop here</i> 
<i>are Shirley and Peter DeMaras,</i>  

447
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,778
   <i> who became empty nesters,</i>   
  <i> moved to Peter's home town</i>   

448
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,647
        <i> and bought this</i>

  <i> that first opened in 1945.</i>   

450
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:23,520
          This is like          
       the quintessential       
       postcard experience      

451
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,890
  of driving down the freeway,  
       and all of a sudden      
    you see this little hut,    

452
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,726
        and you're like,        
         "Boy, I bet you        
      that's a cool place."     

453
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,796
        It's an original        
         Florida shack,         
  is what they used to call it.

00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,132
      Food is always fresh,     
         always amazing.        

455
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:38,402
        Local style fish,       
       but a lot of stuff       
 you don't see everywhere else. 

456
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,604
       We have the chicken      
          smash potato.         

457
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:41,739
      The chicken and smash     
          is excellent.         

458
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,542
         It's two whole         
     chicken breasts, fried,    

459
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,677
         a baked potato         
        that he smashes,        

460
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,748
      and then it's topped      
        with this awesome       
     white gravy. I love it.    

461
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,817
      So, let's talk about      
 this chicken... Smash chicken. 

462
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,419
       -Chicken and smash.      
   We're gonna make the brine.  
             -Okay.             

463
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,488
         -[Peter] Water.        
          -Brown sugar.         

464
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,490
      [Peter] Kosher salt,      
       orange concentrate.      

465
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,626
       Orange concentrate?      
        Okay, I like it.        

466
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,427
  -[Peter] Lemon juice, ginger. 
            -Got it.            

467
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,630
       -A sea salt blend.       
       -Red chili flakes,       

468
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,432
   -little granulated garlic,   
         yada-yada-yada.        
              -Yep.             

469
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,635
     Rosemary, fresh thyme,     
           fresh sage.          

470
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,970
   Simmer for 15, 20 minutes.   

471
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,573
          -And how long         
      is this gonna brine?      
           -Overnight.          

472
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,575
     -What's our next step?     
    -Making a Buffalo sauce.    

473
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,711
   -Regular old Buffalo sauce   
       isn't good enough?       
             -Nope.             

474
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:21,913
  Hot sauce, the reaper sauce.  

475
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:23,715
        It's also another       
      style of wing sauce.      

476
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:27,452
      White pepper, chili,      
         cumin, ginger,         

477
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,054
   mustard, cayenne, turmeric.  

478
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:32,790
       [Guy] There you go       
     with that concentrated     
       orange juice again.      

479
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,592
        -And the butter.        
 -Okay. So, standard wing sauce 

480
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,596
   just completely freaked out  
    by you to the next level.   

481
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,064
          -Pretty much.         
           -Good talk.          

482
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:43,667
 [Peter] We have our buttermilk 
      and the Buffalo sauce     
       that we just made.       

483
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,736
    -[Guy] So, this goes in,    
     brines for another day?    
              -Yep.             

484
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,939
            -Next up.           
       -Caramelized onion       
          cream sauce.          

485
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:50,608
 When I come down to the beach, 
      hang out at the Keys,     

486
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,678
  I always like to have a nice  
 caramelized onion cream sauce. 

487
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,479
         It always says         
      bathing suit weather.     

488
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,348
        Put a speedo on,        
       you got the chain.       

489
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:58,816
      Why not? Let's roll.      

490
00:16:58,885 --> 00:16:59,950
        [both chuckling]        

491
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:04,688
  Clarified butter, salad oil,  
     onions, sea salt blend,    

492
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,691
    -white pepper, garlic...    
          -And de-glaze         
    with a little white wine?   

493
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,495
         [Peter] Cream,         
   little bit of cream cheese.  
      And let that reduce.      

494
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:12,697
   [Guy] So, when can we eat?   

495
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,632
           -Tomorrow?           
        -Ooh, good watch.       

496
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,500
        -[Peter chuckles]       
  -Right past the freckle, huh? 

497
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,502
     -[Peter] We got to make    
       the chicken flour.       
            -Got it.            

498
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:21,239
    AP flour, basil, oregano,   

499
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:23,640
      cumin, thyme, ginger.     

500
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,443
          -Guess what?          
            -Garlic?            

501
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,844
         -White pepper.         
       -White pepper. Oh!       

502
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,779
      How did I miss that?      
         He teed it up.         

503
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,715
      -[Peter] Rub sage...      
         -Chili powder.         

504
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:34,852
     [Peter] Mustard, cumin,    
  coriander, parsley, paprika.  

505
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,854
         -Are we missing        
        salt there, or...       
           -Thank you.          

506
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,791
  So, now the chicken comes out 
  of that to high-gluten flour, 

507
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:41,993
  into an egg wash, into this,  
  and then we go to the fryer.  

508
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:44,795
   And all we do is just take   
     a regular baked potato,    

509
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,131
   smash it, throw it in there  
  when the chicken is cooking.  

510
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,801
     That's it. Top 'em with    
  the green beans, our chicken, 

511
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,071
       onion cream sauce,       
        scallions on top.       

512
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,239
          Bon appetit.          

513
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,544
          That chicken          
     is layered with flavor.    

514
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,080
   And it soaks up that brine   
      so it's super juicy.      

515
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,417
    And the caramelized onion   
        anti-Speedo gravy       

516
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,885
   is the piece de resistance.  

517
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,554
    I mean, that's what ties    
   this whole thing together.   

518
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:13,624
       But you got briny,       
          salty, herby,         

519
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:16,227
  a little bit of spice in it,  
        crunchy chicken.        

520
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,431
  Served on a luxurious potato. 

521
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,899
 This is a "stick to your ribs" 
         kind of a meal.        

522
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,436
      And it's really done      
   with real culinary process.  

523
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:26,971
           -Well done.          
       -Glad you like it.       

524
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,307
    Chicken and smash potato.   

525
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,908
   The breading is wonderful.   

526
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:35,446
        His fried chicken       
      is moist and crunchy      
          and perfect.          

527
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,517
       So, I grew up here,      
   and Herbie's was a staple.   

528
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:44,188
     The family environment     
        that we have here       
       is second to none.       

529
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,390
     Everything on the menu     
           is amazing.          

530
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,859
      [Peter] Cheeseburger      
         and para-fries.        

531
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:51,795
   Cheeseburger and para-fries  
      is basically a mound      
         of french fries        

532
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,664
   with a cheese burger on top  

533
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:57,201
     and extra cheese curds     
    that come from Wisconsin.   

534
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,768
     It melts in your mouth.    

535
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:01,739
    Okay, first step of this    
       cheeseburger and...      

536
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,941
           Para-fries.          
  We're gonna make a remoulade. 

537
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:08,179
  Garlic going in, horseradish, 
      roasted red peppers.      

538
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:13,150
       Add a little bit of      
  pickle juice, mustard, mayo.  

539
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,819
  -[Guy] Cajun blackened spice. 
       -A little cayenne.       

540
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,221
   -[Guy] A dash of hot sauce.  
      -A dash of hot sauce.     

541
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,889
  Just a dash. Now we're gonna  
    take it to another level.   

542
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,425
         -And it's gonna        
        be called the...        
          -Hack sauce.          

543
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:24,461
          -Hack sauce.          
     So, more mayonnaise...     
         -Pickle relish.        

544
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,897
       You said there was       
      a beer cheese sauce?      

545
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:29,633
      The beer cheese sauce     
      is very much like our     
 caramelized onion cream sauce. 

546
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:33,037
      -From there we add...     
         -Mexican lager,        
       American pale ale,       

547
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:37,241
   cheddar cheese, provolone,   
    Havarti, American cheese,   
         seasoned salt.         

548
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,645
          -Final steps?         
    -We got the burger going,   
      little white pepper.      

549
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:41,845
   You and your white pepper.   

550
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:45,649
   [Peter] Some cheese, fries.  
   Lay the burger down on it.   

551
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:48,786
       Lettuce, tomatoes,       
         onion, pickles.        

552
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,188
    -[Guy] And cheese curds.    
         -Cheese curds.         

553
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:51,722
  And yet, there's more, folks. 

554
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:55,126
     [Peter] The beer cheese    
      that we made earlier,     
     the hack sauce on top.     

555
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,731
              [Guy]             
   Patty is cooked perfectly,   
  little caramelization to it.  

556
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,667
   I like the American cheese   
  on top. It's silky and melty. 

557
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:07,071
      All the crustifiation     
  from the veggies is perfect.  

558
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:11,475
        Where do you get        
      a little ridiculous?      

559
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,878
       Like, over the top       
      and, like, you know,      

560
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,480
     -running in the dark...    
             -Naked.            

561
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,949
    Running in the dark naked   
      is the cheese curds.      

562
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,885
       -It's really good.       
    I mean, it's really good.   
       -Glad you like it.       

563
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,420
  Cheeseburger and para-fries.  

564
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,422
        Got nice flavor,        
      nice juiciness to it.     

565
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:26,624
         The whole combo        
       works really well.       

566
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,426
       Spicy clam chowder.      

567
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:29,694
      Herbie's is the best.     

568
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:32,697
          This is what          
      Triple D's all about.     
  If it's funky, we'll find it. 

569
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,265
           -Nice job.           
           -Thank you.          

570
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:39,236
    That's it for this week.    
      But don't you worry,      

571
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,572
    I'll be looking for more    
  joints all over this country. 

572
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:45,209
    I'll see you next week on   
 <i> Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.</i>  

573
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:49,713
    Hey, this is the Ice Man,   
  and I kick like Jackie Chan.  

574
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,782
         And here we are        
        in the 561, man.        

575
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,386
        This is Triple D.       
     Get it how you live it     
            with me.            

576
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:57,088
          [Guy laughs]          

577
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,091
      -[Vanilla Ice laughs]     
       -That was awesome.
