00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,566
FIERI: But right now,
my new co‐host Zac Brown

174
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,040
and I are getting busy
with Chef Darius

175
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,740
diving into his soul food
with a spin.

176
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,573
MAN: Everybody should try
this restaurant

177
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:07,273
because it makes you think
outside the box

178
00:06:07,373 --> 00:06:10,573
without going too far,
especially with the lasagna.

179
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:11,806
WILLIAMS:
Collard green lasagna.

180
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:13,506
Collard green lasagna
is my new favorite.

181
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,306
The sauce is just so flavorful.

182
00:06:15,406 --> 00:06:16,840
Just creamy, cheesy,

183
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,806
everything you look for
in a lasagna right here,

184
00:06:18,906 --> 00:06:20,673
then the little twist
with the collard greens.

185
00:06:20,773 --> 00:06:22,306
I like it.
‐What are we making now?

186
00:06:22,406 --> 00:06:25,106
These are the collard greens
for the collard green lasagna.

187
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:26,706
Oh, wait a minute.

188
00:06:26,806 --> 00:06:28,673
I've had spinach in lasagna,
maybe, before.

189
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:30,406
Thank you. You're going
exactly where I'm going.

190
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:32,873
But collards seem way
more legit.

191
00:06:32,973 --> 00:06:34,906
It'll kind of remind you
of spinach a little bit,

192
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:36,973
but with our own twist.
Let's get into it.

193
00:06:37,073 --> 00:06:38,673
Smoked turkey
is where we start.

194
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,673
And we just throw
the greens right in

195
00:06:40,773 --> 00:06:42,573
because they all have
to cook and stew together.

196
00:06:42,673 --> 00:06:44,906
Once these cook down,
then we'll season them.

197
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:47,340
So you put a little sugar,
Cajun seasoning, chicken...

198
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,406
Chicken base.
There you go.

199
00:06:48,506 --> 00:06:49,440
Garlic powder.
Onion.

200
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,140
Onion powder,
that's it, oil.

201
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,673
And these are gonna go down
for how long, Chef?

202
00:06:52,773 --> 00:06:54,173
Three, three and a half,
four hours.

203
00:06:54,273 --> 00:06:57,173
Drain them, then we add in
the ricotta, the heavy cream...

204
00:06:57,273 --> 00:06:58,873
Salt, pepper, and garlic.
Salt, pepper, and that's it.

205
00:06:58,973 --> 00:07:00,980
That's it.
Then over to the meat sauce.

206
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,380
Yeah. Onion, garlic, salt and
pepper, and Italian seasoning.

207
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,946
We brown off the ground turkey.

208
00:07:06,046 --> 00:07:08,313
Tomato paste
and then crushed tomato,

209
00:07:08,413 --> 00:07:09,880
do a little sugar, garlic...

210
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,013
Chicken base.

211
00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:12,580
Now we build this monster.
That's it.

212
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,313
Add in some turkey red sauce.

213
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:15,846
Lasagna sheets down.

214
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:19,380
Collard green, ricotta mixture,
and then you smoosh it around.

215
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,613
Top it with shredded moz.

216
00:07:20,713 --> 00:07:21,580
Now how long is this gonna
go down for?

217
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,446
About 45 minutes.

218
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:24,846
Bring it out, what size
piece are we talking?

219
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:26,346
A big serving.
A hunk.

220
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,446
That's what I want.
It's a hunk.

221
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:28,546
Make a hunk happen.

222
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:30,680
The same tomato turkey gravy...

223
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,080
That's it.
Then we get a hunk.

224
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,880
Half hour show, Chef.
Oh, you ready?

225
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,013
Yeah.
Here we go. [ Laughs ]

226
00:07:38,113 --> 00:07:41,813
Oh, yeah.
And a little parmesan.

227
00:07:41,913 --> 00:07:43,013
That looks good, man.

228
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:44,413
My mouth just started
to water.

229
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:46,246
Cheers.

230
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:50,313
There's a ton of collards.

231
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:51,546
They have really cooked down.

232
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:53,480
The collards work.
The turkey's nice.

233
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,846
You get a good texture
from the meat.

234
00:07:56,946 --> 00:07:59,380
You're using a really
strong noodle.

235
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,520
I like a thirsty noodle, too,
and this noodle's drinking up

236
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,686
all the goodness
that he's got going on.

237
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:05,053
Hey.

238
00:08:05,153 --> 00:08:06,653
Where do you come up
with "thirsty noodle"?

239
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,086
So good.
Is there like a cooking ‐‐

240
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:10,353
you got a Zac cookbook
coming out, what's going on?

241
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:11,620
Thirsty noodle.

242
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,486
Hey, you crushed it, my friend.
Thank you.

243
00:08:13,586 --> 00:08:14,553
Congratulations.
Thank you.

244
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:15,953
‐Amazing.
‐Collard green lasagna.

245
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:19,386
The lasagna is the perfect
ratio between meat,

246
00:08:19,486 --> 00:08:20,820
cheese,
and collard greens.

247
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,386
It's incredible, really good.

248
00:08:22,486 --> 00:08:23,853
Crab stuffed catfish.

249
00:08:23,953 --> 00:08:25,620
Greens and Gravy
is wonderful.

250
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,386
I'm from 30 miles away.

251
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:29,586
So you had to make a voyage
to get here.

252
00:08:29,686 --> 00:08:30,586
Yes.
Was it worth it?

253
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:32,053
Yes. [ Laughs ]

254
00:08:32,153 --> 00:08:33,520
I mean, it's legit, right?

255
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,920
Yes.
Just a wonderful place to go.

256
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,320
I wanted this to be really good,
and it exceeded.

257
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,386
It's great.
Thank you.

258
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:40,453
ZB, nice having you,
brother.

259
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:41,386
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Thank you, man.

260
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:42,353
Appreciate it.
Yes, sir.

261
00:08:42,453 --> 00:08:44,920
Watch out.

262
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,120
FIERI: Up next...

263
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,386
We're keeping the hits
coming as we head to Austin...

264
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,620
You had me at "Hello."

265
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,386
...where the real star
in the Lonestar state...

266
00:08:52,486 --> 00:08:54,120
‐God.
‐...is Brazilian.

267
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,653
Little truck, big flavor.

268
00:09:00,326 --> 00:09:04,826
♪♪♪

269
00:09:04,926 --> 00:09:06,560
So the last time I was
in Austin, Texas,

270
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,926
I took this buddy of mine
to the Monument Cafe

271
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:10,060
and we had a blast.

272
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,193
So I rolled back into Austin,
and of course,

273
00:09:12,293 --> 00:09:13,526
he's shooting
a movie overseas,

274
00:09:13,626 --> 00:09:15,026
but he says,
"Listen, bro," he says,

275
00:09:15,126 --> 00:09:17,526
"if you like Brazilian food,
you got to check this joint out.

276
00:09:17,626 --> 00:09:19,126
It is totally legit."

277
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,260
What did I say?

278
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,426
"All right, all right,
all right."

279
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:25,026
This is Boteco.

280
00:09:25,126 --> 00:09:27,060
This is only the best food truck
in Austin,

281
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,393
but it's also the best place
to get food in Austin.

282
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:31,026
I got the Yuca fries right here.

283
00:09:31,126 --> 00:09:33,260
It's like my food, you know,
it's my mom's food.

284
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,360
This is how your mom
would make it?

285
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,826
Yeah.

286
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:36,960
FIERI: And it's how
Fernando Marri's mom made it

287
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,393
when he was growing up
in Brazil, too.

288
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:40,693
My family has restaurants
in Brazil,

289
00:09:40,793 --> 00:09:42,193
so I grew up
in the kitchen, literally.

290
00:09:42,293 --> 00:09:43,460
So what is the food?

291
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,760
What we're making today
is feijoada.

292
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,693
Feijoada.
National dish of Brazil.

293
00:09:46,793 --> 00:09:48,393
It's a black bean
and porridge stew.

294
00:09:48,493 --> 00:09:50,860
Feijoada, it can keep me
alive for years.

295
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,360
You could really tell that
he puts the passion into it.

296
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,793
So we start with a pork butt.

297
00:09:55,893 --> 00:09:58,260
Oil, salt,
garlic and onion paste.

298
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,593
Okay.

299
00:09:59,693 --> 00:10:00,833
Got the same marinade
on the ribs...
Okay.

300
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,266
...on the sirloin.
What type of grill is this?

301
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:04,966
It's a yakitori.
Super hot charcoal in there.

302
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:06,733
Next step is to caramelize
the smoked meats.

303
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,566
Which is what?
Good chunks of bacon.

304
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:09,900
The hocks and the tail.

305
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,100
The smoked neck bones.

306
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,533
You can get those
anywhere here.

307
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:15,933
Prosciutto, pork and bean
sausage, put the onions here.

308
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,466
Garlic and onion paste.

309
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:19,500
Then we'll take the
grilled pork butt and ribs...

310
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,533
Yes.
Got it.

311
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:21,900
Add a little beef base.

312
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,366
Fresh bay leaves,
black beans soaked overnight.

313
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:27,100
Water goes in, salt,
pressure cooker,

314
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,300
how long's this gonna go?

315
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,966
30 minutes.
What are we making next?

316
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:31,800
We're gonna have a little
pork belly on the side

317
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,200
just to give it
a little bit of texture

318
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,500
because all the meat's
gonna be stewed.

319
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,800
We're just gonna score it.

320
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,433
Through the fat
right down to the meat.

321
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:39,300
A little bit of salt and
a little bit of Cachaça,

322
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,600
Brazilian rum.

323
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,333
A little rum.
Then we make a bed of onions...

324
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:45,800
Oranges, lemons, limes.
Beautiful.

325
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,333
A little more Cachaça
on top.

326
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:49,033
Looks like you've had
some Cachaça.

327
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:50,300
I did.
In the oven...

328
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,033
About 2 hours,
400 degrees.

329
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:53,366
And what's the final piece?

330
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:55,533
Farofa, the most popular
side dish of Brazil.

331
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:56,800
Okay.
Oil and butter.

332
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,200
Chilies.
Garlic and onion paste.

333
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,440
Cook a little bit.

334
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,773
And then you add
the Yuca flour,

335
00:11:01,873 --> 00:11:03,240
then you're free to add
whatever you want.

336
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,806
A little bit of salt.

337
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:06,973
We'll add bananas.

338
00:11:07,073 --> 00:11:10,573
Bananas.
Literally, that is...

339
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:13,106
The pork belly, pour
a little bit of hot oil on top

340
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,073
to get this thing cracking.

341
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,440
I like this move.

342
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,073
Now we're just gonna
serve that.

343
00:11:17,173 --> 00:11:19,140
I'm gonna
serve it like this.

344
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,673
Got to have a little
