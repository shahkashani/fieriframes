           THE TOILET PAPER ON.

   WE GOT ANOTHER SET OF ROLLERS
        HERE. WE'RE LOADED.     

228
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,452

00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,521
SPINACH AND SWISS CHARD.        
       WE SQUEEZE THE WATER OUT.

230
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,790
   WE MIX TOGETHER              
FOCACCIA BREADCRUMBS.           

231
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,593
 THEN ONIONS SAUTéED WITH NUTMEG

SO WE PUT IT ALL TOGETHER,      
  AND WE'RE GOOD TO GO.         

235

PUSH THE DOUGH INTO THOSE       
   ROLLERS. THAT'S IT.          

239
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,744
                  CRANK IT DOWN.
PUT THE PRESSURE ON IT,         
 AND THEN YOU JUST...           

240
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,479
            NOW IT'LL SELF-FEED.
THAT'S CORRECT.

      BEAUTIFUL. LOOK AT THOSE  
     LITTLE PILLOWS OF MADNESS.

244
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,758
       CANNED TOMATOES FORTIFIED
            WITH THE BASIL.     
    AND THEN WE ADD             
OREGANO, CHILI PEPPER.          

245
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,827
THEN WE STIR IT, AND WE'RE      
    GONNA LET IT COOK.          

246
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,896
COVER IT FOR A LITTLE BIT.      
THEN WE TURN THE FIRE HERE,     

247
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:01,700
'CAUSE WE DO THE SECOND PART.   
       <i> OLIO DI OLIVA.</i>          
                  THAT'S WHAT   
                I WAS GONNA SAY.

00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,973
   OKAY, THE SALT. LET IT POACH 
     IN THE OIL A LITTLE BIT,   

251
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,775
                 AND THEN WE'RE 
               GONNA DUMP IT IN.
THAT'S CORRECT.                 

252
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,977
               NOW HOW LONG     
           IS THIS GONNA SIMMER 

253
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,779
                   AFTER WE PUT 
                  THE GARLIC IN?
A COUPLE HOURS.                 

254
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,515
THE LONGER IT GOES,             
 THE BETTER IT IS.              
                 OH, THIS REALLY
                   LOOKS GOOD.  

255
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:21,052
   I WISH WE COULD TRY          
SOME OF THIS. OH, MY GOSH.      
                  THIS WAS BAKED
                   LAST NIGHT.  

256
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,787
          OH, LOOK AT THAT. MMM.
              EXCELLENT, MAN.

             AND NOW IT'S TIME  
           TO COOK THE RAVIOLIS.
APPROXIMATELY                   
FOUR MINUTES,                   

258
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,924
         AND WHILE THE RAVIOLIS 
              ARE COOKING,      

259

  ARE THOSE                     
BAD BOYS DONE?

            NOW WE NEED A PLATE 

263
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:40,472
AND A LITTLE BIT

00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:43,514

    OF GROUND BEEF.             

363

        YOU ARE A MACHINE, DUDE.

364
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,586
   NOW WE GOT SOME SALT         
AND A LITTLE GARLIC POWDER.     

365
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,989
         I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
           SEEN ANYBODY MAKE... 
BLACK PEPPER.                   

366
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,590
         SHEPHERD'S PIE IN JUST,
           LIKE, RECORD TIME.

  AND THIS IS                   
WORCESTERSHIRE.                 

368
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,994
                     (whistles) 

369
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:59,596
AND THEN WE JUST MIX            
    ALL THAT UP.                
              DO YOU ALWAYS COOK
                  THIS FAST?    

370
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:03,401
YEP, ALWAYS.                    
                 WE HAVE MADE   
             THIS ENTIRE MIXTURE

371
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,668
                WITHIN PROBABLY 
               ABOUT 60 SECONDS.

372
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,738
    THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE DELAY,
         'CAUSE I'VE TALKED.    
WE'RE READY.                    

373
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,874
      OKAY. COULD YOU SLOW DOWN?
          I'M OUT OF BREATH.    
(laughing)                      

374
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,477
 WE'LL PUT SOME ALUMINUM FOIL   
ON THERE AND PUT IT IN THE OVEN 

375
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,345
AND LET HER GO.                 

376
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:17,081
             WAS THAT ONE WORD? 

377
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,619
YEP.                            
                THAT WAS 1 WORD,
                   17 HYPHENS.  

378
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,821
       OKAY, SO 350 FOR 2 HOURS.
         OKAY, CRACK HER OPEN.  

379
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,757
               IT LOOKS A LITTLE
                MEAT LOAFY-ISH. 
YEAH.                           

380
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,893
                IS THAT A WORD, 
               "MEAT LOAFY-ISH"?
COULD BE.                       

381
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,895
                           OKAY.
 MAKE THE BROWN GRAVY           
FOR THE SHEPHERD'S PIE          

382
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,764
FOR THE SHEPHERD'S PIE.         
     MAKE A ROUX.               

383
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,632
     NOW YOU ADD                
SOME KITCHEN BOUQUET,           

384
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,500
SO YOU CAN GIVE IT SOME COLOR   
    AND A LITTLE FLAVOR.        

385
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,436
TAKE THE ROUX AND ADD IT        
    TO THE BEEF STOCK           

386
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,038
AND PUT IT ON TOP.              

387
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,839
AND THEN OUR CORN WILL GO       
 RIGHT IN ON TOP OF IT.         

388
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,775
THEN MASHED POTATOES WILL       
 JUST GO ON TOP OF THAT.        
                AND WHAT YOU GOT
                IN THOSE MASHED?

389
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,777
JUST PEPPER AND A LITTLE BIT    
OF GARLIC, A POUND OF BUTTER.   
                       OH, OKAY.

390
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,646
         NOW HOW LONG WILL THIS 
        GO BACK IN THE OVEN FOR?
OH, JUST ABOUT                  
 TEN MINUTES.                   

391
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,716
          JUST TO BROWN THOSE   
      MASHED POTATOES UP ON TOP?
YOU GOT IT.                     

392
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,653
OKAY, LOOKS LIKE CULINARY       
QUICKSAND IN FLAVOR TOWN.       

393
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:59,524
                       OH, YEAH.
CAN YOU SEE THE STEAM?          

394
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,526
MMM, OH, THAT'S GOOD.           

395
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,862
YOU GET ALL THAT WORCESTERSHIRE 
      DOWN IN THAT MEAT,        

396
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,798
AND THEN YOU GET THAT NICE,     
    LITTLE SWEET CORN,

THEN YOU GET THAT TWICE-BAKED   
MASHED POTATO THING GOING ON.

    TO MY RIB RIGHT NOW.        

399
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:15,672
IT'S SIMPLE BUT PACKED          
     WITH FLAVOR.               

400
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:19,543

DID EARL FORGET THE ECONOMY     
  AND INFLATION WENT ON?        

403
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,819
