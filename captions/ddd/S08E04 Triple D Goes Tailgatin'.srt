         SO MOST PEOPLE ROLL OUT
         TO DO TAILGATING,      

54
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:17,669
  YOU COME OUT WITH FRESH LINENS
  AND A FRYER.                  

55
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,938

  THAI NOODLE SALAD.            

57
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:24,342
        WE START OFF            
        BY MAKING THE DRESSING.

00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,544
       DISTILLED WHITE VINEGAR, 
       WE'VE GOT SUGAR.         

59
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,546
            PUT SOME GARLIC IN, 

60
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,348
LET THIS ALL COME UP TO A BOIL.

00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,551
A LITTLE SAMBAL OELEK.          
                  NICE AND HOT. 

62
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,753
   AND I'M GONNA MAKE A MARINADE
   FOR THE SHRIMP RIGHT NOW.    

63
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,688
NORMALLY WHEN YOU COME TO       
A TAILGATING EVENT              

64
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,623
AND YOU SEE A BLENDER           
BEING WHIPPED OUT               

65
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,558
IT'S BECAUSE                    
SOMEONE'S MAKING MARGARITAS.    

66
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:42,360

          SUGAR AND FISH SAUCE. 

70
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,835
                LET THAT BLEND. 

71
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,104
WE'LL GIVE IT A LITTLE TASTE.   

72
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,173
WORKS FOR ME.                   

73
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,042
WHAT SIZE SHRIMP

75
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,179

00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,115
     NOW I'VE GOT WATER BOILING 
     AND I'M GONNA PUT IN SOME  
     RICE NOODLES               

77
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,516
              AND LET THOSE SIT 
              FOR FIVE MINUTES. 

78
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,518
 I'LL STRAIN 'EM, COOL 'EM OFF, 

79
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:10,122

82
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,329

00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:19,264
GO, GO, GO, GO, GOOD.           

84
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,266
NOW WE'RE GONNA DO              
SOME SHRIMP INTO IT?            

85
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:23,201

86
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,936
       WE'LL PUT IN             
       A LITTLE GRAPE SEED OIL. 

87
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:27,139
EVERYBODY SAUTES                
AT A RAIDER GAME.               

88
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,341
SHRIMP LOOK GREAT.              

89
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,343
      YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE SALT, 
      A LITTLE PEPPER.          

90
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:33,345
              YOU CAN GO AHEAD  
              AND TOSS THAT UP. 

91
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,013
HOW'S THAT?                     
                       PERFECT. 

92
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,948
                 SRIRACHA AIOLI,
                 RICE POWDER.   

93
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:39,284
           TOASTING UP SOME RICE
           AND JUST PUT IT IN   
           A SPICE GRINDER.

       AND THERE WE ARE.        

98
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:49,494
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN GET     
THE RIGHT ANGLE ON THIS,        

99
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,563
BUT SEE THE RAIDER GUY?         

100
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,498
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU'LL EVER
SEE THIS HERE AGAIN.            

101
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,567
OH YEAH, AND CHOPSTICKS.

00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,471
THIS SALAD LOOKS GREAT, MAN.

112
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,928
I LIKE HOW THE WAY THAT HEAT    
KIND OF CREEPS UP A LITTLE BIT. 

113
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,996
           WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING  
           SHRIMP IN SOMETHING, 
           YOU CAN'T GO WRONG.  

114

                   DEMON LOVER. 

123
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,552
THAT'S SAYS WAFFLE.             

124

      YOU WANT TO WHISK THAT UP 
      TO GET IT THICK.          

131

        FOR THAT,

00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,811

       SO 20 YEARS OF           
       DOING COMFORT FOOD       
       AT RICK AND ANN'S,       

351
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,813
            CHEF RICK LAUER,    
            HOW ARE YOU, BUDDY? 

352
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:39,150
GOOD, GUY,

                I'M DOING GOOD. 

353
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,686
THE FIRST THING                 
WE'RE GONNA START OFF WITH IS   
A STEAK SANDWICH MADE WITH WHAT?

354
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,821
JALAPENO PESTO.                 

355
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,823
                THAT'S A FIRST, 
                LET'S DO THIS.  

356
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,425
         HERE'S A NICE PIECE OF 
         FLANK STEAK.           

357
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,493
WE'RE GONNA MARINATE IT.        

358
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,362
WE'LL DRIZZLE A LITTLE BIT OF   
OLIVE OIL ON IT, EXTRA-VIRGIN.  

359
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,231
YOU CAN USE REGULAR OLIVE OIL,  
YOU CAN USE CANOLA OIL.         

360
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,300
              OR 10-40 PENZOIL. 

361
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,168
         A LITTLE FRESH GARLIC. 

362
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,236
SPRINKLE SOME KOSHER SALT,      
FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER.    

363
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,572
PAPRIKA, KIND OF                
RUB IT IN THERE.                

364
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,240
 SO WE'LL LET THIS HANG OUT     
 FOR A FEW HOURS IN THE FRIDGE. 

365
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:06,444
    WHAT ARE WE GONNA MAKE NOW? 
WE'RE GONNA MAKE                
SOME JALAPENO PESTO.            

366
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,779
THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THAT      
I DON'T LIKE THE SOUND OF.      

367
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,316
YEAH, I KEEP THIS IN MY CAR.    

368
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,718
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GONNA
NEED A FOOD PROCESSOR HERE      
AT THE TAILGATING EVENT.        

369
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:15,787
A LITTLE CILANTRO.              

370
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,789
JALAPENOS,                      
KEEP THE SEEDS IN FOR HEAT.     

371
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:19,791
SOME WHOLE GARLIC CLOVES,       
VIRGIN OLIVE OIL.               

372
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:22,126
               GRATED PARMESAN. 

373
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,328
 FRESH LEMON JUICE, THAT ACID   
 HELPS KEEP IT NICE AND BRIGHT. 

374
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,331
LET'S TOSS IT.                  

375
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,799
         THE FLAVORS WILL MARRY 
         A LITTLE BIT HERE.     

376
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,935
  GET THE STEAK ON,             
  BUT HERE'S THE KEY            
  WHEN IT COMES TO FLANK STEAK. 

377
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,004
DON'T OVERCOOK IT,              
OTHERWISE YOU'RE GONNA GET      
YOURSELF A TOUGH PIECE OF MEAT. 

378
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,006
       WHAT DO WE WORK ON NEXT? 

379
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,008
WE'RE GONNA SAUTE SOME PEPPERS  
FOR THE SANDWICH.               

380
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:39,076
FIRST WE'RE GONNA PUT IN        
SOME CANOLA OIL.                

381
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,412
SLICED WHITE ONIONS.            

382
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:43,881
        THE ONIONS COOK DOWN,   
        NOW WE HIT THE PEPPERS. 

383
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,816
YEAH, SLICED GREEN PEPPERS,     
SWEET RED PEPPERS,              

384
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:47,752
AND THEN SOME YELLOW PEPPERS.   

385
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:49,554
                 A LITTLE SALT. 

386
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,555
A LITTLE FRESH,                 
GROUND, BLACK PEPPER.           

387
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,491
    GA-GA-GA-GA-GA-GA-GA-GA.    

388
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,626
    THIS IS WHAT YOU GOTTA LOVE 
    ABOUT A RAIDER GAME, MAN.   

389
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,695
 YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. 

390
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,964
OKAY, THE PEPPERS ARE DONE,     
NOW WE CAN BUILD THIS SANDWICH. 

391
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,033
ONE MORE THING, THOUGH.         

392
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,302
WE ADD SOME JACK CHEESE         
TO THE PEPPERS, WE'RE DONE.     

393
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,770
            OH, THE JUICE       
            COMING OFF OF THAT. 

394
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:09,774
      JUST GIVE IT FIVE MINUTES 
       SO THE JUICES CALM DOWN. 
EXACTLY.                        

395
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:12,109
LET'S DO SOME SLICING HERE.     

396
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,378
      ARE THOSE YOUR KEYS       
      OVER THERE ON THE GROUND? 

397
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,246
MY KEYS?                        

398
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:18,383
I DON'T SEE ANY KEYS, GUY.      

399
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,986
                   THAT'S GOOD. 

400
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:23,721
HIT ONE OF THESE ROLLS          
WITH SOME OF THE JALAPENO PESTO.

401
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,123
PUT THE FLANK STEAK ON,         

402
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,660
THEN THE SAUTED PEPPERS,        
ONIONS, AND JACK CHEESE ON TOP. 

403
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,995
CUT IT IN HALF.                 

404
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,830
    TAKE A LOOK AT THAT,        
    A PICTURE-PERFECT SANDWICH. 

405
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:35,199
       THAT'S A GREAT SANDWICH. 

406
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:37,034
  YOU GET THE CARAMELIZATION OF 
  THE ONIONS, THE DISTINCT      
  BELL PEPPER,                  

407
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,203
      BUT IT'S THE LITTLE BITE, 

408
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,005
    JUST THE LITTLE BITE        
    YOU GET FROM THAT JALAPENO. 

409
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,407
             THAT'S GREAT, MAN, 
             YOU'D LOVE THIS.   

410
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,476
           I BETCHA WE'VE GOT   
           FOUR MORE SANDWICHES 
           OUT OF THAT.

    DO YOU WANT TO FEED SOME OF 
         THESE FANS NEXT TO US? 
LET'S DO IT.                    

412
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:50,081
THEY'VE GOT SOME                
MEAN-LOOKING SAUSAGE            
AND I HEAR THEIR BEER'S COLD.   

413

YOU GUYS WANT TO TRY            
A KILLER STEAK SANDWICH?        
                OH, ABSOLUTELY.

COME OVER AND CHECK THIS OUT.   

415
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,287
THIS IS WHAT YOU DO             
HERE IN RAIDER NATION.          

416
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,423
          THIS LOOKS BEAUTIFUL. 

417
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,358
                   NICE FLAVOR. 

418
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:03,027
    THE SANDWICHES ARE GOOD?    

419
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,229
                   THE PEPPERS. 

420
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,365
     THE SAUSAGE AIN'T BAD.     

421
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,233
             I'VE NEVER TASTED  
             THIS KIND OF STUFF 
             AT A TAILGATE.     

422
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,168
                  THIS IS GOOD. 

423
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,037
  DON'T GO AND COOK TOO MUCH OF 
  YOUR OWN FOOD                 

424
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,973
      BECAUSE WE'VE GOT         
      PORK CHOPS COMING UP.     

425
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,575
       WE GOT ENOUGH PORK CHOPS 
                      FOR THEM? 
WE SURE DO, GUY.                

426
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,845
SO FIRST                        
WE BRINE THE PORK CHOPS.        

427
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,980
WE START WITH SOME COLD WATER   
AND WE'RE GONNA PUT IN          
KOSHER SALT,                    

428
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,115
GRANULATED WHITE SUGAR.         

429
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,985
     YOU COULD USE BROWN SUGAR, 
     WHITE SUGAR, MOLASSES,     
     HONEY.                     

430
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,987
  LET IT ALL DISSOLVE IN THERE. 

431
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,921
THEN WE ADD OUR BAY LEAF,       
FRESH CRACKED PEPPER.           

432
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,524
        JUNIPER BERRY IN THERE. 

433
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,925
YEAH, CRACK IT IN               
A FOOD PROCESSOR FIRST.         

434
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,061
      A LITTLE RED CHILI FLAKE, 
      MY FAVORITE, GARLIC.      

435
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,597
GIVE THAT A STIR.               
         POP THESE BAD BOYS IN. 

436
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,666
WE'LL LET THIS STAY REFRIGERATED
ABOUT 12 HOURS AND THOSE WILL   
BRINE UP NICE.                  

437
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:45,003
          WE'RE GONNA SMOKE IT? 
ON A TABLE-TOP SMOKER.          

438
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,338
THESE ARE APPLEWOOD CHIPS,      
COVER THE BOTTOM.               

439
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,340
THEN WE JUST PUT THE PAN        
ON TOP OF THE WOOD CHIPS.       

440
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,342
THAT KEEPS THEM                 
FROM CATCHING ON FIRE.          

441
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,211
NOW WE PUT THE PORK CHOPS       
IN THE SMOKER.                  

442
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,146
 REALLY STARTING TO GET SOME OF 
 THAT SMOKE OUT OF THOSE CHOPS. 

443
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,081
THEY'RE READY.                  
                  LOOK AT THAT. 

444
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,083
THEN WE'RE GONNA FINISH 'EM OFF 
ON THE GRILL.                   

445
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,352
           NOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE 
           THE POTATO PANCAKE.  

446
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,021
FIRST WE START OUT              
WITH SHREDDED POTATOES.         

447
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,023
 THAT YOU SOAKED IN WATER       
 SO THEY DIDN'T GO GRAY ON YOU. 

448
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:07,124
THEN WE'RE GONNA CRACK ONE EGG, 

449
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,560
SOME GRATED ONION,              
PANKO BREADCRUMBS.              

450
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,629
  MIX THAT TOGETHER, YOU'VE GOT 
  A LITTLE BINDER OF THE EGG.   

451
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,497
WE'RE READY TO PUT IT           
ON THE GRIDDLE.                 

452
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,499
JUST PLOP THEM RIGHT ON.        

453
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,368
WE'RE GONNA PUT SOME SALT       
AND PEPPER ON, CANOLA OIL,      

454
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,370
AND IT'LL HELP BROWN 'EM UP.    

455
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,839
FINISH 'EM OFF                  
WITH SOME CHEDDAR               
AND JACK CHEESE ON HERE.        

456
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,574
COVER 'EM WITH A SHEET PAN.     

457
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,376
LET'S DO IT.                    
 THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. 

458
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,311
 THE CHOPS ARE DONE.            

459
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,647
          WE BRINED 'EM         
          SO YOU KNOW THEY'VE   
          GOTTA BE SUPER MOIST. 

460
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,649
PUT ON SOME HOMEMADE APPLESAUCE 
AND A SCOOP OF SOUR CREAM.      

461
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,651
A LITTLE BIT OF GREEN ONION     
AND WE'RE READY TO GO.

     OF SMOKE.                  

465
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,794
         THAT REMINDS ME        
         A LITTLE BIT OF BACON. 

466
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,930
