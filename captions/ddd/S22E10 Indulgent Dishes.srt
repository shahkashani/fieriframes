00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:02,000
           Hey, there.          

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,468
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,005
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,474
          This trip...          
                       Oh!      

5
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:10,142
      It's time to indulge.     

6
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:11,744
  You ain't saving              
any calories today, Guy.        

7
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:14,212
            It's some           
      rockin' rich recipes.     

8
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,814
              I'm gonna end up  
         pushing that car again.

9
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,816
  In Los Angeles, California... 

10
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:20,085
      Oh!                       
         ...A Koreatown         
           biergarten.          

11
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:23,288
 That's impressive!             
       ...Firing up funky,      
      full-flavored fusion.     

12
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,556
       Is that                  
what you were going for?        

13
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:26,024
                Yeah, that's    
           what I was going for.
      Gangster.                 

14
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,893
 In Charlotte, North Carolina...

15
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:28,827
             What a great place.

16
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,229
    A mother-daughter duo...    

17
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:31,630
            Can I lick the bowl?
   Sure.                        

18
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,899
    ...Serving up the savory    
         and the sweet.         

19
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:36,234
              That is probably  
        one of the best desserts

20
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,969
                I've ever had   
               on "Triple D."   

21
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,038
      And on the east side      
         of Charlotte...        

22
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,173
      Hey, ho!                  

23
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:42,441
  ...A wild and crazy joint...  

24
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:44,242
You got to come down            
    for the show.               

25
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,845
     ...Dishing out seafood     
        with an attitude.       

26
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:49,448
                 Badda-bing,    
            right there for you!
   Yeah.                        

27

     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

28
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,052
         on "Triple D."         

29
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,999
     I'm always looking for     
          great joints          

30
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,735
  that are serving killer food  
  served up by real characters. 

31
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,538
             I mean,            
  you got Stretch at Grinders,  

32
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,838

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,541

       at Queens Comfort.       

34
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,877
    I mean, the list goes on    
         and on and on.         

35
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,946
          So here I am          
      on the northeast side     

36
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,614
  of Charlotte, North Carolina. 

37
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,749
           Badda-bing,          
     I've found another one!    

38
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,685
       This is Krazy Fish.      

39
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,454
               Oh!              

40
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:31,757
          Mussels in the window.

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,358
   It's the best in Charlotte.  

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,693
   Melting pot of good flavor.  

43
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,562

   in the restaurant business,  

45
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,498
          you got to be         
       a little bit wacky.      

46
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,432
                     Oh!        

47
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,700
             George             
     is a little bit wacky.     

48
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:44,369
      FIERI: That would be      
 New York native George Prisco, 

49
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,105
         who grew up in         
   his family's restaurant biz  

50
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:50,976
  before opening his own brand  
        of crazy in 2011.       

51
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:52,243
         A couple of my friends,

52
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,846
  we got together and we decided
        to open up a restaurant.

53
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:55,914
         Concept just came along

54
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,516
                 of welding     
       a bunch of junk together.

55
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,518
  Started welding.              
          Krazy Fish came about.

56
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,253
        The name embodies       
  kind of the food combinations 

57
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,188
         they make here.        

58
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,523
MAN: Blackened catfish.         

59
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,391
     It brings a little bit     
   of the coast to Charlotte.   

60
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:09,127
   From the Thai curry snapper  
         to the mussels.        

61
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,597
      FIERI: To a loaded up

        all put together.       

64
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:18,604
          We got our gumbo here.

65
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,606
And were starting off           
  with a pork butt.             

66
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:23,141
         Rub it down, slap it up
   with some Jamaican jerk here.

67
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,343
                I know a guy    
     that knows a guy in Jamaica

68
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:26,611
            that sends it to me.
   I know a guy...              

69
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,348
  How long is this              
gonna go in the oven?           
       About four or five hours.

70
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,548
              Start it at 350,  

71
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,217
           and then drop it down
              to about 100, 150 

72
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,218
        for the rest of the way.

73
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,954
             Throw it over here.
     Over here.                 

74
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:38,156
      Look at that pork there --
                 beautiful.     
   Oh, you know!                

75
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,825
             Put it in the bowl,
               ready to go in.  

76
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,426
          So we're gonna turn on
             our pot over here. 

77
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:42,827
               Hit it up with   
            a little bit of oil.

78
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,562
          Gonna add our chicken,

79
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,897
          throw some Cajun spice
                  in there.     

80
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,299
                Stir that up    
                a little bit.   

81
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,368
         And we're getting ready
  to throw our shrimps in there.

82
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,570
    Shrimps?                    
      Shrimps are shrimps, baby!

83
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:52,771
                 [ Laughs ]     

84
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,039
                 We're gonna    
             add the pork to it 

85
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,974
              and let this keep 
                cooking down.   

86
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,309
              Oil in a hot pot. 

87
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,177
     Take our onions, peppers --

88
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,380
        <i> babarol,</i> we call these.
     <i> Babarol!</i>                  

89
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:02,981
              Throw some celery 
                  in there.     

90
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,316
               <i> Babarol</i> again.  

91
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:05,784
           Little bit of garlic.
  Okay, there we go.            

92
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:08,052
            Throw that in there.
      That guy.                 

93
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,454
           That guy right there.

94
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,389
Welcome to the Rocky Balboa     
   cooking hour --              

95
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,524
             live at Krazy Fish.

96
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,594
We getting any okra in here?    
      We don't put okra in ours.

97
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:18,063
          We put cactus in ours,
                    huh?        

98
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,131
                The way we do   
              our cactus here,  

99
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,601
         we take it, we boil it,
           let it sit overnight.

100
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,269
                The next day,   
                we sauté it.    

101
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,270
           Gonna add some thyme.

102
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,139
               And I'll throw   
            some curry in there.

103
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:29,141
     My favorite                
  gumbo ingredient!             

104
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:31,876
             Some garam masala. 
     Yeah, garam masala.        

105
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,012
     And a bunch                
  of chicken base.              

106
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,014
                And then add    
   a gallon and a half of water.

107
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,415
               And then we add  
                our tomatoes.   

108
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,483
        Let that come to a boil.

109
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,287
          All right, after that,
  we're gonna add our roux here.

110
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,289
That's a good-looking roux.     
            Smells like popcorn.

111
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,357
 And it makes you want to eat it
             when you smell it. 

112
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,893
         Gonna take our chicken,
           pork, and our shrimp,

113
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,295
              toss it in there. 

114
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,030
        Gonna let this cook down
 real good for about 30 minutes.

115
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,164
  Cook it up nice.              
                      Mm-hmm.   

116
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,101
              I'll bowl this up 
             for you right here.

117
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,236
                 Badda-bing,    
            right there for you.

118
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,405
        Yeah!                   
Now you're scaring me.          

119
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,110
        Mmm!                    
The flavor's fantastic.         

120
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,377
 It's not too runny.            

121
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,445
The rice tightens things up,    

122
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,114
   got a good mix               
of peppers and onions,          

123
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,248
  nice garlic pop.              

124
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,416
I do enjoy the cactus.          

125
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,320
     Real deal.                 

126
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,822
Crazy, but real deal.           

127
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:20,259
      This is great gumbo.      

128
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,461
      The sauce is amazing.     

129
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,062
             WOMAN:             
      Lots of bold flavors.     

130
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,364
   Everything has a little bit  
        of a kick to it.        

131
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,400
     Kind of a funky place.     

132
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:30,068
        Definitely crazy.       

133
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,671
         Yeah, there's a mermaid
      with a dustpan for a tail.
          [ Laughter ]          

134
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,072
                  That's...     
     Crazy.                     

135
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,141
      MAN: Love the decor,      
        love the people,        

136
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:37,876
          and the food          
    is excellent every time.    

137
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,745
        And your seafood diablo.

138
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:40,545
  This right here.              
                 The diablo?    

139
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,813
 Get it every time.             

140
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,749
There's a lot in this --        
a lot of shrimp, scallops.      

141
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,419
 PRISCO: Okay, we're gonna start
             our seafood diablo.

142
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:48,486
                 <i> Bellissimo.</i>   
    Yeah!                       

143
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,622
              Butter in there,  
          get that nice and hot.

144
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,692
           We're gonna throw our
       cebolla in there, onions.

145
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:56,227
            Our green peppers   
            and our red peppers.
            Get that going.     

146
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,030
            Then we're gonna add
          our scallops in there.

147
00:04:58,032 --> 00:04:59,631
             Then we take our...
     Shrimps.                   

148
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,899
                  Shrimps.      
Now you got me saying it.       

149
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,033
                There you go.   

150
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,769
     Then we take our mahi-mahi,
                 fresh cut.     

151
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,704
           And we're gonna start
             adding our spices. 

152
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,172
            We add our sriracha.

153
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,041
     We add our Valentina sauce.

154
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,311
Oh, you're taking a little      
Mexican to it, okay.            
                   Oh, yeah.    

155
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:15,113
       We got the chipotle next.
  <i> Chipotle adobo!</i>              

156
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,848
                Salt and pep.   
  And lots of that.             

157
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,916
              Our Cajun spice.  

158
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,718
     We're gonna add our garlic.

159
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,186
        Nice.                   
                   Beautiful.   

160
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,788
         Gonna add our turmeric.

161
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,656
            A little bit of sug.

162
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,592
               Half and half,   
              some heavy cream. 

163
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,127
    Oh, hang on.                
I'll get you the kitchen sink.  

164
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,595
That's the only thing           
    not in there.               

165
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:32,664
                Plate it up.    

166
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,233
                 Couple nice    
           flour tortillas here.

167
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,937
    Throw some scallions on top,
                some cilanch.   

168
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,405
        Cilanch!                
                 There we go.   

169
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,941
     The dish is gonna knock you
               to the ground.   

170
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:46,678
Knock me to the ground.         
                     Yes.       

171
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,013
It's got a nice little bit      
      of heat.                  

172
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,349
It's definitely rich.           

173
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,484
   Tons of flavor.              
I mean, no question.            

174
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,020
    I understand                
why it's called Krazy Fish.     

175
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,691
                   Booya!       
  Perfect example.              

176
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,627
   The spice in it is perfect,  
  good blend of curry flavors.  

177
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,763
 You know, it all comes together
        in a great dish.        

178
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:06,364
        I like everything       
        about this place.       

179
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,832
Pulled pork tacos up!           

180
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,634
                Now you know    
       where the name came from.
     Yeah.                      

181
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,035
             One word -- crazy. 

182
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,904
     With a "K."                

183
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,306
      A fun place to come.      

184
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:16,241
You put a ton of enthusiasm,    
  a ton of energy,              

185
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:17,509
 a ton of respect --            

186
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,377
 the way you run it,            
the way you decorate it.        

187
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,246
  Got to come down              
    for the show.               

188
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,548
               Ah, very crazy.  
    Oh! Hey, ho!                

189
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:29,053
             FIERI:             
Coming up, a Korean-German combo
       in Los Angeles....       

190
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,121
  Spot-on, brother.             

191
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,923
         ....Where beer         
        makes the bird...       

192
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,326
   Holy cooked up               
    glazed bird!                

193
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,993
And there's a lot more than beef
        in their burgers.       

194
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,462
I could eat one of those        
     every day.                 

195
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:48,273
     So I'm here on the edge    
  of Koreatown in Los Angeles,  

196
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,074
      right down the street     
        from Beer Belly,        

197
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,676
      remember that place?      
          The duck? Oh!         

198
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,745
  Anyhow, I'm here to check out 
     this Korean restaurant     

199
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,947
        where they've got       
   the traditional environment  

200
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,015
   and the traditional menu --  

201
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,082
 [ Needle scratches on record ] 

202
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,351
          Not so much.          

203
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:01,486
    No, this is Biergarten --   
  fusion grill and craft beer.  

204
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:02,754
             German fried rice! 

205
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,357
  I've never seen Korean-German 
       combination before.      

206
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:08,026
   It's food that, literally,   
  you can't get anywhere else.  

207
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,895
            Korean fried chicken
             with French toast. 

208
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:12,898
  Koreatown obviously has a lot 
   of different fusion places.  

209
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,499
     Not German and Korean.     

210
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,634
   FIERI: But that didn't stop  
         owner Neil Kwon        

211
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,836
    from playing matchmaker.    

212
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,838
  kimchi short rib              
     fried rice.                

213
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,105
                What gave you   
           the inspiration to do

214
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,708
               a Korean fusion  
         funky craft beer joint?

215
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,778
   After college,               
we backpacked through Europe.   

216
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,045
One of the stops, Germany.      

217
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,248
    If anything,                
I wanted to capture that vibe.  

218
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,517
          With the help         
       of Chef Eddie Hah,       

219
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,386
  who started mixing things up  
     in the kitchen in 2011.    

220
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,788
         HAH: One tempura fries.

221
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,989
              MAN:              
    He's extremely passionate   

222
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,324
        about everything        
       he's serving here.       

223
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,992
             Drunken chicken C3.

224
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:44,061
   It's called drunken chicken  
 because they brine it in beer. 

225
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,864
      MAN: It's very moist.     
    Got a great crust on it.    

226
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,265
          Just perfect.         

227
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,868
What are we making?             
               The beer brine   
        for the drunken chicken.

228
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,870
       Is that                  
a typical Korean dish?          
                No, it's not.   

229
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:53,605
      I dig it.                 
 Let's get after it.            
                  All right.    

230
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:54,739
             I'm gonna go ahead 
        and put the Korean beer.

231
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:55,940
                    <i> Hai!</i>       
    <i> Hai!</i> Right.                

232
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,944
     Water. We're gonna go ahead
    and put that honey in there.

233
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,147
                Some parsley.   
                Half lemons.    

234
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,214
   A lot of them.               
              A lot of them.    

235
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,416
           And garlic -- peeled.

236
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:05,817
             Add some bay leaf. 

237
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,686
Bay leaf, a Korean food?        
                       No.      

238
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:08,753
   Just checking.               

239
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,288
                Dry oregano,    
              some kosher salt, 

240
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,023
          and some black pepper.

241
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,157
Fire it up and then...          

242
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,893
              then we'll brine. 
    Yeah.                       

243
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,161
                  Give that     
               a little stir.   

244
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,497
Harry Potter called,            
 he wants his spoon.            

245
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:19,965
             Basically, we just 
      want the salt to dissolve.

246
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,433
   Salt dissolves,              
bring the flavors together,     

247
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:23,435
and that's our brine            
that we're gonna use            
for our chicken.                

248
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:24,769
                    Yes.        
      Okay.                     

249
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,038
  So we have our brine here now,
             it's at room temp. 

250
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,439
         It smells a little like
                a sweet tea.    

251
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,975
         You want to smell that?
 No, I'll smell it,             

252
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:32,444
and then you'll probably        
push my head in there.          
                  [ Laughs ]    

253
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:35,179
            We're gonna go ahead
            and add the chicken.
Down into the party bowl.       

254
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,649
And how long are we gonna       
  hold the chicken?             
                About 24 hours. 

255
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,517
                   So now       
         that these have brined,

256
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,252
        we're gonna add the beer
                to the stems.   

257
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,653
And what kind of beer           
      is this?                  

258
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:43,989
                   This is      
           a Guinness, actually.

259
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,323
       This is                  
 a dark stout, okay.            

260
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,191
And then I'm just gonna go ahead
              and pat this dry, 

261
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,728
   I'll go ahead and season with
     salt, pepper, and some oil.

262
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,063
          Push the chicken down,
          right into the cavity,

263
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,299
              and into the oven 
            at about 400 degrees

264
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,468
           for about 35 minutes.
       Got it.                  

265
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,936
   Holy cooked up               
    glazed bird!                

266
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,472
 That's impressive!             

267
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:02,139
                I'm gonna cut   
          right down the center,

268
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,475
             and we'll go ahead 
               and plate that   

269
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,276
                  with our      
            cabbage frisee salad

270
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,280
   and garnish it with a pickled
    jalapeno and pickled diakon.

271
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,715
All right, and that's it?       
                  That's it.    

272
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,153
         Oh!                    

273
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,821
    We like to do               
  beer can chicken,             

274
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,624
but I don't think I've ever     
had one that's infused          

275
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,559
and has this much flavor        
      of beer.                  

276
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,230
You get some of that nice       
roasted flavor from the skin,   

277
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:29,100
    then you get                
a little bite of that slaw...   

278
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,836
    A little bite               
  of that jalapeno.             

279
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:32,970
        Mmm!                    

280
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,438
 Chef, nicely done.             
              Thank you, Chef.  

281
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,507
     MAN: The skin's crispy,    
        the meat's juicy.       

282
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,376
            I get it            
     every time I come here.    

283
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,312
   These are three of my buddies
     from "Guy's Grocery Games,"

284
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:42,046
      Eric, Gabe, and Francesco.

285
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,581
              What do you think 
               of the chicken?  

286
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,317
It's so flavorful.              
Like, I didn't think it         
would be this flavorful.        

287
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,253
     The beer, the honey --     
          it's perfect.         

288
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,656
     It's silly                 
  how juicy it is.              

289
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:55,126
                 It's silly     
              how juicy it is?  
    Yeah.                       

290
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,861
             How do you describe
             the menu to people?

291
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:59,064
Oh, man, just anything          
   and everything               

292
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,531
that pairs well with beer.      

293
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,201
      FIERI: That would be      
     25 types of craft beer,    

294
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,803
   tapped alongside everything  

295
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:07,605
      from kimchi pancakes      
      to German sausage...      

296
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,340
            One wurstplatte, C5.

297
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,077
      ...And a unique take      
         on the burger.         

298
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,745
            The meat            
      is completely unique      

299
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,814
       to any other burger      
         in Los Angeles.        

300
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:16,814
     All right,                 
what are we making next?        

301
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,949
             The Chosun burger. 

302
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,951
         "Chosun" actually means
             "Korea" in Korean. 

303
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,686
 Why didn't you just            
    say "Korea"?                

304
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:24,155
       I wanted it to sound like
         it's the chosen burger.

305
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,490
       Is that                  
what you were going for?        

306
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,025
                Yeah, that's    
           what I was going for.
      Gangster.                 

307
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,759
        I'm making some kimchi. 
    All right.                  

308
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,494
              We're gonna halve 
              the napa cabbage. 

309
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,296
        Salt?                   
            Four cups of salt.  

310
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,033
   So this is like              
   quick kimchi?                
            It's somewhat quick.

311
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,569
        The cabbage will now sit
      at room temp for 24 hours.

312
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:39,437
We're gonna bring it back,      
      rinse it,                 

313
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,038
   and then hit it              
   with the paste.              

314
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,173
             Yeah. kimchi paste.

315
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,374
              We'll start with  
           a little bit of water

316
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,642
               and then onion.  

317
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,511
             Red pepper flakes, 
             fish sauce, sugar, 

318
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,380
         garlic -- whole garlic.
  Lots of it.                   

319
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:49,714
         Lots of it. And ginger.

320
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:50,949
                Baby shrimp.    
                 Pulse this.    

321
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,251
            Add the Korean pear.
      Pear?                     

322
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,986
           You want to try that?

323
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,187
    That's good.                
                    Delicious.  

324
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,322
More like apple.                
     Add the Korean radish next.

325
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,924
  So blend this up.             

326
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,860
Now we take that,               
and we're gonna brush           
it onto each leaf.              

327
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:02,927
                 Each leaf.     

328
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,328
      We're gonna let it sit out
                for 24 hours,   

329
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,530
              and then throw it 
                into the wok.   

330
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,799
  So it gets funky,             
and then it's chili funky.      

331
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,066
                Chili funky.    
      Okay.                     

332
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,269
All right, now we're into       
the Chosun One burger.          

333
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:14,072
We have a patty that we do 50/50
             with beef and pork,

334
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,873
                 and we add     
           a little bit of tofu,

335
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,141
        which is a Korean thing,
                  actually.     

336
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,277
  So now it's 110%              
                       110%.    

337
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,280
    So that's it?               
And salt, pepper on the outside.

338
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,215
               Onto the grill.  
     Fantastic.                 

339
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,618
            We're gonna add some
     grilled Spam, Korean bacon.

340
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,685
    Korean bacon!               

341
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,687
                 All right,     
           we're gonna start off

342
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,556
    with a little bit of mustard
             on the bottom bun. 

343
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,758
            Then we're gonna add
     some of our sautéed kimchi.

344
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,361
So you are allowed to cook      
kimchi after you've done it.    

345
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,363
               It gets better   
             when you sauté it. 
     Really?!                   

346
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,564
             Yeah. Man, it does.
       Okay.                    

347
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:40,699
            The hamburger patty.

348
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,032
               A little bit of  
             the pickled diakon.

349
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,234
              Red pepper aioli. 

350
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,969
            We're gonna go ahead
              and add the Spam. 

351
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:45,970
   And some fries.              

352
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:47,238
 What's the coating             
     on the fry?                

353
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,740
                It's a little   
               tempura batter.  

354
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:54,179
        Mmm!                    
If someone were to say,         

355
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:57,782
"I'm gonna make you a hamburger,
but I'm gonna Korean-ize it,"   

356
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:58,783
that's what that is.            

357
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,518
Great texture, a lot of meat,   

358
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,054
acid, sweet, crunch,            
     all there.                 

359
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,124
Mmm! Awesome burger.            
                   Thank you.   

360
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,458
I could eat one of those        
     every day.                 

361
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,793
              MAN:              
      The patty is unique.      

362
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,394
   It just really falls apart   
      when you take a bite.     

363
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,530
  It's one of the best burgers  
        in L.A., easily.        

364
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,466
     This is my buddy Skrape    
          from TapouT,          

365
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:17,134
         Julian Edelman,        
  number 11 from the Patriots.  

366
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,204
   You got a funky biergarten   
          in Koreatown.         

367
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:20,070
         Break it down.         

368
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,673
       Tell me                  
what's in this first.           

369
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:23,941
It's good. I don't know         
what's in it, but it's good.    

370
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,677
       So Julian and I do       
         a great program        

371
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,279
      called "Best Buddies"     
    in Boston with Tom Brady,   

372
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,815
     helping intellectually     
        disabled adults.        

373
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,684
  In your regiment of training  
         for the season,        

374
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:34,552
    this is the kind of food    
     you're allowed to eat?     

375
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:37,155
  Yeah. You know, a complex carb
               with the rice,   

376
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,222
              High in protein.  

377
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,558
        I'd say it's pretty much
                a great meal.   

378
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,561
   You will leave full, happy,  
        and comfortable.        

379
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:46,697
       FIERI:                   
You want a funky joint,         
great beer, eclectic menu --    

380
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,967
 come see this guy.             

381
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,301
              Thank you, Chef.  
   Spot-on, brother.            

382
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,705
  FIERI: Up next, in Charlotte, 
        North Carolina...       

383
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,307
              Boy, the flavor's 
               nice in there.   

384
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,042
         ...A real deal         
      home-style hangout...     

385
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,644
          I've got a spotter now
                 when I eat.    

386
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,045
          ...Right down         
         to the dessert.        

387
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,413
                I want, like,   
              16 of them to go. 

388
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,122
 So a lot of people don't know, 

389
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,658
  but my mom, Penny, was raised 
     here in North Carolina.    

390
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,592
       I love coming back.      

391
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,327
             I mean,            
    there's so much history.    

392
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,329
      So I'm in Charlotte.      
       And you know what?       

393
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,597
      To find a restaurant      

394
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,333
          in a building         
that was built in the year 1900,

395
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,400
    that's pretty incredible.   

396
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,669
     What's more incredible     

397
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,337
         is that you got        
   a mother and daughter team   

398
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,673
       that are serving up      
 an eclectic scratch-made menu. 

399
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,308
        This is 300 East.       

400
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,814
        French onion soup       
        is in the window.       

401
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,617
   300 East is about the most   
    welcoming place in town.    

402
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,352
              The sweet potato  
                  ravioli.      

403
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,888
        My favorite thing       
       changes every week.      

404
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,489
      Entrée crab cake up.      

405
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,625
 Everything you eat             
     is unique.                 

406
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,560
      It's like                 
a classic American menu         

407
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,295
      with some                 
  kind of surprise.             

408
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,231
   FIERI: Which is no surprise  
         to the locals,         

409
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:57,301
   'cause owner Cathy Coulter   
   opened doors in this house   

410
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,770
        way back in 1986.       

411
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,571
                The building    
          is from the year 1900.

412
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,506
             Is that a big deal 
                  to folks?     

413
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,043
      It is because so many     
  of Charlotte's old buildings  

414
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,110
      have been torn down.      

415
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,312
             FIERI:             
   But Cathy prefers to build.  

416
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,648
     So in 2000, she brought    
       in daughter Ashley       

417
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,450
       as general manager       
        and pastry chef.        

418
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:13,651
    Chocolate bread pudding.    

419
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,920
       FIERI: And in 2001,      
      Chef Kristine Schmidt     

420
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:19,190
      came on to spearhead      
   the savory side of things.   

421
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,091
    Lamb and mushroom ragout    
         in the window.         

422
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,528
       It's a hearty dish.      
      You'll fill up on it.     

423
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,595
      And what do we start with,
                leg of lamb?    

424
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,065
   SCHMIDT: Yeah,               
boneless leg of lamb here.      

425
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:30,101
You want to pour a little bit   
of olive oil in that pan?       
                     I got you. 

426
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,804
                 All right,     
             so we drop this in.

427
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,006
                We sear this    
               on both sides.   

428
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,674
I'm gonna season this.          
             Salt and pepper.   

429
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,075
     We're ready                
  for the braising.             

430
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,745
A little bit of onion in,       
  carrots, celery.              

431
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:46,350
Some whole garlic cloves.       
            I'm down with it.   

432
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,086
Some fresh thyme sprigs.        

433
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,088
                   S. and P.?   
     Got to get                 
that flavor in there.           

434
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,489
Nice bottle of wine.

That's very elegant.            
                        Yes.    

541
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:51,062
Well, it's those sausage fingers
             that say elegance. 

542
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:54,932
           So these are gonna go
    for 18 minutes at what temp?
  350.                          

543
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,601
              When are we gonna 
             make the ice cream?
      Let's do it.              

544
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:59,003
  We're gonna melt              
some unsalted butter            

545
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,404
and some brown sugar.           

546
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,607
     Heavy cream                
   and whole milk.              

547
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,675
      That's coming to a simmer.
                What's next?    

548
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:09,680
So then we take some egg yolks, 
brown sugar, and salt.          

549
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:12,282
               And we're gonna  
               temper this in?  
    We are.                     

550
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:15,152
So you pour in about            
1/3 of the hot cream.           

551
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,288
  So then this can              
  just go back in.              

552
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:21,225
It needs to get up to           
      175, 180.                 

553
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:24,162
  I will strain it,             
put it in an ice-bath,          

554
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,897
and then we add the vanilla.    
             Let this cool down.

555
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,565
             It doesn't have to 
             be ice-cold, right?

556
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,366
It needs to be ice-cold.        
        It's got to be ice-cold,

557
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,367
         just what I was saying.

558
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,702
              And then we'll go 
               to the machine.  

559
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,307
  So the ice cream              
     is churned.                

560
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,641
              Scoop it all out. 

561
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,644
And it needs to firm up.        

562
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,845
            Can I lick the bowl?
   Sure. Go for it.             

563
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,047
     [ Laughs ]                 

564
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,718
So now this goes in the freezer 
   for four hours.              

565
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,855
   All right. Cookies are ready,
             ice cream's ready. 

566
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,023
                   Hit it.      

567
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,328
   And some of our              
caramelized pineapple,          

568
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,863
  nasturtium petal.             

569
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,199
               That's pretty.   
     Thank you.                 

570
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:08,138
           Mmm. That is probably
        one of the best desserts

571
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,142
                I've ever had   
               on "Triple D."   
     Oh, thanks.                

572
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:12,476
          This is the definition

573
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,445
     of how ice cream sandwiches
                  started.      

574
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,949
       Make the cookie yourself,
                outstanding.    

575
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:19,150
         Ice cream is delicious.

576
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:21,151
       The whole presentation --
                  dynamite.     

577
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,553
  Thank you.                    
                I want, like,   
              16 of them to go. 

578
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,889
   Awesome. Done.               

579
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,557
       Ice cream sandwich       
         in the window.         

580
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,027
  It's creamy and scrumptious.  
      Just close to heaven.     

581
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:31,495
     And the ahi tuna salad.    

582
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:34,498
 It's a really cool melting pot 
          in every way.         

583
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,233
             What a great place.

584
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,902
             Eclectic, creative,
           and the food's great.

585

           Thank you.           
                    Good job.   

586
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,908
        So, that's it for       
   this trip, but don't worry.
