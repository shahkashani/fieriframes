113
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,062
 Nice biscuit.                  
                   There you go.

114
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,797
               Give it a nice,  
                little toast.   

115
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,734
   We're gonna make two patties 
   and cook this on the flattop.

116
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:32,804
      We toasted the biscuit up.
                Sausage here.   

117
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,674
          Now we put our sausage
            and gravy on there. 

118
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,079
            Fresh green parsley.

119

Oh, what happened               
to yours, Robert?               

121
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,021
  It's like a fight             
  to get in there.              

122
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,694
The cheddar in the biscuit      
     is bananas.                

123
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,295
 Then on top of it,             
 the sausage patty.             

124
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,297
 But you know what?             

125
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,232
  It's that sambal              
in that sausage patty           

126
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,501
 that just gives it             
a little bit of that extra heat.

127
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,904
                    Yep.

 The gravy's creamy.

       not dry and gritty.

It's thick and pretty.

          it's amazing.

        I don't eat fat,

135

 called From Scratch            
in Carmel, California.          

156
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,173
      We needed                 
that entire commercial break    

157
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:19,377
 just to come out of            
the food [exhales sharply] coma.

158
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,512
       Speak for yourself.      

159
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:22,847
      I was doing push-ups      
         and star jumps.        

160
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,182

  All right, Chef,              
 what are we making?            

163
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,589
   We're gonna make From Scratch
               brisket chili.   

164
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:35,460
       The meat is tender       
  and the right blend of spicy. 

165
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:38,663
               WOMAN:           
   If I could make chili, I wish
     I could make it like this. 

166
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,399
                It's amazing.   

167
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:42,801
                  We start      
            with a full brisket.

168
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,936
   Doctor. Doctor.              

169
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,672
        And we're gonna cube it 
  and go with the one-inch cube.

170
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,073
       Dig it.

                that we make.   

172
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,479
          When we cook,         
    we layer flavors, right?    

173
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:57,415
      This is important --      
to season every step of the way.

174
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,550
All right, let's go.            

175
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,019
             We're gonna sear it
               on the flattop.  
Okay.                           

176
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,488
Okay, so, now you got it        
browned all the way around.     

177
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,491
  Now we'll hit it              
with a little onion.            

178
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,160
Caramelize those a bit.         

179
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:10,828
                    Yep.        
Now where are we at?            

180
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,031
         Well, we're gonna build
                 our chili.     
Hit it.                         

181
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,966
       We'll start off with our 
       fresh-made chicken stock.

182
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:18,035
          We got the beef stock.

183
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,238
                  Chili powder  
                that we blended.
That you made yourself.         

184
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,840
        Chicken base, beef base,

185
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:24,309
             granulated garlic, 
             granulated onion.  

186
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:27,312
           Fresh, toasted cumin.
                Cocoa powder.   

187
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,381
You got to have a little        
chocolate in the bottom of      
that. I'll give it to you.      

188
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:30,715
               Chopped garlic.  

189
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,852
 Seared-off brisket             
  with the onions.              

190
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,386
              Crushed tomatoes. 

191
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,988
                Tomato paste.   

192
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,924
          A little raisin paste.
Okay.                           

193
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:40,858
                  And then      
             we'll add one beer.

194
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,793
        We'll let that cook down
                a little bit.   

195
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,628
How long?                       
                    For an hour.

196
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,264
             Plate up our chili.
   Okay.                        

197
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,200
                I'm gonna use   
              red kidney beans. 

198
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:49,601
From dry. I love that.          

199
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,010
           Incredible.          

200
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,279
   It's rich. It's flavorful.   

201
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,481
 The meat's tender,             
but you find the meat.          

202
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,684
              Right, and that's 
          why you cube it large.

203
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,619
  You taste the little sweetness
        of the raisin in there, 

204
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,554
             just counterbalance
                 that heat.     

205
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,089
I get a couple levels           
    of sweetness.               

206
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,692
That's a phenomenal chili.      
                  Thank you.    

207
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,594
      Just the right amount     
            of heat.            

208
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,031
We're gonna have to go to       
the gym after this, aren't we?  
                 Yep.           

209
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,967
   Brisket chili.               

210
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,703
 MAN: I like it because it's got
    big chunks of meat in it.   

211
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:25,803
     They don't play around.    

212
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,372
    WOMAN: It's not too hot,    
         but it's spicy.        

213
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,774
  It's the best chili I've had. 

214
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:32,110
Chef, had a great time.         
               Thank you, Guy.  

215
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,579
 And he's gonna send me some of 
     the biscuits and gravy.    

216
