1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,334
     Hey, everybody, I'm Guy    
  Fieri, and we're rolling out, 

2
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:06,004
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

3
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:06,605
           This trip--          

4
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:07,473
    It's like shake and bake.   

5
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,074
              Yeah.             

6
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:10,676
      The Camaro's taking a     
 detour-- a where, with, what-- 

7
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:13,478
       to joints a little       
      off the beaten path.      

8
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,547
  I want more of that all day.  

9
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,616
    Like East Coast Canadian    
       cuisine in Ottawa--      

10
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:19,551
 this is a handful right here-- 

11
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,487
          one-of-a-kind         
      sandwiches in Reno--      

12
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,756
       look at this-- and       
        a righteous spot        

13
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:26,825
     in Richmond, Virginia--    
      it is so delicious--      

14
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:29,561
    serving a one-way ticket    
       to Jamaica, "mon."       

15
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,431
      This is the dish that     
    should be torturing you.    

16
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,367
     That's all right here,     
     right now, on "Diners,     

17
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,169
     Drive-Ins, and Dives."     

18
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,072
          [theme music]         

19
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:50,982
   And I got to be honest with  
     you, before "Triple D,"    

20
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,653
  I can't say that I had a lot  
   of curried goat or oxtails,  

21
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:55,720
        or Jamaican food        
        for that matter.        

22
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:56,855
         I mean, not out        
       on the West Coast,       

23
00:00:56,957 --> 00:01:00,525
   but once I got a taste for   
   it, oh, I have been hooked.  

24
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,127
      So I'm right outside      
     of Richmond, Virginia,     

25
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,596
    in Chesterfield, to check   
     out a joint everybody's    

26
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:07,332
   talking about, and they're   
    serving up my favorites.    

27
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,269
        This is Carena's        
        Jamaican Grille.        

28
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:11,669
         [vibrant music]        

29
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,605
      Gonna need some goat.     

30
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:16,474
  Carena has put Jamaica right  
    in the heart of Richmond.   

31
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:18,143
         Shrimp Rundown         
       with rice and peas.      

32
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,144
         I am addicted.         

33
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:20,879
     GUY FIERI: And he's not    
      the only one hooked.      

34
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,681
    After Carena Ives started   
  serving the food she grew up  

35
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,484
 with at her first spot in '94--

36
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:26,885
       Pick up, let's go!       

37
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,620
      GUY FIERI: --she felt     
      the demand to expand      

38
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:31,022
    into this joint in 2007.    

39
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,891
     Customers kept begging     
     for a bigger location.     

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,160
     I just had a gentleman     
   stop me in the parking lot,  

41
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:36,695
     and he says, oh man, I     
    love going to that place,   

42
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,030
      and it's packed, and      
      the food's so great.      

43
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:41,566
      Carena's does a great     
   job with her stewed dishes,  

44
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:42,968
     especially the oxtail.     

45
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:43,902
          Oxtail lunch.         

46
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:46,371
        You can't come to       
      a Jamaican restaurant     

47
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,572
   without trying the oxtail.   

48
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:49,040
         It is the bomb.        

49
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,908
     This isn't from an ox.     

50
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,643
        It's from a cow.        
      - It's the best part.     

51
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,644
  What are we gonna do with it? 

52
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,179
     We start our marinade.     

53
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:54,713
     Scotch bonnet peppers--    

54
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:55,781
       GUY FIERI: Got it.       

55
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:56,982
      --and yellow onions,      
    and then this is a little   

56
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,452
bit of adobo, thyme, garlic, and
 a little bit of Worcestershire.

57
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:02,521
         And how long is        
      this gonna marinate?      

58
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:03,721
       For about 24 hours.      

59
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,657
       Vegetable oil goes       
        in our pan here,        

60
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:06,725
  but we're gonna sear it off.  

61
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:07,593
     GUY FIERI: And what are    
     we gonna braise it in?     

62
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:08,727
    CARENA IVES: Plain water.   

63
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:12,130
     Water is gonna make the    
   foundation of this oxtail?   

64
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:12,530
              Yes.              

65
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,465
              Huh.              

66
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:14,599
        About how long is       
       this gonna go for?       

67
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:15,934
        About two hours.        

68
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:16,602
           Here we go.          

69
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,470
   It's been doing its thing.   

70
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,338
     We're nice and tender.     

71
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,339
         GUY FIERI: OK.         

72
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,540
        A little bit more       
    onions and peppers go in,   

73
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,009
     scallions, and a little    
     bit more Scotch bonnet.    

74
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:24,810
        And I'm not gonna       
         go all the way.        

75
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,478
         Oh, go all the         
      way, it's you and me      

76
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,345
           All right.           

77
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:28,347
    And some stewed tomatoes.   

78
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,548
      GUY FIERI: And where      
     did you learn all this?    

79
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:30,749
          - My mother.          
          - I love it.          

80
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,619
       Thyme and a little       
         bit more adobo.        

81
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,620
       We'll let it simmer      
      for about 20 minutes,     

82
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,489
     then we'll add slurry,     
        flour and water.        

83
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,291
      GUY FIERI: So what's      
    going on with the beans?    

84
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,292
     Those are butter beans.    

85
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,560
        Smells fantastic.       

86
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:42,427
              Mmm.              

87
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:43,494
     CARENA IVES: That's it.    

88
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:44,563
         OK, we get into        
       the rice and beans?      

89
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:45,763
              Yes.              

90
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,700
    Small red beans, water to   
  cover, bay leaf, a little bit 

91
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,502
       of onion, allspice.      

92
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,637
       This is sort of the      
     big component of jerk.     

93
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,705
        Thyme and garlic.       

94
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:54,840
      GUY FIERI: We're just     
    gonna keep adding stuff?    

95
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,842
      Oh yeah, and you know     
    what else we need to do?    

96
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,710
      Towel, kitchen towel      
         needs to go in.        

97
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,646
        Then we're gonna        
      also build the rice?      

98
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:01,713
      CARENA IVES: Coconut      
          milk goes in.         

99
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,649
  This is what's gonna give it  
   its nice, creamy richness.   

100
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:04,916
    A little bit more thyme--   

101
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,251
 Boy, this thyme is taking up-- 

102
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:06,652
        Yes, some thyme.        

103
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:07,586
        --a lot of time.        

104
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,920
 CARENA IVES: And some scallion.

105
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:09,854
      Just big ol' massive      
        pieces like that?       

106
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,056
              Yes.              

107
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,724
    These are Scotch bonnets,   
  and we'll just break it open. 

108
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,459
           - OK, good.          
      - Put that in there.      

109
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,394
              Rice.             

110
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,061
          Is there any          
      measurement going on?     

111
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:16,728
            Oh, why?            

112
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,997
  This is just pour, dump, add? 

113
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:19,865
 CARENA IVES: You kind of feel. 

114
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,600
         Oh yeah, that's        
       how I always do it.      

115
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:22,600
   So this is gonna cook down?  

116
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:23,735
      CARENA IVES: And then     
       we're gonna plate.       

117
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:24,936
    And here comes your tail.   

118
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,072
      GUY FIERI: So a nice      
      little gravy, beans.      

119
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:29,675
  Now, is it proper to pick it  
 up and eat it with your hands? 

120
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:32,744
     The best way to do it.     

121
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:36,414
   This is the dish right now   
  that should be torturing you. 

122
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,483
       It is so delicious.      

123
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,286
   You get the tenderness, but  
    the chew, of the oxtail.    

124
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:42,421
         It's luscious.         

125
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:42,821
           It's tangy.          

126
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:43,821
           It's meaty.          

127
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:46,024
    Just soaking up all that    
     gravy, all that sauce.     

128
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:53,632
    That slow-mo is for you.    

129
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,833
 Got oxtail with rice and peas. 

130
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,770
  The flavor and the tenderness 
     is right on the money.     

131
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:01,173
  I suck the meat off the bone. 

132
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:01,906
         It's that good.        

133
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:02,574
           Fantastic.           

134
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:03,708
 I can't give it a better word. 

135
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,644
    GUY FIERI: The killer is    
   the rice and peas on there.  

136
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,379
  I want more of that all day.  

137
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,379
           Tremendous.          

138
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,048
  Whole Red Snapper Escoveitch. 

139
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:10,582
            Pick up!            

140
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,717
      Are you from Jamaica?     

141
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:12,784
         Born and bred.         

142
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,586
  Is this a good representation 
        of Jamaican food?       

143
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,721
           Absolutely.          

144
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,391
    CUSTOMER: In Jamaica, we    
     like the hot, the curry    

145
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,726
     that we have, the jerk.    

146
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,794
  Those are like bold flavors.  

147
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:23,929
       We are bold people.      

148
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:27,332
    We love adding ginger to    
 our juices, to our seasonings. 

149
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,666
    Island Fried on the line!   

150
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,403
        I love the Island       
      Fried Chicken, mostly     

151
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,737
  because of the ginger gravy.  

152
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,406
 You can't get it anywhere else.

153
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,606
           We're doing          
      another gravy thing?      

154
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:36,742
     Yes, because the rice--    

155
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,477
    It's not swimsuit season.   

156
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,344
      It's not swimsuits--      

157
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:40,746
         --loves gravy.         

158
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,814
        We start with the       
      garlic, black pepper,     

159
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:46,684
  salt, onion powder, rosemary, 
   cayenne for a little kick.   

160
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,686
  Dry rub this on the chicken.  

161
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:48,887
 How long is this gonna set up? 

162
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,624
  24 hours, so they can get to  
 know each other, be roommates. 

163
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,559
      Been In the kitchen a     
 little too long there, sister. 

164
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,560
             I know.            

165
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,628
        Starting to talk        
         to the chicken.        

166
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,628
             I know.            

167
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:58,764
      Dredge them in flour,     
        salt, and pepper.       

168
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:00,632
      A whole breast and a      
      whole thigh and drum?     

169
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,700
  CARENA IVES: And it goes into 
 our fryer for about 20 minutes.

170
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,768
       GUY FIERI: Got it.       

171
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:04,969
         So we're gonna         
        make this gravy.        

172
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:08,640
  A little bit of oil goes in,  
   garlic, some sliced onion,   

173
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,975
        stewed tomatoes.        

174
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:10,776
        A lot of ginger.        

175
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:13,378
        The brown sugar,        
      thyme, and bay leaf.      

176
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,046
       Now, you house-make      
       the chicken stock?       

177
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:15,781
              Yes.              

178
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:16,648
       When do the Scotch       
         bonnets go in?         

179
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,782
     Put them in right now.     

180
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:20,452
  Simmer for about 45 minutes,  
     and then we strain it.     

181
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,520
   Tighten it up with a little  
    bit of slurry and butter.   

182
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,788
         GUY FIERI: OK.         

183
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,923
    We don't just give you a    
    big ol' breast like that.   

184
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:26,524
             Hiyah.             

185
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:27,859
  Put some cuts in it for you.  

186
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:28,593
              Yep.              

187
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:29,728
        CARENA IVES: And        
       on the plate here.       

188
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,662
    GUY FIERI: There you go.    

189
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,331
         And here comes         
        the magic sauce.        

190
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,266
      Ginger-tomato gravy.      

191
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:36,334
    CARENA IVES: Have at it.    

192
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,471
         [vibrant music]        

193
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,072
        That gravy could        
         go on anything.        

194
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,274
 If there was one thing I would 
    be bottling and selling--   

195
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,109
       CARENA IVES: Gravy.      

196
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,612
       It's like something      
         I've never had.        

197
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,080
         It is dynamite.        

198
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,483
      And this is one of my     
       all-time faves now.      

199
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,885
      Island Fried Chicken      
    with sweet ginger gravy.    

200
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:57,422
  It's a little crispy, but not 
 soggy, and so it is just right.

201
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,291
         And that sweet         
        with the gingery?       

202
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,359
           To die for.          

203
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,626
     Wow, what an adventure.    

204
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,762
   This is the cheapest flight  
    to Jamaica I've ever had.   

205
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,365
        Two goat lunches,       
         hot and ready.         

206
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,698
        If you come once,       
    you're gonna come again,    

207
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,100
and you're gonna love all of it.

208
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,502
     GUY FIERI: You are the     
      Jamaican ambassador.      

209
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:11,636
        I'm gonna get you       
       little flags to put      

210
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:12,637
    out in front of your car.   
          - All right.          

211
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,439
     - Thank you, my friend.    
      - Thanks for coming.      

212
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,307
          Outstanding.          

213
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,375
       What is over here?       

214
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,176
               Um.              

215
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:21,046
            [laughs]            

216
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,915
    GUY FIERI: Up next, we're   
headed to Ottawa, Canada-- dude,

217
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,585
     this looks awesome-- to    
     check out specialities     

218
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:27,586
   from a Newfoundland chef--   

219
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,589
    razzmatazz and pizzazz--    
       including a recipe       

220
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:31,723
   passed down for centuries.   

221
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,925
     It tastes pretty fresh     
     for a recipe that old.     

222
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,227
         That's exactly         
      what I was gonna say.     

223
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,200
          [theme music]         

224
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:42,833
      I'm here in downtown      
         Ottawa, Canada,        

225
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,936
    about a five-minute walk    
      from the Parliament,      

226
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,839
 to check out a restaurant where
 a chef from Newfoundland-- now,

227
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:48,840
        hang on a second.       

228
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,976
     I've never said Ottawa,    
  Newfoundland, or Parliament,  

229
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:52,844
      in a "Triple D" show.     

230
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,779
       Anyhow, I'm here to      
        check out a joint       

231
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,582
 where this guy's taking street 
    food to an artisan level.   

232
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,318
          This is OCCO.         

233
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,786
    Poutine hitting the pass.   

234
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,522
    When I tried the food the   
    first time, I was hooked.   

235
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,791
         So I've got the        
       cauliflower wings.       

236
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,392
        There's a lot of        
       East Coast flavors       

237
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,793
 from the East Coast of Canada. 

238
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,395
        GUY FIERI: That's       
        because Chef Mark       

239
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:11,663
  Steele is from Newfoundland.  

240
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:15,666
 He went from corporate cooking 
   to catering to this joint.   

241
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:16,601
      What does OCCO mean?      

242
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,670
   Orleans Catering Companies.  

243
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:19,671
       GUY FIERI: Orleans       
        is an area here?        

244
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:20,872
  It's the east end of Ottawa.  

245
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,074
    We take very approachable   
      food everybody likes,     

246
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:26,744
but we make things from scratch,
   use the local ingredients.   

247
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:27,812
      CUSTOMER: You get the     
     burgers and the fries,     

248
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,614
        but then you get        
      the specialty things      

249
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,882
   like the East Coast Donair.  

250
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,750
      GUY FIERI: Which is a     
     familiar regional dish.    

251
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:33,818
         CUSTOMER: It's         
       ground beef that's       

252
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,620
 piled together on a pita bread.

253
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,955
    GUY FIERI: Fired up with    
   Mark's own culinary punch.   

254
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:41,425
CUSTOMER: The combination of the
 sweet sauce and the hot peppers

255
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:42,627
         is so, so good.        

256
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:43,561
       All right, so what       
      are we getting into?      

257
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:44,563
      An East Coast Donair.     

258
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:45,764
      A where, with, what?      

259
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,366
   MARK STEELE: It's a spin on  
  a gyro made with ground beef. 

260
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:49,501
    Now, this is our version.   

261
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,237
     A little more pizzazz,     
        more razzmatazz.        

262
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,571
     Razzmatazz and pizzazz.    

263
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,973
      What did I get into?      

264
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,843
   We have some ground chuck,   
   about 70/30, garlic powder,  

265
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:00,779
      onion powder, smoked      
      paprika pepper, salt.     

266
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,914
       This is the pizzazz      
         here, cayenne.         

267
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:03,582
            Pizzazz.            

268
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,583
        Then to the meat,       
         fresh oregano.         

269
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,785
       Throw this right on      
       the sheet pan here.      

270
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:08,853
       Just roll that out.      

271
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,590
    Throw it in the oven, 350   
    for about seven minutes.    

272
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,458
       Now, the donair is       
       something that you       

273
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:14,392
     find throughout Canada?    

274
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,794
   Especially the East Coast.   

275
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,796
        But this sauce is       
       what differentiates      

276
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:22,467
  it from any other beef, meat  
   sandwich-type sliced thing.  

277
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,202
     You got it, absolutely.    

278
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,471
  We start off with evaporated  
 milk, sweetened condensed milk.

279
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:28,540
         Those cows are         
      rich and thick here.      

280
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,807
   MARK STEELE: Fresh garlic.   

281
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,876
  Because that's what I always  
 do-- evaporated milk, sweetened

282
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,879
     condensed milk, garlic.    

283
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:34,679
           Some sugar.          

284
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,748
       I'm just gonna add       
         in the vinegar,        

285
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,748
        and you're gonna        
        see this thicken.       

286
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,351
         Vinegar's gonna        
        tighten this up?        

287
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,552
     MARK STEELE: Big time.     

288
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,487
This Is where the magic happens.

289
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,088
      It's already starting     
         to thicken up.         

290
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:44,889
      I've never seen this.     

291
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:45,623
        What do you think       
       has happened here?       

292
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:46,625
           Beautiful.           

293
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:47,559
        Can we call Alton       
        brown right now?        

294
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,561
        This is an Alton        
       Brown question 101.      

295
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:50,628
 We've got the meat cooked off. 

296
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,696
    Take it to the flat top.    

297
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:52,697
  MARK STEELE: Grill the pita.  

298
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,365
       Hit this with some       
         garlic butter.         

299
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,500
        GUY FIERI: Dude,        
       this looks awesome.      

300
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,702
  Nice and thin and easy going. 

301
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,038
     A little cheddar, crisp    
  lettuce, and a ton of sauce.  

302
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,642
 And then some cherry tomatoes, 
 sweet mini peppers, and sliced 

303
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,710
 jalape o, and some more cheese.

304
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,379
       Finish it with our       
       pickled red onion.       

305
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:08,579
        And there you go.       

306
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:09,513
          Look at that.         

307
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:12,984
      Yeah, don't you know.     

308
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:13,784
     Oh, you got a little--     

309
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,453
        that's the way it       
       should be, though.       

310
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,121
         Oh, you bring a        
       bath towel, or have      

311
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,389
  a car wash when people leave. 
           They can--           

312
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,324
           - Exactly.           
    - --just walk through it.   

313
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,992
         Get hosed down.        

314
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,260
   GUY FIERI: Delicious, chef.  

315
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,462
   The meat is what's the most  
 impressive, with the seasoning,

316
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,531
      with the crust, with      
       the caramelization.      

317
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,533
      But when you get the      
     fresh vegetables mixed     

318
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:32,737
    with the cheese, and then   
     you get the little kiss    

319
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:36,474
 of the sauce, it rounds it out.

320
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,609
      That is really good.      

321
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:39,678
       Donair in the pass.      

322
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,412
   The best one I've ever had.  

323
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,280
           Seriously?           

324
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:43,481
   The meat is nice and juicy.  

325
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:43,949
          It's perfect.         

326
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:44,949
    Where is my sweet sauce?    

327
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,617
       No, you can't have       
      any more sweet sauce.     

328
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,886
     This is bang-on exactly    
    what I've had down east.    

329
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,621
        And you've got to       
      be from Newfoundland.     

330
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:51,623
      That beard and stuff.     

331
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,623
            I mean--            

332
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:53,824
       No, I just married       
        a Newfoundlander.       

333
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:54,959
   You married up, my friend.   

334
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:58,430
     OCCO hits home with the    
   fish and chips, the chowder  

335
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,697
   on the menu, the cod cakes.  

336
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,699
      Cod cakes, table 16.      

337
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:02,834
     This is grandma level.     

338
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:06,704
 I've never had a cod cake like 
   hers until I tried Mark's.   

339
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,773
        There's a secret        
         recipe I heard,        

340
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,642
       and you can't have       
        it anywhere else.       

341
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,377
  Newfoundland Cod Cake recipe. 

342
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,113
  This recipe is 432 years old. 

343
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:15,780
     Wait, wait, wait, wait.    

344
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:16,915
   Where does the 32 come in?   

345
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,850
   Because when it was handed   
 off to me, it was for 400 years

346
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,585
              old.              

347
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,253
       And I'm gonna cook       
         the potatoes--         

348
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:22,987
         Yukon potatoes.        

349
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,322
        --with a parsnip        
         and the onion.         

350
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,657
    Poach our cod separately.   

351
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:28,259
    Newfoundland, man, where    
     I grew up, cod is king.    

352
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,460
        In cod we trust.        

353
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,796
         Do not take our        
         American slogan        

354
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,731
   and rip it off and throw a   
    fish in the middle of it.   

355
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:34,933
        Oh, I thought you       
    guys stole that from us.    

356
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,534
   - Do you have it on a coin?  
             - Uh--             

357
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:37,535
          - Thank you.          
       - I think we might.      

358
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:38,603
          - Thank you!          
       - I think we might.      

359
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:39,804
  You don't have it on a coin!  

360
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,673
    MARK STEELE: We're gonna    
   add our cod to our potatoes  

361
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,074
      and melt the butter.      

362
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,676
          This here is          
      Newfoundland savory.      

363
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:47,612
  It has a very unique flavor,  
      and it's less woodier     

364
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,480
   than, say, a winter savory.  

365
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:50,481
   I was just gonna say that.   

366
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,816
       This is one of the       
       magic ingredients.       

367
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,352
      Add salt and pepper,      
         fresh parsley.         

368
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,619
         I mash this up.        

369
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:56,688
      GUY FIERI: All right,     
      so these will set up.     

370
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,691
   Then we're gonna bread them  
    using seasoned flour, egg   

371
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,494
  wash, and panko bread crumbs. 

372
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,629
     Drop them in the fryer     
        for four minutes.       

373
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:05,630
         And what do we         
        serve them with?        

374
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,365
     It's caper berry mayo.     

375
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:08,499
       This I got to see.       

376
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,701
   That's the big caper berry,  
     seed pods inside of it,    

377
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,436
         and it comes in        
        a picklely brine.       

378
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:13,772
  Give these just a quick chop. 

379
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,574
   And then I'm gonna throw in  
  all of my ingredients, mayo-- 

380
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:19,177
       You sure that's not      
 sweetened condensed milk again?

381
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:19,910
              Yeah.             

382
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,446
         [laughs] Dijon,        
        it's local honey,       

383
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,981
      and lemon juice, flat     
      leaf Italian parsley,     

384
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,784
 fresh dill, chives, and thyme. 

385
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,653
     And a little "warshed"     
         Worcestershire.        

386
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,388
       That's how you get       
     around saying it wrong.    

387
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,724
        Pepper, salt, add       
      a little lemon zest.      

388
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,792
   We give this a quick puree.  

389
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,327
       So this is gonna be      
      our cod cake plate--      

390
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,396
     the caper berry mayo we    
  just made, red cabbage slaw,  

391
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,865
 the jalape os, cherry tomatoes.

392
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,600
      You should have wore      
     a helmet for this one.     

393
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,002
This one's gonna blow your mind.

394
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:47,671
     OK, fried Atlantic cod     
     cakes, some fresh herb,    

395
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:50,141
   caper berries, lemon wedge.  

396
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,675
         And it's done.         

397
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:55,079
  This is gonna be interesting. 

398
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:55,613
         It's dynamite.         

399
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,081
     It's creamy, delicate.     

400
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,350
     A nice amount of crunch    
      to the outside of it.     

401
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,686
        It's like a fish        
        and chip gnocchi.       

402
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,687
        You can taste the       
      fish, but not fishy.      

403
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:07,424
       And the caper aiole      
      is the sleeper here.      

404
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:10,361
       That extra acidity       
        and razzmatazz is       

405
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,562
 what elevates the entire game. 

406
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,431
     It tastes pretty fresh     
     for a recipe that old.     

407
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,967
  Exactly what I was gonna say. 

408
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,034
           Cod cakes.           

409
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,238
    The panko breading that's   
     on them, super crispy.     

410
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,773
   The sauce makes it perfect.  

411
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,508
         I think it's a         
      200-year-old recipe.      

412
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,577
      I'm new here, but I'm     
   gonna have to correct you.   

413
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:28,779
        What is it, Mark,       
      422 year and 30 days?     

414
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:30,448
  We're looking at 33, I think. 

415
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,449
         Today, it's 33.        

416
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:32,850
     We're just-- just keep     
  clicking them off the board.  

417
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,386
 CUSTOMER: If you're looking for
 a good place to eat in Ottawa, 

418
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:36,654
       OCCO Kitchen's the       
         place to go to.        

419
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,522
  This is a handful right here. 

420
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:39,457
            O-C-C-O?            

421
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:40,458
            O-C-C-O.            

422
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,793
         O-C-C-O, later.        

423
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:45,730
      Up next, a funky deli     
        in Reno, Nevada--       

424
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,931
        they make really        
       weird sandwiches--       

425
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,733
    pushing breakfast burrito   
  boundaries-- can you help me  

426
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:50,802
           lift it up?          

427
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,805
   [groans]---- and going off   
   the chain with the chicken.  

428
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,540
    This is the kind of stuff   
      that we used to make      

429
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,142
   up when we were in college.  

430
00:12:58,411 --> 00:12:58,476
          [theme music]         

431
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,415
   So I'm just like you guys.   

432
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,717
I mean, not just for "Triple D,"
  but for me and for my family. 

433
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,485
       I'm always looking       
     for great restaurants.     

434
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:09,621
     I'm always on the hunt.    

435
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,756
    So a few years ago, I was   
     in Truckee, California.    

436
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:12,757
       Everybody tells me       
        about this place,       

437
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:14,359
         you got to get         
       the sandwich here.       

438
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,960
 So I did, and it was dynamite. 

439
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,496
 Well, now, I'm in Reno, Nevada,
   and I find out these dudes   

440
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:20,298
   have got a second location.  

441
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,299
     I got to check it out.     

442
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,635
    This is Full Belly Deli.    

443
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,637
   The Philly and on Parmesan.  

444
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,505
        Absolutely lives        
         up to its name.        

445
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:29,507
     Definitely, full belly.    

446
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,708
   TOM MARRIN: The Cheesesteak  
        with blue cheese        

447
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,243
   bread, one of my favorites.  

448
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,778
    These guys are all about    
   creating a great sandwich.   

449
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,513
  They're passionate about it.  

450
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,583
  GUY FIERI: But it was passion 
  for the slopes that led Eric  

451
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,651
      Barton and Tom Marrin     
         to Tahoe, where        

452
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,788
     they opened their first    
    joint in nearby Truckee.    

453
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,656
    And we just kind of saw a   
 niche that needed to be filled.

454
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:46,591
    I love making sandwiches.   

455
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:47,659
   He loved eating sandwiches.  

456
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:48,993
   - It's like shake and bake.  
             - Yeah.            

457
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:49,794
  GUY FIERI: We're in Truckee.  

458
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:50,928
        We're doing this        
        family road trip,       

459
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,997
   and every time I would say   
  to somebody, where do we eat? 

460
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,466
  They would go, well, you got  
    to go to Full Belly Deli.   

461
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,468
      I go there, and it's      
     not your average deli.     

462
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,937
        They make really        
      weird sandwiches, OK?     

463
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,407
  And they're doubling down at  
   their second location here   

464
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,876
            in Reno.            

465
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:05,876
       We got our biscuits      
       and gravy burrito.       

466
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,678
       Their biscuits and       
     gravy breakfast burrito    

467
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,280
 is like two breakfasts in one. 

468
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,616
    They have the biscuit and   
 the home-fried potato in there.

469
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,685
      If you're looking for     
      all your breakfasts,      

470
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,553
   just come get this burrito.  

471
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:16,821
          Let's see it,         
      what's the game plan?     

472
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,289
        TOM MARRIN: We're       
    making a chorizo sausage    

473
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,358
     gravy for our burrito.     

474
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,959
           Olive oil--          

475
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:21,959
 And you're making the chorizo? 

476
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,494
     It's made from a local     
      company here in town.     

477
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:24,562
             Got it.            

478
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:25,630
      TOM MARRIN: Breakfast     
       sausage, all pork.       

479
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,632
         Once the meat's        
       cooked down, I add       

480
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,434
        organic AP flour,       
       paprika, granulated      

481
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:31,636
      garlic, onion powder.     

482
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,370
      Cook that flour out.      

483
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,572
  Half and half and whole milk. 

484
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:37,441
    Let this come to a simmer   
      and salt and pepper,      

485
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,576
  and it'll be ready to serve.  

486
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:41,178
    This next step of making    
   biscuits for one dish, it's  

487
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,380
           impressive.          

488
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:46,384
  Organic AP flour here, sugar, 
   baking soda, baking powder.  

489
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,785
        Just give this a        
        quick pulse here.       

490
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,987
        Then we have our        
       extra cold butter.       

491
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,722
     Give it a good pulse to    
     get it about pea size.     

492
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,058
      The idea is breaking      
         that butter up,        

493
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,793
      so it just sits there     
  suspended between the flour.  

494
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,662
  So when it cooks, you really  
  develop all of those layers.  

495
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,863
            Correct.            

496
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,798
   It means everything in the   
 world of making a good biscuit.

497
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,800
     TOM MARRIN: Incorporate    
     the buttermilk slowly.     

498
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,669
       And it's gonna kind      
     of look a little dry--     

499
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,671
    But he's got more butter    
     than we typically see.     

500
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,807
  So this is gonna make a nice, 
   light, flaky biscuit if we   

501
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,008
  can get it to stay together.  

502
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,344
   Because right now, it just   
 looks like we're trying to make

503
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,611
  a sandcastle out of dry sand. 

504
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,480
      TOM MARRIN: So we're      
    going for a square here.    

505
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,282
       Could be a triangle      
         for all I care.        

506
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:19,550
   TOM MARRIN: Roll this out.   

507
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:20,818
      We're gonna cut this.     

508
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,687
       You brush it with a      
    little bit of buttermilk?   

509
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,754
       We're gonna finish       
      with salt and pepper.     

510
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:25,489
         GUY FIERI: OK.         
   We go in the oven how long?  

511
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,157
 TOM MARRIN: 25 minutes at 350. 

512
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:27,759
              So--              

513
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:28,892
     That is beautiful, wow.    

514
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,762
    Drop the tortilla on the    
     flat top to warm it up.    

515
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,699
      Hash brown coming out     
       of the fryer there.      

516
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,901
     Gonna take our biscuit,    
         slice this up--        

517
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,902
               Oh!              
       Seems sacrilegious.      

518
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,637
     TOM MARRIN: We're gonna    
      add a little cheddar      

519
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:43,908
  cheese to this guy, a crispy  
   hash brown, biscuit there.   

520
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,908
    And then we've got gravy.   

521
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,511
   GUY FIERI: Oh, so it's for   
    the whole family, I see.    

522
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,713
   TOM MARRIN: We roll it up.   

523
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,314
   Can you help me lift it up?  

524
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,782
   [groans] That's ridiculous.  

525
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,252
  TOM MARRIN: We're gonna take  
 that over to the panini press, 

526
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
  and then we are ready to go.  

527
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,255
      High carb, meet carb.     

528
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,725
         [vibrant music]        

529
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,594
    Well, I'm gonna tell you,   
  first thing, as scared of it  

530
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,863
       as I was, for some       
     reason, the way you've     

531
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:07,598
        made it, the way        
       you've seasoned it,      

532
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,800
 it really is not overly heavy. 

533
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:10,668
         It's delicious.        

534
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,470
      The biscuit is light      
       and flaky in there.      

535
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,671
     The crunch of the hash     
  brown inside is really nice.  

536
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:18,476
       But the kicker for       
      me is the gravy, bro.     

537
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,344
        I could just have       
        a bowl of gravy.        

538
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,413
 This is a ski bum delight 101. 

539
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:23,614
         Well done, man.        

540
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:23,881
      Yeah, thank you very      
      much, appreciate it.      

541
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,682
           Well done.           

542
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,417
        We got a biscuits       
       and gravy burrito.       

543
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,486
    It blows my expectations    
        out of the water.       

544
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,522
       The chorizo and the      
    gravy has so much flavor.   

545
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,824
         The biscuit is         
       soft and delicious.      

546
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:34,892
          Unbelievable.         

547
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:37,428
      Dirka Dirka, Dirka on     
     jalape o cheddar bread.    

548
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,563
          Your favorite         
      sandwich on the menu?     

549
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:39,697
       Dirka Dirka, baby.       

550
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,499
    You get that big crunchy    
      bite with that slaw.      

551
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:42,833
       You got that spicy       
       something in there.      

552
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:45,570
You're gonna love me for telling
   you to get the Dirka Dirka.  

553
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,438
         They sell Dirka        
         Dirka T-shirts.        

554
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,906
     The word's gotten out.     

555
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:52,443
  So everybody knows about the  
   Dirka Dirka and the Philly   

556
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,577
      and the GNAR Burrito.     

557
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,978
      There's really a lot      
    of options for everybody.   

558
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:56,914
    When I went and tried you   
    guys for the first time,    

559
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,449
    and I find that you guys    
      had a place in Reno,      

560
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,384
    you haven't let me down.    

561
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,651
       That's two for two.      

562
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,319
    Let's see what's up next.   

563
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,521
   And we got a spoiler alert.  

564
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:06,390
        It turns out, the       
     third time is a charm.     

565
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,524
          Oh, how cute.         

566
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,594
     He took chips and they     
   put it around the chicken.   

567
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:10,395
              Dude.             

568
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:14,432
              Huh?              

569
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,567
            We good?            

570
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,503
        Got to go get the       
        pressure washer?        

571
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:20,438
          Welcome back.         

572
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,839
       "Triple D" hanging       
        out at Full Belly       

573
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:22,773
   Deli in Truckee, Californ--  

574
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,642
        [audio screeches]       
      Sorry, Reno, Nevada.      

575
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,777
    He's got one in Truckee.    

576
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:26,644
      He's got one in Reno.     

577
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:27,712
      This is the new one.      

578
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,480
       I found these guys       
        a couple of years       

579
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,048
       ago in Truckee on a      
      big family road trip.     

580
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,786
We're talking about scratch-made
  sandwiches, funky creations.  

581
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,921
        Nacho Pollo Loco        
         in the window.         

582
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:41,526
      The Nacho Pollo Loco      
     sandwich is ridiculous.    

583
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:44,395
  The chicken itself is breaded 
  with the nacho cheese chips.  

584
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,330
         You don't find         
       this anywhere else.      

585
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:47,598
     It's really delicious.     

586
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,534
    Now we're gonna get into    
    a chicken sandwich that's   

587
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:50,935
  coated in nacho cheese chips. 

588
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,803
    This is the kind of stuff   
      that we used to make      

589
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,005
   up when we were in college.  

590
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:56,540
     When you would have the    
   leftover potato chips that   

591
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,875
     were just the crumbles     
         at the bottom,         

592
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,143
         I would always         
       incorporate those.       

593
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,945
 TOM MARRIN: First, we're gonna 
    season the egg wash here.   

594
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:04,615
We've got some hot sauce, kosher
   salt, fresh cracked pepper.  

595
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,551
    Do a quick whisk on that.   

596
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:07,818
   All natural chicken breast.  

597
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,754
         A little dredge        
      there for the flour.      

598
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,622
   Into our seasoned egg wash.  

599
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,423
      Then we're gonna pack     
      those chips on there.     

600
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:14,525
         You want to get        
      that crunch, and you      

601
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,760
    want to get that flavor.    

602
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,427
 Now we're gonna let these rest 
   a bit before you fry them?   

603
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,495
          We don't fry          
       them, we bake them.      

604
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:19,429
         GUY FIERI: Oh,         
      we're gonna bake it?      

605
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:19,897
          It's healthy.         
        I mean, come on.        

606
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:20,698
              See?              

607
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,699
       Just when you think      
       they weren't gonna       

608
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,501
      let you be healthy at     
      the Full Belly Deli,      

609
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,502
        they go ahead and       
        bake the chicken.       

610
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,369
        TOM MARRIN: Yeah,       
      we bake the chicken.      

611
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:25,969
           Next step?           

612
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,104
      The southwest sauce.      

613
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,440
  We're gonna add our chipotles 
   and adobo, fresh cilantro.   

614
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:30,641
      GUY FIERI: Gonna be a     
      little heat in that.      

615
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,710
        Mayonnaise, sour        
        cream, then we're       

616
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,712
     gonna add the chipotle     
      and cilantro mixture.     

617
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,250
    I just got a huge waft of   
   that smoky, dry, chipotle.   

618
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,317
        Very interesting.       

619
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:40,918
   I'll hold this, your honor.  

620
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:41,852
               OK.              

621
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,388
       Horseradish, lemon       
      juice, salt, pepper.      

622
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,589
         Finish it off.         
              - OK.             

623
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:46,457
        Pickles are next.       

624
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,525
             Got it.            

625
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:48,526
This is an immersion circulator?

626
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:49,594
        TOM MARRIN: Yes.        

627
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:50,861
      Well, isn't that just     
    the cutest little thing?    

628
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,530
       We have a fountain       
     like that in our room.     

629
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,531
         I could also be        
       brining my pickles.      

630
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:56,867
     We've got white vinegar    
     here, sugar, and salt.     

631
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,603
       And that'll be our       
         brining liquid.        

632
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:00,671
      And we're gonna go a      
   whole yellow mustard seed,   

633
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,473
      toasted caraway seed      
       here, peppercorns.       

634
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,140
      GUY FIERI: Tricolor?      

635
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:04,142
        TOM MARRIN: Yep.        

636
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,610
   Whole garlic, bay leaf, an   
    arbol chili, fresh dill.    

637
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,479
      Then we're gonna add      
     our pickling cucumbers.    

638
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:09,479
         GUY FIERI: OK.         

639
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:10,414
        TOM MARRIN: Then        
       we have our brine.       

640
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,549
         How long are we        
        gonna sous vide?        

641
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:12,283
  TOM MARRIN: 2 and 1/2 hours-- 
       GUY FIERI: Really?       

642
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,417
     TOM MARRIN: --at 140--     

643
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,354
    Could you use some really   
   good sous vide terminology?  

644
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:16,887
         Let's go 39.9.         

645
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:17,555
          There you go.         

646
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,357
  For two hours and 41 minutes. 

647
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,491
              And--             

648
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,491
      And they'll be done.      

649
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:22,559
       TOM MARRIN: Then we      
     let them sit overnight.    

650
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:23,627
          Look at this.         

651
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,162
Can I just come in and buy this?
        TOM MARRIN: Yes.        

652
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:25,696
          Yes, you can.         

653
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:26,764
      Good, I'll take this.     

654
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,832
       So jalape os and a       
        bunch of cheddar.       

655
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:29,500
   TOM MARRIN: We toast it up.  

656
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,701
        And we've got our       
        southwest sauce.        

657
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:33,371
       Romaine lettuce and      
  heirloom tomatoes, a pickle.  

658
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,505
        GUY FIERI: I like       
       where we're going.       

659
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,440
  Nacho-crusted chicken breast. 

660
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,308
          Fold it over.         

661
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:39,143
        GUY FIERI: Dude.        

662
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:43,647
       Bread is dynamite.       

663
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,716
    It's got a good texture,    
    good chew, but not heavy.   

664
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,718
    I love the cheese and the   
    jalape os on the outside.   

665
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
  And the chicken breast, it's  
    got a really good crunch.   

666
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,521
     I mean, I heard it when    
   you hit it with the knife.   

667
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,123
      Awesome smokiness out     
     of the southwest sauce.    

668
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:57,194
But the kicker that refreshes it
 is that pickle, and that pickle

669
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,195
             sings.             

670
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,529
        Singing pickles.        

671
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,799
         Nacho Pollo and        
       jalape o coming in.      

672
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,534
       The chicken is real      
       juicy, real tender,      

673
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:06,003
        but the chips add       
     like a perfect crunch.     

674
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,605
    The pickles are amazing,    
    nothing like any pickles    

675
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,274
         I've ever had.         

676
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,675
   The jalape o cheddar bread   
  is definitely the way to go,  

677
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,811
       spicy, but cheesy.       

678
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,346
   Cheesesteak on blue cheese.  

679
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:16,614
      It's a 25-pound deli.     

680
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:20,484
    Once they moved to Reno,    
       I gained 25 pounds.      

681
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,819
        Line of the year.       

682
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,753
           Good night.          

683
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:23,821
        If you're looking       
      for a great sandwich,     

684
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:26,623
       I would say this is      
     the best place to come.    

685
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,025
        And you're gonna        
    leave with a full belly.    

686
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:31,495
      Great sandwich, great     
   attitude, great creativity.  

687
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:32,363
            Dynamite.           

688
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:33,497
    Just gave me goose bumps.   

689
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:34,632
        Gonna put them on       
       the menu next week.      

690
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,233
 Come on down, Full Belly Deli. 

691
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,502
     Sous vide goose bumps.     

692
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:40,504
  Was that a road trip or what? 

693
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,573
    But don't worry, there's    
       plenty more joints       

694
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:43,907
  all over this great country.  

695
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:47,445
     I'll be looking for you    
    next time on "Triple D."    

696
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:48,579
          I'm spoiled.          

697
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,446
             I know.            

698
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:50,714
           I can tell.          

699
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:51,582
  You have more bling than me.  

700
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:52,717
         We have a rule.        

701
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,652
       You can't have more      
      bling than the host.      

702
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,989
     [laughter, theme music]
