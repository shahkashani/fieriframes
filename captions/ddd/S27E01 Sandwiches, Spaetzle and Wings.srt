00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,201
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,669
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:06,471
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,339
          This trip...          

5
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:08,340
       Hello.                   

6
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:09,340
    ...we're cruising towards   

7
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:10,942
     some delicious detours.    

8
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:12,544
                Look at that.   

9
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,013
       Like a two-for-one       
      in Norfolk, Virginia.     

10
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:16,281
             I want to have     
         my birthday party here.

11
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:18,150
 Revving up a butchery by day...

12
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,218
             One of a kind joint
        you've got to check out.

13
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,888
   ...then taking a Flavortown  
        U-turn at night.        

14
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,157
                Ridiculous.     
          Like, ridiculous good.

15
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:26,825
   And here's a doozy for you.  

16
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,026
             Doctor.            

17
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:29,894
  A legit German-Swiss joint... 

18
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,631
    I think Hofbrau             
and Schnitzel Emporium.         

19
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,966
          ...smack-dab          
     in the middle of Maui.     

20
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,002
  I didn't see that             
 coming, everybody.             

21
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,970
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

22
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:41,340
      on "Diners, Drive-ins     
            & Dives."           

23
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:52,851
                     ♪♪         

24
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,788
         So I'm here in         
       Norfolk, Virginia,       

25
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,590
    and check this story out.   

26
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:01,193
      Husband and wife team     
       buy this old house,      

27
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:02,995
       and they convert it      
      into a butcher shop.      

28
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,663
     Well then they turn it     
       into a restaurant.       

29
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,464
   Well then they rent it out   
         to another guy         

30
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:07,800
  to do a restaurant at night.  

31
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:09,401
         That's my kind         
       of Triple-D joint.       

32
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:10,969
        This is Pendulum.       

33
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,940
             There's not another
     butcher shop like Pendulum.

34
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,741
 We have a flat-iron            
  steak back here.              

35
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,476
 You can come buy all different 
      kinds of meats here,      

36
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:19,611
         great sausages.        

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,012
       Or you can get a sandwich
           and eat it here.     

38
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:22,547
     Pick it up,                
 two Monte Cristos.             

39
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:25,417
  FIERI: And the crazy thing is 
 owner Dylan Wakefield's journey

40
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,487
      to making sandwiches      
   actually started on a sub.   

41
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,088
I was in the navy on            
a submarine for 8 years,        

42
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:31,089
 cooking underwater.            

43
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:32,491
    And then went               
 to culinary school.            

44
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:33,492
        FIERI: And where did you
            learn to butcher?   

45
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:34,626
    A little bit                
 in culinary school             

46
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,828
   and a lot of it              
  just on the job.              

47
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:39,097
 You can see your sausages being
   made, or your meat being cut,

48
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,298
             or your sandwiches 
                 being made.    

49
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:41,900
     MAN: Pick it up,           
one roast beef with fries.      

50
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,968
       You can't go wrong       
  with the roast beef sandwich. 

51
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,837
      I keep ordering this      
      'cause it's so good.      

52
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:48,040
            So what are we gonna
             break out of here? 
What I use for our              

53
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:49,775
butcher's roast beef            
sandwich is a top round.        

54
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,177
      Tender, lean, cooks great,
            slices awesome.     
Yep.                            
Yep, yeah.                      

55
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,113
So on the exterior layer        
I'll just be cutting off        

56
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:55,581
   good fat to go               
   into rendering.              

57
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,582
And I'm really try to expose    
     some of the seams.         

58
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:58,850
                There we go.    
                  Yahtzee!      

59
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,051
                     Get this   
                  top round out.
      Yep.                      

60
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,254
        FIERI: And then,        
      the real fun begins.      

61
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:03,788
             This is a gigantic 
                 playground.    

62
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:05,123
             I want to have     
         my birthday party here.

63
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,324
                  You have      
                all the toys.   

64
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,326
               This gigantic    
              caveman smoker.   
     Yeah.                      

65
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,994
  These old butcher             
    paper rolls.                

66
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,730
               Let me see that  
               butcher twine.   

67
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:15,534
                There's room    
                in my shirt.    

68
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:17,735
               Don't worry,     
           I can get it in here.

69
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,071
               Ridiculous. Aw!  

70
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:20,405
  So part of using              
 that whole animal,             

71
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,074
   this is the fat              
 we just ground up.             
                       Yep.     

72
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:24,209
  We're gonna make              
   this into oil,               

73
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,210
  so any time we're             
  using the griddle             

74
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:26,478
    we want to use              
a little bit of tallow.         

75
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,679
    We throw some               
 garlic and rosemary            

76
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:28,680
in there just for flavor,       

77
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,349
   and then we render           
this down really slowly.        

78
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,684
And it's almost                 
like a confit.                  
               That's awesome.  

79
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,553
             Don't be shallow   
             about the tallow.  
      Yes.                      

80
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,555
             So here is the top 
             round that you cut.

81
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,290
The butcher's recipe.           
               Hence the butcher

82
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,558
         and the roast beef. So.

83
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,426
Salt, pepper, garlic,           

84
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,295
     red onions.                
                     Just a nice
                     paste here.

85
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:45,897
        Now do you tie it first,
         or do you rub it first?
I do need to tie it.            

86
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,065
Somebody took my string.        

87
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:47,899
                  [ Sighs ]     

88
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:50,636
               It's in my car.  

89
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:53,171
     I was holding it over there
         so it didn't get dirty.
   Okay.                        

90
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,040
               Nobody told me   
                we needed it.   

91
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:57,309
All right. So I'm gonna         
do a pretty quick tie-up.       

92
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:58,243
Spot me right there.            

93
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,578
             It keeps everything
                a little bit    

94
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,913
               more contained,  
            and doesn't dry out.
  Doctor?                       

95
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,248
                 All right.     
              Where's that bag. 

96
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:05,717
          So now we get this rub
               of the garlic    

97
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,653
              and the shallots, 
            salt and the pepper.

98
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,988
And then we sell it by          
the pound or on a sandwich.     

99
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,256
            You're not for real.

100
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:12,324
                    In the oven,
                     what temp? 
    There we go.                

101
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,526
We keep that at 350,            
    let it rest,                

102
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,528
get it nice and cold so they    
 actually slice really well.    

103
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:17,929
                Look at that.   

104
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:20,498
              So thin, it only  
                has one side.   

105
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,001
            This is for science.
     Yes.                       

106
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,336
        Nice.                   

107
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,738
    I really believe, especially
on these tougher pieces of meat,

108
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:28,139
   the thinner you can slice it,
            the better.         

109
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:29,674
         Like, pit beef that you
            get up in Baltimore.

110
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,876
             Shout out to Chaps.

111
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,344
      If you ever get the chance
        to go to Chaps Pit Beef,

112
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,145
       trust me, you'll love it.
       But this right here, bro.

113
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:35,013
          You're right in there.

114
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,148
             And this gets what?

115
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,016
  Caramelized onions,           
Swiss cheese on there.          

116
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,818
  And that's gonna              
   go in the oven.              

117
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,154
       Tallow,                  
focaccia grilled off.           

118
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:44,223
         Every day you're making
            a batch of bread?   
 Every day.                     

119
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:48,493
      Man, you can totally smell
        the rosemary and garlic.

120
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:50,162
  We're gonna smear             
  with spicy mayo.              

121
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:51,163
  We're gonna take              
   that roast beef              

122
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,832
   that just came               
  out of the oven.              

123
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,436
               I'm having full  
             flashbacks on this.

124
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:01,839
  The roast beef sandwich at the
   meat market when I was a kid.

125
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:05,843
     The meat was roasted there,
            sliced thin.        

126
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,246
       You can really appreciate
          the craftsmanship,    

127
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:09,514
              time, the energy, 
                 the effort     

128
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,716
          that were all utilized
          to make that sandwich.

129
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,051
           It's worth everything
           that you're getting. 

130
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,452
              Don't touch this. 
                  All mine.     

131
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,787
         ...roast beef.         

132
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,322
     It's just really juicy,    
   and it has the right amount  

133
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,590
   of crisp on the top of it.   

134
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:21,592
   The onions add the perfect   
       note of tanginess.       

135
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,128
   WOMAN: This place is great   
         for a sandwich,        

136
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:25,263
  and then you realize, "Wait a 
 minute, I'm also in a market." 

137
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,532
    There are so many things    
         going on here.         

138
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,868
     They even have classes     
       on how to butcher.       

139
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,471
          Superman, you do knife
           sharpening here also?

140
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:34,939
         WAKEFIELD: Yes.        
              I'm done with you.

141
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:37,542
 WOMAN: It's just different than
  any other type of restaurant  

142
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,010
            or market           
       that you might see.      

143
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:40,945
What I want my walk-in          
     to look like.              

144
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,881
         Some of our house-cured
            hams on the bone.   

145
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,217
               We cure and smoke
                  ham and bacon.
Are you human?                  

146
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,618
             FIERI:             
   And this hand-crafted pork   

147
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,287
        is piled high on        
   a classic Havana sandwich.   

148
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,756
  Cuban with fries.             

149
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,491
             Now we're gonna get
          into a Cuban sandwich.
  Yeah.                         

150
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:53,891
  Take a pork leg,              
   break it down.               

151
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,360
    Cut it into all             
the individual muscles.         

152
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:57,562
                 Now we're gonna
                    rub them.   
      Salt,                     
 pepper, garlic.                

153
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,297
               Kind of making   
               that wet paste.  

154
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,698
In the old smoke pit.           

155
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,634
             How long are you   
               gonna smoke?     
  Four hours,                   

156
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,437
175 to 200 degrees.             
                   As low as you
                     can get it.

157
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,307
    This is our rested          
and ready-to-slice-up pork.     

158
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,909
Looking for that beautiful      
pink smoke ring.                
                   There you go.

159
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,043
            What kind of smoke  
          are you using on that?

160
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,712
I like the oily pecan.          

161
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,580
                Thin slices.    
                 Beautiful.     

162
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,248
             They can buy this  
             in the deli case?  
      Yes.                      

163
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,050
                 Ridiculous.    

164
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,451
Put some cheese on there.       

165
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,319
This goes in the oven           
 and gets warmed up.            

166
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,921
     Really good                
  flatbread again.              

167
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:23,855
   Spicy mustard.               

168
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,257
                     That's hot.
  That is hot.                  

169
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:26,458
           Where are the pickles
               coming from?     

170
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,660
Just a regular pickle           
    that we get.                

171
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:31,596
      You didn't make something,
             you slacker!       

172
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,932
               The only thing   
             I got on this guy. 

173
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,734
   Press that down              
    really good.                

174
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:37,102
  A classic Cuban.              

175
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,872
        Good.                   

176
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:43,141
        Very seldom are you able
           to get meat like that

177
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,676
         because Captain America
         is butchering it down, 

178
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:47,813
          separating the muscles
           on that hind-quarter,

179
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:50,214
    and then making it available
          just sliced thin.     

180
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,017
         That's why this doesn't
           have any of that fat.

181
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,418
      Yeah.                     
                    This isn't  
                  a pulled-pork.

182
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:55,487
                    Wow!        

183
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,622
            Brother, I'm glad   
        I don't live in Norfolk.

184
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,157
                We'd probably   
                 be friends.    

185
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,159

Yeah, I know, man.              

186
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,428

           swimsuit season ever.

187
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,297
 This is by far one of the best 
   Cuban sandwiches I've had.   

188
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,100

    We're gonna make            
our own braising liquid.        

318
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,418
    Got some cinnamon,          
dried chilies, star anise,      

319
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,020
some black peppercorns,         

320
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:25,222
cloves and some Sichuan         
     peppercorns.               
                   Love them.   

321
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,092
   Get them toasted,            
let them get aromatic.          

322
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,560
    This is tare.               

323
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,628
             Tare, the roasted  
             chicken bones...   
      Yep.                      

324
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:31,763
               ...simmered in   
               the soy sauce.   

325
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,632
              Really the flavor 
                  is crazy.     

326
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:34,966
   This is Chinese              
    cooking wine.               

327
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,434
   Got some chili               
     paste here.                

328
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,770
A little bit of water,          
some rice vinegar, ginger here  

329
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,172
and one head of garlic.         

330
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,441
            And then our sachet,
             our little packet. 

331
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:44,576
Give it a little tie.           

332
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:47,178
Cover this with foil,           
throw it in the oven,           

333
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,647
    350 for about               
    5 to 6 hours.               

334
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,315
          All right, home slice.
     You roasted the beef bones.

335
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:53,051
Yep. Smother them with          
  some tomato paste.            

336
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,652
            These are gonna go  
             back in the oven?  
      Yep.                      

337
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,053
  About 10 minutes.             
                       Okay.    

338
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,189
Now I'm gonna go ahead          
and toss them in this pot,      

339
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,459
and fill it up with the         
vegetables and some water.      

340
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:02,326
                  Everybody     
                in the pool?    

341
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,328
      Simmer it                 
    for 48 hours.               

342
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:07,198
   And then you have 7,000 other
   ingredients to put together. 

343
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,867
I'm gonna go ahead and start    
by sautéing some cabbage.       

344
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:12,670
  The oxtail, start             
assembling the bowl.            

345
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,472
  This is something             
  called beef tare,             

346
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:17,676
and it's like a reduced version 
of the braising liquid.         

347
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,410
                   Okay.        
 Katsubushi salt,               

348
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:23,081
smoked and dried tuna that's    
been shaved super thin.         

349
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,283
We blend it with some sea salt  
      and some beef fat.        

350
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,352
 Chili garlic oil that          
we make here in house.          

351
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,686
   Black vinegar.               

352
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,021
    I'm gonna go ahead          
and drop the noodles down,      

353
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,089
and get them cooking.           

354
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,892
   So this is our               
strained beef broth.            

355
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:34,826
                     Oh.        

356
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:37,028
     The noodles                
   should be done.              

357
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,830
We'll take a little bit         
    of the oxtail,              

358
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,965
 cabbage, scallions,            

359
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,168
    beef tendon that            
we've cooked and sliced,        

360
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:44,569
      cilantro.                 

361
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:48,573
Finish with some sesame seeds,  
      some cilantro oil.        

362
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:51,943
           That's a lot of time,
             energy, and love.  

363
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,047
          The depth of the broth
              is ridiculous.    

364
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,449
             You got this really
             phenomenal, tender,

365
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,585
         super flavorful oxtail.

366
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:01,786
                 Then I get     
             the tender noodle. 

367
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:02,921
     Then I get that little bite
           of the cabbage.      

368
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,188
         Then I get some of that
           fresh green onion.   

369
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,523
        Then I'm over there into
      a little bit of the spice.

370
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,192
              Then I get some

00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:01,679
All right. What are we          
  making next, chef?            

539
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,414
              We are gonna make 
              an apple strudel. 

540
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:05,683
          A traditional strudel.
Apple strudel.                  

541
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,885
          The old-fashioned way.
  Okay.                         

542
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,755
  This is one of those desserts 
     that I look forward to.    

543
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:14,692
 It's a really good, flaky crust
 that has apples on the inside. 

544
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,160
       This vanilla cream       
          sauce on top          

545
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:18,095
    is absolutely delightful.   

546
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,230
     All right.                 
 Let's get it going.            

547
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,498
              We're gonna start 
            with some milk, oil,

548
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,634
                 some eggs,     
               a little salt.   

549
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,369
    Let me guess.               
  Unbleached flour.             

550
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:26,637
                There you go.   

551
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,239
 So we let this mix.            

552
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:31,442
             Put it in film wrap
 and let it sit there overnight.

553
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,910
   And then we'll               
    roll it out.                

554
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,180
   [ Laughs ] Hey!              

555
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,982
    That is a lot               
   of dough, bro.               

556
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,516
       Hello.                   

557
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:42,987
       The mixture, some apples.
  I put some sugar in, cinnamon.

558
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,988
         Then use macadamia nuts
             or hazel nuts.     

559
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,325
A lot of macadamia nuts up      
    in the Swiss Alps.          

560
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,127
              No, we have a lot 
                 over here.     

561
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:50,461
      Raisins.                  

562
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,395
                There you go.   

563
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,064
               Then we lay it   
                  on there.     

564
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:55,132
             Go like this, about
         a half into the middle.

565
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:56,400
                Lay it in.      
      Okay.                     

566
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,735
                Then we take    
              the cheese cloth. 

567
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,070
        Ohhh!                   

568
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:01,806
      Oh, dude,                 
  that is awesome.              

569
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,674
I didn't see that coming,       
       everybody.               

570
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,942
               And then we use  
               some egg wash.   

571
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:08,346
           Throw it in the oven,
            45 minutes at 325.  

572
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,413
And what are we gonna           
   serve it with?               

573
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:10,747
             Vanilla bean sauce.

574
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:13,818
Swiss vanilla bean sauce        
is what I was hoping for.       

575
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:17,221
         It's fresh milk, sugar,
             fresh vanilla bean.

576
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,422
The whole bean itself?          

577
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,358
                 And lemon skin.
Let that come                   
to a boil.                      

578
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,426
      In the mean time, you have
          milk with a little bit

579
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,161
               of corn starch   
             and some egg yolks.

580
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,163
  Oh, there we go.              

581
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,366
And that's gonna tighten        
 that up, cream that up.        

582
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,633
Then you'll strain it.          

583
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:30,801
              And cool it off.  

584
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,370
    Look at that.               

585
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,305
                  Right out     
                of the oven.    

586
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:35,306
        Huh?                    

587
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,044
             With whipping cream
   and a strawberry for garnish.

588
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:43,781
               Powdered sugar.  

589
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,584
   And then we take the ice-cold
        vanilla bean sauce      

590
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,052
           over the hot strudel.

591
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:50,021
               And here we go.  

592
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,725
A lot of times I think          
of strudel as being light.      

593
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:57,261
   The dough has more           
texture than I expected.        

594
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:59,196
     The filling                
    is fantastic.               

595
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,598
 And it's just like             
  you got ice cream             

596
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,333
with the vanilla sauce.         
                       Yeah.    

597
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:06,070
It's nice and creamy, luxurious,
but it's not overly sweet.      

598
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:07,672
  I like the crust              
    of apple pie.               

599
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,072
That's my favorite part.        

600
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:11,208
So if you like a real           
    hearty crust,               

601
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:12,643
this is your dessert.           

602
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,881
    So incredibly delicious.    

603
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,015
         It's a perfect dessert.

604
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,817
                   Brigit!      

605
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:22,953
 We're so lucky to have Bernard 
        and Brigit here.        

606
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:24,821
         One of the best        
   restaurants on the island.   

607
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,223
 I wanted something             
     different.                 

608
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,158
Something that wasn't just      
      the traditional           

609
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:29,827
  what I would get              
 every time in Maui,            

610
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,029
 this is about as far of        
a change as you can get.        

611
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,030
   I'm impressed.               

612
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,098
                   Aloha.       

613
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,933
 Alo -- And then he             
   gives me aloha.              

614
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,905
  So that's it for this edition 
 of "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

615
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,640
 If you want to find the recipes
 of some of the joints we visit,

616
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,776
  well, go to foodnetwork.com.  

617
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,178
         I'll be looking        
        for you next time       

618
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,047
      on "Diners, Drive-Ins     
            & Dives."           

619
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,582
              Are there locks   
           on the meat case now?

620
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:55,386
       No, but maybe they       
       should put some on.      

621
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:56,787
                     You keep   
                     it quiet.  

622
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,156
  What do you want out of there?
             I saw some T-bones.
