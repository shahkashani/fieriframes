1
00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:02,267
         Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,736
         I'm Guy Fieri,
      and we're rolling out

3
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:06,739
 looking for America's greatest
  diners, drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:08,574
This trip...

5
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:10,142
 ...we're piling on the pork...

6
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:12,478
  I like me a tender hog foot.
              -Yes.

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,413
 ...and some hearty homecooking.

8
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:15,681
         I'd eat that every day.

9
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:18,717
     Check out these monster
     chops in San Antonio...

10
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,185
     Holy moly!

11
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,788
       ...pig's head tacos
        in New Orleans...

12
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,423
They're gonna flock-o
   for this taco.

13
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:27,526
  ...plus, Southern bird meets
       Far East flavor...

14
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,795
 "A rad place to jam
and killer chicken."

15
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:32,231
      ...alongside knuckles
       that pack a punch.

16
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:34,099
Dude, that's righteous.

17
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,968
     That's all right here,
           right now,

18
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,170
           on "Diners,
       Drive-Ins & Dives."

19
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,985
   So, I'm here in New Orleans
        on Broad Street,

20
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:54,753
        just a few blocks
         away from Canal

21
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,922
   that'll take you right down
         to the Quarter.

22
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:58,457
      Listen, I love coming
          to this city.

23
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:02,027
  You got great people, amazing
 food, all kinds of characters,

24
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:03,996
       you got the party,
      you got the history,

25
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:05,631
      and listen, I'm here
      to check out a joint

26
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:07,466
       that's got all that
         under one roof.

27
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:10,736
     This is Marjie's Grill.

28
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,404
              Charred pig tail
               in the window.

29
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,972
     I love this restaurant.

30
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:16,008
              Fresh cracklings
                for you guys.

31
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,509
    Nothing like it in town.

32
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,878
        Southeast Asian Southern
    barbecue is what we call it.

33
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,213
And it's what you get

34
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:23,048
       when Marcus Jacobs
       and Caitlin Carney

35
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,017
  travel through Southeast Asia

36
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:28,120
  and bring new culinary tricks
      to Big Easy cooking.

37
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:30,589
         Louisiana, Mississippi,
          Gulf Coast ingredients

38
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,192
 seasoned with Thai, Vietnamese,
              and Lao flavors.

39
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,594
Well, you guys are just
 gigantic copycats.

40
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,162
   This is crazy.

41
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,465
  It's new. I think he invented
   a whole new genre of food.

42
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:41,467
And apparently,
  a whole new language.

43
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:43,135
          Honey butter yardbird.

44
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:44,236
Da whoda wini henay?

45
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:45,370
             -Honey.
             -Honey.

46
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:46,472
            -Butter.
            -Butter.

47
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,240
           -Yardbird.
     -Honey butter yardbird.

48
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,042
       My favorite chicken
         in New Orleans.

49
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:52,911
   Ah, man. It's the smoke --
     the grill in the back.

50
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:56,181
   It's got this amazing chili
   and herb sauce with garlic.

51
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,483
       You can't beat it.

52
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:58,951
      This is the chicken spice.
             This is what we use

53
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,352
              to rub our honey
              butter yardbird.

54
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,420
    Let's see it.

55
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:03,188
                First, we go
             salt, black pepper,

56
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,023
           paprika, white pepper
               right there...

57
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:07,126
             -Okay.
-...garlic powder, onion powder.

58
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,027
            -Japones?
  -It's like a Japanese chili.

59
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:10,529
                  Add dried
             Vietnamese chilies.

60
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,731
   Oh, I'm sorry.
  Did I miss this?

61
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:13,899
              The slogan, man.

62
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:17,369
     Marjie's --
"A rad place to jam."

63
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,871
That's the best line ever.

64
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:21,206
         Now we're gonna butcher
      the chicken -- spatchcock.

65
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,442
But you did it down the breast
and not down the back.

66
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:24,810
                  Correct.
                  This way,

67
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,245
           it gets a lot of that
   smoke flavor in the breast...

68
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:28,247
             -Okay.
   -...from the grill outside.

69
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:29,615
       -This is the setup.
             -Yeah.

70
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:30,983
     So, we're just gonna put it
                right on here

71
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,919
    over our burning oak logs --
          about two hours or so.

72
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:36,288
      Love it.
Only in New Orleans.

73
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,190
      All right, next up...
      -A chili garlic sauce

74
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:40,125
     to serve alongside it.
           -I dig it.

75
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:42,461
           We add some shallots.
       So, these get pounded up.

76
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:45,063
            -Next...
      -The garlic, chilies,

77
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:49,034
       raw Louisiana cane sugar,
     lime juice, and fish sauce.

78
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,570
 All that together.

79
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:54,606
I'll have that on any...
      bath mat.

80
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,975
          So, we got our chicken
  all glazed up here with honey,

81
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,578
           butter, and some more
          of that chicken spice.

82
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,613
Okay. And this is one of
the staples of the house.

83
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,048
                 Definitely.

84
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,483
       This is my favorite thing
         that we ever cook here.

85
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:06,518
                Some of that
             chili garlic sauce.

86
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,287
            And it gets finished
  with a little French sea salt.

87
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,025
I'll tell you what --
 that's good eatin'.

88
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:15,527
 I got a sweet glaze
 and smoke taking me

89
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,729
into great Southern chicken,
and all of a sudden,

90
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,799
I come into fish sauce
    and chilies.

91
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,401
                    Yeah.
            And, I mean, I think

92
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:24,570
               that it bridges
         the Louisiana influence

93
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:26,438
              and the Southeast
              Asian influence.

94
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,507
I don't know how much
   it bridges it,

95
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:33,045
as much as it creates
its own new superhighway.

96
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:35,981
  This garlic sauce
 should be bottled.

97
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:38,584
This chicken -- you get
the heat, you get the sweet,

98
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:41,587
you get the vinegar, you get
the spice, you get the salt.

99
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,289
You're setting people up to be
disappointed next time

100
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,124
  they have to eat
just regular smoked chicken.

101
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,659
Dude, that's righteous.

102
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:50,329
It should say, "A rad place
to jam and killer chicken."

103
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:51,863
Your honey
    buttered yardbird.

104
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,432
  The chicken is unbelievable.

105
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:54,566
The chili sauce --

106
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,101
           you dip it
 and you just keep coming back.

107
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,869
     You know, you can spend
   about three hours in here.

108
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,404
        I ain't lying --
        I did it before.

109
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,106
I come to Marjie's
  because it feels

110
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,774
  like you're at a dinner party
          every night.

111
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,476
 -Where did the name come from?
           -My mother.

112
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:05,877
         She passed away
       when I was younger,

113
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,913
       and we just wanted
          to honor her.

114
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,314
   -What a cool way to do it.
             -Yeah.

115
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,650
   We got Som Tam
with a knuckle chicken quarter.

116
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,752
I always tell people,
   you just got to come,

117
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,355
 you got to sit down, and eat --
          it's gonna be amazing.

118
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:18,824
 I've tried things that I would
        have never tried

119
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:20,092
    at any other restaurant.

120
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,526
           Crispy pork knuckles.

121
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,196
 There's fish sauce
on the knuckles and fresh herbs

122
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,832
that you wouldn't normally
find with Southern cuisine.

123
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,634
 All right, brother.
Tell me all about it.

124
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:29,801
We're gonna take
   these split pig feet,

125
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:30,869
               boil them off,

126
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,037
                 and get rid
           of some of that funk.

127
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,306
      -Get rid of the funk.
         -A little salt.

128
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:36,008
 While that's going, we're gonna
          make ourselves a nice,

129
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,244
  flavorful, crawfish-boil-style
     braise to cook the feet in.

130
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,679
We got three gallons of water...
            -Got it.

131
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:42,547
              ...our soy sauce,
                fish sauce...

132
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,116
Copious amounts of garlic.

133
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:47,052
   ...cut lemons, dried chilies,
             Japones, of course.

134
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,387
             -Okay.
       -And some satsumas.

135
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,554
     That's what
 I was gonna put in.

136
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,189
                    Yeah.
        That's Louisiana citrus.

137
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,358
       Some onions, and...
         -Crawfish boil.

138
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,993
 -Crawfish boil seasoning, yes.
            -Got it.

139
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,161
           We're gonna simmer it

140
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,863
      for, like, 20, 30 minutes,
              strain this out,

141
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,865
             and then cook them
            in the flavored boil

142
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,199
                for about two
        and a half, three hours.

143
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,502
  -I like me a tender hog foot.
              -Yes.

144
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,836
       Yeah, you don't want them
                  al dente.

145
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,104
And then, we'll drop
    in the fryer.

146
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,472
                  Crisp up
              the skin on them,

147
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,408
          hit them with a little
                  black pepper.
Fresh cracked.

148
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,443
     This is a mix of fish sauce
               and lime juice.

149
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:12,577
             This is cane syrup.

150
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,046
           Scallion, right here.

151
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:16,214
       Fresh chilies, torn mint,
                 torn basil,

152
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,482
          and a little cilantro.

153
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,017
Oh, you should smell it.

154
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,587
As soon as those herbs hit those
hot knuckles, they just...

155
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,656
As I'm cruising down the street,
  I'm telling you,

156
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,925
  I'm not expecting
these flavors inside of here.

157
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,226
        So, knuckles go right on

158
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,928
              and we get all of
         our goodies in there --

159
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,963
             some of the herbs,
            some of the chilies.

160
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,802
        Mmm!

161
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:39,504
I've had the Southern
delicacies of pigs feet --

162
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,806
pickled pigs feet typically
is how you get them,

163
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:41,940
 but this right here

164
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,408
 is probably one of
the best representations

165
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,643
         I've ever seen.
           -Thank you.

166
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,044
Put a completely different
    spin on them

167
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,713
  with those herbs
and that fish sauce.

168
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:51,416
It's tender, it's crispy,
unique, over-the-top flavor.

169
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:52,951
     It's using
a part of the animal

170
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:55,687
  that doesn't get
as widely recognized,

171
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,622
but I'll tell you what --
you know what you're doing.

172
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,925
        Mmm!
    I got to go.

173
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:01,093
                    Yeah.
                   See ya.

174
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:03,261
I have your crispy pig knuckles.

175
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,796
       They're so amazing.

176
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,032
   You just have to really get
    in there with your hands,

177
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,867
        take them apart,
           get sticky.

178
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,237
    The fresh herbs are real
    aromatic on your palette.

179
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,373
    You know, the fish sauce,
 the chilies, the lime juice --

180
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,607
        they're perfect.

181
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,109
     Caramel-encrusted yardbird,
                  right up.

182
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:19,845
 Every time I come here, I have
  a good meal and a good time.

183
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:22,647
Name says old school, the style
and energy says fun,

184
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,083
   the creativity
in the kitchen says respect.

185
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,753
You're given a culinary passport
right on Broad Street.

186
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:28,887
          -Thanks, man.
       -Crushed it, homes.

187
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,155
          I'll be back.
             -Cool.

188
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,824
  You're gonna love
     this place.

189
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:33,992
Up next...

190
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,093
     Let's see.
What's it have, Mase?

191
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,928
      ...another funky spot
        in New Orleans...

192
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,163
  Wow, that's dyno.

193
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,665
 ...going big and a little crazy
          with the pig.

194
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:41,700
       This is
  everybody's taco.

195
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,710
Hey, I'm here in New Orleans.

196
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:54,980
  Is this Turkey and the Wolf?

197
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,548
           Oh, great.

198
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,451
         Can I come in?

199
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:02,888
         Well, what time
        do you guys open?

200
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,222
             Peace?

201
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:06,258
     What time -- Oh, 11:00.

202
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,859
        I'm with "Diners,
       Drive-Ins & Dives."

203
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,361
    You sure I can't come in?

204
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,633
           Oh, thanks!

205
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:15,867
    Wow, it's cold out there.

206
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,569
  This is Turkey and the Wolf.

207
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,307
Cabbage salad.

208
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:23,975
     The food here is crazy
        and off the wall

209
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,077
          but familiar
      and always delicious.

210
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,546
         Lamb neck roti.

211
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,448
      They're doing things
   that nobody else is doing.

212
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,650
And a feat pulled off
  by this joker --

213
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:34,986
Mason Hereford, whose reputation
       for inventive grub

214
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,055
           has made it
     all the way to NorCal.

215
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,723
   I was shooting
"Guys Grocery Games"

216
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,992
and one of our great team
members, Tara, said,

217
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,527
"Listen, I hear you're
going to New Orleans.

218
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,796
You got to go shoot this place
called Turkey and the Wolf."

219
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,364
             Tara seems awesome.
                    Tara.

220
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,599
 What kind of food?

221
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,901
  Well, I mean, we're a sandwich
            shop based on fun...

222
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,269
       Right.

223
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,004
       ...and trying to make big
     flavors, make people happy.

224
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,439
         There's weird,
   quirky things on the menu,

225
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:57,008
but it's all executed perfectly.

226
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,710
      Two headcheese tacos.

227
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:02,280
      The hog's head tacos
      are crunchy and spicy

228
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,883
    and they have that fatty
       hog's head cheese.

229
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,251
      What are
we gonna make first?

230
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,353
           The hog's head cheese
             that's gonna go on

231
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:09,855
           our hog's head cheese
                   tacos.

232
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:11,823
All right, so we've got
this beautiful hog head.

233
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,959
              We're gonna go in
        with some water, celery,

234
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,061
       onions, carrots...
            -Got it.

235
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:18,463
              ...onion powder,
             granulated garlic,

236
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:21,032
                white pepper,
   black pepper, chili powder...

237
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,301
             -Okay.
    -...Korean chili flakes,

238
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,303
                  paprika,
              mustard powder...

239
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,072
   Copious amounts
     of garlic.

240
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,341
                ...hot sauce,
          and a little bay leaf.

241
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:31,877
First, get it rolling and then
drop it down to a simmer.

242
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,380
             10 to 12 hours and
      it should be falling apart

243
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,949
                  and ready
              to pick the meat.

244
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,652
So, we've been standing here
 for 10 to 12 hours.

245
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:44,322
     Boy, are my legs tired.
  -Yeah, and my stove is tired.

246
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,124
 Boy, we almost ran
   out of propane.

247
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,093
                   Yeah...
       and things to talk about.

248
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,628
Exactly.

249
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,796
  So, the way you know it's done
              is when the ears

250
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:52,831
         are totally broken down

251
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,332
              and you can pull
              the back jaw out.

252
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,902
Right. Okay. Got it.
That's usually my d--

253
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,203
  uh, when I pull the jaw out.
      -We've got the meat.

254
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,338
       We also have reduced down
              all that liquid.

255
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,007
                We chopped up
               some mirepoix.

256
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,041
            Some sherry vinegar.

257
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,442
             Korean chili flake.

258
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,211
            Some Creole mustard.
                Kosher salt.

259
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,113
   Fresh, ground black pepper.
        -That's the key.

260
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,447
                 Hot sauce.

261
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:12,817
             Last but not least,
         we have this reduction.

262
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,120
     Let's see.
What's it have, Mase?

263
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:16,655
            We're gonna start by
         throwing some tortillas

264
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:17,722
              on the flat top.

265
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,257
         Ours, we make in-house.

266
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,560
    This is gonna be an American
        cheese slice right here.

267
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:22,928
      Good man.

268
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,529
  Melt the cheese by steaming it
            with a little water.

269
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:25,764
What are these little
strips of deliciousness

270
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:26,798
  that I'm eating?

271
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,567
               "Strippies" --
             it's our tortillas.

272
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:29,701
                Slice 'em up.
                 We fry 'em.

273
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,069
        Yep.

274
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,137
      We make a little, sort of,
            taco spice of sorts.

275
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,538
           -Delicious.
     -And we season them up.

276
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,041
   Little bit of our hog's head.
                 Sour cream.

277
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,409
        We actually put a little
          buttermilk in there --

278
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,810
            make it extra tangy.

279
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,845
                 Hot sauce.
        Hit it with what we call

280
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,347
                "shrettuce,"
      which is shredded lettuce.

281
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,182
              We find ourselves
             pretty clever here.

282
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,850
You guys are laughing at your
  own jokes a lot.

283
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:46,785
          -Constantly.
             -Yeah.

284
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:47,986
             "Strippies" on top.

285
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,888
               Fresh jalapeño.

286
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,523
   Just coming off
    the flat top,

287
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,592
   we got a little
surface-of-the-sun hot.

288
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:59,230
You took the funky elements
of a fast-food taco --

289
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,399
    "shrettuce,"
the American cheese,

290
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,969
and the crunchy topping --
   legitimized it,

291
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,637
       making
the critical ingredients

292
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,074
refined and delicious.

293
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,209
You take the handmade tortilla

294
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:14,713
and the super-unctuous,
mega-flavor headcheese --

295
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:17,482
give it some nice hot sauce
and a little tangy crema.

296
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,351
It's the best of both worlds
  coming together.

297
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:20,752
       This is
  everybody's taco.

298
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,687
They're gonna flock-o
   for this taco.

299
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,389
         That's all we hope for.

300
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,360
Hog's head tacos.

301
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:29,761
      The hog's head cheese
         is really rich,

302
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,329
      but there's something
    about the American cheese

303
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,098
        and the hot sauce
        mixing together.

304
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,600
            -So good.
     -We got lamb coming up.

305
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,969
       I love eating here.
     It's just a fun scene.

306
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,504
Whenever you order
   at the counter,

307
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:42,340
 they give you a unique animal,
  and that's how they find you.

308
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,643
          So you'd be like, "Oh,
 this one goes to the dead bat."

309
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,212
Go ahead and take these two
 collard-green melts

310
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:48,580
       over to
  the dragon table.

311
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:49,814
       Collard-green melt.

312
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,417
This is a melty, hot,
   spicy sandwich

313
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:56,554
     that is reminiscent of,
 like, Jewish-style Philly deli.

314
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:59,958
    It's, like, a triple-decker,
          collard-green sandwich

315
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,127
         with some Reuben vibes.

316
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,261
      First thing we're gonna do

317
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,362
      is make the collard greens
                   for it.

318
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,797
  Getting after it.

319
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:09,734
          We're gonna start with
      a good spoonful of butter.

320
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,870
               Minced garlic.
             Rice wine vinegar.

321
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,072
              Red wine vinegar.
    A little Korean chili flake.

322
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,607
  That's his go-to.

323
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:16,541
              Creole seasoning.

324
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:17,976
                Black pepper.
                   Sugar.

325
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,778
                Kosher salt.
      A little water to the pot.

326
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,680
                   And add
             the collard greens.

327
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:22,814
        While these are cooking,

328
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:23,982
              we're gonna make
           the Russian dressing.

329
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,216
       Got it.

330
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,785
           So, we're gonna start
              with mayonnaise.

331
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,453
                 Chopped-up,
         pickled cherry peppers.

332
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,021
               Smoked paprika.
                  Ketchup.

333
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,090
   Let me guess --
 Korean chili flake.

334
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:33,058
             Korean chili flake.
                    Yeah.

335
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,626
                Black pepper.
                Kosher salt.

336
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:35,894
                Finished off
               with hot sauce.

337
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,062
       Now we make the sandwich.

338
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:38,296
            We have three pieces
                of rye bread.

339
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,131
         -Three pieces.
         -Three pieces.

340
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,599
               Middle slice is
              the soaker slice.

341
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:44,869
      It soaks up all the juices
        from the collard greens.

342
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,671
              Two of the slices
                 get Swiss.

343
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,707
     We're gonna add the collard
     greens to our sandwich now.

344
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:49,974
           We're gonna finish it

345
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,543
       with our Russian dressing
              and our coleslaw.

346
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:52,510
          Soaker slice.
             -Okay.

347
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:53,845
                 Here we go.

348
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:55,313
    And that's our collard-green
               melt sandwich.

349
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,716
So, everything you want
in a Reuben, but vegetarian.

350
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,819
                  Exactly.
                    Yeah.

351
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:04,022
 That cherry-pepper
Russian dressing is gangster.

352
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,857
      The slaw
  is a great foil.

353
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,425
     Of course,
  I love a Reuben,

354
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,027
but if you're going to put
something in the center,

355
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,729
you got to put something in
there that's got some texture,

356
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,130
   got some body,
   got some life.

357
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:13,765
             -Yeah.
-It's got to have some identity,

358
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,534
and the collard greens are
the perfect wingman for this.

359
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,236
  Wow, that's dyno.
        Mmm!

360
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,571
         -I'll take it.
        -All right, Chef.

361
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,507
      Nice job.
Watch out for this guy.

362
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,275
                   We have
         the collard-green melt.

363
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,610
That's a perfect
   combination

364
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:26,845
   of, like, spice and savory

365
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,847
    and just fills your mouth
       with robust flavor.

366
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,415
  And then, you have that slice
          in the middle

367
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,817
     that gets all the good
  collard-green juice in there.

368
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:34,419
           It's great.
       -Bologna sandwich!

369
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,521
       I can't understand
       how his brain works

370
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:39,290
    and how everything comes
  together and tastes so good.

371
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,892
Watch out for the turkey
    and the wolf.

372
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:41,960
      Which one
  are you gonna be?

373
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,161
        Hope I'm not the turkey.

374
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:49,534
Coming up -- prime time
 Puerto Rican in San Antonio.

375
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:51,336
        That's a different level
            right there, sister.

376
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,271
     Putting an island twist
           on nachos.

377
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,506
              I don't even know
               where to start.

378
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:57,108
      And taking pork chops
       into new territory.

379
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,343
             I've been to a lot
               of restaurants.

380
00:12:58,345 --> 00:12:59,410
       I've never seen that cut.

381
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:00,578
               I've never seen
             that presentation.

382
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:07,218
My dance team in the hallway
are the best, by the way.

383
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,787
     These guys
   are priceless.

384
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,825
  So, I'm here in the southeast
   side of San Antonio, Texas,

385
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,027
      and I got to tell ya,
  I have talked more people out

386
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,862
 of getting into the restaurant
 business than you can imagine,

387
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,631
  especially if they don't have
      a ton of experience,

388
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:20,665
    but listen to this story.

389
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,233
This girl comes from Puerto Rico

390
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:25,036
 and gets her degree in Medical
     Imaging in New Mexico,

391
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,404
        and then she goes
       and teaches school,

392
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,039
      and all of a sudden,
      on a whim, she says,

393
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,108
       "I'm gonna open up
   a Puerto Rican restaurant."

394
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,943
      You know what I say?
             No way.

395
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,378
          But she did,
      and she's killing it.

396
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,748
       This is Luna Rosa.

397
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,249
              Guavate, table 1.

398
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,884
Every time I bring folks
   over here,

399
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,419
   all I get is rave reviews.

400
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,154
              Two more minutes
            on that seafood mix.

401
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,757
    This is like Puerto Rico
         in South Texas.

402
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,859
       You don't get stuff
    like this anywhere else.

403
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,261
And you don't hear
 stories like Iris Ornelas'

404
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:51,462
       most places either.

405
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:52,597
So, how did the restaurant
       start?

406
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:53,765
You stopped teaching?

407
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,400
               After 25 years,
              I stopped teach--

408
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,035
You taught for 25 years?!

409
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,070
     Now I'm doing what I wanted
           to do when I grew up.

410
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,438
   The whole time,
you wanted to be a chef?

411
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,873
                   This is
            what I wanted to do.

412
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,142
    So now she's doing it --
      firing up traditional

413
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:07,745
 Puerto Rican recipes alongside
     her own creative spins.

414
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,180
The Caribbean nachos.

415
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,715
             This is
    my favorite thing to get

416
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,550
      'cause it's not like
      your typical nachos.

417
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:15,119
That's right -- no simple
  chips and cheese here.

418
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:19,290
    This is plantains loaded
       with culinary plus.

419
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,492
     The first thing we're gonna
              make is the base

420
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,162
  for every Puerto Rican food --
                the sofrito.

421
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:26,497
    The base -- it has recao.
             -Recao.

422
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,900
             Most people call it
                  culantro.

423
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,802
       Very similar to cilantro.

424
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:32,036
                  Some oil.

425
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,038
                  Blend it.
        Put the onions in there.

426
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,107
    -That's a lot of garlic.
            -Garlic.

427
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:37,342
That's the foundation
   of everything.

428
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:38,576
           That's the foundation
               of everything.

429
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,044
     All right.

430
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,145
         Now we're going to make
         the brew for the beans.

431
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,547
           -The what?
      -We call it the brew.

432
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,916
           -I like it.
   -First, add some olive oil.

433
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:46,851
                   Bacon.
              And then, garlic.

434
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,386
      -Some of the sofrito.
            -Sofrito.

435
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,121
                 The onions.
             Green bell peppers.

436
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,389
         Add some salt.
             -Okay.

437
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,191
        Annatto -- or achiote --

438
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:56,761
    powder to give it some color
           and some good flavor.

439
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,096
And then, what is this?

440
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,197
              That is pumpkin.

441
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,531
I've made a lot of beans.

442
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,066
   I've never put
   pumpkin in it.

443
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,903
           Puerto Rican beans --
        most people add pumpkin,

444
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,537
                and it's just
              not any pumpkin.

445
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:07,772
      It's Puerto Rican --
   -It's not just any pumpkin.

446
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,374
           Puerto Rican pumpkin.

447
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:11,309
   Oh, of course,
it's Puerto Rican pumpkin.
           Puerto Rican pumpkin.

448
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:12,543
 That's all I carve
    at Halloween.

449
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,045
          Add some tomato sauce.

450
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:17,282
       Top it with water so that
   it can boil for a little bit.

451
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:18,216
              Dry pinto beans.

452
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,384
             -Right.
             -Salt.

453
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,486
          More sofrito.
       -Green bell pepper.

454
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,521
         -And the onion.
   -How long is this gonna go?

455
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:26,291
       -For about an hour.
     -And then what happens?

456
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,927
       We're gonna add that brew
            to our cooked beans.

457
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,562
And that's just the beans,
just as a side dish?

458
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,830
          -Just -- yes.
         -A lot of work.

459
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,666
              Now we're making
               the pork roast.

460
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:35,767
            We call it pernil --

461
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,535
              very traditional
               in Puerto Rico.

462
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:41,539
           We have salt, garlic,
           pepper, oregano, oil.

463
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,608
          Rub the pork.
              -Wow.

464
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,711
    They're gonna go in the oven
            for about six hours.

465
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:47,812
What's our next step?

466
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,814
              A Hatch red chili
               for our nachos.

467
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:50,782
             -Hatch?
         -Hatch -- yes.

468
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:51,950
                 And that's
              not Puerto Rican,

469
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,885
              but my husband is
              from New Mexico,

470
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:56,354
              so I had to have
         something here for him.

471
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,522
So, give me the rundown.

472
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,757
                   This is
          the Hatch chili puree.

473
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,060
      Salt, garlic, and oregano.

474
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,594
      And a little bit of water.

475
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:06,331
    And then, it's going to boil
             until it thickens.

476
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,434
And on top of these nachos,
we're gonna use plantains?

477
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:12,103
         -Yes -- fried.
           -I like it.

478
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:14,572
Now we're gonna build them --
the Caribbean nachos.

479
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:15,773
             -Okay.
         -Add the beans.

480
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:16,941
    Chili sauce.

481
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,509
        Pork.
       Cheese.

482
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,211
     In the oven
for about five minutes.

483
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,312
         To let the cheese melt,

484
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,547
           and then bring it out
               and garnish it?

485
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,349
        Yes.
  Luna Rosa sauce.

486
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:25,550
     The recao.

487
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,518
 And there are your
  Caribbean nachos.

488
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,655
              I don't even know
               where to start.

489
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,790
                    Mmm!
       The pork is super tender.

490
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,125
          Plantains are crunchy.

491
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,460
     For anybody that hasn't had
                 a plantain,

492
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:38,663
                this would be
   a great way to experience it.

493
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,098
          Some of the best beans
                  I've had.

494
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,933
   Now, that's a different level
            right there, sister.

495
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:43,835
                Great flavors
             and a big portion.

496
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,703
                  I can see
           why people are happy.

497
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,939
      Definitely the nachos
          is my go-to.

498
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:50,008
The pork is really, really good.

499
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,843
     Oh, the best, the best.

500
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,511
            Ropa Vieja, table 2.

501
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,812
What makes the place
     so special?

502
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,247
     They treat you like family.

503
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,548
        Everybody's family here.

504
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,017
He's not kidding.

505
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:02,520
     Iris' husband, Manuel,
 and two sons, Amadeus and Omar,

506
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,022
  are in on the action as well.

507
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,456
They invested their time,

508
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,458
     efforts traveling back
         to Puerto Rico

509
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,861
  to get the recipes from home.

510
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,729
Like this beast of a meal.

511
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,799
When it came in, I saw the size.
  I was just completely amazed.

512
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,300
     Holy moly.

513
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,202
I don't think I've ever seen
  a chop like that.

514
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,639
It looks like a cross
between a Halloween mask

515
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,508
and some meat dreadlocks.

516
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,575
  That's dangerous.

517
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:25,610
...when we come back.

518
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,850
At Luna Rosa
  in San Antonio, Texas,

519
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,987
   former teacher Iris Ornelas
     is schooling the locals

520
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:37,822
          on authentic
      Puerto Rican cooking.

521
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:39,057
             Cuban with sweets.

522
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,625
           I always kept telling
                 my husband,

523
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,760
    "I want to own a restaurant.
              I want to cook."

524
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,295
 So, you always had
the restaurant in your head.

525
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,763
                  Yes, yes.

526
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:48,533
    So, she left her 25-year
teaching career and went for it.

527
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,568
              So, I went home,
         told my husband, and --

528
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,769
"Hey, guess what, honey?

529
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:52,937
    We're in the
restaurant business."

530
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,405
             Yes. "We're opening
               a restaurant."

531
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,808
      And they're going big
         with this dish.

532
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,342
      The Chuleta Kan-Kan.

533
00:17:58,344 --> 00:17:59,510
This is like

534
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,612
         the Flintstone
  brontosaurus-type pork chop.

535
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,681
Once you mix it with
 the white rice and the beans,

536
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,850
            it's like
    a perfect, perfect plate.

537
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:07,718
            We are going to make
              Chuleta Kan-Kan.

538
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,353
             -Okay.
    -It's the big pork chop.

539
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,855
     Holy moly.

540
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:12,623
I don't think I've ever seen
  a chop like that.

541
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,092
                    Yeah.
            They're very unique.

542
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,493
You've got the pork chop.

543
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,361
  This is the back.
Now you come down the side.

544
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,863
        Here's your ribs.
         -That's a rib.

545
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,098
        Wow.

546
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,599
This thing is just riddled
    with flavor.

547
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:25,103
The only challenge to this
is how to cook this all together

548
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,605
and not have these loins
become dry by the time

549
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,408
     these sides
and rib areas become tender.

550
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,777
               So, that's why
               we brine them.

551
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,213
            Add salt.
    -Just a tiny bit of salt.

552
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,181
              -Yes.
-So, these are brined overnight.

553
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,850
             Next, we are going
               to season them.

554
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,318
              Salt and oregano.

555
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,186
                Garlic salt.
                  Sofrito.

556
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,855
          And then oil.
             -Okay.

557
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:45,523
       And why
 are we making two?

558
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:47,391
       Well, I guess one for you
               and one for me.

559
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,759
 Sounds good to me.

560
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,294
      Okay, so now, we are going
             to add the annatto,

561
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,497
                 especially
               around the edge

562
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:56,200
     because we want the annatto
   to make the skin very crispy.

563
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:59,704
The annatto seed is ground up
to make the achiote powder

564
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:03,641
   to give a nice,
beautiful, red hue to this.

565
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,409
     Then, we're gonna bake them
          for 15 minutes at 350.

566
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:06,811
  For 15 minutes --
     that's it?

567
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,514
       Because then, after that,
           we fry them to order.

568
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:10,715
           Let's see it, sister.

569
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:13,084
We're gonna eat this
pork chop with white rice.

570
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:15,219
     Garnish it
  with some recao.

571
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,088
      The beans
  with the pumpkin.

572
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,289
  Sweet plantains.

573
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,424
     Garnish it
  with chimichurri.

574
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,726
And you're ready to go.

575
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,761
         When are the other guys
               gonna show up?

576
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,062
The ones that are gonna
share this with you?

577
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,464
             -Yeah.
         -I don't know.

578
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:28,132
 -The rest of the football team.
     -You need to call them.

579
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,472
        Well, I'll tell you this
            right off the bat --

580
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,841
              that's dangerous.

581
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,142
         Chimichurri's dynamite.

582
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:40,278
    The presentation, of course,
                 is amazing.

583
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,915
            The meat on the bone
        surrounded by the fat...

584
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:45,183
                    Mmm.

585
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,651
         When you can get a bite
              of the pork chop

586
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:50,855
            and the...chicharrón
                all together,

587
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,423
             that's prime time.

588
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:53,858
                    Mmm!

589
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,793
       But I don't even know why
       you go to all that effort

590
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:58,229
             to serve that pork

591
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:01,532
                when the rice
            and beans are money.

592
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,835
 This just wrecks rice and beans
        for every other culture.

593
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:07,004
                    Mmm!
         I'd eat that every day.

594
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,406
             I've been to a lot
               of restaurants.

595
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:09,774
       I've never seen that cut.

596
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:11,142
               I've never seen
             that presentation.

597
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:13,744
         It's fantastic.
           -All right!

598
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:17,181
It's crunchy, yet
 the inside is full of flavor.

599
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,383
 How they do it, I have no idea.

600
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,985
Mofongo seafood mix!

601
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:22,853
You know what you're
   getting here

602
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,655
     is delivered with love
        from Puerto Rico,

603
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:25,823
     and it's very evident.

604
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:29,093
           For a Medical Imaging
             graduate, mother...

605
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,228
     A teacher.

606
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,064
    ...teacher turned restaurant
               owner and chef,

607
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,132
               you definitely,
      definitely did that right.

608
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:37,535
     Thank you.

609
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:40,004
 So, was this a great road trip
            or what?

610
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,372
      But don't you worry.

611
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:44,041
I got plenty more joints to find
     all over this country.

612
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,309
     I'll be looking for you
            next time

613
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:48,379
           on "Diners,
       Drive-Ins & Dives"!

614
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:49,880
              Okay.
    -I'm gonna wash my hands.

615
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,082
So, first we're gonna
cook off the funk...

616
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,883
            -Mm-hmm.
 -Oh, I got it, Cap -- I got it!

617
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:54,585
          You just go!
     -Thanks. Appreciate ya!

618
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,520
       Right. So, boil it
   and then add the spaghetti

619
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:59,257
 with the eggs and the cupcake.
             Got it!
