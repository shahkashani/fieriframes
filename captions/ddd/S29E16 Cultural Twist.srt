This is out there, bro.         

121
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:13,785
I mean, this is big flavor,     
super-crispy, it's tangy,

00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,188

How do you eat it?              
                  I use a spoon.

           What rules are there?

00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:23,675

"Okay, ground up cheeseburger."

   of both dishes

223
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,929

what its supposed to taste like.

226
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,936
        And that ends up        
        being delicious.        

227
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,473
   The dill pickle on the top   
    just makes it authentic.    

228
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,942
  Is it fried rice              
and a cheeseburger together?    

229
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,610
             It's got everything
              but french fries. 

230
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,745
Everything but french fries.

283
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,057
We're going to do my brown sauce
for the Wienerschnitzel.        

284
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,258
I buy an inside round           
and I trim it all off.          

285
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,794
              You make the meat 
           for different dishes,

286
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:58,196
    and then you reserve the jus
     to make for your schnitzel.

287
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,597
      Exactly.                  

288
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,332
I start with chopped celery,    
carrots, sweet garlic.          

289
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,668
                    Some garlic.
Onions, tomatoes.

             Mirepoix plus plus.

291
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,006
 Black pepper, salt,            
and pickling spices.            

292
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,608
You get the roast in,           
and more of the seasonings.     

293
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,410
          In the oven, how long?
An hour and a half.             

294
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:13,745
     And then we'll take the jus
                 from this,     

295
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,213
                 and that's     
             for the schnitzel. 

296
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:18,817
And then I add coffee, burgundy 
or red wine, ketchup, and water.

297
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,218
                    Nice.       
           See that little move?

298
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,753
Then I get it back in the oven  
 and juice it down.             

299
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,089
           Draining that, and...

300
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,958
Tighten up with our roux        
for the schnitzel sauce.        

301
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,426
                What's next?    

302
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,161
We're seasoning the flour       
for wienerschnitzel with salt,  

303
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,763
crack pepper, and garlic.       

304
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,831
                  You love      
             that garlic powder.
   I do.                        

305
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,500
This is a schnitzel,            
    and it's done               

306
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,101
by my father's butcher.         

307
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,703
He takes all of his trimmings   

308
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:41,172
  and then runs it              
through a tenderizer.           

309
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,707
                      I love it.
 Dip it in the egg.             

310
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,642
And I only dredge it            
    on one side.                

311
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,578
    Really? I've never seen just
            the one-side dredge.

312
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,580
Yeah, no. I don't want          
that much flour on it.          

313
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:50,982
   I'm not making               
chicken fried steak.            

314
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,316
              So that goes down.
    Yeah.                       

315
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,386
      Flip it over, that's it --
               simple, simple.  

316
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:57,722
Then I got some potatoes,       
asparagus that I've grilled up, 

317
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,992
my schnitzel, brown sauce it,   
garnish it with a lemon.        

318
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,127
        And some capers to boot.

319
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,361
        Yeah.                   

320
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:10,335
 It's a very simple dish, but it
 eats so delicate and so tender.

321
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,270
             You're getting all 
            of that rich flavor.

322
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:18,076
    Just the attention to detail
      you take in the schnitzel.

323
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,677
                The perfectly   
              cooked asparagus, 

324
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,681
          beautiful pan-finished
         finger length potatoes,

325
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:26,016
    and the piece de resistance,
          really, is this gravy.

326
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,354
Try it with some lemon          
     and caper.                 

327
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,222
             As soon as you add 
         that little bit of acid

328
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:34,291
       and the little brightness
         of one of those capers.

329
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,428
            This would be a dish
           I would come to enjoy

330
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,829
         a couple times a month.

331
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,964
                 Fantastic.

    -It's perfect every time.   
         -Capers please.        

336
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,442
     It's the little nuances    
  that make all the difference. 

337
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:51,976

    Pastry chef.

00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,223
     SINGH: 14.                 

458
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:01,359
This machine makes perfect      
    dough balls.                

459
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:02,760
         What are we making now?

460
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,629
 We're going to make            
a garam masala for sauces.      

461
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,966
 Pomegranate seeds,             
  bay leaf, mace...             

462
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:09,968
      The outside of the nutmeg.

463
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,036
 ...cinnamon sticks,            
  brown flax seed,              

464
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,170
  white flax seed.              

465
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,372
             You got the rainbow
              of the flax seed. 

466
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:17,642
Yeah. Nutmeg, green cardamom,   
 and black cardamom.            

467
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,110
                 Any Greek?     

468
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,045
       Dude, we have just robbed
       the Indian spice counter.

469
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:22,713
 Cumin seed, cloves.            

470
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,515
Black pepper, coriander.        

471
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,717
Fennel seed.                    
         That's a lot of flavor.

472
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,252
             You grind it once, 
               and then twice?  

473
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,588
Yeah. No we're going to make    
the honey crepe baste.          

474
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,590
                        Great.  
  Wish Garam masala             
    with Ginger.                

475
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,192
      -Roasted and ground?      
             -Yeah.             

476
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:39,464
Oregano, basil, red pepper      
flakes, paprika, olive oil,     

477
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,666
then we will rest it            
     for a week.                

478
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,401
                 So we made     
             the garam masala...
   Yeah.                        

479
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:44,802
               ...then we made  
                the paste --    

480
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,070
         all the more to make to
           to make the on sauce.

481
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,805
     One sauce.                 

482
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,407
We still got a couple           
  more steps to go.             

483
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,341
             You're killing me, 
                   Smalls.      

484
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:55,146
    Whole tomatoes, cumin seeds,
         roasted garlic, ginger,

485
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:58,216
             paprika, add water,
          cook about four hours.

486
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:00,018
What's the next step?           
                The onion gravy.

487
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,755
Oil, cumin seeds, roasted garlic
           ginger, salt, onions,

488
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:08,959
water, paprika powder, turmeric,
        let it cook for 7 hours.

489
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,294
Onion gravy?                    
                 Onion gravy.   

490
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,229
Goes in the sauce?              
              Goes in the sauce.

491
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,432
The paste we made earlier, we're
  going to put in there with it.

492
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,567
    Add honey in there, as well.
                Let it cook.    

493
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,302
This is the honey curry?        
             It is honey curry. 

494
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:19,837
     I like it.                 

495
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,838
Next up, we're going            
to make the chicken tikka.      

496
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,040
             So chicken breasts.

497
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,842
  Homemade yogurt,              
lemon juice, coloring.          

498
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,177
             Got to make it red.

499
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,779
Chili powder, paprika, salt,    
 garlic, and ginger.            

500
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,114
      Roasted garlic and ginger.

501
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,582
           What are you thinking
                 back there?    

502
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,050
 Little bit of oil.             

503
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,252
So we are going to let it       
sit for 10 hours at least.      

504
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,654
                    Okay.       

505
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,789
I roast at about 500 degrees    
for 25 to 30 minutes.           

506
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,657
               And now we make  
                 the pizza?     

507
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,125
  Exactly.                      
                I'm starving.   

508
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:43,127
We take the dough ball --       
a little bit of oil.            

509
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:44,095
 Cooks a little bit.            

510
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,530
          Oh, puts a little heat
                   on it.       

511
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:46,797
We take the curry sauce.        

512
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,066
        Fresh-grated mozzarella.

513
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,668
Chicken on, roasted fresh       
garlic, fresh Ginger.           

514
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,869
              It's flavor city  
                 right here.    

515
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:55,672
         Didn't see that coming.

516
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,341
I still need green onions.      

517
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,010
              The 80s said that 
          I'd impeach the folks.

518
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:03,481
Basil, cilantro, jalapenos,     
garlic salt, fenugreek          

519
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:05,149
                In the oven.    
            Look how excited is.

520
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,750
 Two, three minutes.            

521
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,687
It looks like you went and stole
everything off of the pizza line

522
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,088
and put it on one pizza.        

523
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,692
            That's why I call it
             the Bhinda special.

524
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,026
             What do you think? 

525
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,696
  I think I'll have             
   another piece.               

526
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,833
It's actually going to wreck    
pizza for me for a while.       

527
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,835
You've brought such depth       
   and such flavor              

528
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:27,037
 and such creativity            
  and new textures,             

529
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,305
like the cauliflower.           

530
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,507
You get a touch of the oregano  
and the basil in that sauce,    

531
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,509
a little bit of the Italian,    
and then you come heavy         

532
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,312
with everything from            
the fenugreek to the cardamom.  

533
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,914
The naan is nice, I mean,       
     it's thin,                 

534
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,382
neopolitan-style crust.         

535
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,251
So you get that nice cracker    
crunch that you want out of it, 

536
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:41,986
but it's still tender.          

537
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,124
My expectations were high.      

538
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,592
You beat my expectations.       

539
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,126
                 Thank you.     

540
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,661
         Bhinda special.        

541
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,530
These are good friends of mine  
from a company called Camp Chef,

542
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:53,864
    and they know               
a lot about cooking.            

543
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,733
So I think they would be        
  the perfect ones              

544
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,802
to ask what they think          
    of the pizza.               

545
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,471
  It's spicy, but there's, like,
           a really good flavor.

546
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,806
        I really like the crust.

547
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,874
   I would say my favorite pizza
               I've ever had.   

548
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,743
           -Seriously?          
      -I love Indian food.      

549
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,345
  It's the marriage             
     of the two.                

550
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:09,480
              -Yes!             
           -Margarita.          

551
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,748
  When they do American pizzas, 
       they do their own.       

552
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,350
        And then they do        
        create your own.        

553
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,551
          You guys are brothers,
                 I take it?     

554
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,220
             -Twins.            
              -No.              

555
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,156
       Curry Pizza catered      
         for our school,        

556
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,957
     and these kids go like,    
       "Man, this is great      

557
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,492
          cheese pizza.         
        Where's it from?"       

558
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,094
             WOMAN:             
They have the mozzarella cheese,
       the paneer cheese,       

559
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,831
  which has got a firm texture, 
        but it's creamy.        

560
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,366
                  Next one      
             we're making is... 

561
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,234
Glaze paneer.                   
            Walk me through it. 

562
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:31,502
The honey curry sauce           
  we made earlier.              

563
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,037
              In the same dough 
                that we made.   

564
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,572
        Yup,                    
those are all our cheese.       

565
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,106
             Paneer.            
      -Do you make it here?     

566
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,575
    Yes.                        
            They make the yogurt
                   at home      

567
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:38,776
               know they make
