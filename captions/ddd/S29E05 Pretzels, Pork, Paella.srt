00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,267
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,735
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:06,538
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,539
          This trip...          

5
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:08,807
                     Ho!        

6
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:11,677
...we're digging into everything
    from pretzels and pork...   

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,345
             This is next level.

8
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,880
    ...to prime-time paella.    

9
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:16,081
      Gorgeous.                 

10
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,282
     Like in Little Rock...     

11
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,283
               I'm in heaven.   

12
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,885
         ...where things        
     are getting twisted...     

13
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:22,554
       Does somebody on the team
             have octopus arms? 

14
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:25,023
          ...along with         
    some international flair.   

15
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,892
    Look at that!               

16
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:29,161
Plus farm-to-table in Montana...

17
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,962
              Come to Bozeman,  
             that's outstanding.

18
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,697
  ...that's worth waking up to. 

19
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,433
          That's one of the best
              breakfast dishes  

20
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:35,567
         I've had on "Triple D."

21
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:36,701
                I mean, wow!    

22
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,570
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

23
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,973
      on "Diners, Drive-ins     
            & Dives."           

24
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:47,246
                     ♪♪         

25
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:53,519
                     ♪♪         

26
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:55,053
So I'm here in Bozeman, Montana,

27
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,055
     right across the street    
 from Montana State University. 

28
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,057
  Now, we've all heard the term 
     "farm-to-table," right?    

29
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,192
     Well, I'm here to check    
           out a joint          

30
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:01,793
where a husband and wife team --

31
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,462
     well, they're taking it    
    to a whole nother level.    

32
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:06,531
  You see, because they own the 
 farm and they have the tables. 

33
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,567
   This is Storm Castle Cafe.   

34
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,205
  Grandma's enchilada, waffle,  
     please, in the window!     

35
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:14,806
   This is the best breakfast   
           in Bozeman.          

36
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,474
       I have                   
the Monte Cristo for you.       

37
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:17,809
              WOMAN: Thank you. 

38
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,811
  FIERI: This isn't your average
             breakfast-and-lunch

39
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,980
          kind of joint, this is
             a little [whistles]

40
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,148
             -Yeah.             
        -...over the top.       

41
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,750
It's always packed in here.     
Everyone's always here.         

42
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,753
  FIERI: Maybe because Bozeman  
   native Chef Scott Peterson   

43
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,290
      is serving up a spot      
      that feels like home.     

44
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,358
This area's changed a lot       
in the last 10 years.           

45
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,026
                          Right.
And so, we just wanted          
      to create                 

46
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,628
    an experience               
that was an authentic           

47
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,363
 Montana experience             
that you might have got         

48
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:39,831
sometime in the past.           

49
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,567
And while wife, Nicole, heads up
     the front of the house,    

50
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,771
  her Mexican heritage mixes in 
    to the kitchen, as well.    

51
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,239
       I have the pocampo.      

52
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,107
 I think this is Scott's version
       of the chimichanga.      

53
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,909
     I've never had anything    
  like it anywhere. It's great. 

54
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,110
 So our first thing             

55
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,444
that we're gonna make           
is gonna be our pocampo,        

56
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,913
  which starts out              
with our homemade carnitas.     

57
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,581
We use either pork loin         
or pork shoulder depending      

58
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,517
    on what we have in-house.   
    -What you have available.   

59
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,518
You want to dice it up          
in some fairly large cubes.     

60
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,454
It gives it an opportunity      
to be more succulent.           

61
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,989
             -Okay.             
-We get a pan with the bacon fat

62
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,191
 that's already hot.            
Season it with salt and pepper. 

63
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:07,725
             That's all gonna go
              till it's tender? 

64
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,394
      Not till                  
it's fall-apart tender          

65
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:10,729
'cause we're gonna do           
another braise on it after this.

66
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:11,463
            -Got it.            
    -So we have cumin here...   

67
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,598
                    Okay.       

68
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,132
...granulated garlic,           
  dried cilantro...             

69
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,167
                Chili powder.   

70
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,069
...oregano that's dried,        
a touch of cinnamon.            

71
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,337
       -A little paprika.       
  -This is paprika, for color.  

72
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,139
      Now, this is where it gets
               interesting --   

73
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,674
     orange juice and milk?     
             -Yeah.             

74
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,275
There's some lactic acids       
     in the milk                

75
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,611
that are gonna help break       
down our pork a little bit,     

76
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,145
and then it's gonna be          
  the citric acids              

77
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,947
as well that are gonna          
offer up a bit of sweetness.    

78
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,149
                 How long's     
              this gonna cook?  

79
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,883
It takes another 45 minutes     
     to an hour.                

80
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,151
                  Next up?      

81
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,486
We call it a fire-roasted       
     salsa here,                

82
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,688
but we're actually doing it     
  on the flat top.              
                        Okay.   

83
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,423
Green onions that we're         
gonna char off, jalapeños,      

84
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,225
fire-roasted tomatoes,          
       onions.                  

85
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,627
        -Garlic go down?        
    -Yeah. Garlic goes here.    

86
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,095
As soon as they're charred,     
we hit them in the pot,         

87
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,564
we let that simmer until        
the veggies are broken down.    

88
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:46,765
             And then just when 
              they're finished? 

89
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,433
         A little salt.         
      -Yeah, and cilantro.      

90
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:51,303
             Immersion blender. 

91
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:52,437
Next up is our queso.           

92
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,572
              Queso, you gonna  
               make it or not?  

93
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:54,506
        Yeah.                   

94
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:58,243
                  'Kay, so      
             you gonna make it? 

95
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,711
So we start off with            
a little bit of bacon fat.      

96
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,179
       For some reason, it seems
         like you have bacon fat

97
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,714
     running in your veins.     
  -It's a pretty common theme.  

98
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:04,048
   We're gonna add              
   our flour to it              

99
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,383
to create a little bit          
     of a roux.                 

100
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,785
This is our pico de gallo       
that we make in-house.          

101
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,253
   We're gonna add              
a little bit of beer.           

102
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:09,388
            -Come on!           
       -So we're gonna let      

103
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,588
     this simmer                
so it starts to come out.       

104
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,789
  Add a little bit              
    of our milk.                

105
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,191
So what we got here is          
the cheese that melts.          

106
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,993
                    Yeah!       
          And a little American?

107
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,394
A little bit of American,       
   just for body.               

108
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,263
Just give it a whisk,           
let it melt until it's smooth.  

109
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:19,131
              Done.             
             -Okay.             

110
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,599
          Make it happen, Cap'n.

111
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:21,666
We're just gonna egg-wash       
this whole tortilla.            

112
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:22,868
    Jack cheese,                
   cheddar blend.               

113
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,602
And then we have some potatoes, 
    season them,                

114
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,671
    sear them off               
with peppers, onions.           

115
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,072
             Those are dynamite!

116
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,741
And then our carnitas           
    pork mixture.               

117
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,410
    Fold it over.               
  We roll it tight.             

118
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:32,678
And then after we get           
  to this point...              

119
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,146
     -Fry them for service?     
            -Correct.           

120
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:35,546
     Let's put it together, man.
                 I'm hungry.    

121
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,349
Here's what we do now           
   to finish this.              

122
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,286
These are our signature         
cowboy beans, we call them.     

123
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:43,155
Pinto beans cooked off          
with a lot of bacon fat,        

124
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:44,289
 onions, jalapeños.             

125
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,224
    A little bit                
  of cotija cheese.

      People like that breakfast
                 for dinner.    

127
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,194
               This is a meal.

129

 The whole farm-to-table aspect 
     comes together so well.

00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,475
             FIERI:             
 'Cause much of the ingredients 

152
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,610
    are coming from the farm    

153
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,679
 Scott and his parents have run 
        since the 1970s.        

154
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:42,080
We raise the majority           
    of the pork.                

155
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,482
             -Okay.             
  -We have a herd of red Angus. 

156
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:44,950
 We have a garden --            
      zucchini,                 

157
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,352
 cucumbers, squash,             
all that kind of stuff.         

158
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:50,088
      But occasionally, his     
  do-it-yourself attitude leads 

159
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,957
  to should-have-paid-someone-  
     else-to-do-it results.     

160
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,093
I farrow pigs, right,           
which means that these sows     

161
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,695
     are gonna have babies.

163
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,299
     I find out                 
  I'm having pigs.              

164
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,368
I cruise out to the farm,       
 we deliver 16 pigs.            

165
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,569
 I get done at 10:00

166
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:05,837
   when I decided               
   to cut my hair.              

167
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,106
Except, you see this            
little streak right here?       

168
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,441
     That's where I missed.     
       -You cut yourself?!      

169
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,244
Cut myself with a pair          
     of clippers                

170
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:14,246

171
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:15,480
      I thought you were running

This is the beginning.          

216
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,122
  What we do to it              
that's a little bit different,  

217
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,657
   is that we make              
a French toast batter.          

218
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,992
We take our eggs, sugar,        

219
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,993
     we get that                
 mixed up real good,            

220
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,128
then we're gonna add            
    our vanilla,                

221
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,463
  not a lot of milk

            -Got it.            
    -It's just a light dunk.

          -Boom, boom.          
  -And then we let it crisp up. 

224
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,668
And then as it cools down,      
that sugar that was caramelized 

225
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,870
on the outside crunches         
like a crème brûlée.            

226
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,140
Then we're gonna add            
  our Swiss cheese.             

227
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:49,207
              This is your ham?

       It is.

231
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:58,150
Hit it in the batter,           
drop it in the fryer.

strawberry-rhubarb syrup        

238
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:11,696
that we made earlier.           

239
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:12,564

      So, I'm here in North     
     Little Rock, Arkansas,     

290
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,102
     just about a half mile     
     from the downtown area     

291
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,637
      to check out a joint.     

292
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,239
  Well, it's these two buddies  
      that met in college.      

293
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,840
   One was a stay-at-home dad   

294
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,509
      and the other became      
     a high school teacher,     

295
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,776
        and they decided,       
       "Hey, let's open up      

296
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,312
 a brewery and serve pretzels." 

297
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:08,580
       Well, then they met      
      this chef that said,      

298

    "Let's expand the menu."    

299
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,782

317
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,152
         Chef Gina Jones        
     to spice up their menu.    

318
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:49,888

  Southern food that could mix  
      with some soul foods

         and some Cajun

    to master the O.G. recipe

00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,331
    the boys first paired up    
        with their pints.       

323
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,099
    Here is the pretzel tree.   

324
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,034
   They give you a good amount  
           of options           

325
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,437
    with the different salts    
    and sauces you can have.    

326
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,039
    It's almost like ordering   
   10 different meals in one.   

327
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,573
         Alright, so what are we
         gonna make first, Chef?

328
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,176

    the pretzel.

00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,844

         I used to sell pretzels

330

        when I was a little kid.

331

335
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,920
             with an easier way 
            to get the flour in?
I know.                         

336
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,588

                on the side.    

337
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,589
                 Keep going.    
                 Keep going.    

338
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:25,590
                 You got it.    
                    Okay.       

339
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:28,126
 Salt, sugar, yeast.            

340
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,395
          So, we mix all the dry
             ingredients first. 

341
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,130
 And then slowly put            
your water in there.            

342
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,599
   And how many pretzels are you
          guys making in a week?

343
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,135
  Anywhere from 600             
to 700 pretzels a week.         

344
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,739
       Does somebody on the team
             have octopus arms? 

345
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,040
   Now my butter.               

346
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,340
 It's gonna take us             
about a good 30 minutes         

347
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,809
    to get it all               
   mixed together.              

348
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,077
             Then we let it rest
                for how long?   

349
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,345
   An hour or so.               

350
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,547
    Roll it out.                
   Wrap it around.              

351
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,549
            And we make one type
              of pretzel dough, 

352
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,084
               but we do a lot  
             of different sauces

353
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,952
  and a lot of different salts. 
              -Yes.             

354
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,354
         Alright, we're gonna go
               to a water bath  

355
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,089
   with a little baking soda.   
           -Yes, sir.           

356
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,758
   We'll cook them              
for about 15 minutes.           

357
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,427
While those are cooking,        
we're making sauces.            

358
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,962
          We're first gonna make
            our hickory mustard.

359
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,765
              Mustard, ketchup, 
                brown sugar,    

360
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,634
          "watch your sister" --
              Worcestershire... 

361
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,235
 "Watch your sister"            
       sauce.                   

362
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,505
               ...apple cider,  
    chili powder, garlic powder.

363
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,372
             -Okay.             
  -Liquid smoke goes on there.  

364
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,774
         This will cook for like
                 10 minutes.    

365
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,309
Next one we're making is, what? 
 The honey mustard?             

366
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,445
         Yes, sir, and this goes
       with our Migrate pretzel.

367
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,446
     "Migraine"?                

368
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:22,980
               Not "migraine"   
              like a headache.  

369
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,249
          "Migrate" like a bird.

370
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:25,583
     -Okay, Migrate pretzel.    
              -Yes.             

371
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:26,984
       Got it.                  
       Got it.                  

372
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,119
   -So you got mustard here...  
      -With the mayonnaise.     

373
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,387
           ...apple cider again,

374
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,456
               garlic powder,   
             put salt in there, 

375
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,391
          the honey that make it
            sweet and delicious.

376
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,859
And that one we don't           
    have to cook.               

377
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,195
              Just stir and go. 

378
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,596
                FIERI: That's   
         a nice-looking pretzel.

379
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:39,531
 We butter them up.             

380
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:40,932
             Boy, you look nice,
                  pretzel.      

381
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,334
               Oh, a different  
                buttering up.   

382
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:44,803
       And then this is gonna be
               the which one?   

383
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,137
This is the Free Range.         

384
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,072
       This is                  
the bacon salt here.            

385
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,874
          So, you grind up bacon
                 with salt?     

386
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,008
        Yes.                    

387
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,412
   This goes with               
the hickory mustard.            

388
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:55,680
    My favorite.                

389
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,281
           So, you get the bacon
               of the pretzel,  

390
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,417
      and then you get the smoke
          from the liquid smoke,

391
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,286
                so it's like    
          a smoky mustard sauce.

392
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:04,089
            -Mm-hmm.            
      -That works for sure.     

393
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,289
                Mm. Alright,    
            what's the next one?

394
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,025
      Migrate.                  
This is lavender salt.          

395
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:09,227
   This comes with              
 our honey mustard.             

396
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,697
               I'm in heaven.   

397
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,299
                Much more on    
          the traditional style.

398
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:15,966
     Both of them are screaming,
             "Drink more beer." 

399
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,368
             I think that's kind
                of the idea.    

400
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,972
            But I do have to say
             that the bacon salt

401
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:22,306
       with the hickory sauce --

402
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,708
            I think that's going
             to be my favorite. 

403
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,043
            But why don't we try
      all the rest of them, too,

404
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,377
          just so I can be sure.

405
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,779
   We can do that.              

406
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:30,248
        I like the way you roll.

407
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,582
        Migrate pretzel.        

408
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,518
      Having the different,     
        unique flavors --       

409
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,919
         it's excellent.        

410
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,721
  It's hot. It comes out fresh, 
 and you can really taste that. 

411
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,524
  -Have you always been a cook? 
              -No.              

412
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:41,059
 Someone say, "Well,            
 you enjoy cooking,             

413
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,261
but you would have to go        
to Kentucky to go to school."   

414
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,863
   And I was like,              
"I'm here in Arkansas."         

415
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:47,064
And sure enough, they finally   
 opened up a school             

416
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,399
for us here in Arkansas.        

417
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,334
         So, how long did you go
             to culinary school?

418
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:50,668
  I went to school              
    for 2 years,                

419
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,404
 and I'm going back             
to get my bachelor's.           

420
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,206
                 That's how     
              you get it done.  

421
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,675
    MAN #2: She changed what    
       they were offering.      

422
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:59,744
 She elevated it and brought it 
         to a new level.        

423
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,279
What's your favorite thing      
    on the menu?                

424
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,815
          -Gumbo fries.         
      -Gumbo cheese fries.      

425
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:06,550
Her gumbo is as good as anything
    I've had in New Orleans.    

426
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,954
   WOMAN #4: And it's all with  
       this big steak fry.      

427
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,090
 It really soaks up the juices. 

428
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,758
     -What makes good gumbo?    
              -Me.              

429
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,293
                    "Me."       
                Let's see it.   

430
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,962
  JONES: So, this is how I start
       my roux -- oil and flour.

431
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,297
       This takes anywhere from,
         like, 20 to 30 minutes.

432
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,099
    Okay, so roux               
  goes in the back.             

433
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:25,436
             Put my veggies in, 
    then the garlic, my sausage.

434
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,238
           -Andouille.          
        -Take my roux...        

435
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,306
   Nice and dark.               

436
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,508
       ...pour it over in there,
               chicken stock.   

437
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,443
          -Chili flake.         
        -Greek seasoning.       

438
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,112
            -Shrimp?            
           -Yes, sir.           

439
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,446
                  Crawfish?     
                    Yes.        

440
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:38,783
            Chicken.            
      -A little hot sauce.      

441
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,050
   Fries are done.              

442
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,586
              Cajun salt there. 

443
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:42,921
                   Cheese.      

444
