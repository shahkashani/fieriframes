1
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:03,435
I'm Guy Fieri,
  and we're rolling out

2
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:06,372
looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.

3
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:08,073
This trip...
 This is gonna be interesting.

4
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:10,275
...we're headed west.
  Of course we are.

5
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,778
...for a righteous taste of
   the Far East.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,879
Oh, my gosh!

7
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:15,681
In Las Vegas, Nevada...

8
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:16,982
That didn't just happen, did it?

9
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:18,951
...the city's first
  Japanese spot...

10
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:21,020
It's dynamite, I can see why you
 guys have been here so long.

11
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:23,522
...still rolling out
  old-school style.

12
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,791
This is, again, doing it
   the traditional way.

13
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:27,726
Then just off The Strip...

14
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,194
What are we making?!

15
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,764
...a jackpot joint tucked
  inside a casino...

16
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,232
Nicely done, my friend.

17
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:36,502
...dealing an Asian spin
 into good ol' American.

18
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:38,804
It's my grandma's secret.
No, I got it.

19
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:41,306
And in Westminster, Colorado...
  Pretty gangster.

20
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:44,176
...a unique barbecue hot spot...
 A lot going on in there.

21
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:47,379
...doing "all you can eat"
   Korean style.

22
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,181
I wish I could rent, like,
   two extra arms.

23
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,451
That's all right here,
   right now,

24
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:53,919
on "Triple D"!

25
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:10,636
You know, you say "Las Vegas,"
and everybody thinks, of course,

26
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:12,838
The Strip, but I got to
 tell you, from living here,

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,641
there's so much to find
 off the strip, like this joint,

28
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:18,877
the first Japanese restaurant
   in Las Vegas.

29
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,148
48 years and going strong,
 this is Osaka Japanese Bistro.

30
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,783
Shrimp tempura pick-up,
  please!

31
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:26,251
It's fabulous.

32
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,654
It'll ruin any other sushi
  that you'll ever eat.

33
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:30,089
White tiger!

34
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:31,890
It's got to be the most
 authentic Japanese restaurant

35
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:33,358
in the United States.

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,794
Probably because owner
   Gene Nakanishi

37
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,664
learned a thing or two from
 a real restaurant pioneer.

38
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,266
Your mom opened the restaurant?
 Yeah, she came over from Japan.

39
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,367
She originally worked in

40
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,002
the first Japanese restaurant
     in L.A.

41
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:46,071
Then came and opened the first
 one in Las Vegas?

42
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:47,506
That's correct.
Crazy.

43
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,708
That was way back in 1967,

44
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,277
and today, veteran chef
   John Barker

45
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,313
is carrying on
 the kitchen tradition...

46
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:55,814
Beef teriyaki
 pick-up, please!

47
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:59,718
...serving up authentic entrées,
 sushi, and rock-star rolls.

48
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,354
Your roppongi.
    It's a spicy tuna.

49
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,756
The sauce is just
 really zesty.

50
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,525
Oh, I could probably
   eat this till I drop.

51
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:09,995
Monster --
   big, beautiful tuna.

52
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,497
I assume from Hawaii.

53
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:13,232
This is Hawaii big-eyed tuna.
     Big-eyed tuna.

54
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,800
Okay, get after it.
  Majority of the ingredients

55
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,201
you're bringing in
    this whole fish.

56
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:17,569
The majority of them, yes.
       Really?

57
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:18,937
Now, you guys will
    break it down.

58
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,739
So, you guys kind of
   take this seriously.

59
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:23,175
Absolutely.
    When looking for

60
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:25,244
a real-deal sushi joint, this is
 what you should see happening.

61
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:26,578
Now we're gonna make this roll.

62
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,413
We're gonna start by adding
the sriracha to the bowl.

63
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,215
A meal that we make here is
called Yum Yum Sauce --

64
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,850
sweet meal.
     Yum Yum Sauce?

65
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,485
Yummy, yummy, yeah.
       Okay.

66
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,921
Sesame oil, shichimi --
 Japanese pepper --

67
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,356
soy sauce, grated garlic.

68
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,258
Mix this together
 and add the sugar.

69
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,493
I like that.
And then smelt eggs.

70
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,228
And this is a sauce with all
    the smelt eggs?

71
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,630
That's correct.

72
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,401
Just put it on a plate.

73
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:50,736
I'll just eat it off of
     the plate.

74
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:52,304
Now we're gonna make spicy tuna.

75
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,640
All right, we got our tuna here
 we chopped up,

76
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,608
then we're gonna add
 spicy tuna sauce.

77
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,244
Mix this together.
So, that is our spicy tuna.

78
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,612
Now, we're gonna make
    the roll finally?

79
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:01,947
Now, we're gonna make the roll.

80
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,248
We're gonna lay our nori down,

81
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,883
spread our rice across
 the seaweed.

82
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:07,419
Turn that over,
 add our shrimp.

83
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,955
And now our spicy tuna.
 We roll that.

84
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:11,790
This is one of the number-one
     rolls here.

85
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,859
That is our number-one
 selling roll.

86
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,527
We put more tuna on top.

87
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,862
Beautiful tuna.

88
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,031
Our trusty plastic wrapper,
and we'll press this again.

89
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,036
Now, this tataki sauce
that we made earlier.

90
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,470
Right.
Yum Yum Sauce.

91
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:28,607
Finish off with a little smelt
eggs and some green onions.

92
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:29,975
Beautiful roll.

93
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:33,979
I'll tell you, man,
    look at that.

94
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,048
Mmm!
    It's fantastic.

95
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,649
Taking the time
   to make all the sauces,

96
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,351
bring in the whole fish
    and break it down,

97
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:41,587
you guys just do it all the
 right way, man, it's dynamite.

98
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:43,422
I can see why you guys have
    been here so long.

99
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:46,191
Mmm!

100
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:47,759
Nice job, Chef.
Thank you.

101
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:50,762
Your roppongi has got
 a really complex texture to it,

102
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,532
a little spicy, sweet, and sour
  all at the same time.

103
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,067
It's an art form
 how it's presented

104
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,702
once it's getting ready
 to be served.

105
00:03:56,704 --> 00:04:00,138
What is it to have the first
 Japanese restaurant in Vegas

106
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,441
that makes you still so popular?

107
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,610
The fact that we're authentic,
  do everything old school.

108
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,044
They don't even do it in Japan
    the way we do it,

109
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,579
but it tastes better.

110
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,781
Nabeyaki udon pick-up!

111
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,750
You've got your noodles,
 your broth, your chicken.

112
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,085
It's usually got an egg in it.

113
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:15,220
It's just a wealth of variety.

114
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:17,923
It's absolutely delicious.

115
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,358
Okay, what are we on to now?

116
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,493
Okay, now we're gonna prepare
the shrimp for tempura.

117
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,095
Okay, and what's this
    going to be for?

118
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,863
Nabeyaki udon.
    The noodle dish?

119
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:25,897
Correct.
      Awesome.

120
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,132
We're gonna peel the shrimp.

121
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,734
This is gonna be interesting.
De-vein the shrimp.

122
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:30,235
Because if he does what
   I think he's gonna do,

123
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:31,803
you'll get a kick out of this.
Cut the back end.

124
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,373
Now, see.
And press it, stretch it out.

125
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,841
This kind of elongates
     the shrimp

126
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,176
and makes it more presentable,
 and the shrimp doesn't curl up

127
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,645
when you put
    the tempura batter.

128
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:40,812
Nicely done.
Thank you.

129
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,180
All right, tempura batter.

130
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,016
Tempura batter --
 ice-cold water.

131
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:46,218
Add egg yolk to it, and...

132
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,587
Whoa, egg water!

133
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,989
Nothing like a little egg water
   on a hot summer day.

134
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,791
Mix it with the tempura flour.

135
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,259
Tempura flour, okay.
Yes.

136
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,228
You gonna dredge
    your shrimp first?

137
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,529
Yes.
       Okay.

138
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,464
These pans that you have here,
    what's the story?

139
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,166
They're copper pans,
they retain the heat

140
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,402
much better than what you get
from a stainless-steel pan.

141
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:05,237
But this is, again, doing it
    a traditional way

142
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,738
and not dropping them into
     a fryer?

143
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,106
That's right.
       Dig it.

144
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,808
Now we're gonna make
 nabeyaki udon.

145
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,209
What's "nabeyaki" mean?

146
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:12,778
Nabe -- first of the pot
 that we use.

147
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,480
Okay.
Yes. Udon is udon.

148
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,615
Yes, yes.
     Got it.

149
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,383
We're gonna add the dashi
that we made earlier.

150
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,585
It's a fish stock.
Just a little bit of mirin.

151
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,554
So, this is made to order
     each time?

152
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,056
Yes.
This is -- Higashimaru

153
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:26,591
is a light soy sauce;
kombu, and a little sea salt.

154
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:30,195
And once it starts to boil,
we're gonna add bonito flakes.

155
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:31,697
That's a lot.

156
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,598
We're gonna strain this into
  our nabe.

157
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,434
And it just goes clear liquid?
     Got it.

158
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:36,868
And we're gonna add
 our udon now.

159
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,637
Chicken, fresh shiitake
  mushrooms.

160
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,205
Normally, I would put the egg in
  right now.

161
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,606
Would you care for an egg?

162
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:44,343
No egg, thank you.
     Thank you.

163
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:47,079
Fish cake, spinach,
 some green onions.

164
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:49,214
And it gets served in this
   screaming-hot bowl?

165
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,149
Yes.
And the tempura shrimp.

166
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,484
Great.
   There you go.

167
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,291
Oh, my gosh!

168
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,126
Mmm!

169
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:04,629
That broth is outrageous.

170
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,398
Mmm!

171
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,700
It is prepared perfectly.

172
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,202
I mean, that's --
  that's the way you do it.

173
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:13,038
Mmm, tempura --
    nice and light.

174
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,807
Not over-battered.

175
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,513
That didn't just happen,
     did it?

176
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:24,116
You're making it from scratch,
  treating it with respect,

177
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:26,752
and just the whole presentation,
  all these components --

178
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,620
well done.
Thank you.

179
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,922
Nabeyaki udon.
Oh, man, that looks good.

180
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,191
I love it.
I absolutely love it.

181
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,793
Here's pocket aces for you guys.

182
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,162
I actually grew up in Japan,
 so a lot of the food here

183
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:39,664
is really comparable to the food
 that I eat back at home.

184
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,634
It's my buddy Mario from
the world-famous Four Kegs.

185
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:43,969
What do you think makes it
  so great?

186
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:45,704
They're just wonderful.
They take care of the customers.

187
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,739
It's like family when you walk
 in, and that's what we like.

188
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,776
This is what you call
  hometown Las Vegas,

189
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:53,178
and there is nothing
   better Osaka's.

190
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,313
It is old school.
 This is old Vegas,

191
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:58,717
and it's got all the feelings,
and your Chef John is fantastic.

192
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,652
The food was dynamite.
    Glad you guys came.

193
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,088
Awesome, brother.
       Thanks.

194
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,490
Coming up,
 we're staying in Vegas...

195
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:06,825
Let's get after this.

196
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:08,193
...for an Asian-American
   diner...

197
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09,895
You have an eclectic mix.

198
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:12,097
...putting a flavorful twist
  on traditional comfort.

199
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,231
That is a bomb grilled cheese.

200
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,707
So, I think everybody
   knows by now,

201
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,376
I went to college here in
   Las Vegas,

202
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:26,144
and I'm about a 1/2 mile off
   The Strip.

203
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,046
Now, I drove by this place
  a million times,

204
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,115
never stopped in here --
 it's called the Eureka Casino,

205
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,683
and, boy, did I miss out.

206
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:34,319
This is the home of Fat Choy
  Asian American Fare.

207
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:40,192
I have your sesame noodles
   here for you.

208
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:42,994
Looks like a diner but tastes
 like it's gourmet.

209
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,529
One Fat Choy burger!

210
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:45,664
If I was ever in the hospital,

211
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,965
I'd want someone to sneak
    this in to me.

212
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,868
Chicken teriyaki rice.
  Sheridan's an amazing chef.

213
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,571
That'd be Sheridan Su,
  who worked at kitchens

214
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:55,307
from New York to Los Angeles
  before rolling the dice

215
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,576
in Vegas in 2011.

216
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,444
They started off as
    a food truck.

217
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:01,079
And then he had a little kiosk t

218
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,248
hat was in the middle of
 a beauty salon,

219
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,017
and now he's got a full kitchen
and a full restaurant.

220
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,519
One Pork Belly Bao!

221
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:10,155
I typically get two orders
   of the Pork Belly Bao.

222
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,924
A Chinese steamed bun with
  marinated pork belly --

223
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,226
total goodness.

224
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:17,329
So, this is how loud
it's gonna be the whole time?

225
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,232
We're in a wind tunnel!
What are we making?!

226
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:23,101
We're making Pork Belly Bao!
All right, man, get into it.

227
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,737
We're gonna start with a
marinade -- 2 cups of soy sauce.

228
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,306
There we go.
    4 cups of water.

229
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:32,477
And brown sugar.
 Garlic powder and green onion.

230
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,646
There we go.
So, let that simmer down?

231
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:37,582
Yes.
I said, "Let it simmer down!"

232
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,584
We're gonna pour it
  right on top of the pork.

233
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,620
You have to let it cool down
or you're gonna poach it.

234
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,555
Yes.
   And then I'll cover it.

235
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:46,558
Now, this will marinate for
24 hours, then go in the oven?

236
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,394
For three hours,
    300 degrees.

237
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,863
And then what's going on
 here with the pork?

238
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,799
The pork -- we'll put a pan
 over it just to compress it.

239
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,335
So, we'll put it into
   our fridge overnight.

240
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,305
And from here,
  we'll take the pans out.

241
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:05,143
So, we'll take this baby out,
 right onto the cutting board,

242
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,945
where I'll just trim off
     the edges.

243
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:09,281
Got it.
  Cut them into nice blocks.

244
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:11,750
So, we'll sear that off
  in a pan?

245
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:14,085
Yes.
   Brown it on both sides.

246
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,787
All right, now,
 what are we doing?

247
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,123
Now we're gonna chop
 the preserved mustard greens.

248
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,559
Okay.

249
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,627
We're gonna go ahead
    and sauté them.

250
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:23,662
Got it.

251
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:26,064
So, first, the oil,
    garlic, onion.

252
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,600
And in goes
    the mustard green.

253
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,068
And a little...

254
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,703
Sweet soy sauce.

255
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,071
And how long are you gonna
let that sauté down?

256
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,472
About three minutes.

257
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,608
Okay.
  We have our steamed buns.

258
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,810
We're gonna open the bao.

259
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,845
First, it goes
    hoisin sauce.

260
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:45,183
Thai roll.
Put the pork belly right on top.

261
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:48,920
On top of that, gets preserved
    mustard greens.

262
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,122
And add crushed peanuts.

263
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,992
And then finally cilantro
   right on top of that.

264
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,927
And this is one of
the number-one sellers?

265
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,462
Yes.

266
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:58,863
That's it --
    the Pork Belly Bao.

267
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,266
And that's all she wrote, okay.
Let's get after this.

268
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,804
Great steamed bun -- nice,
tender, nice and light.

269
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,143
The pork is tender.
  It's sweet.

270
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,845
I like the counterbalance
with the mustard green --

271
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,348
really good, man.
      Awesome.

272
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,949
I feel you.

273
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,217
Nice.

274
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,585
All right, Pork Belly Bao.

275
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,488
Luscious and delicious
and outstanding and...

276
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,657
It's like the ultimate
   slider, right?

277
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,926
It's like supersized bacon.
  It's pretty cool.

278
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,527
BLT!

279
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,463
Sheridan's made
  a reputation of taking

280
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,765
American food and giving
 a little Asian twist to it.

281
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,400
Short-rib grilled cheese!

282
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,435
The short-rib
  grilled-cheese sandwich

283
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,737
is a great example of that.

284
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,038
Short-rib grilled cheese?

285
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,606
Yes.
In an Asian bistro?

286
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,274
In an Asian bistro.

287
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:46,044
When we started this restaurant,
    it was a diner,

288
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,246
so we kept a lot of
    the diner dishes,

289
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,815
and we threw in a lot of Asian
    twists to it.

290
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,384
Okay, so, we're gonna
 trim this down.

291
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:54,686
So, we're gonna take all the fat
  and some of the skin off,

292
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,788
and then we're gonna cut it
  right through the bone.

293
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,690
Oh, this is on the bone, too?
  Great.

294
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,625
And we're gonna give this
     a nice sear

295
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,394
till it's brown
    on all sides.

296
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,732
So, after the short ribs
    are done browning,

297
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,868
we're gonna put it
    right into the pan.

298
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,202
A lot of work for
 a grilled cheese.

299
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:12,871
On top of that, we're gonna
    put our marinade.

300
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,272
Okay.
   Let's start with Cola.

301
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,307
Really?
  It's my grandma's secret.

302
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,143
No, I got it.
    And add rice wine.

303
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,245
Soy sauce.

304
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:22,847
A little bit of water,
    and add ginger.

305
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,883
Garlic and green onions.

306
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:27,052
So, we're gonna let that braise
    for three hours,

307
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:29,220
300 degrees,
  till it falls off the bone.

308
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,391
I mean, that's done.

309
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,460
Nice.
Okay.

310
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,762
We're gonna start with
    the onion jam.

311
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:40,131
A little bit of oil.
We're going with the red onions.

312
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,400
We'll add a little bit of honey
   to help it caramelize.

313
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,969
And add a little bit of
    brown sugar.

314
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,104
Whoa!

315
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,906
Give that a stir.
A little red wine.

316
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,874
And we'll finish it with
    balsamic vinegar.

317
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,843
Another one of those famous
 Asian ingredients.

318
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:54,846
Some black pepper and salt.

319
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,716
That'll be the onion jam going
for the grilled cheese

320
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,819
we're having at the Asian bistro
in a casino in Las Vegas.

321
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,487
Absolutely.
You hear it every day.

322
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:05,056
So, I wanted a couple of
  nice slices of sourdough.

323
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,725
Is it a butter sandwich?

324
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:10,228
So, this goes right into
     the pan.

325
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,598
American cheese, cheddar cheese,
    and Swiss cheese.

326
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,767
So, the short ribs
   that we have shredded.

327
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,602
Again, a spoonful of this
     onion jam.

328
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,337
We'll just mix this
    all together,

329
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,706
and then this goes right
   on top of the cheese.

330
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,141
A lot of short rib.

331
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,843
So, we'll just let that
   cook slowly, and --

332
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:27,045
Put in a little salad
and a little vinaigrette.

333
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,847
Our dipping sauce, marinara.

334
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:32,450
Nicely done, my friend.

335
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,352
The bread --
 nice and crunchy.

336
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:37,655
I like you put
a lot of butter on there.

337
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,724
The onion marmalade
 is what makes it.

338
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:42,694
Your short rib is seasoned
perfectly, and you get a ton.

339
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:44,195
That is a bomb grilled cheese.

340
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,097
All right,
 short rib grilled cheese.

341
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,032
I can't decide whether to just
 take small bites

342
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:49,701
or shove the whole thing
 into my mouth.

343
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:51,169
And this is actually
  what I eat every time.

344
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,370
It's the best.

345
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,038
Roasted Duck Bao.

346
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,142
I'm not just raving on because
 it's bloody television, mate.

347
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:59,310
Everything on the menu,
   it's fantastic.

348
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:02,180
You come in here.

349
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:05,884
You have an eclectic mix,
definitely not what I expected.

350
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:06,951
Nice job.
   I'm glad you like it.

351
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,322
Up next, in Westminster,
   Colorado...

352
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,757
Wow, you got that process down.

353
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,960
...we're firing up the grills...
  You just are nonstop!

354
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:19,430
...for Korean barbecue
  that just doesn't quit.

355
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:20,932
There were a few things I was
 expecting him to tell me.

356
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,267
Pig out was not one of them.

357
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,275
I love Colorado.

358
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:32,110
I mean, they got so much
   going on here,

359
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,278
especially the food scene.

360
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,046
I mean, who could forget
   Fat Sully's?

361
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,581
Give me some pie!

362
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,550
Then you got Lauer-Krauts --
  love that place.

363
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:41,452
So, there's no doubt that these
 guys got a Korean restaurant

364
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,521
and not just any
  Korean restaurant --

365
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:46,825
this one's off the hook --
 this is Dae Gee Korean B.B.Q.

366
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:50,695
Get your chicken!

367
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,363
If you want
  authentic Korean food,

368
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,232
this is definitely
  the place to come to.

369
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,500
Beef's up!

370
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,569
This is just overwhelmingly
   delicious.

371
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:00,171
You get to come here and cook it
   on the grill,

372
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,739
and it's just an experience.

373
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,842
I'll eat everything they put
    in front of me.

374
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,644
Which is just how owner
  Joe Kim wants it.

375
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,880
Somebody says,
"Okay, I'm gonna go to Dae Gee."

376
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:10,748
"Oh, that place -- you..."?

377
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,217
Pig out.

378
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,352
There were a few things I was
expecting him to tell me.

379
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,187
Pig out was not one of them.

380
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,557
But that's exactly what his
 customers have been doing since

381
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,760
he and his mother-in-law heated
 up the hibachis in 2010.

382
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:24,262
What makes it so dynamite?

383
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:26,698
All you can eat.

384
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,366
Unlimited barbecue!

385
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,236
Every different kind of meat you
 can imagine, they bring out.

386
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:34,205
Just covered with sides.
There's nonstop food coming.

387
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,709
You just keep eating,
    and it's awesome.

388
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,043
What are we making first?

389
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,411
We're gonna make
   the beef bulgogi first.

390
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:41,646
What does "bulgogi" mean?

391
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,715
"Bul" means fire,
  and then "gogi" means meat.

392
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,283
Fire meat?
   Yeah. Got the water.

393
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:46,918
This is the sauce for
 the bulgogi?

394
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,486
Right.
     The garlic.

395
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,788
The onions.
     Pineapples.

396
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,057
Got the apples.
Apples?

397
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:56,227
Yeah. The soy sauce, sugar,
    black pepper.

398
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,362
Sesame oil?
       Yeah.

399
00:14:57,364 --> 00:15:00,131
And most importantly, Soju.

400
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,400
Soju?
 Kind of a Korean spirit, yeah.

401
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,202
"Soju" gonna put it
 in there now?

402
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,503
Yeah.

403
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,173
Hey, what meat is this?

404
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,942
A rib-eye.
You slice it thin.

405
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,443
How long are we gonna
 let that marinade?

406
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,045
12 hours.
12 hours?

407
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,314
Yeah.
What are we making next?

408
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,649
Chicken bulgogi.

409
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,951
Add some garlic,
 the soy-bean oil, sesame oil,

410
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:21,753
ginger, black peppers.

411
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:25,356
Sugar?
      Soy sauce.

412
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,791
And the Soju.

413
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,326
"Soju" just put
 a little bit in?

414
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,761
Yeah.

415
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,764
Over the chicken?

416
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,232
Yeah.
24 hours?

417
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:35,700
Yeah.

418
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,035
Next, we're gonna make
    the Dae Gee sauce.

419
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:38,236
Dae Gee sauce.
   Dae Gee sauce, yeah.

420
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:39,337
So, this is like
 the house sauce?

421
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,772
House sauce.
Kind of like

422
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,407
the Korean Thousand Island.
Exactly -- put it on everything.

423
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:45,410
The soy sauce,
    the vinegar, sugar.

424
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:48,413
Soy-bean oil.
  You add some corn syrup.

425
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:49,781
That's what you use in
 your hair, huh?

426
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:50,915
Oh, yeah.

427
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,984
Sesame seed
   and Korean red peppers.

428
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,219
And that's the bags of Korean
red peppers you have up there?

429
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,587
Absolutely.
I'll be stealing them.

430
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:58,856
Next, Chef, what are we making?

431
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,024
Kimchi.

432
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,260
Is that, like, the French fries
 to the burger?

433
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,228
Absolutely.
 So, first, the Napa cabbage.

434
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,264
We're gonna cut it into fourths.

435
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,032
Salt it.

436
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:09,634
Wow, you got that process down.

437
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,970
And let it sit
    for 12 hours.

438
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,404
Now, let's make the marinade.

439
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,406
Gonna add some onions, garlic,
    little shrimps.

440
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:16,841
A little shrimp?
      Scrimps?

441
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:17,942
Scrimps?
       Yeah.

442
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,644
Add some daikon radish, ginger.

443
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,646
A little bit of rice just
 to tighten it up?

444
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,314
Yeah.
    Some seafood broth.

445
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,550
Fish sauce.
And then some of the...

446
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,085
Korean red peppers.
That I'm stealing.

447
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,619
Yeah.
Then we're gonna add some sugar.

448
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:29,821
Okay.

449
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:30,855
We have the cabbage.

450
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,757
It's already been rinsed
 and strained.

451
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,359
Then just kind of go at it.

452
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,827
Where did you learn this?
    My mother-in-law.

453
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,162
She had a restaurant in Hawaii
  for about 15, 20 years.

454
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,365
What's next?

455
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:41,599
We're gonna make some
    kimchi pancakes.

456
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,734
Of course we are.

457
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:44,335
This is our kimchi
   that's been fermenting

458
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,570
for about a month right now.

459
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,538
All right, and this is one of
 the side-dish items

460
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,973
that comes out?
      Correct.

461
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:50,475
A little tofu?
       Yeah.

462
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:51,743
Jalapeños and onions?
       Right.

463
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:54,312
Soon as that's pureed,
    add some sugar.

464
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,214
Some Korean red peppers.

465
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:57,615
That's what's in your hair.
  I knew it.

466
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,350
Egg?
  Yeah. Some potato starch.

467
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,885
Potato starch?
       Yeah.

468
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,186
Then we're gonna add some flour.

469
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,421
A.P.?
      Yeah.

470
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,356
All right. And these are
 gonna get fried up?

471
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,492
Sautéed, yeah.

472
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:11,796
So, actually, there's another
 side that we're gonna make,

473
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,998
which is a fish cake.
That's just -- that's awesome.

474
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,266
We'll eat next week.

475
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,535
All right, we got the wok.
    Heat that up.

476
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,137
There's some BTUs, baby.

477
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,705
We're gonna add some onions,
    some green onions,

478
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,940
carrots, jalapeños.

479
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,442
Add some garlic.
  Stir it in a little bit.

480
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:28,346
Fish cakes.

481
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,181
Soy sauce,
    some black peppers.

482
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,816
Add some sugar, yeah.

483
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:34,952
Corn syrup, seafood broth,
   crushed red peppers,

484
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,454
and then Korean red peppers.

485
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:38,556
Top it off with
    some sesame oil.

486
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,124
And that's it.

487
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,260
Now what do we do?

488
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:43,594
Yeah, we're gonna cook it at
   the barbecue tables.

489
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,763
Okay. Go, we just bring it out,
 or what do we do?

490
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,065
Yeah, I'll make a plate
    and everything,

491
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,599
and I'll set it all up,
 and I'll bring it out to you.

492
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,601
You're gonna show up,
 though, right?

493
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:51,869
Oh, yeah.

494
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,838
Oh, yeah --
  when we come back,

495
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,174
we're finally gonna get it going
   on the grill.

496
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,308
You will bring it?
       Yeah.

497
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,444
To the table?
     To the tables.

498
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,145
That I'm at?
       Yeah.

499
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,081
Now?
       Right.

500
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,183
Check.

501
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:13,491
The grills are lit just
 outside Denver, Colorado...

502
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:14,926
Unlimited barbecue!

503
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,028
...at Dae Gee Korean B.B.Q.

504
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,031
You just are nonstop!

505
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:23,034
I take my job very seriously.
Yes, you do, Chef.

506
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:25,903
But I haven't eaten a thing yet
 'cause all we've been doing

507
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:28,206
is making preparations for
  the ultimate feast.

508
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,941
The unlimited barbecue.
    All you can eat,

509
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,043
six different types of meats,
   and there's actually

510
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:33,811
an assortment of side dishes
   that come out with it.

511
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,614
So, let's recap this --
 we made the beef bulgogi,

512
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,484
chicken bulgogi, the Dae Gee
  house barbecue sauce,

513
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:42,320
Napa cabbage kimchi,
  kimchi pancakes,

514
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:46,124
fish cakes, and there's plenty
 of all that to go around.

515
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,361
It's truly unlimited.

516
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,729
You can keep eating forever.

517
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:54,265
I purposely don't eat sometimes
  before I come here.

518
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,567
The grill's hot.
 Throw it right on there.

519
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,836
It's sizzling.
 It's an interactive experience.

520
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,738
If you're gonna eat it,
  they're gonna bring it.

521
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,573
What do we do first?

522
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,175
We get some onions right here.

523
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:06,477
So, you season the grill
    with the onion?

524
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,613
Yeah, and then you get
some vegetables on there.

525
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:12,617
Beef bulgogi and then
the chicken bulgogi.

526
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:13,985
So, typically, you take
 a lettuce wrap,

527
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,486
put a little bit of the meat
 that you like,

528
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,921
some of the sides.

529
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:19,857
Mmm! Kimchi cake --
    pretty gangster.

530
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,262
Whole point is the pig-out.

531
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,030
Mmm!

532
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,398
A lot going on in there.

533
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,735
The bulgogi is
    out of bounds.

534
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,270
I love that you used
    the rib-eye.

535
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,838
You get a little salt,
    a little vinegar.

536
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,907
Mmm!

537
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:39,777
The Dae Gee sauce.

538
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,480
Steal that.

539
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:43,881
Mmm!

540
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,983
I just like that you have
    the variety.

541
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:49,053
The bright, fresh, acid flavors,
 you got the cooked veggies.

542
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,322
You got the raw veggies,
    the briny kimchi,

543
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:53,524
then the cornucopia
     of meats.

544
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,926
Where's the venting going?

545
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:56,627
Venting through these sides
  right here.

546
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,429
So, it's a built-in table
    that does it all?

547
00:19:58,431 --> 00:19:59,931
I got to get one these
    for my house.

548
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,203
You take the time
   and make it yourself.

549
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,171
That's the difference.
    Outstanding.

550
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,540
I wish I could rent,
   like, two extra arms.

551
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,278
If you're a meat eater, you
should definitely come eat here.

552
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,713
It's protein heaven.

553
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,715
You can always find
something that you like,

554
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,951
and if you like something,
you tell them to bring more.

555
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:22,887
You're involved in what
   you're cooking,

556
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:26,691
and you can socialize and enjoy
food and share it with everyone.

557
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:30,962
If you're gonna have a haircut
     like that,

558
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:32,496
you'd better back it up.
Yeah, absolutely.

559
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:33,631
Legit, buddy.
All right, man.

560
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:34,632
Legit.

561
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,434
Keep cooking.

562
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:39,704
So, that's it for this
 road trip, but don't worry,

563
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:42,907
we got plenty more joints
 to find all over the country!

564
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,042
I'll be looking for you
   next time

565
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:47,245
on "Diners, Drive-ins,
   and Dives."

566
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,418
It's been like 90 seconds.

567
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,321
Where's the food?
