       ON TOP OF THE TRIMMINGS. 

103
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:02,708
 THEY WILL BE USED FOR THE BASE,
 THEN I MAKE MY AU JUS WITH IT. 

104
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,176
HOW LONG HAVE YOU               
BEEN MAKING THIS?               
                  LOTS OF YEARS.

105
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,178
    NOW WE HAVE SOME MORE SALT, 
    LITTLE BIT OF BLACK PEPPER. 

106
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,114
             NOW WE'RE GONNA GO 
              GRANULATED ONION, 

107
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:11,583
                  NOT A LOT,    
              JUST A LITTLE BIT.
NO, JUST 1/2 A CUP.             

108
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,187
         AND GENEROUSLY NOW WITH
          OUR GRANULATED GARLIC.
GARLIC, YES.                    

109
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,322
       I LIKE THIS.             
EVERYBODY ON THE MOUNTAIN.      

110
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,457
           SOME BASIL, OREGANO, 

111
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,259
                 AND TO GIVE IT 
                  EXTRA FLAVOR, 

112
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,261
           WE'RE GONNA ADD SOME 
           OLIVE OIL ON THE TOP.

113
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,063
THIS IS AN ADVENTURE            
     IN COOKING.                

114
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,199
   NOW I TAKE ALL THE TRIMMINGS.
     YOU WANT TO TUCK 'EM IN.   

115
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,935
I LOVE THIS.                    

116
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,604
NOW HOW LONG IS THIS            
GONNA SLOW-ROAST FOR?           
         FOR A GOOD EIGHT HOURS.

117
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,674
 SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR           
A MEDIUM RARE IN HERE?          
             OH, AND IT WILL BE.

118
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:38,476
OH, LOOK AT THAT. IS THAT       
PICTURE PERFECT OR WHAT?        

119
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,812
NOW WE THROW IT UP              
  AND SLICE IT?                 
                     YES, WE DO.

120
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,481
               THAT'S FANTASTIC.
                 LOOK AT THAT.  

121
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,150
       YOU COULDN'T GET A BETTER
        MEDIUM RARE THAN THAT.  

122
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,952
             SLOW IT DOWN.      
       I CAN'T EAT IT THIS FAST.

123
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,820
       AND WHAT'RE WE GONNA DO  
     WITH THIS? PUT IT ON PIZZA?

124
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,688
              I CAN'T EVEN SEE  
             THE PIZZA ANYMORE. 

125
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,424
AND JUST PUT A LITTLE BIT       
 MORE CHEESE ON THE TOP         

126
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,359
TO HOLD IT TOGETHER.            
       AND THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE.

127
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,227
THAT'S IT.                      

128
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:58,997
 THAT LOOKS LIKE A MANHOLE COVER
         IN FLAVOR TOWN.        
             (laughs)           

129
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,768
             THAT LOOKS KILLER. 

130
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,036
                         MMM.   

131
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,239
         THAT'S IT. ANYBODY THAT
          WOULD COME TO CHICAGO 

132
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,374
  AND NOT COME HERE AND TRY THIS
        SHOULD BE ARRESTED.     

133
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,242
                  I'M MOVING IN.
GOOD.                           

134
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,111
        IT REMINDS ME OF        
    AN ITALIAN BEEF SANDWICH    

135
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,979
        BUT ON THE PIZZA,       
         SO IT'S GREAT.         

136
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,783
IT MAKES US HAPPY EVERY TIME WE 
LEAVE HERE. IT'S A GREAT MEAL.  
             MMM.               

137
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,917
I LIKE EVERYTHING               
THEY HAVE HERE.                 
         LARGE SAUSAGE.         

138

   <i> AND THE JOINT'S SO BUSY,</i>

140
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,659
            A PIZZA SHOULD TAKE 
          A MINUTE FROM THE TIME

141
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,662
           THAT NICKY GETS IT...
      <i> CUTS IT, SAUCES IT</i>       
  <i> AND SENDS IT FOR TOPPINGS.</i>

           I PUT OREGANO ON IT. 

143
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,866
    I GOT A LARGE SAUSAGE, HALF 
   PEPPER AND ONION COMING OUT. 

144
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:36,868
 GOT A LARGE CHEESE COMING OUT.

                WATCH, WATCH.   

146

THROWIN' THE BOARD AT HIM THING,
    WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?   
    BEEN DOING IT FOR YEARS.    

147
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,543
I THROW THE BOARD BACK TO NICKY,
    NICKY CATCHES THE BOARD.

   <i> AND THE BOARD GOES BACK.</i>    
                  YOU'RE WORKING
               A 10-HOUR SHIFT,

00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,882
            YOU TRY NOT TO WALK 
            AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. 

151
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,418
     AND THERE'S A CLOUD OF DUST
         THAT COMES WITH IT.    
(laughs) YOU'RE RIGHT.          

152
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,420
IT'S THE WAY WE'VE

      <i> HOWEVER YOU GET IT.</i>      

153
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,889

THE BREAKFAST PIZZA.            
           IT'S BREAKFAST PIZZA,

154
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,225
     BUT YOU DON'T HAVE IT FOR  
  BREAKFAST, HAVE IT FOR DINNER.

155
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,427
                  SO WHAT ARE WE
                 GONNA MAKE NOW?
EGG PIZZA.                      

156
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,429
WE NEED SOME CHEESE             
     ON HERE.                   

157
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,565
MAKE FIVE WELLS.                

158
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,366
           OH, WE'RE PUTTING 'EM
                  ON RAW.       

159
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,235
AND YOU WANT TO START           
  FROM THE OUTSIDE,             

160
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,236
PULL THE WHITES                 
TO THE CENTER,                  

161
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,706
 OTHERWISE THEY'RE              
ALL OVER THE PLACE.             
    THERE'S A SCIENCE AND AN ART

162
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:17,309
           TO HOW TO DO IT      
     AND WHERE TO DRAG THE YOLK.

163
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,310
A LITTLE BIT OF OREGANO.        

164
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:22,113
NOW WE PUT OUR SECRET INGREDIENT
   ON HERE SO IT DOESN'T DRY.   

165
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,116
HALF CORN OIL, HALF WATER.      

166
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,118
     CRISPY PEPPERONI.          
YOU'RE GONNA CRUMPLE THIS...    
                           NICE.

167
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:29,053
  AND SPRINKLE IT               
ON TOP OF THE EGGS.             
   HIDE THAT ONE, HIDE THAT ONE.

168
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,989
   THERE WE GO. CAN'T EVEN TELL 
      THERE'S EGGS ON THERE.    

169
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,724
I'M EXCITED.

  TO COME OUT.                  

171
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,995
DON'T QUIBBLE. TRY IT BEFORE    
YOU SAY, "I DON'T LIKE IT."     

172
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,930
                I'M NOT SAYING  
               I DON'T LIKE IT. 

173
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,665
             OH, SHE WANTS YOU. 

174
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,602
               THAT WAS AWESOME.
I SAW THAT.                     

175
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,604
         I'LL TELL YOU THIS,    
    IF YOU'RE NOT A BIG EGG FAN,

176
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,939
    THE ONLY WAY TO EAT EGGS IS 
    TO SAY I WANT IT ON A PIZZA 

177
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,274
                WITH THIN CRUST 
              FROM VITO & NICK'S

   'CAUSE I'LL EAT IT THAT WAY.

180
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,814
 AND THE LITTLE BIT OF SPICINESS
  OF THE PEPPERONI, DELICIOUS.  

181
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,885
     I COULD EAT THIS PIZZA

205
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,072
                IT'S VERY GOOD. 

206
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,140
      GRAPE LEAVES FILLED       
      WITH LAMB AND RICE.       
            IT'S VERY AUTHENTIC.

207
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,209
   IT TASTES JUST               
AS GOOD AS MY MOTHER            

208
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:00,211

SO MUCH ABOUT IT?               
                I LOVE THE LAMB.

218
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,101
  UNBELIEVABLE. IT REALLY IS.   
             THE MEAT IS TENDER,

219
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,237
                 ALWAYS JUICY...

WHAT I DO, WE JUST START        

221
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,307
WITH THE WHOLE LEG

222
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,643
     BOY, YOU REALLY KNOW YOUR--
        I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS.   
OH, YEAH.                       

223
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,379
        YOUR GETTING THE OPTIMUM
          PORTIONS OF THE LAMB, 

224
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,381
        CLEANING THEM UP        
 AND THEN MAKING THE BEST CUBES 

225
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,383
               THAT YOU CAN GET 
                FOR THE KEBAB.  
EXACTLY.                        

226
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,385
     DUDE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.
            LOOK AT THAT.       

227
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:43,321
   THIS IS KIND OF PLACE THAT I 
 WOULD WANT TO GET A KEBAB FROM.
    THIS IS THE WAY I LIKE IT.  

228
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,523
       SO THAT'S ENOUGH TO GET  
     A COUPLE OF KEBABS STARTED?
YEP.                            

229
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,525
FOUR PIECES, ZUCCHINI,          
      ONION NOW.                

230
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:49,527
                 SO IT'S A FOUR,
                   DOUBLE UP,   

231
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:52,330
               THREE, DOUBLE UP.
AND THEN YOU PUT THREE          
   ON TOP OF THAT.              

232
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,998
READY FOR COOKING.              

233
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,267
  NICE, HOT CHARBROIL.          
WE'RE GONNA LET 'EM SEAR        

234
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,403
 ON THE ONE SIDE, FLIP 'EM OVER 
      AND THEN BASTE 'EM...     

235
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:01,673

  A BLENDER.                    

237
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:05,544
             THAT TASTES GREAT. 

238
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,546
                  SO THIS TAKES?
ABOUT FIVE,                     
SIX MINUTES.                    

239
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,881
 IDEALLY, THEY SHOULD           
BE PINK, NOT WELL DONE.         

240
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,083
                SO THIS WILL GET
               SERVED WITH WHAT?
PLATED WITH RICE                

241
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,085
AND EAT IT WITH THE BREAD,      
    LEBANESE FLATBREAD.         

242
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,620
                   WE'RE READY. 

243
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,822
     YOU TAKE A PIECE OF BREAD, 
            PULL IT OFF,        

244
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:20,158
     SPLIT IT OPEN SO YOU'RE NOT
          GETTING ALL BREAD.    
                YEAH.           

245
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,093
                 GRAB A PIECE...
EDIBLE NAPKIN.                  

246
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,297
MMM. THAT'S AWESOME.            
NICE AND MEDIUM RARE.           
      THAT'S THE WAY TO EAT IT. 

247
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,365
   THAT'S BRIGHT                
AND NICE AND FRESH.             

248
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,300
THAT'S GREAT LAMB.              
     LET THE MEAT SHINE THROUGH.

249
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,168
THAT'S ON POINT, MAN.           

250
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,504
I LIKE THE WAY IT'S JUST GRILLED
      TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT      

251
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:36,107
   OF TEXTURE ON THE OUTSIDE,   
 THEN THE INSIDE IS VERY TENDER.

252
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,309
IT'S JUST REALLY LIKE           
A NICE SUBTLE FLAVOR.           

253
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:41,179
           IT JUST TASTES GREAT.
NEVER REALLY HAD LAMB BEFORE,   
         AND NOW I LOVE IT.     

254
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,181
        IT'S MY FIRST TIME HERE,
            AND I'LL BE BACK.   

255
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,116
   HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK 
          YOU INTRODUCED        

256
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,051
              LEBANESE FOOD TO  
             FOR THE FIRST TIME?

257
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,387
WE INTRODUCED THE WHOLE CITY    
 TO LEBANESE FOOD, I THINK.     

258
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:52,523
<i>EVERYTHING FROM SPINACH PIE...</i>  
DEFINITELY FRESH.               

259
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,592
      <i> TO LENTILS AND RICE,</i>     
       <i> STUFFED ZUCCHINI,</i>       

260
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:57,862
     <i> A CRACKED WHEAT SALAD</i>     
     <i> CALLED TABBOULEH...</i>       
JUST OUTSTANDING.               

261
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,931
  <i> TO SOMETHING CALLED KIBBE.</i>   
      (woman) KIBBE COMBINATION.

262
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,266
              GROUND BEEF MIXED 
             WITH BULGUR WHEAT. 

263
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,602
IT'S VERY GOOD.                 
          YOU CAN HAVE IT RAW,  
        OR YOU CAN HAVE IT BAKED

264
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,738
                 WITH A FILLING 
                 OF GROUND LAMB.

265
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,740
     THE RAW KIBBE, KIND OF     
      THE LEBANESE VERSION      

266
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,742
       OF STEAK TARTARE.        
                THE BAKED KIBBE.

267
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,744
      IT'S A DIFFERENT FLAVOR   
   THAN THE RAW. IT'S DELICIOUS.

268
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,746
EVERYTHING IS A LITTLE BIT      
DIFFERENT BUT REALLY GOOD.      

269
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,681
        <i> AND THEN THERE'S</i>       
       <i> REALLY DIFFERENT.</i>

          I AM LOOKING FORWARD  
         TO HAVING SOME TONGUE. 

272
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:25,156
THEY'RE APPETIZING.             
          FIRST THING THAT CAME 
         TO MY MIND. APPETIZING.

273
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,025
WE'LL PUT IT ON THE BOARD,      
      AND IF ANYBODY            

274
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:29,027
FEELS ADVENTUROUS               
THEY'LL ORDER IT.               
                      (whistles)

275
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,828
                 WOW, THOSE LOOK
                  INTERESTING.  

276
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,630
              OKAY! HERE WE GO. 

277
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,766
HAVING TROUBLE?                 
                             NO.

278
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,701
               OBVIOUSLY, IT WAS
                 TEARS OF JOY.  

279
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,703
   IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST TENDER
        PIECE OF THE ANIMAL     

280
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,772
              I'VE EVER EATEN.  
            THIS IS LIKE FILLET.
EXACTLY.                        

281
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,041
 I DIG IT. YEAH, I MEAN, I DON'T
  KNOW--WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY, 

282
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,110
      IT'S JUST RIGHT ON THE TIP
             OF MY TONGUE.      

283
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,844
              IT'S VERY TENDER. 

284
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,879
    HAVE YOU EVER HAD IT BEFORE?
NO, I HAVEN'T.                  
THAT'S TENDER.                  

285
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,648
              I'M SURPRISED,    
           BUT IT IS VERY GOOD. 

286
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,451
  THE FOOD IS OUT OF THIS WORLD.
    AND THERE'S JUST            
SO MUCH TO CHOOSE FROM.         

287
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,453
   WHAT'RE YOU ENJOYING SIR?    
             THIS IS A MEAT PIE.

288
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,255
                IT IS DELICIOUS.
HE MAKES IT FRESH.              

289
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,858
 <i> RIGHT FROM GRANDMA'S RECIPE.</i>  
                LET'S GET IT ON.

290
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,727
 ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR. I'LL BE OVER
  HERE 'CAUSE I HAVE BLACK ON.  

291
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,996
             YEAST, SUGAR, SALT.
WE'RE GONNA DISSOLVE THIS.      

292
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,198
            THEN INTO THE FLOUR?
YES.                            

293
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,533
    OKAY, SO YOU'LL LET THIS RUN
          FOR FIVE MINUTES?     

294
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,803
APPROXIMATELY. UNTIL I GET      
   A NICE, SMOOTH BALL.         

295
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,938
             DONE AND GOOD, HUH?
LET IT SIT FOR A WHILE.         

296
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,674
  DUST THE TABLE A LITTLE BIT.  
WE'RE GONNA DUST OUR MACHINE UP.

297
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,810
      WHEN MY MA USED TO BAKE,  
     THEY DID IT ALL BY HAND... 

298
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,612
        <i> BUT NOT ANYMORE.</i>

  AND I DO BLANCH THEM.

             THIS SAME TOPIC,   

502
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,753

TEN SECONDS.

AND ONTO A SHEET PAN,           
     QUICK COOL.

505
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,160

THREE LEMONS, THREE LIMES,      
      THREE ORANGES.            

508
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,432
 A LITTLE OLIVE OIL--           
IT ADDS A NICE RICHNESS         

509
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,234
IN THE SEVICHE.                 
                          RIGHT.

510
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,170
OUR CHIPOTLE SAUCE,             
 THAT'S THE HEAT.

     AND SOME KETCHUP.          
       THE INTERNATIONAL ELIXIR.

514
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,847
  ACTUALLY A SEVICHE THAT       
YOU MIGHT FIND IN HONDURAS,     

515
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,782
BECAUSE IT'S RED.               

516
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:47,251
           NOW HOW LONG WILL YOU
           LET THIS MARINATE UP?
JUST ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF.  

517
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,186
IT'S READY TO EAT NOW.          
   IT'S READY NOW.              
           WE CAN GO NOW, RIGHT?

00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,788
TOSTONES.                       
   YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MAKING--
      YOU'RE MAKING ME HUNGRY.

ALL RIGHT. SEVICHE.             

520
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,860
         YOU GET A LITTLE MUSIC 
         GOING IN THE BACKGROUND

521
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,128
 AND LET ME HEAR SOME BIRDS AND 
 A LITTLE CRASHING OF THE OCEAN 

522
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,598
           AND I MIGHT BE THERE.
  YOU'VE GOT YOUR FEET IN       
THE SAND ALREADY, DON'T YOU?    

523
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,533
                SERIOUSLY, NO,  
               I-I'M FEELING IT.

524
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:04,468
              MMM. THAT'S WHAT  
             I'M TALKING ABOUT.

           THAT IS GREAT. OH,   
         PEOPLE GOTTA TRY THIS. 

526
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:09,206
                   THE TOSTONES 
                   ARE PERFECT. 

527
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,208
               DELICIOUS, FRESH,
                   HANDMADE.    

528
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,010
               IT'S AN ORCHESTRA
                  OF FLAVOR,    

529
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,145
       AND NOBODY IS TAKING     
   A SOLO RIGHT NOW. EXCELLENT.

                         MMM.   

531
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,749
   THE SEVICHE IS INCREDIBLE.   

532
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,684
         THE SHRIMP ARE         
       JUST UNBELIEVABLE.       

533
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,153
       YOU CANNOT GO WRONG      
 WITH THE FOOD. IT'S EXCELLENT. 

534
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:25,222
I CAN ALWAYS GET SOMETHING      
  REALLY, REALLY, TASTY.

             TO HAVE THIS HERE.
