00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,126
   has been driving this train  
    since it opened in '09...   

342
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:23,994
They make everything            
 except the plates.             

343
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,263
      ...with a little help     

344
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:28,666
       from his grandpa's       
  rock-solid southern recipes.  

345
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:31,202
WOMAN: I got your chicken       
with yams and collard greens.   

346
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,938
            I ordered the smoked
              barbecue chicken. 

347
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,941
    ...which is just so good.   

348
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,477
           So, we're gonna work 
         on some smoked chicken.

349
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,012
AKA: First, you have            
your butterflied chicken,       

350
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,948
and you're gonna make           
your buttermilk marinade.       

351
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:44,949
                 I'm gonna?     

352
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,484
I'm gonna make it, okay?        
                  There you go. 

353
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:50,021
   First you start              
with your buttermilk, onions.   

354
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:53,291
Then you got your pepper,       
salt, sugar, garlic.            

355
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,162
All right, these bad boys are   
going for at least four hours,  

356
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,732
but overnight is definitely     
 the best way to go.            

357
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,237
              Now, the dry rub? 
  Yes.                          

358
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,508
Start off with paprika,         
pepper, celery salt,            

359
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,510
 granulated garlic,             
    kosher salt,                

360
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,579
cumin, mustard powder,          
    brown sugar,                

361
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,317
ancho chili powder, parsley,    
   and some sugar.              

362
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,919
 Just whisk it all              
 till it's uniform,             

363
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,390
  just so it can be             
as even as possible.            

364
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:27,125
    Now you have                
your marinated chicken.         

365
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,661
    Right here is               
your seasoned salt --           

366
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,462
just pepper, salt, garlic.      

367
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:34,198
That's it. And this goes on     
  before your rub.              

368
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,866
Now we go with this rub.        

369
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,002
   Sprinkle it on.              
You don't want it on too thick. 

370
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:40,204
You don't want to bite into,    
like, a whole bunch of rub.     

371
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,340
   Is this gonna stay marinated 
   again after it gets all this?

372
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,409
  Yeah, definitely,             
at least four hours,            

373
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,411
     but again,                 
it's better overnight.          

374
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:48,412
          And then we finally go
               to the smoker?   

375
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,546
3 to 5 hours at 225.            

376
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,215
           What kind of pellets?

377
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,551
A mix of hickory and cherry.    

378
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,019
Now it's ready to roll.         

379
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,487
                Here we go.     
                [ Whistles ]    

380
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:57,588
                    Whoa.       

381
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,525
               Coming at you,   
              right behind you. 

382
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,696
             Look at that. Man! 

383
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,366
Now that these guys are out,    
  we let them rest.             

384
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:11,769
     That's good-looking smoke. 
 I got to get a picture of that.

385
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:14,505
All charred and everything      
     like that.                 

386
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:17,708
              That's gorgeous.  

387
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,710
              Aw, really nice.  

388
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,045
                   Juicy.       

389
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:24,015
 That brine with the buttermilk,
       how that comes together. 

390
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,519
               So, the smoke's  
              not overpowering. 

391
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,721
   Different smoke will give you
              different colors. 

392
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,389
 People look at it and go, "Wait
  a minute, that's not cooked." 

393
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,525
           This bird is totally,
               totally cooked.  

394
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:37,194
       It's the smoke that gives
        that little pink tinge. 

395
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,064
                  Mmm. Mmm!     

396
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,866
                 So, there's    
             our smoked chicken.

397
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:50,808
Now we're gonna baste it with   
our homemade barbecue sauce.    

398
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,810
You're gonna get a little crust,
a little bit of char.           

399
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,178
Another level of flavor.        

400
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,481
 Constantly flip it             
so it doesn't get overcooked.   

401
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,050
   One more coat.               

402
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,556
 Right to the plate.            
                            Wow.

403
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:08,759
   Now we're ready              
for the collard greens.         

404
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,963
                         Dig it.
Get a nice bowlful.             

405
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:14,699
You really want to get          
a lot of that broth,            

406
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,834
'cause that's what took         
    all the time.               

407
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,436
       And that's all she wrote.

408
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,938
Texas toast is made in-house    
  every single day.             

409
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,445
          Oh! It's great smoke, 
    really tangy barbecue sauce.

410
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,583
                  Mmm. Wow.     

411
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:33,885
             The broth is great.

412
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,056
    Not too salty. A little bite
               of the vinegar.  

413
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:43,928
       A healthy amount of that 
   shredded hock and turkey leg.

414
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,996
 You got to dig in.             

415
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,799
             Get that ladled up 
              right like that.  

416
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:48,933
           Huh? Right like that.

417
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,202
              You nail it, man. 

418
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,538
       You nail it, you nail it,
                you nail it.    

419
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,573
    It is divine.               

420
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,208
      WOMAN: You can taste      
        the smoked flavor       

421
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,409
           all the way          
      through the chicken.      

422
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,077
Absolutely delicious.           

423
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,481
  I have a New Mexican burger,  
            order up.           

424
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:05,415
   WOMAN: I thought, why am I   
ordering a burger at a barbecue?

425
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,651
   And the burger floored me.   

426
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,556
  FIERI: And from what I hear,  
     same goes for the dogs.    

427
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,891
                   Tell me      
             about this hot dog.

428
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,426
 AKA: We're making              
 a Guadalajara dog.             

429
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,094
                Guadalajara dog?
      Yes.                      

430
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,629
                 All right,     
             when you come back,

431
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:19,964
                 we'll make     
            the Guadalajara dog.

432
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,766
   We're hanging out at The Cube
    in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 

433
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,035
                  Be easy on me.
I will.                         

434
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:37,014
       Welcome back.            
       "Triple D" hanging out in
       Albuquerque, New Mexico. 

435
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,884
     Now, it's called The Cube. 
  Dude is scratch-making it all.

436
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,486
              I'm talking about 
  from the brines to the sauces.

437
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,355
        I mean, he's smoking it,
              he's cooking it.  

438
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:46,557
              And now, we're on 
         to the Guadalajara dog.

439
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,925
       I have                   
 a Guadalajara dog.             

440
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:50,628
  It's fantastic, 'cause it has 
      chipotle mayonnaise.      

441
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,096
            Give me the rundown.
 All right.                     

442
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,765
  You're gonna take             
your all-beef frank,            

443
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:58,102
take this thick slice           
of applewood-smoked bacon.      

444
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,771
              Hang on a second. 
      Equal weight, practically.

445
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,373
       Look at the side of that.
                 Half a pig.    

446
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,576
   Only way to go.              

447
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,178
                    Okay.       
   Okay.                        

448
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,447
             Couple toothpicks, 
             keep it together.  

449
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,183
       What sauce are we making?

450
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:15,118
    We're making                
  a chipotle sauce.             

451
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,055
We have your chipotle peppers   
in adobo that have been pureed. 

452
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:21,124
     You dump it                
 in the sour cream.             
                   Beautiful.   

453
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:25,529
You blend it until it is        
 all the same color.            

454
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,032
            Dig it. Fry the dog.
    All right.                  

455
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:33,403
     So, it'll crisp up the dog,
               cook the bacon.  

456
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,072
             And we'll be done. 

457
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:37,875
     All right.                 

458
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,477
  We want to put on             
    a good amount               

459
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:42,546
of the chipotle sauce.          

460
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:46,216
After that, you top it off      
   with your pico.              

461
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:49,654
Nice, healthy serving           
of it. Now we're ready.         

462
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:56,827
        There's something about 
   that naturally cased hot dog.

463
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,764
             You get that snap, 
       like a real casing on it.

464
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,569
                Crunchy bacon   
               on the outside,  

465
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,905
              spicy sour cream  
             from the chipotle, 

466
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,874
          and then the freshness
          of the pico de gallo. 

467
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:15,646
                    Mmm.        
              That is gangster. 

468
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,314
          Here's the only thing 
        I don't like about this,

469
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,283
          is I want six of them.

470
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,987
  Here's your Guadalajara dog.  

471
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:24,522
       WOMAN: The hot dog       
      is cooked perfectly.      

472
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:26,190
       Like, you bite in,       
      and the skin bursts,      

473
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:27,324
   and all the juice gets you.  

474
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,792
   They're just awesome here.   

475
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,461
               This is exactly  
              the kind of place 

476
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:31,729
               we want to find  
               on "Triple D."   

477
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:32,930
        Dude, you're knocking it
              out of the park.  

478
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,399
  Thank you.                    
             Manny, you the man.

479
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,101
                 Barbe-cube.    

480
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,274
  So, that's it for this trip,  
        but don't worry.        

481
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:45,943
 There's plenty more "Triple D" 
  joints all over the country.  

482
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:47,478
     I'll be looking for you    
            next week           

483
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,347
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

484
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,815
             I got to tell you, 
                what a blast.   

485
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:52,883
        Thanks for recommending.

486
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:53,817
               This is real --  

487
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:57,288
       Did Gorilla just walk by?
                   Weird.       

488
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,090
            You didn't even have
              a line, Gorilla.
