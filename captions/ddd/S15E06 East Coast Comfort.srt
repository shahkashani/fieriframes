200
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,277
   I STARTED COOKING            
WHEN I WAS 12 YEARS OLD.        
                           YEAH.

201
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,814
THE KITCHEN WAS MY COMFORT ZONE 
      AND STILL IS TODAY.       

202
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:38,750

203
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:42,554

00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,294
OKAY. BUTTER?                   
                      MARGARINE.

YEAH, MARGARINE.

             INVOLVES MARGARINE?
YEAH, YOU KNOW,                 

209
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,635
THINGS WERE POOR IN THOSE DAYS. 
        CHOPPED ONIONS,

00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,870

                YOUR OWN...     

215
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,585

221
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,332
      THIS ONE TAKES            
A LITTLE MORE. OKAY, GOOD.      

222
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:30,335
I HAVE CABBAGE NOW.             
             OKAY. THERE YOU GO.

223
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,671

BOILED.                         

224
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:35,473
                AND A LITTLE BIT
                  OF CAYENNE?   
CAYENNE WORKS WELL              
  WITH CABBAGE.                 

225
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:38,075
IT BRINGS OUT THE FLAVOR.       
       STIR-FRY...              
                       STIR-FRY.

226

      AND IT'S DONE.            

227
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:43,281

228
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,283

THAT'S--YES.                    

229
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,151

                           OKAY.

232
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,892

                           OKAY.

234
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,030
GIVE IT A TURN.

00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:02,967
AND OUT POPS

236
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,637

                   LOOK AT THAT.

           PERFECTLY PRESSED    
       PIEROGI PORTION BY PATTI.

238
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,508

247
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,532

   WHEN IT'S COOKED.            

248
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:36,734

396
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:07,491
   OF AUTHENTIC ITALIAN FOOD.

             ALL REAL DEAL, YES.

YOU'D BE HARD-PRESSED TO TELL ME
     YOU WEREN'T IN ITALY.

       ALLE VONGOLE WHITE SAUCE.

411
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:43,528
                    LET'S DO IT.

412
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:51,402
      WE ADD ABOUT 2 TABLESPOONS
      OF EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL,

413
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:55,272
     A "GLOVE," GLOVE AND A HALF
          OF SLICED GARLIC.     
CLOVE.                          

414
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,875
                    PEPERONCINO.
SO A LITTLE                     
CHILI FLAKE.                    

415
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,877
       CHILI FLAKES. THEN WE ADD
            OUR LITTLENECKS.    

416
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:02,679
THE LITTLENECK CLAMS THAT HAVE  
   BEEN CLEANED, SCRUBBED.      

417
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,215
                YES, AND PURGED.

418
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:07,084
      WE WANT TO DEGLAZE IT WITH
     A LITTLE BIT OF WHITE WINE,

419
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,886
          ANY TYPE OF WHITE WINE
             YOU HAVE AT HOME.  

420
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,155
BUT YOU GOTTA AT LEAST          
  WANT TO DRINK IT.             

421
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,023
IF YOU WON'T DRINK IT,          
 DON'T COOK WITH IT.            
                   THAT'S RIGHT.

422
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:16,160
OKAY.                           
              I ADD A LITTLE BIT
                OF CLAM JUICE.  

423
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:18,095
OKAY.                           
                      ALL RIGHT.

424
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,097
                I DON'T LET     
           THE LITTLENECKS BURN.

425
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,300
                    PUT A COVER 
                   TO THE PAN...
OKAY.                           

426
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,570
                 SO THAT WAY    
             IT CREATES A STEAM.

427
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,572
                      THAT WAY--
(imitating Italian accent)      
     CREATES A STEAM.           

428
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:30,174
               STEAM SO THE CLAM
                   CAN OPEN.    
(normal voice) DO YOU           
 GET THE ENTHUSIASM?            

429
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,109
                 THAT'S ITALIAN.
I GOT IT, MAN.                  

430
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,112
         (speaking indistinctly)
I'M--I CAN--THIS IS--           
  IT'S LIKE POETRY.             

431
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,515
          SO AT THIS POINT WHILE
          IT'S COOKING, RIGHT...
RIGHT.                          

432
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,650
                YOU WANT TO DROP
                   YOUR PASTA.  

433
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:41,452
        WHEN THE CLAMS ARE OPEN,
              ALL RIGHT...      
OKAY.                           

434
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,521
          WE ADD ALSO BABY CLAMS
               TO IT--TO IT.    
OKAY.                           

435
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,192
                JUST WANT TO ADD
                  SOME SALT...  
OKAY.                           

436
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,394
          AND SOME BLACK PEPPER.

437
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:53,264
      READY TO PLATE, AND WE PUT
         THE CLAMS ALL AROUND.  

438
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:58,135
           DRAIN THE PASTA WELL.
            RIGHT INTO THE PAN. 

439
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,004
                I ADD SOME      
           ITALIAN FLAT PARSLEY.
ITALIAN FLAT PARSLEY--          

440
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,806
THE ONLY KIND OF PARSLEY        
        I LIKE.                 
                      ALL RIGHT.

441
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,476
          WHAT I LIKE TO DO ALSO
            BEFORE I SERVE IT-- 

442
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,611
                I LET IT COOK   
            FOR ONE MORE MINUTE.

443
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,815
             THAT WAY THE SAUCE 
            WILL COAT THE PASTA.

444
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,751
  IT BECOMES NICE AND, YOU KNOW,
        COATED AND CREAMY.      

445
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,553
             AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

446
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,755
TELL ME YOU DON'T               
 LOVE THIS GUY.                 

447
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,757
              BEFORE I SERVE IT,
                 I LIKE TO ADD  

448
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,092
                SOME MORE       
         EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL.

449
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,094
JUST A TOUCH.                   
                 JUST A LITTLE--
                  JUST A TOUCH. 

450
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,364
               AT THIS POINT    
          I'M READY TO PLATE IT.

451
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,232
NESTING THE PASTA,              

452
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,968
   AND THEN POURING             
ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL...          
              CLAM JUICE ON TOP.

453
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,103
RIGHT ON.                       
                      AND VOILà.

454
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,039
                THAT'S SPAGHETTI
                  ALLE VONGOLE. 

455
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,974
SO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.         
    ALL THAT JUICE.             

456
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:40,111
NO CREAM, NO BUTTER,            
      NO NADA.                  
                           NOPE.

457
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:42,914
JUST SIMPLE GOODNESS.           

458
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,916

459
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:48,385
MMM. A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT,      
  LITTLE BIT OF GARLIC.         

460
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,520
     COOKED THE CLAMS           
JUST TO WHEN THEY OPEN UP.      

461
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,723
