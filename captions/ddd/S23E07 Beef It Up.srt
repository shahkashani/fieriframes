                   Dig in.      

233
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,169
         Ah!                    

234
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,940
          Great crust.          
   New York deli all day long.  

235
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:58,075
Individually, everything has    
its own taste and identity.     

236
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,479
      And then,                 
when you marry it all together, 

237
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,079
it's like elevated taste.       

238
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,281
           Thank you.           

239
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,950
   Smoked salmon and the Nova   
      are very delicious --     

240
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,218
        nice and tender.        

241
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,554
  It goes well with the bagels  
      and the cream cheese.     

242
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,356
      WOMAN: The sable here     
  is done really, really well.  

243
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,091
        It's a fish that,       
 if you've not tried it before, 

244
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,093
I highly recommend, and you will
    definitely become a fan.    

245
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,429
  The trout salad is a takeoff  
        on the whitefish        

246
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,997
     that we'd normally get     
    in New York. I love that.   

247
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,633
   Think everybody's gonna be   
    really happy coming here.   

248
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:25,169
 You guys have not only brought 
       an original taste,       

249
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,038
         but you brought        
      the original attitude     

250
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,173
      about how you do it.      

251
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,240
       Outstanding, Chef.       

252
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,109
     Killin' it.                
Putting Georgia on the map.     

253
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,710
          We're loading         
       my trunk right now       

254
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,512
    with corned-beef pastrami   
           and bagels,          

255
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,846
  also some of the smoked fish. 

256
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,515
          And, yes, G.,         
       you can drive home.      

257
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,950
 Vroom, vroom, baby!            

258
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:44,856
  Coming up, we're mixing it up 
  in Plymouth, Massachusetts... 

259
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:45,790
Worcestershire sauce!           

260
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,258
      "What's this here?" sauce.

261
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,661
       ...with a new piece      
        to a meaty pie...       

262
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,661
                  Oh, yeah.     

263
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,665
          ...alongside          
     a tasty pretzel twist.     

264
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,200
               Point on, man.   

265
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,277
                     ♪♪         

266
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,715
         So, I'm in area        
    that a lot of people call   

267
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,916
      "America's hometown."     

268
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,118
         That's right --        
    Plymouth, Massachusetts.    

269
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,321
       Now, when you come       
  to a tourist area like this?  

270
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,990
    Where do you want to eat?   
 Right on. Where the locals eat.

271
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,725
      And from what people      
         are telling me,        

272
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,926
      this is the joint --      

273
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,562
   the Driftwood Publick House  
           & Oysteria.          

274
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,399
  I got your tater for table 1. 

275
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:30,201
 It's definitely a great, great 
      spot to come and eat.     

276
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,470
    It's funky. It's just not   
       your average place.      

277
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:34,472
  Tory, oyster chowder -- boom. 

278
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:35,873
       -The food's unique.      
     -As unique as the man.     

279
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:36,908
                    Yes.        

280
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,676
       That would be owner      
         Matt Hennessy,         

281
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:42,414
 who returned to his roots when 
  he opened this joint in 2012. 

282
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,615
    MAN: Matt's a great guy.    

283
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,282
        He's a local kid,       
         sowed his oats         

284
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,485
      out in the big cities     
     of Chicago and Boston,     

285
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:48,753
  and now he's come back home.  

286
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,354
                   FIERI:       
           That's quite a beard.

287
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,822
     You need it                
   for the winter.              

288
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,825
 Matt's getting it done up here.

289
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:56,628
      Classic home cooking,     
  but way better than at home.  

290
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,829
   Here's that Philly pretzel.  

291
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,631
    MAN: The best cheesesteak   
      that you've ever had      

292
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:00,899
    wrapped in pretzel dough.   

293
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,602
   People definitely come here  
     just for this pretzel.     

294
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:05,970
               All right, so,   
            let's get into this.

295
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,440
So, we're starting off          
with a little bit of oil.       

296
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,507
Take our beef shoulders,        

297
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,176
hit it with a little bit        
 of salt and pepper.            

298
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,777
Sear it on both sides.          

299
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,712
                    Okay.       

300
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,313
    Take them off               
and put them to the side.       

301
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:18,716
Add some fresh white onion,     
garlic, our house herb mixture. 

302
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,519
 Let this sweat down            
  for a little bit.             
                           Okay.

303
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:23,521
 I'm gonna add some             
Worcestershire sauce.           
                      Some what?

304
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,190
Worcestershire sauce!           

305
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,592
      "What's this here?" sauce.

306
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,394
 Our locally brewed             
     golden ale.                

307
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,328
               All right, so,   
          now this goes in here?

308
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,396
        Yes.                    

309
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,531
                  What temp     
      are we gonna cook this at?

310
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:34,866
250 for about 5 hours.          

311
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:37,302
    And that's gonna get stuffed
             inside the pretzel.
Yes.                            

312
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,537
We got our dough done.          

313
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:44,809
We're gonna low this out to,    
like, a long rectangular shape. 

314
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,078
     Gonna take                 
our shredded beef shoulder,     

315
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,880
shredded American cheese.       

316
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:51,015
               Nice processed   
              American cheese.  

317
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,885
A little bit of egg wash        
    on the sides.               

318
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,619
Just gonna fold that over.      

319
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:59,290
             So it is a pretzel 
      and a calzone have a baby.
Oh, yeah.                       

320
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,492
You get a lot of egg wash       
      on there.                 

321
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,627
That's what gives it            
  that nice like --             

322
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,629
                 Nice sheen.    

323
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,765
     Top it off                 
with some pretzel salt.         

324
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,032
           Bake this in the oven
                at what temp?   

325
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,568
475, 10 to 12 minutes.          

326
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,570
               That's massive.  

327
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,372
This is our house-made          
   Sriracha crema.              

328
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,708
   Gonna hit that               
with a little bit of olive oil  

329
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,510
   and some fresh               
   chopped chives.              

330
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,711
                    Mmm!        

331
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,380
          A good amount of meat,
               great texture.   

332
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,384
         [ Both mumble ]        

333
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,653
                   I like       
          it's a little crunchy.

334
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,855
             The American cheese
       is what makes it all fly.

335
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,390
          And then then Sriracha
 dipping sauce -- point on, man.

336
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,992
                    Mmm!        

337
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,394
             It really does have

338
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,397
           a "Philly cheesesteak
             in a pretzel" feel.

339
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,731
      That's out of bounds, man.

340
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,533
        -Philly pretzel.        
       -Delicious, moist.       

341
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,335
 Shaved steak inside is awesome.

342
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,804
    The flavors are amazing,    
      and I love the sauce.     

343
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,340
 The menu in general is far more
      than a pretzel place.     

344
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,009
              MAN:              
   They have a great raw bar.   

345
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,611
       They have a lot of       
 oyster-oriented seafood dishes.

346
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,480
       The oyster chowder.      

347
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,814
       I got to try the chowder,
                 by the way.    
Oh, yeah.                       

348
00:11:56,816 --> 00:12:00,418
Here we got our fresh           
oyster chowder for you.         

349
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,886
    -This is your head chef?    
            -Mm-hmm.            

350
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,421
    What is this fritter on top?

351
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:04,956
That is a freshly fried         
       oyster.                  

352
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,093
 I like the fried oyster on top,
           nice tender potatoes.

353
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,161
             Excellent chowder. 

354
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,563
  What the Driftwood does best  

355
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,698
           is a twist           
   on a classic American dish.  

356
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,300
   Here's that shepherd's pie   
          for table 5.          

357
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,769
MAN: Has short rib in it instead
   of, you know, ground beef.   

358
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:20,371
        It's really good.       

359
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,773
         What are we making now,
                   homey?       

360
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,974
 Braised short ribs             
for the short-rib shepherd pie. 

361
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:24,976
         Short-rib shepherd pie.

362
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,711
                Hey, oh, now.   
                 Here, now.     

363
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:27,912
Add some oil in the pan.        

364
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,247
Take our short ribs.            

365
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,115
Gonna hit them with a little bit
 of salt and pepper.            

366
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,450
                There we go.    

367
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,452
And now that these short ribs   
   are seared off,              

368
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,253
we're gonna put them            
 in this hotel pan,             

369
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,789
 and we're gonna add            
    our mirepoix                

370
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,456
  plus a little bit             
  of fresh garlic.              

371
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,125
    Tomato paste                
and fresh herb mixture.         

372
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,994
 Mix that up a bit.             

373
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,596
   Deglaze the pan              
with Harpoon Irish Stout,       

374
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,932
 our burgundy wine,             
   and some water.              

375
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,534
                 All right,     
    so, take the braising liquid

376
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,737
                over the top    
             of the short ribs. 

377
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,606
              Let that sear off 
                in the oven.    

378
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,742
              250 for 5 hours.  
         Now we're making the...

379
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:00,277
Root vegetable puree that gets  
topped on the shepherd's pie.   

380
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,412
                 Oh, really?    

381
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:03,480
  Russet potatoes.              
 Some sweet potato.             

382
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,150
           -Parsnips.           
           -Parsnips.           

383
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,752
    White onion.                
    Fresh garlic.               

384
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:08,887
  Little olive oil.             

385
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:11,122
      Seasoning                 
with salt and pepper.           

386
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,160
       So, slow-roast this down.
              250 for how long? 

387
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,762
          -Three hours.         
          -Three hours.         

388
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,165
 Now we're gonna add            
our roasted root vegetables     

389
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,432
 to the Robot Coupe.            

390
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,568
We're gonna add some butter,    
heavy whipping cream,           

391
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,769
and salt and pepper to taste.   

392
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:25,537
             All right. Hit it. 

393
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,841
We got our braised short ribs   
  out of the oven.              

394
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:30,775
              Very nicely done. 

395
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:31,843
 Look at that, huh?             

396
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,779
        Nothing wrong with that.

397
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,514
           -All right?          
 -Just chug that down right now.

398
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:40,384
Now we're gonna pull            
    the meat out.               

399
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:41,853
Strain the vegetables.          

400
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,923
   Puree that up.               
That's gonna be the base layer. 

401
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:48,259
We're gonna build a nice layer  
of the short rib here.          

402
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:51,262
Pureed root vegetables          
gonna get the top layer.        

403
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,130
The au jus that we have topped  
   right onto it.               

404
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,332
           In the oven how long?

405
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,867
450 for about 12 minutes.       

406
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:56,934
                   Got it.      

407
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,737
So, we got some locally sourced 
    microgreens.                

408
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,940
   Fried shallots.              

409
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,544
                  The meat      
              is super tender.  

410
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,813
      I love the braising liquid
              right at the top  

411
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,614
              'cause that adds  
              even more depth.  

412
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,483
                Very simple,    
           very straightforward,

413
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:13,384
              very comforting.  

414
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,086
     That's an all-American dish
                right there.    

415
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,221
         Shepherd's pie.        

416
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,090
     The shredded short rib     
         brings it home.        

417
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,959
    Just it makes it a little   
 different and a little unique. 

418
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,561
    Really like the parsnips    
    and the roasted potatoes.   

419
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,763
 Tory, I got your Philly pretzel
        for the raw bar.        

420
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,632
       This is the kind of place
              I wanted to find, 

421
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,567
        where all the locals go,
            where they hang out,

422
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,168
              serve great food, 
         lots of good cocktails,

423
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,369
            a lot of craft beer.

424
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,639
This is when you go on vacation,
            you get into a town,

425
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,173
                you're like,    
         "Hey, where do you go?"

426
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,241
       This is the place you go.

427
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,476
          -Nicely done.         
           -Thank you.          

428
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,780
             FIERI:             
    Up next, in Minnesota...    

429
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,715
This would make you move        
   to Minneapolis.              

430
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,917
      ...a neighborhood pub     
    rising from the ashes...    

431
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,186
                There you go.   
                Look at that!   

432
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,322
    ...and taking their menu    
         to new heights.        

433
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:52,523
This is elevated bar food       
      big-time.                 

434
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,568
                     ♪♪         

435
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,573
          So, I'm here          
 in the Powderhorn neighborhood 

436
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,974
   of Minneapolis, Minnesota.   

437
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,911
  Now, listen, everybody loves  
    their favorite gastropub,   

438
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,244
     but here in this area,     

439
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,380
          these folks,          
     the neighbors, the fans    

440
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,049
     love the joint so much     
    that after it burnt down,   

441
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,519
     they helped raise money    
      to reopen the joint.      

442
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,921
    This is Buster's on 28th.   

443
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,127
      Got a Walleye Rachel      
      with sweet potatoes.      

444
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,928
     This is the definition     
     of a neighborhood bar.     

445
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,798
    -We got a turkey burger.    
-This place is like a super pub.

446
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,600
    It's just got great food,   
 great beers, and great people. 

447
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,336
             FIERI:             
     That's the kind of love    

448
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,738
      that owners Joel Hall     
    and Mike Steer hoped for    

449
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,674
   when they opened this joint  
            in 2007.            

450
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:45,209
But then things got interesting.

451
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:48,346
    There was a big bad storm   
          back in 2013.         

452
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:49,547
        The hood ignited.       

453
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,215
  I've been there.              
I've had a restaurant burn.     

454
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,551
The neighborhood got behind it, 
and you finally reopened.       

455
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,119
    Did you think               
it would actually happen?       

456
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,355
    It was pretty dark there    
       for a little while.      

457
00:15:57,357 --> 00:16:00,158
 They closed for a year, and it 
was the longest year of my life.

458
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,094
 FIERI: Even Chef Dave Steffens 
      was counting the days     

459
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,362
     until he could get back    
         to rockin' out         

460
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,698
    his own take on pub grub.   

461
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,298
   Gyro burger with coleslaw.   

462
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,769
   The menu here is not what I  
would consider typical bar food.

463
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,637
          Braised beef          
  with salt-and-vinegar chips.  

464
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,773
    It's beef cooked in beer.   
          It's awesome.         

465
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,775
      Just what you expect      
         and even more.         

466
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,977
   All right, so,               
what are we making first?       

467
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:20,979
             Beer-braised beef. 

468
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,312
 Start with brisket.            

469
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,515
     Yep, we're gonna just break
        her down into 4x4 cubes.

470
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,985
 Make it easier for all the beer
         to get to all the meat.

471
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:28,653
         And then we'll go ahead
              and season up --  

472
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,654
       a little salt and pepper,
  little garlic powder in there.

473
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,523
         Then we'll just give it
            a quick rub through.

474
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,524
        And then we top that off

475
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,059
              with some of our  
           julienne onions here.

476
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,528
   Mix in lots of garlic cloves.

477
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,398
               And, of course,  
       our local beer of choice.

478
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,398
    Heavy stout.                

479
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,733
We're gonna wrap it.            
In the oven. How long?          

480
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,935
                   8 hours      
           in a 500-degree oven.

481
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,138
So this is gonna cook down      
      to nada.                  

482
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,139
What are we making now?         

483
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,473
              Salt-and-vinegar  
                potato chips.   

484
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,675
                Idaho potato.   

485
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,810
 Soak them in water,            
pulling out the starch.         

486
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,812
          Gonna add a little bit
               of our vinegar.  

487
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:57,281
                    Salt.       

488
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:58,682
                  Go ahead      
        and just add it to that.

489
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,584
               We marinate it   
             for 12 to 24 hours.
Really?                         

490
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,554
       We pull it out and fry it
             straight to order. 

491
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,491
              So, we got it all 
           nice and cooked down.

492
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:07,892
    Look at that.               

493
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,227
I'll have some of that.

00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,362
            So, then we go ahead

496
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,699
           and separate our beef
            from our sauce here.

497
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,969
          Shred this bad boy up.
      Strain off any excess fat.

498
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:20,838
            And then we go ahead
              and buzz that up. 

499
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,641
      Go ahead and add our sauce
                back in here.

It's just overflowing with beef.
  It's got a great tangy sauce.

        It's just yummy.

527
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,568
      the greatest places to eat

528
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,237
             is to ask somebody 
       that owns a limo company.

529
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,838
           This is my buddy Gus.
             What do you think? 

530
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,306
    It's awesome,               
and it's what you want          

531
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,641
    when you sit                
 in a bar like this.            

532
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,643
  And the first thing I noticed 
      was all of the beers.     

533
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,111
          I think they only have
               like 32 on tap.

           this joint to people?

539

This is not bar food.           
 This is great food.

     I got a steak sandwich     
        with onion rings.       

541
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,395
          It's awesome.         
It's got this blue cheese sauce.

        Just scrumptious.

What are we making now?         

544
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,933
 A little bit of our blue cheese
dressing for our steak sandwich.

546
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,735
             and throw one nice 
        little shallot in there.

547
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,204
              Now we're adding  
                 our garlic.    

548
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,805
                Little salt,    
               little pepper.

00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,476
       Got our blue cheese here.

552
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,145
      We got a little buttermilk
           going in there, also.

553
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,014
             Give this a little 
                 pulse here.    

554
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:12,416
       Then we're gonna go ahead
  and add that back to the mayo.

555
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:13,617
    And then we got a little bit

556
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,419
     of our local hot sauce here
               from Minnesota.  

557
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,355
    Stir that up.               
Let it come together.           

558
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,356
           Blue cheese dressing.

559
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:19,690
                 Now we make    
             the steak sandwich.

560
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:20,958
     Now we do.                 

561
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,160
     So, we got our top cap here
             off of our sirloin.

562
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,495
               This is called   
                the culotte.    

563
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,896
             We just trim it up 
                 real quick,    

564
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,898
  and we go ahead and we portion
         into a 6-ounce portion.

565
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,233
               We'll go ahead   
             and butterfly this.

566
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:32,703
     Open. We'll give her a nice
    little sliced julienne here.

567
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:33,971
You got a lot of passion        
     about this.                

568
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:35,173
 It's very evident.             
     It's good.                 

569
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,107
        We take the sliced meat,
    and we go ahead and throw it

570
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,108
      right on our flattop here.

571
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,510
                Got a little    
              salt and pepper.  

572
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,379
     Seasoning blend, of course,
                 as always.     

573
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:44,181
  Got a little bit of our cooked
       bacon here, all julienne,

574
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,918
and some nice caramelized onions
  going on top of that, as well.

575
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,519
              Toasted bun here. 

576
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,387
        Beautiful steak sandwich
