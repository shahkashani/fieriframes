00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:03,469
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:06,338
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,407
          This trip...          
   Get down                     
with your bad self.             

4
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,209
      FIERI: ...we're going     
        from the Atlantic       

5
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:11,276
    to the Rocky Mountains...   

6
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:12,611
     Whoa-ho-ho!                

7
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,480
          FIERI: ...for         
    an East/West flavor-fest.   

8
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:16,147
You're gonna get warmed up      
       for it.                  

9
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,549
             FIERI:             
      In Washington, D.C...     

10
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:18,817
  Now, watch this.              

11
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,553
    FIERI: ...an underground,   
     upstairs Asian joint...    

12
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:22,888
       Crazy!                   

13
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,157
     FIERI: ...turning ramen    
        into an art form.       

14
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:27,626
It is truly a masterpiece       
      of food.                  

15
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:29,161
             FIERI:             
  In Ocean City, New Jersey...  

16
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,162
    There you go!               

17
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:31,897
             FIERI:             
  ...a red-hot Italian spot...  

18
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,832
 There's no slacker             
     over here.                 

19
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,968
    FIERI: ...firing up pizza   
          with a twist.         

20
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,703
    I'm a little                
freaked out right now.          

21
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,238
     FIERI: And in Colorado     
           Springs...           

22
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,572
I love how you're getting       
     after this.                

23
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:43,175
 ...a place where it's go big...
Look at that thing!             

24
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:44,109
             FIERI:             
     ...or go home cooking.     

25
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,845
 20-pound top round!            

26
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:50,416
     That's all right here,     
    right now on "Triple D."    

27
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:07,132
     So I'm here on H Street    
       in Washington, D.C.      

28
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:08,867
    And you know the tag line   
      I say all the time --     

29
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:10,402
 "If it's funky, I'll find it"? 

30
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,603
   Well, today, it should be,   

31
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,138
         "If it's funky,        
      I'll<i> try</i> to find it."     

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,874
  You see, I'm looking for this 
  kind of secretive noodle shop 

33
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,742
   that everybody knows about,  
     but it's hard to find.     

34
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,211
          That's 1232.          

35
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:20,479
          That's 1236.          

36
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:23,949
     This has got to be it.     
    This is Toki Underground.   

37
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:30,422
    We got a red miso ramen,    
            table 21.           

38
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,291
    Every dish is               
   a work of art.               

39
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,093
           Absolutely           
    my favorite ramen place.    

40
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:35,627
          Kimchi ramen.         

41
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,496
WOMAN: You can tell that so much
 effort was put into everything.

42
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:39,831
     There's so much flavor     
      and complexity to it.     

43
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,768
    FIERI: Almost as complex    
   as the man behind it all --  

44
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,703
     Chef Erik Bruner-Yang.     

45
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,037
              I'm from Taiwan.  

46
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,507
         Me and my mom came over
  to California when I was four.

47
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,708
You live in California?         

48
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,376
      Long Beach and then Japan.

49
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:54,046
             And so we traveled,
          and we've eaten a lot.

50
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:56,314
 FIERI: But eventually settling 
          here in D.C.,         

51
00:01:56,316 --> 00:02:01,653
     owning this funky spot     
 hidden above a pub since 2011. 

52
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,722
   There's no signage outside.  

53
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,858
 You wouldn't notice it at first
       when you walk past,      

54
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,860
     but as soon as you know    
 where it is, you never forget. 

55
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:10,462
     Especially with Erik's     
   serving up an Asian classic  

56
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,463
    he learned from his mom.    

57
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,731
 Vegetarian pan-fried dumplings.

58
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,066
            Oh, these are crack.

59
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,935
     Crunchy on the outside,    
       soft on the inside.      

60
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,937
         Very flavorful.        

61
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,339
  FIERI: All right,             
 let's get into it.             

62
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:23,075
   First, we're gonna start with
    our vegetarian dumpling mix.

63
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:24,610
       Got it.                  

64
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,678
                 Scallions,     
             some Napa cabbage. 

65
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,947
Someone around here has got     
some mean knife skills.         

66
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,815
                Daikon radish   
           that's been blanched.

67
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,951
             Shiitake mushrooms,
                 fried tofu.    

68
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,486
          -Fried tofu?          
             -Yeah.             

69
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,020
      Get down                  
 with your bad self.            

70
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,755
      -Then we mix this up.     
             -Okay.             

71
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,959
       Then we add pureed ginger
                 and garlic.    

72
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,028
That much ginger and garlic?    
      Oh, wow.                  

73
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,429
                    Salt.       

74
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,499
     Some black pepper, and then
     since we put so much garlic

75
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,767
          and ginger for flavor,

76
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,568
   we add a little bit of mirin,
                 some sugar,    

77
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,171
             to kind of balance 
                  that out.     

78
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:53,504
                 Soy sauce.     

79
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,640
       And then to finish off...

80
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:56,908
   You want to do the honors?   
            -Tell me.           

81
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,311
  A heavy sprinkle of togarashi,
               and that's it.   

82
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,646
Okay, so this is done.          
Now we make the dumplings?      

83
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,116
         -Yep, exactly.         
      -I want to see this.      

84
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:06,851
       BRUNER-YANG: Locally made
             dumpling wrappers. 

85
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,253
                Put the mix.    

86
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,124
               A little water.  

87
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,195
  And a nice little             
four-pleat on there,            

88
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,463
pressing a little bit           
of the air out of them.         

89
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:19,865
                 Sounds like    
              it's in your DNA. 

90
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:23,668
      Oh, I am                  
a dumpling-making machine.      

91
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,738
  Now, we're gonna              
go straight from here,          

92
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,273
      a little bit of oil.      
   -Just brown on the bottom.   

93
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,742
Just brown on the bottom.       
       Cover?                   

94
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,278
A little bit of water.          

95
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,613
     And because                
 they're not frozen             

96
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,682
and because we don't            
have raw meat in this,          

97
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:37,749
   these are gonna              
    come up fast.               

98
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,150
      Yeah, just about a minute.

99
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,820
             We're gonna do the 
   dumpling sauce on the bottom.

100
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,622
        Serve them skin-side-up.

101
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,627
                    Then,       
            we do the scallions.

102
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,297
          Our Chinese chili oil.

103
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,367
                And we finish   
      with a little sesame seed.

104
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:58,170
             And it is gonna be 
                  very hot.     

105
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:01,106
  I've never burned             
  my mouth before.              

106
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,708
                 I doubt it.    

107
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,910
 If I was Pinocchio,            
you would have been skewered.   
                      [ Laughs ]

108
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,051
                 [ Muffled ]    
             That's really hot. 

109
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,853
[ Muffled ] A little hot --     
     really hot!                

110
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,124
Might be the best vegetarian    
dumpling I've ever had.         

111
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,792
                   Thanks,      
       I really appreciate that.

112
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,994
Like, they always ask, you know,
what's your last meal?          

113
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,596
     When I put                 
 that list together,            

114
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,531
I think I'm gonna put           
this vegetarian dumpling        

115
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:29,668
    in that list.               

116
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,403
There's so much texture         
     in here --                 

117
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:37,475
 from the fried tofu            
to the shiitake to the diakon.  

118
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:40,478
And then the flavor explosion   
   that's going on              

119
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,080
with all that ginger            
 and all the garlic             

120
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,682
  is so outrageous.             

121
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,451
           Fantastic.           
           -Thank you.          

122
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,155
           It's sweet.          
           It's spicy.          

123
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,156
     It's just got a clever     
     combination of textures    

124
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,092
    in it with the shiitakes    
      and then the daikon.

  Anthony Hoy Fong.             

126
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,030
        It works so well.       

127
00:04:58,032 --> 00:05:00,832
You bite into it and it's kind  
of like a cornucopia.           

128
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,500
             Unlike             
    other vegetarian dishes,    

129
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,702
    you still feel satisfied    
    after you've eaten them.    

130
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,172
    I'm gonna say               
that you probably couldn't make 

131
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,508
two more dozen of those         
and see if I could eat them.    

132
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,708
        -I bet you can't.       
      -Gotta get warmed up.     

133
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,177
You're gonna get warmed up      
       for it.

          -Thanks, man.

    Welcome back.               

137
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,629
  Hanging out here              
at the Toki Underground in D.C. 

138
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:33,632
I just had probably the most    
amazing vegetarian dumplings    

139
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:34,966
you could ever imagine.         

140
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,903
So since you start off with     
a brief appetizer, what's next? 

141
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:41,573
  Our pulled pork that we put on
  top of the Toki Classic ramen.

142
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,442
        We're gonna pan-sear it.

143
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:44,776
            I'm just gonna build
                 some crust.    

144
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,044
So what happens next?           

145
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:49,114
             So we're gonna drop
  this big hunk of pork shoulder

146
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,648
                 in the pot.    

147
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,451
               And then we do   
           low-sodium soy sauce.

148
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,920
 I can already tell             
this is gonna be fantastic.     

149
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:59,524
        Mirin, so it gets a nice
     little sugary glaze on top.

150
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,526
           Chinese cooking wine.

151
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,061
                  And then      
             just to top it off,

152
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,730
         we toast our own little
    Chinese five-spice blend up.

153
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,867
Dude, you are crazy!            

154
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,468
             We cover it in foil
        and drop it in the oven.

155
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,270
        -How long? At --        
          -Five hours.          

156
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,873
              -325.             
              -325.             

157
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:19,678
And the ramens have an abundance
of items that can go in it.     

158
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,013
              We usually have 8 
         to 10 different add-ons

159
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,215
              that you can do.  

160
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,882
             Pork belly, I mean,
        there's chicken oysters.

161
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,350
    -You got chicken oysters?   
              -Yep.             

162
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,487
  You're harvesting             
your own chicken oysters        

163
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,021
        from the chicken?       
            -Correct.           

164
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:33,225
And you want to talk            
  about flavorful?              

165
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,760
   Now watch this.              

166
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:36,761
                There's like    
         a little piece of meat.

167
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,497
      Right --                  
So right in this flank --

Wouldn't you call that          
 in the flank area?             

169
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,233
               Yeah, it's like  
              your love handle. 

170
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,035
     Yeah, it's                 
the chicken love handle.        

171

      Perfect.                  

172
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,373
        And we'll sear it so you
   get crispy skin, tender meat.

173
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,710
God, people gotta go nuts       
      for that.                 

174

   how we build all the soups.  
             -Okay.             

176
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,181
                Our stock is    
               triple stock --  

177
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:00,518
        pork stock, dashi stock,
     chicken stock all combined.

Got it. So let's start off      
with the dashi stock.           

179

     First up will be the kombu,
      which is Japanese seaweed.

180
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:08,326
         Drop the bonito flakes,
   and then we have this tea bag

181
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:10,629
      mix of different mackerels
               all smashed up.  

182
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:15,467
       It is.                   
It really is a fish tea bag.    

183
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,468
                  And then      
      you just turn the pot off.

184
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,338
    Then we just let it rest.   
         -Okay, next up?        

185
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,039
                   First,       
       we start with pork stock,

186
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,009
        which is just pork bones
                 and water.     

187
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,411
             Add chicken stock. 

188
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:30,081
   Chicken stock is with garlic,
    ginger, onions, and carrots,

189
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,549
                and we do it    
     for about a couple house --

190
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,684
              just the carcass. 

191
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,820
  -And then the dashi goes in.  
              -Yep.             

192
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:37,222
Now we'll strain it,            
creating the service soup.      

193

 to make some ramen?            

194
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,693
   -Yeah, we can finally eat.   
      -Let's get after it.      

195
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:43,361
               So we're gonna   
         do our braising liquid.

196
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,363
         This is pork fat, salt.

197

This was the braising liquid    
 from the pork butt.            

198
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,367
                It is the fat   
        that we skim from the --

     the actual braising liquid.

201
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,640
            And then we're gonna
          add the service broth.

202
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,575
            Then we're gonna put
        our noodles in the bowl.

 Little bit of rich,            
 little bit of tang,            

226
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,576
 little bit of chew.            

227
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,513
And I didn't even crack the egg 
and let that come out.          

228
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,781
     It is truly                
a masterpiece of food.          

229
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,385
                Thanks, man.    
         I really appreciate it.

230
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,320
  Toki Classic, chicken oyster. 

231
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,857
     The flavor in the broth    
        is very complex.        

232
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:23,528
    You can't stop eating it.   
         I love it here.        

233
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,129
       As soon as I leave,      
          I'm thinking          

234
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,931
       about the next time      
        I'm coming back.        

235
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,733
Brother, you're doing           
it one bowl at a time.          

236
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,902
 -Thanks, man, I appreciate it. 
          -Incredible.          

237
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,808
        FIERI: Coming up        
  in Ocean City, New Jersey...  

238
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,542
             Props to that, man.

239
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,612
             FIERI:             
     ...a pizza-pasta place.    
  Oh!                           

240
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:42,146
    FIERI: ...putting a kick    
         into chicken...        

241
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,147
   Right on point.              

242
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,749
             FIERI:             
    ...and a burger onto pie.   

243
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,819
 It's a cheeseburger            
on a big toasted bun.           

244
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:58,562
           So I'm here          
   in Ocean City, New Jersey,   

245
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,632
     about 15 minutes south     
        of Atlantic City.       

246
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:03,501
    And it's called America's   
     Greatest Family Resort.    

247
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:06,237
     Now, in the summertime,    
      up to 150,000 people.     

248
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,972
   Wintertime, down to 10,000.  

249
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,508
  And the locals, well, they're 
stoked to tell you about a place

250
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,976
  that's open all year 'round.  

251
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,446
  But even more so because they 
 got the bomb wood-fired pizza! 

252
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,014
        This is Piccini.        

253
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,518
 Tomato gorgonzola.             

254
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,453
      The pizza is awesome.     
       Everything's great.      

255
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,788
Pesto chicken, pick up.         

256
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,323
-It's like comfort Italian food.
       -Seafood cioppino.       

257
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,525
  A couple of streets that way, 

258
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,327
   you're right on the ocean,   
        on the boardwalk.       

259
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,796
Or if you walk this way a couple
blocks, you're right on the bay.

260
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,265
      You got the beach --      
       a good place to be.      

261
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,200
    FIERI: That's definitely    
  what Dave Cates was thinking  

262
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,337
   in '95 when he and his wife  
  moved here from Pennsylvania  

263
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,739
       to open this joint.      

264
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,440
      I saw this property,      
           and I said,          

265
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,275
        "That would make        
      a great pizza shop."      

266
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,476
         FIERI: Which one of you
                 does pizza?    

267
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,012
   I was the original employee  
    hired here 21 years ago.    

268
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,480
             Props to that, man!

269
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,215
         All wood-fired?        
        -All wood-fired.        

270
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,751
Yo, I got two minutes on        
that bacon cheeseburger pizza.  

271
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,686
      It's just like eating     
         a cheeseburger.        

272
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,355
         With the great,        
       crispy pizza crust,      

273
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,823
       and it's wonderful.      

274
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,692
  Let's talk about              
what makes great pizza.         

275
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,427
                Great dough.    
     It's like building a house.

276
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,695
                 Gotta start    
             from the ground up.

277
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,096
                 Great base     
             equals good pizza. 

278
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:07,232
     Great<i> bass</i>                 
also equals Metallica.          

279
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,299
                 Absolutely.    

280
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,101
           First, we're going in
               with semolina.   

281
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,236
              Salt, some water. 

282
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,905
    We gonna get                
 any yeast in this?             

283
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,373
             Believe it or not, 
               it goes later.   

284
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,409
             -Okay.             
        -Now we mix this.       

285
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,845
     Now we're adding flour.    
        -So no yeast yet.       

286
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,246
                  Not yet.      

287
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,915
       Granulated garlic.       
            -Got it.            

288
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,183
                   Thyme.       

289
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,919
              Now the yeast --  
             Dry instant yeast. 

290
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,454
 We let this go for,            
what, 15, 20 minutes?           

291
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,722
             About 10, maybe 11.

292
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:31,923
Till it starts to pull          
 away from the side?            

293
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,325
      Maybe 11?                 

294
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,760
   We go straight               
from this to portioning.        

295
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:36,927
              -Yes.             
   -How long we gonna hold it   

296
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,062
        before we use it?       
           -24 hours.           

297
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,530
   24 hours, okay.              
 What are we making?            

298
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,733
          The bacon cheeseburger
                   pizza.       

299
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,001
    There you go!               

300
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:45,469
No slacker over here.           

301
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,005
             Now we go ketchup. 

302
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,206
  Whoa, whoa, whoa,             
  whoa, whoa, whoa!             

303
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,476
         No sauce on this one --
            ketchup and mustard.

304
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,010
I'm a little freaked out        
     right now.                 

305
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,212
           You're gonna love it.

306
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,947
    What goes better on a burger
            than cheddar cheese?

307
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,015
             Cheddar jack down. 

308
00:11:57,017 --> 00:12:00,218
               Our house-made   
           seasoned ground beef.

309
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,352
 What did you season            
      it with?                  

310
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,354
           Salt, pepper, garlic,
             and taco seasoning.

311
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,890
It gives that beef a little bit 
extra, okay, I get it.          

312
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,825
             Now a little bacon.

313
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,361
        And she's ready to roll.

314
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:12,696
          -Six minutes.         
          -Here we go.          

315
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,899
If there was a pizza            
that looked like a cheeseburger,

316
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:18,503
 I'd give it to you             
 right there. Okay.             

317
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,238
                   Top it       
             with a dill pickle.

318
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,973
         That's it, that's a go.

319
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,178
         Oh!                    

320
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,182
    Yeah, get a pickle in there.
            Cut through the fat.

321
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,718
 It's a cheeseburger            
on a big toasted bun.           

322
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,187
   A cheeseburger               
with awesome texture.           

323
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,989
        Nicely done, man.       
           -Thank you.          

324
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,657
          WOMAN: Here's         
    your cheeseburger pizza.    

325
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,526
       Between the ketchup      
         and the mustard        

326
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,995
    and then the little kick    
        of the seasoning,       

327
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,663
        which is really,        
    really tasty and unique.    

328
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,865
      The wood-fired crust      
       is just excellent.       

329
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,201
   It's a big deal              
 for the restaurants            

330
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,336
   that stay open               
during the winter months --     

331
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,805
there's not many of them.       

332
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,406
But that's a really important   
 thing for you guys             

333
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:56,607
that are living here            
     full-time.                 

334
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,209
                  Yes, sir.     

335
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,011
             Plus, it's not just
               a pizza joint,   

336
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,080

   on the chicken.              

382

A little kiss of basil right    
at the end really opens up.

    gives you a little punch.   

389

the garlic in and everything.
