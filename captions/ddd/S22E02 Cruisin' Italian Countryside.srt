00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,075
You're gonna finish the last    
part of the cooking right there 

228
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:33,078
and let the pasta absorb it.    
     Okay, and now we can plate.

229
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,212

231
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,484
             And then we finish 
      with the dry-aged ricotta.

232
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:40,752
  Dry-aged ricotta.

236
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,292
               And we're done.

but prepared so perfectly.

That is out of bounds.

The calamari is fresh,          
and it's super tender.          

241
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,781
The shrimp, also fresh,

     and you saw                
how beautiful that was.         

243

 Just nice and pink.            

244
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:17,656
And then we've got this         
handmade pasta cooked al dente. 

245
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:22,661
This is worth the plane ticket  
 to Italy by itself.

   of a deep-fried artichoke.

    and really, really good.

              We're gonna clean 
               the artichoke.   

259
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,222
              We take the leaf.

264
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,032

                 the leaves.    

265

So, now we take these.

             the pasta by hand. 

455
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,515
Now I cut it and form it        
   into tortelli.               

456
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,450
Next, they are gonna go         
  in the water now.             
                    Okay.       

457
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,853
Now is the reduction            
of the oxtail and the carrots   

458
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:38,523
together with a touch of butter 
 and sherry vinegar.            

459
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:39,257
                    Okay.       

460
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,725
Now we get the tortelli.        

461
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,294
           Just let it coat that
                a little bit.   

462
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,596
  Okay. That's it.              

463
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,801
   So, now we add               
 the Vezzena cheese,            

464
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,870
   the olive oil.               

465
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,338
                 Very nice.     

466
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,675
                    Wow.        

467
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,878
That olive oil is in a different
           class all by itself. 

468
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,747
Do you mind if I try some?      
     Oh, please, please, please.

469
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,818
      You know, my favorite part
          about the whole thing 

470
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,487
             is that little kiss
              of that vinegar.  

471
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,759
            The pasta has bite. 
           Incredibly flavorful.

472
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,627
                 The texture    
             is nice and creamy.

473
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:17,929
                   I mean,      
         all of it is delicious.

474
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,433
    One of the best tortelli    
            in Lucca.           

475
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,169
 They are perfect with red wine.

476
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,371
        When you come to a city 
       like this, you don't know

477
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:28,906
               what is local,   
              what is tourist,  

478
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,908
            and this is kind of 
            off the beaten path.

479
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,710
              And when you come 
           into your restaurant,

480
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,845
              it's like coming  
           into somebody's home.

481
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,781
I think that is what            
 I was looking for.             

482
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:40,251
 The quality of the ingredients 
      is really very good,      

483
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:45,656
  using the tradition of Lucca  
  and some creative approach.   

484
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,991
    What are we gonna make next?
The carbonara mussel.           

485
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,194
Instead of the bacon,           
which is a traditional recipe,  

486
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,929
 we use the mussel.             

487
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,432
Should we drop the pasta?       
                This is like    
            short, fat rigatoni.

488
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:55,666
        Yeah.                   

489
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,535
                 All right,     
               so now we take   

490
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:58,936
               all the mussels  
               that are cooked  

491
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,605
             out of the shell,  
             saving the liquid. 

492
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:04,008
  Okay, so, we work             
   with the mussel              

493
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,210
   and the water                
   of the mussel.               

494
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:09,013
 We remove the pasta            
  from the boiling.             

495
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,748
  We have generous              
Parmesan cheese on the top.     

496
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,684
That's gonna make a nice, little
   sauce with the mussel water. 

497
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:16,220
   And then we add              
only the yoke of the eggs.      

498
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,689
              Gonna work it in. 
                   Great.       

499
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,825
               Beautiful dish.  

500
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,061
Now we're gonna add             
the Parmesan cheese.            

501
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,566
We add the pepper now           
with a touch of olive oil.      

502
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,303
      My mouth is just firing up
                  for this.     

503
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,841
              Very impressive.  

504
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:40,511
   You like your pasta al dente,
                 my friend,     

505
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,712
               and that is how  
                I like mine.    

506
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,982
                What I love,    

507
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:49,519
         you've allowed mussels 
  to take the place of pancetta.

508
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,122
                It's refined.   

509
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:54,191
          It definitely has its 
   respectable notes and accents

510
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,860
            and representations.

511
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:56,860
             I'm impressed, man.

512
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,462
             Thank you very much
               for having me.   

513
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,864
 Really, I got to tell you, man,
             you're a good cat. 

514
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,000
 [ Speaks Italian ]             

515
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,669
  The mix of the eggs, cheese,  
         and mussels --         

516
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,872
      They test very well.      

517
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,675
       I watch you and I listen 
    and things are very precise,

518
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,343
              but then you have 
                a wild side.    

519
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,078
That is one of the best things  
   they say to me               

520
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,346
in the last 20 years.           

521
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:17,615
  So, you're blond,             
but you're not a nice girl,     

522
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:20,418
because if you was a nice girl, 
I would kiss you, okay?         

523
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,352
           You're a good friend.

524
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,955
                I really like   
              friends like you. 

525
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:27,224
Was that a great "Triple D" tour
        in Italy or what?       

526
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,294
       I got to tell you,       
  there's just one last thing.  

527
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,496
            You know,           
 you haven't been able to drive 

528
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,698
  on top of the walls of Lucca  
           since '85,           

529
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,301
        but when you got        
 a nice, red Ferrari like this, 

530
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,904
    well, you just have to --   
      You know what I mean?     

531
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,873
    I'll see you next time on   
 "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives."
