1
00:00:03,468 --> 00:00:04,503
Hey, there.

2
00:00:04,603 --> 00:00:05,970
I'm Guy Fieri,
and we're rolling out

3
00:00:06,071 --> 00:00:09,441
looking for America's greatest
diners, drive‐ins, and dives.

4
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:10,642
This trip...

5
00:00:10,742 --> 00:00:12,011
What's that over there?

6
00:00:13,712 --> 00:00:14,679
These are delicious.

7
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:18,250
It's buns, beef,
and one funky burger.

8
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,951
I want my mommy.

9
00:00:20,052 --> 00:00:22,387
We've got a charcuterie
smorgasbord in Denver.

10
00:00:22,487 --> 00:00:23,955
I want to tour
the showroom.

11
00:00:24,056 --> 00:00:25,290
I want to test drive
everything.

12
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,626
A worldwide web of flavor
in Utah.

13
00:00:27,726 --> 00:00:29,128
That is good.

14
00:00:29,228 --> 00:00:30,662
And in Juneau, Alaska...

15
00:00:30,762 --> 00:00:31,696
You're rocking it,
Bro.

16
00:00:31,796 --> 00:00:33,365
...a chef taking a "bao"...

17
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:34,666
Benny's with
the bun police.

18
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:36,535
He doesn't carry a gun,
just a bun.

19
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:38,170
...in a tiny little trailer.

20
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,372
I mean, Brother,
this is outstanding.

21
00:00:40,472 --> 00:00:42,107
That's all right here,
right now,

22
00:00:42,207 --> 00:00:44,843

&amp; Dives."

25
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:58,957
I'm here in Juneau, Alaska,
right across the street

26
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:00,259
from where all the big cruise
ships come in,

27
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,526
and great news, folks,

28
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:03,835
I have got a special guest.
No, it's not an actress,

29
00:01:03,935 --> 00:01:05,604
it's not a sports star,
it's not a politician.

30
00:01:05,704 --> 00:01:07,972
No, it's somebody that's really
big here in Alaska,

31
00:01:08,073 --> 00:01:09,541
and no, it's not Sasquatch.

32
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:11,543
No, this guy's
from North Pole, Alaska.

33
00:01:11,643 --> 00:01:13,012
He's the triple D‐O‐G.

34
00:01:13,112 --> 00:01:15,647
He's the one and only
Benny Lin from Pagoda.

35
00:01:15,747 --> 00:01:17,449
All right, Chef,
do you like bao buns?

36
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,084
Yes, I do. You want me
to make you some?

37
00:01:19,184 --> 00:01:20,152
I can make you some.

38
00:01:20,252 --> 00:01:21,320
No, Benny,
we've already done that.

39
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,055
You've been on the show.
You're a guest this time.

40
00:01:23,155 --> 00:01:24,756
We're going to go check out
a dude that's making great buns.

41
00:01:24,856 --> 00:01:26,525
This is Bun Daddy.

42
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:29,828
Full Boar coming up next.

43
00:01:29,928 --> 00:01:32,531
Bun Daddy has a unique flavor
in Juneau.

44
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:37,236
I would describe it as a street
taco mated with a steamed bun,

45
00:01:37,336 --> 00:01:39,204
and they created some magic.

46
00:01:39,304 --> 00:01:43,342
FIERI:
All conjured up in a 1968 camper
by husband and wife team,

47
00:01:43,442 --> 00:01:46,245
Laura Steele
and Max Goldrich.

48
00:01:46,345 --> 00:01:47,746
Where did you learn
to cook? Just...

49
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:50,149
Self‐taught.
I loved steam buns

50
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:52,917
and I couldn't get the ones here
that I wanted to eat.

51
00:01:53,018 --> 00:01:54,619
It ain't no fun
unless you got buns, hun?

52
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,754
Exactly.

53
00:01:55,854 --> 00:01:57,589
The buns are really fluffy
and delicious.

54
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,424
Almost like a cotton
candy of bread.

55
00:01:59,524 --> 00:02:01,660
We got a Belly of the Beast
bun coming up.

56
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,968
Belly of the Beast is kinda like
a bacon lover's dream.

57
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:06,038
A little bit of veg on there,
the sriracha sauce.

58
00:02:06,138 --> 00:02:07,839
Unicorn pork buns.

59
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:09,208
So, let's make
the buns.

60
00:02:09,308 --> 00:02:11,410
GOLDRICH:
We're going to start out
with the water here,

61
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,812
we've got sugar next,
and then we'll add the yeast,

62
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:17,182
oil, baking powder,
and all‐purpose flour.

63
00:02:17,282 --> 00:02:18,916
‐No eggs, huh?
‐No.

64
00:02:19,017 --> 00:02:20,218
Make notes.

65
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:22,187
So you make all these buns
in this little trailer?

66
00:02:22,287 --> 00:02:23,455
By scratch every day.

67
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:25,124
Cruise ships run
May to September.

68
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:27,326
That's when we're open.
‐What do you do after that?

69
00:02:27,426 --> 00:02:29,894
Go to the Legislature
and work there for a little bit.

70
00:02:29,994 --> 00:02:31,696
Go from Buns
to Legislature?

71
00:02:31,796 --> 00:02:33,598
‐Yeah.
‐All right, after it's done?

72
00:02:33,698 --> 00:02:36,368
Proof for about an hour
or so until it doubles.

73
00:02:36,468 --> 00:02:37,836
Portion that.
‐How many ounces?

74
00:02:37,936 --> 00:02:39,571
‐2 ounces.
‐Pretty spot‐on.

75
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:40,772
And I roll them.

76
00:02:40,872 --> 00:02:42,241
So, you're turning
it inside to itself?

77
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:44,343
Yeah. Let those
proof again,

78
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:46,578
roll it out,
do a drop of oil on it.

79
00:02:46,678 --> 00:02:49,048
Fold it in half.
Throw it in on the steamer.

80
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:51,516
‐How long is it go?
‐10 to 12 minutes.

81
00:02:51,616 --> 00:02:52,851
Really impressed.

82
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:55,154
Benny's with the bun police.
Benny is a bun cop.

83
00:02:55,254 --> 00:02:56,988
He doesn't carry a gun,
just a bun.

84
00:02:57,089 --> 00:03:00,192
FIERI:
Filmed on location with the men
and women of Flavortown.

85
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:01,726
All right, we're going
to do the pork belly.

86
00:03:01,826 --> 00:03:04,369
For the glaze,
first, we will add the sriracha,

87
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:06,571
rice vinegar, hoisin, and honey.
‐Oh, that's nice.

88
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:09,174
Pour some in here.
Seal that up.

89
00:03:11,876 --> 00:03:14,379
Go into the sous‐vide
for seven hours.

90
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,747
176.

91
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:17,082
Well, I do it at 178.

92
00:03:17,182 --> 00:03:18,517
Benny, what temperature
you do it at?

93
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:19,551
‐179.
‐Ooh.

94
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:21,820
‐Yeah, see.
‐Pork belly is done.

95
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,024
I reserve this extra liquid
as a sauce to put on top.

96
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:27,759
Slice up the pork belly,
hit it with the glaze,

97
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:29,728
and throw it in the oven
for just a couple minutes.

98
00:03:29,828 --> 00:03:32,231
‐Oh, okay.
‐Let it get all tacky on it.

99
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:34,599
Tacky not like the outfits
you wore in Vegas last year.

100
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:37,269
See Benny, watch this.

101
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:38,870
Wow, that's
got great flavor.

102
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,773
‐I like it.
‐Steamed buns, big fatty.

103
00:03:41,873 --> 00:03:42,841
Cucumber.

104
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:45,244
Green onion, hit it
with the sauce,

105
00:03:45,344 --> 00:03:47,979
and then a little sprinkling
of sesame seeds.

106
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,282
Here you go Benny.
Let's take a bite.

107
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,584
Wow.

108
00:03:54,286 --> 00:03:55,520
I told him you were
the bun police.

109
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,621
Now, you're going
to steal the recipe?

110
00:03:56,721 --> 00:03:58,790
‐Yeah. [ Laughs ]
‐I think it's dynamite.

111
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,393
The pork belly itself
is spot‐on.

112
00:04:01,493 --> 00:04:02,634
It's not
your typical bun.

113
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:05,570
♪♪♪

114
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,039
It's a little less
doughy.

115
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:09,674
The cucumber's a nice touch,
a little sesame seed.

116
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:11,810
Sell the sauce.

117
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,845
‐Yeah, it's good.
‐You're rocking it, Bro.

118
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:15,747
I got a Belly of the Beast
for Buck.

119
00:04:15,847 --> 00:04:17,516
The pork belly is ‐‐
just melts in your mouth.

120
00:04:17,616 --> 00:04:18,883
Juicy and full of flavor.

121
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:21,153
And it goes really good
with the softness of the bun.

122
00:04:21,253 --> 00:04:22,454
‐Can I help the next person?
‐It's delicious.

123
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,023
So, the only thing bad
about Bun Daddy

124
00:04:24,123 --> 00:04:25,590
is that you only get them
in the summer season.

125
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,791
That's right.

126
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,227
MAN: We're a short beat
right next to the ocean.

127
00:04:28,327 --> 00:04:29,961
You definitely get the tourist
people that come out here,

128
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:31,730
but this is
a local spot, absolutely.

129
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,932
‐Favorite thing on the menu?
‐This chicken is delicious.

130
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:37,869
He uses a fish sauce marinade.
It's a unique flavor.

131
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:40,972
It's got fresh jalapeños,
lots of fresh vegetables.

132
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,407
FIERI:
Now we're back in
to make the...

133
00:04:42,507 --> 00:04:44,109
‐Mother Clucker.
‐Mother Clucker.

134
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:46,345
Start out with the sugar,
lime juice.

135
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:47,679
Where's this recipe
come from?

136
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:48,713
Made it up?

137
00:04:48,813 --> 00:04:50,049
Okay.
Fish sauce?

138
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:52,317
Yeah, and garlic.

139
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,486
And the bowl. It's part
of the ceremony, Benny.

140
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:55,987
Boneless, skinless
chicken thighs.

141
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,189
And how long is
that going to marinade?

142
00:04:57,289 --> 00:04:58,757
‐Overnight.
‐And we're going to fry these?

143
00:04:58,857 --> 00:05:02,067
No, we will grill them out
on the barbecue outside.

144
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,268
Okay.
What's up next?

145
00:05:03,368 --> 00:05:05,337
So, we're making pickled
daikon and carrot.

146
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:09,641
We'll start with rice vinegar,
water, sugar, chili flake.

147
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:11,210
I like spicy, I just
don't think I've ever had

148
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,346
my pickled daikon and carrots
with that kind of intensity.

149
00:05:14,446 --> 00:05:15,880
I'll put a couple ice cubes
into it.

150
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,383
Just so it's not going to
sit there and cook it.

151
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:22,587
The daikon and rainbow carrots.
Pour this over the top.

152
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:25,824
Put it in the refrigerator
to pickle overnight.

153
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:26,858
Let's see it, Chef.

154
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,460
A little bit of chicken.

155
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,828
Your mouth's watering,
isn't it Benny?
Oh, yeah.

156
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:32,197
I can hear you making
noises like Mmm, mmm, mmm.

157
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:35,934
Hoisin sauce,
Japanese Mayo, cucumber ‐‐

158
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,169
He loves
his cucumbers.

159
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:39,004
‐Jalapeños.
‐Ooh.

160
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:40,472
Pickled daikon
and carrot.

161
00:05:40,572 --> 00:05:41,706
For a guy that's
not a chef,

162
00:05:41,806 --> 00:05:43,242
you sure have a touch
here, buddy.

163
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,345
Locally grown radish
greens. There you are.

164
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:48,247
Enjoy, guys.

165
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,182
Can you see me here?

166
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:52,584
That's my line,
Benny.

167
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:53,885
Wow, this is good.

168
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:55,587
The bun, we already know
is dynamite.

169
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:57,122
The marinade on the chicken's
really dynamite.

170
00:05:57,222 --> 00:05:59,424
The fact that
you're grilling it, home run.

171
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:02,834
The kicker is that super
unctuous creamy Mayo.

172
00:06:02,934 --> 00:06:04,269
Got a little touch
of sweetness to it.

173
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:06,538
And then all of a sudden,
the refreshing kick of the acid

174
00:06:06,638 --> 00:06:08,140
from the daikon and the carrot.
‐Yeah.

175
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,942
I mean, Brother,
it's outstanding.

176
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:12,144
Yep.

177
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:14,613
Enjoy.

178
00:06:14,713 --> 00:06:16,681
The meat has a little bit
of crispiness on it,

179
00:06:16,781 --> 00:06:18,117
but it's still really juicy.

180
00:06:18,217 --> 00:06:20,319
The spices they put on top,
all the sauces,

181
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:21,753
it just kind of soaks
right into the bun.

182
00:06:21,853 --> 00:06:23,555
Great combination.

183
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:25,824
Max finds a way to make
big things happen

184
00:06:25,924 --> 00:06:27,192
in a very small area.

185
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:30,095
If I was coming to Juneau,
this is where I'd come.

186
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:31,830
You have great
appreciation for detail.

187
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,532
You're working in
a very confined space.

188
00:06:33,632 --> 00:06:34,999
And what you do
and what you deliver

189
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,201
and how you treat
the public, dude,

190
00:06:36,301 --> 00:06:37,202
you're a reason
to come to Juneau.

191
00:06:37,302 --> 00:06:40,172
Thank you very much.

192
00:06:40,272 --> 00:06:42,741
FIERI: Up next, a carnivore's
dream in Denver...

193
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:43,742
Keep going before
I eat

194
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:44,976
everything that goes
on the sandwich.

195
00:06:45,077 --> 00:06:46,511
...artisan cured meats...

196
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:47,812
Oh, that ham.

197
00:06:47,912 --> 00:06:50,515
...on handcrafted
culinary canvases.

198
00:06:50,615 --> 00:06:52,084
Hi, have you met my friend,
Overachiever?

199
00:06:54,753 --> 00:06:59,591
♪♪♪

200
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:01,693
So I'm here in the Highlands
area of Denver, Colorado,

201
00:07:01,793 --> 00:07:02,767
and I tell you,
if you ever want

202
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:04,436
to just parachute
right into an area

203
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:07,006
and hit some awesome triple D
joints, this would be the place.

204
00:07:07,106 --> 00:07:09,374
Let's see, you've got the second
location for Atomic Cowboy.

205
00:07:09,474 --> 00:07:10,875
You got the second location
for Biju,

206
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:13,945
Cafe Brazil, you got
Hops &amp; Pie down the street.

207
00:07:14,046 --> 00:07:15,814
And I think we have a new one
to put on the list.

208
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:19,618
With this chef, he is scratch
making 45 different salumis.

209
00:07:19,718 --> 00:07:21,886
And you know what? He'll even
put it on a sandwich for you.

210
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:24,623
This is Il Porcellino Salumi.

211
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,626
Andouille sausage.

212
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:30,129
It's all the delicious meat
you could ever want.

213
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:33,032
Everything's artisanal.
Everything's made in‐house.

214
00:07:33,132 --> 00:07:34,366
MAN: They're using the same
techniques they did

215
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:37,102
back in Italy, and in my
opinion, they even do it better.

216
00:07:37,202 --> 00:07:39,371
FIERI: And the man behind
this carnivore emporium

217
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:40,572
is Bill Miner,

218
00:07:40,672 --> 00:07:43,142
who's all about
making meat his mission.

219
00:07:43,242 --> 00:07:44,576
Been a chef
for the past 20 years.

220
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:46,645
Found a passion
for cured meats.

221
00:07:46,745 --> 00:07:48,780
Am I at a butcher shop?
A sandwich shop?

222
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,149
Yes.
All of the above.

223
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:52,384
They have this really
great unique menu

224
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:54,319
that serves these
incredible sandwiches.

225
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,521
Hoggie sandwich
with an applesauce is up.

226
00:07:56,621 --> 00:07:58,823
I love The Hoggie. That's one
of my favorites.

227
00:07:58,923 --> 00:08:02,534
The soppressata, the capicola,
and then the ham is fantastic.

228
00:08:02,634 --> 00:08:05,037
Great combination of smoke
and spice

229
00:08:05,137 --> 00:08:07,106
that then gets rounded out
by the aioli.

230
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:08,473
We're making
The Hoggie sandwich.

231
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:10,642
‐This is your style of ham?
‐This is our style of ham.

232
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:11,910
What muscle is this
that we have?

233
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:14,379
So, we could call this
the inside round muscle.

234
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,581
Do we want to call it that or
are we just going to make it up?

235
00:08:16,681 --> 00:08:17,982
‐No, it's called ‐‐
‐Let's call this the...

236
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:18,983
Let's call it the
inside round.

237
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:20,319
...the pig one muscle.

238
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:21,386
No. Make the brine.

239
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:24,656
Salt, brown sugar,
maple syrup.

240
00:08:24,756 --> 00:08:26,191
Pour some...

241
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,492
Liquid sugar on me?

242
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:31,363
Some coriander seed, clove,
lot of allspice,

243
00:08:31,463 --> 00:08:32,831
toasted fennel seed,

244
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:37,002
mustard seed, bay leaf,
celery powder, water.

245
00:08:37,102 --> 00:08:38,303
Bring it up to a boil

246
00:08:38,403 --> 00:08:41,440
and let it simmer
for 5, 7 minutes.

247
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,941
And then once it's cooled
and it's strained,

248
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:44,043
you can start
the injection?

249
00:08:44,143 --> 00:08:45,177
Absolutely.

250
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:46,845
You get a little bit
of that liquid in here.

251
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:48,380
And we'll let this set up
for how long

252
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,514
before we start
to cook it?

253
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:51,383
10 days.
Tie it...

254
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:53,152
‐Smoke it.
‐...smoke it on hickory.

255
00:08:53,252 --> 00:08:54,453
Dig it.

256
00:08:54,553 --> 00:08:55,687
All right, Soppressata.

257
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:57,422
First we have
to mix our spices.

258
00:08:57,522 --> 00:08:59,191
Dextrose, which is
a pine sugar,

259
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,726
Sicilian Sea Salt,
Calabrian Chilies,

260
00:09:01,826 --> 00:09:05,304
and Italian hot pepper,
sweet Calabrian powder,

261
00:09:05,404 --> 00:09:07,439
toasted fennel seed,
garlic powder,

262
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:09,908
black pepper, celery powder.
‐Got it.

263
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:13,578
So ground pork shoulder,
add our frozen pork fat to that.

264
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,281
Season this up.
Add some red wine.

265
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:19,051
Soppressata going into
our sown hog casing.

266
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:22,454
Tie up the end real quick,
and do lots of loops and knots.

267
00:09:22,554 --> 00:09:24,023
We're going to loop
and knot this for the rest

268
00:09:24,123 --> 00:09:26,258
of the week, Captain,
or we making a quilt?

269
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,161
So in the fermentation
chamber for about 48 hours,

270
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:30,895
and then into
our drying room,

271
00:09:30,995 --> 00:09:34,199
which sits at about 60 degrees
for about 10 weeks.

272
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:35,634
Should I just start
eating it now...
Not yet.

273
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:36,668
...or wait till it
goes on a sandwich?

274
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:38,437
Not yet.
We've got our Soppressata.

275
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:39,671
Now what's that
over there?

276
00:09:41,006 --> 00:09:42,007
These are delicious.

277
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:43,175
Keep going before
I eat everything

278
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:44,576
that goes
on the sandwich.

279
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:47,079
I'm going to show you the inside
of this capicola real quick.

280
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:48,447
What do we rub that in?

281
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,550
Fennel seed, Calabrian Chili,
a little garlic pepper.

282
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,584
Delicious.

283
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:54,153
Slice this ciabatta
right in half

284
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:55,820
and get it toasting
on the flat top.

285
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,222
Garlic aioli.

286
00:09:57,322 --> 00:09:59,491
Layer these meats on here,
so we've got our Berkeley Ham.

287
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:01,226
Layer these meats
in my mouth.

288
00:10:01,326 --> 00:10:02,734
Oh, that ham.
‐It's good, right?

289
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:05,737
No, this is not good.
There's not even close to good.

290
00:10:05,837 --> 00:10:08,340
Good's here.
This is where your ham is.

291
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,841
Like skyscraper ham.

292
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:13,178
We've got our capicola, our
Soppressata, pickled peppers.

293
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:15,347
If you made those,
I'm going to just kick you.

294
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:16,581
We make
the pickled peppers.

295
00:10:16,681 --> 00:10:17,749
Of course we do,
we make the peppers.

296
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:18,983
Tomatoes.

297
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:22,021
We also milled this wood,
and he hand‐carved this.

298
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,923
Baby romaine that are dressed
with a red wine vinaigrette.

299
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:28,627
♪♪♪

300
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:31,230
Putting that delicious salumi
inside of the bread,

301
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,499
is kind of like putting
the '68 with a car cover.

302
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:38,103
You're hiding all the beauty.
Except that bread is spot‐on.

303
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:39,738
Little acid
from the baby romaine,

304
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:42,907
the tomatoes,
and the pickled peppers.

305
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:45,277
That's a definition
of an Italian deli sandwich.

306
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:47,079
Oh, oh.

307
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,214
Got a Hoggie and applesauce
for you, ma'am.

308
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:51,516
The ham has a really
great smoke on it.

309
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:53,352
Capicola
is just amazing.

310
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,619
Brings a little bit
of spice to it.

You're not going to find
a better sandwich in Denver.

312
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:58,857
Anything else you'd recommend
for a charcuterie platter?

313
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:00,659
FIERI: You have retail.
People can buy it to‐go.

314
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,434
We do fresh butcher
cuts.

315
00:11:02,534 --> 00:11:03,735
How many different types
of charcuterie?

316
00:11:03,835 --> 00:11:04,769
40, 50.

317
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:06,171
‐No.
‐For real.

318
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:08,540
I want to tour the showroom.
I want to test drive everything.

319
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,142
We're going to do
the roast beef sandwich next.

320
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:11,676
There is a roast beef for you.

321
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:14,213
Super tender,
super moist meat.

322
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:17,082
I get a craving for this, and
I'm in my car, on my way here.

323
00:11:17,182 --> 00:11:18,750
Bringing the knuckles.
See you in a minute....

326
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:27,926
I'm going to end up being
in trouble in this town.

327
00:11:28,027 --> 00:11:29,394
Welcome back.
Triple D hanging out

328
00:11:29,494 --> 00:11:31,096
at Il Porcellino Salumi.
Huh?

329
00:11:31,196 --> 00:11:32,464
‐Did I get that right?
‐Got it.

330
00:11:32,564 --> 00:11:34,599
Denver, Colorado.
Bill is crushing it.

331
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:36,868
He makes over
45 different salumis.

332
00:11:36,968 --> 00:11:39,971
House cures, brines,
dry ages, you name it.

333
00:11:40,072 --> 00:11:41,773
On and on...
Way overachiever.

334
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:44,109
The attention to detail
they put into the meats,

335
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:46,945
knowing how it's going to come
out in a sandwich is incredible.

336
00:11:47,046 --> 00:11:48,880
I'm trying to get everything
on the menu right now,

337
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,215
but I really love
the roast beef.

338
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:51,650
Roast beef sandwich is up.

339
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,952
It's a good blend between
the meat and the horseradish

340
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:55,320
and the melted cheddar.

341
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,689
The arugula gives it
a fresh pop.

342
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:00,559
The jam is that sweetness that
kind of brings it all together.

343
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:02,301
So we're going to do
the roast beef sandwich next.

344
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:04,736
We use inside top round.
We brine it.

345
00:12:04,836 --> 00:12:06,071
Got it.

346
00:12:06,171 --> 00:12:10,475
So salt, fresh thyme, bay leaf,
peppercorns, water.

347
00:12:10,575 --> 00:12:11,710
Bring it up to a boil.

348
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,545
Cool it down.
Then we brine the beef.

349
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,414
And then when we come out,
what's the roast?

350
00:12:15,514 --> 00:12:18,117
We actually sous‐vide it,
so cook it in a hot water bath,

351
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:19,718
110 degrees
for four hours.

352
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:22,021
Hi, have you met
my friend Overachiever?

353
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:24,823
We rub it in beef tallow
and black pepper,

354
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:27,192
and it's going to go in the oven
for about 20 minutes

355
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:28,827
at 350 degrees.

356
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:30,062
What else are we going
to serve on this?

357
00:12:30,162 --> 00:12:31,330
‐Onion jam.
‐Cool.

358
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,532
So, we got a hot pan
with some oil.

359
00:12:33,632 --> 00:12:36,235
Add our onions, a little salt,
a little pepper,

360
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:39,104
and let them caramelize
for three to four hours.

361
00:12:39,204 --> 00:12:41,006
And get those
into the food processor.

362
00:12:41,106 --> 00:12:43,408
Fresh thyme and a little bit
of that sherry vinegar.

363
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:44,643
Oh, just a touch?

364
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:46,911
Turn that on.
A little bit of water.

365
00:12:47,012 --> 00:12:49,014
Into the stove top.
A little bit of water,

366
00:12:49,114 --> 00:12:50,849
apple pectin, sugar,

367
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:52,751
and we'll let that simmer
and kind of come together.

368
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:55,087
Simmer down now. All right.
What's on the menu?

369
00:12:55,187 --> 00:12:56,888
‐Apple Cider Gastrique.
‐Okay.

370
00:12:56,988 --> 00:12:58,457
We make our own applesauce
here, too,

371
00:12:58,557 --> 00:13:00,859
so we keep the cores
and the peels from the apples.

372
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,802
Locally made apple cider,
apple cider vinegar,

373
00:13:03,902 --> 00:13:05,204
honey, brown sugar.

374
00:13:05,304 --> 00:13:06,805
Let that simmer
for a few hours.

375
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:09,508
Strain it out, thicken it with
a little bit of xanthan gum.

376
00:13:09,608 --> 00:13:10,542
Can we finally
have the sandwich?

377
00:13:10,642 --> 00:13:11,876
We can
have the sandwich.

378
00:13:11,976 --> 00:13:13,012
There were four days
we've been here.

379
00:13:13,112 --> 00:13:14,846
Slice our beautiful

and get this toasting
on the flat top.

00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:17,849
Heat up our roast beef.
‐Look at that.

382

Get a little bit

horseradish,

and we're going to go ahead
and melt the cheese,

385
00:13:23,055 --> 00:13:26,191
and then we add a beef
au jus that we make, right?

386
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,727
Cheese is all melty.
‐Okay.

387

Fresh baby arugula on there,
salt and pepper,

388

and our Apple Cider
Gastrique.

California. I met
President Reagan there

for him for three years.
