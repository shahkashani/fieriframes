00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:40,785
         WE'RE GONNA START OFF  
       WITH SOME VEGETABLE OIL--

232
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,720
                LET THAT GET    
             A LITTLE BIT HOT-- 

233
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,255

OKAY.                           
        BECAUSE THEN YOU WANT   
     TO COOK THE REST OF THE WAY

236
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,795
         WITH ALL THE SEASONINGS
               AND STUFF.       

237
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,264
OKAY, NOW WE'RE COOKED          
TWO THIRDS OF THE WAY.          
                        EXACTLY.

238
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,200
      START WITH ADOBO SEASONING
              RIGHT HERE.       

239
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,202
THEN ADOBO SEASONING TAKES      
A PRETTY PREVALENT ROLE--       

240
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,537
   TURMERIC, ONION POWDER,      
GARLIC POWDER, SALT, PEPPER.    

241
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,939
                          RIGHT.
SO NOW--                        

242
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,074

                           YEAH.

245
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,747

246
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,684
       AND THEN WE'RE GONNA ADD 
      JUST REGULAR TOMATO SAUCE.
     A LITTLE BIT               
OF THE MEXICAN OREGANO.         

247
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,719
SO NOW THE OLIVES               
    GO DOWN.                    
                            YEP.

248
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,622
   SO YOU GET SOME OF THAT      
BRINY FLAVOR FROM THE OLIVES.   
                         MM-HMM.

249
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,091
        20 MINUTES OF SIMMERING.
IT'S LIKE PUERTO RICAN

250
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,093
                        EXACTLY.
SO WHERE'S THE REST             
    OF THE BAT?                 

251
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,563
   WE'RE JUST GONNA USE THIS TO 
   MASH UP OUR SWEET PLANTAINS. 

252
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:27,065
   IS THIS GONNA BE LIKE        
THE NOODLE FOR THE LASAGNA?     
                        EXACTLY.

253
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:29,501
NO PASTA INVOLVED.              
           BUT I LIKE TO CALL IT
           PUERTO RICAN LASAGNA.

254
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,503
THAT'S WHAT MY SISTER           
      TOLD ME.

A LITTLE BIT MORE.              
       NOT EVERYONE USES OLIVES.

259
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,113

          THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE 
         SOMETHING TO OFFSET IT.

261

WHERE'S THE HOT SAUCE?          

288

295
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,798

HELP CLEAN OUT THE SYSTEM,      

392
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,606
SO YOU DON'T GET A BUNCH OF SAND
WHEN YOU BITE INTO THE STEAMERS.
                        EXACTLY.

393
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,141

485
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,744
THAT YOU GUYS TAKE THE TIME
