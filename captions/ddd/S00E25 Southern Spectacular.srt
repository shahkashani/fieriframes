1
00:00:00,968 --> 00:00:02,034
Hey, there.

2
00:00:02,036 --> 00:00:03,569
I'm Guy Fieri,
  and we're rolling out

3
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:06,638
looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,806
This trip...

5
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,742
Is the anticipation
  killing you, or what?

6
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:11,110
...whether on a plate
   or a bowl...

7
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:12,144
Cut.

8
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:14,413
...Cajun or soul...

9
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:16,181
Mmm. Mmm!

10
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:20,152
...we got a full hour of good
 old-fashioned Southern cookin'.

11
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:21,653
That was unbelievable.

12
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:24,056
We're talkin'
 North Carolina dumplings...

13
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:25,758
They're ready to go.
      Go time.

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,326
...South Carolina collards...

15
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:29,528
And these right here
   are some money greens.

16
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,897
...a killer
 Kentucky fried po' boy...

17
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,332
I'd eat that every day.

18
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:36,035
And some St. Louis
  Southern comfort.

19
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:37,136
Just like mom
 couldn't make.

20
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:39,872
Just like mama
   couldn't make!

21
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,340
Then we're headin' north...

22
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:42,708
It's cold out here.

23
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,543
...for biscuits and gravy
   in Oregon...

24
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,212
I could be eatin' a paper towel
 with that gravy on it. Wow.

25
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,647
...N'awlins in Indiana...

26
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,816
Once you cross over
    the threshold here,

27
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:52,351
you're in Louisiana.

28
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:55,954
...and good old gizzards --
 yeah, gizzards -- in Michigan.

29
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,656
This place is a trip.

30
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,925
So, get ready for a down-home,

31
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:02,694
down-South food-coma
   kind of show.

32
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,029
This is amazing.

33
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,131
That's all right here,
   right now,

34
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,867
on "Diners, Drive-Ins
   and Dives."

37
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:19,845
You know, on "Triple D,"
  we've hit joints

38
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,680
that are all about pizza,
  all about burgers.

39
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:24,950
We've even hit a joint
 that's all about fried carp.

40
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:28,620
And today, ladies and gentlemen,
 we take another culinary leap

41
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:31,890
to visit a joint that's all
 about the tender, flaky --

42
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:33,992
Is the anticipation
  killing you, or what?

43
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:38,430
The tender, flaky, gravy-topped
  Southern delicacy

44
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,632
known as biscuits.

45
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:43,368
Welcome to Portland's
  Pine State Biscuits...

46
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,670
Full tray comin' up.

47
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,238
The best biscuit ever.

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,773
About three minutes
 on biscuits.

49
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,408
This is the perfect bite.

50
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,709
Biscuit
   and huckleberry jam.

51
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,311
And a biscuit
 with sausage gravy.

52
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:53,812
Do you run here?

53
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,180
Some good home-cooked
   comfort food.

54
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,515
I got some gravy comin'.

55
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,884
...all served up
by college buddies Brian Snyder,

56
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:01,286
Walt Alexander,
  and Kevin Atchley...

57
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,088
Hot tray.
     We're all
   from North Carolina.

58
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,723
All of you?
       Yep.
   How y'all doin'?

59
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:05,958
...who ended up in Portland,

60
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,593
reconnected,
  and opened this place.

61
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,261
Why biscuits?
   'Cause we missed 'em.

62
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,996
People needed a place
  they could stop by

63
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,564
and get a good,
  hearty breakfast.

64
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,333
Like this
  North Carolina classic.

65
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:15,501
The best biscuits and gravy.

66
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:16,368
So get me started.

67
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,903
Flour.
All-purpose?

68
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,072
Unbleached. Baking powder.
    Baking soda.

69
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:23,175
Why the two?
   That's what gives us
  the best rise, flakiness.

70
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:25,310
Little bit of salt.
  And we whisk this together.

71
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,146
Put the dry ingredients
 together first.

72
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:28,547
Then we got the wet mix.
     Buttermilk.

73
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:29,615
Is that buttermilk light?

74
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:30,916
Reduced fat.

75
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,720
We got some full-fat yogurt.
     Some eggs.

76
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:35,854
We'll whisk
    all this together,

77
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:36,989
and then we shred
     the butter.

78
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,424
Whoa. We're gonna what?
Oh, this is awesome.

79
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,793
Dude, I have seen biscuits
 all over the world,

80
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,862
and I have never seen
 butter shredding.

81
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,397
It's rock-hard frozen.
 Exactly.

82
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,633
It's gonna create flaked
 deliciousness.
      You got it.

83
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,701
Check that out.
 That's nuts.
      Yeah.

84
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:50,869
Actually, it's butter.

85
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,671
So now we got to act fast
because we don't want

86
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,406
that butter to melt,
  right?
     That's right.

87
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:55,574
So we get it
    incorporated.

88
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:57,176
So it doesn't separate?
     That's right.

89
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,411
All you do
 is add that liquid

90
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:01,580
and give it, like, two or three
spins and that's it?

91
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:03,615
That's all she wrote.
 Flour the board.

92
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:04,616
We're bringin' out
     the dough.

93
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:05,717
You just
 incorporated it

94
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,085
enough to get it
 out of the bowl,

95
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,787
but you still got
some work to do, correct?

96
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,055
Exactly.
   They are hand-built.

97
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:12,558
We're ready to roll.

98
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,127
So we'll roll this out,
  and we'll do some foldin'.

99
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,663
Not only do you have the flour
creating all of this layer,

100
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:20,199
you're creating layer as you
fold along top of each other.

101
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,200
Exactly.

102
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:22,968
So we're ready to cut.

103
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,536
Exact right size.
 Goes in the oven.

104
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,004
Just below 400.
    12 to 15 minutes.

105
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,306
Hit it
with a little butter.

106
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:29,107
About 2, 3 minutes
   before we pull 'em out.

107
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,577
I'm gonna try to pick out
the one I think is the best.

108
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,578
That one.
       Oh.

109
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,946
Well, now you've done
  broke it.

110
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:35,514
Well, let's cover it
     with gravy.

111
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:38,417
Olive oil. Pureed onions.
   Ground pork. Water.

112
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,619
Give that a stir.
And some flour.

113
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:41,920
Sausage spice mix.

114
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:47,292
Cayenne, salt, pepper, nutmeg,
coriander, thyme, and sage.

115
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,894
Heavy cream, whole milk.

116
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,429
Make a butter
 and flour roux.

117
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:51,830
Add the roux.
 Maple syrup.

118
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,899
Look at that.

119
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,601
Little chives.
    Little paprika
    for some color.

120
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:56,702
I dig it. Okay.

121
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,874
Mmm. That is some of the best
texture in a biscuit

122
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,076
I've ever had.

123
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,744
It has the flakiness,
 and it's light,

124
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,246
but there's real
 substance to it.

125
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:09,281
But, then again,
I could be eatin' a paper towel

126
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:10,582
with that gravy on it.
  Wow.

127
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,417
Mmm! Killer.

128
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,620
I'd say these are some of
the best biscuits I've ever had.

129
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,955
Flaky and delicious.
    Biscuits comin'.

130
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,523
It's a biscuit that can handle

131
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,092
whatever you want to put
  in this biscuit.

132
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,194
Yeah, "whatever" --
  like stewed apples.

133
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:24,129
You got to have a side
   of huckleberry jam,

134
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,297
kind of an Oregon deal.

135
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:26,832
Shiitake mushroom gravy.

136
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,133
My favorite's
 The Double Down Moneyball --

137
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,335
Two biscuits,
 gravy all over the place,

138
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,670
and then an egg on top.

139
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:32,604
Biscuits goin' in.

140
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,039
It's a biscuit place,

141
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,907
but the fried chicken
   is the best in town.

142
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,743
So you know where this is goin'.

143
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,544
This giant sandwich.

144
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,079
The Reggie.
  Right.

145
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,048
You see, Ryan wanted to
  name his son Reggie,

146
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,416
and his wife said no way.

147
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:47,653
So he figured, hey, the next
 best thing was a sandwich.

148
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,655
First things first, we're gonna
  make some fried chicken.

149
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:51,690
We'll make up
  the marinade or the soak.

150
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,892
Little more
 of that buttermilk.
     Little cayenne.

151
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,060
And then
   we'll whisk that up.

152
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,695
Then we'll slice up
    the chicken.
 Whoa.

153
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,297
Thin fried chicken.
   It's biscuit portion.

154
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,232
Soak this for 24 hours.
 Okay.

155
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:02,334
Make up the dredge.
  So, more
of that biscuit flour?

156
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,403
This is actually
    self-rising.
Coarse ground pepper.

157
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:05,771
So we'll whisk this up.

158
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:07,606
Then we got the egg wash.

159
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,907
A little hot sauce.
       Yep.

160
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,475
Wow.
Dare you to lick it.

161
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,843
No, thanks.

162
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,279
So, then we'll season
    the chicken.
 More seasoning.

163
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,448
Garlic salt, salt, pepper,
   and Cajun seasoning.

164
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,116
Whoa.
    We'll dip it.

165
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,384
And then the flour
 on top of that.

166
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,019
You have a tendency
with some of those spices,

167
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,921
they can burn, so the closer
they are down to the bird,

168
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,189
better off you are.
     You got it.

169
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,324
Dude knows
 what's goin' on.

170
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,059
And we'll fry it up.

171
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,728
Look at these. That is some
  good-lookin' fried chicken.

172
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,564
You just showed your North
  Carolina passport just now.

173
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,199
We get a biscuit.

174
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,601
Fried chicken, bacon,
   gravy, and cheddar.

175
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,570
How do you get around
 on that one?
     Don't be shy.

176
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,305
I ain't that kind of guy.

177
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,941
You know the hunch?
     Yeah.
    I know the hunch.

178
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,811
Mmm.

179
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,846
Oh, you do.

180
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,348
That's ridiculous.

181
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,083
Everybody comes together.

182
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:52,217
That's right.

183
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,052
I love it.
  It's got everything on it.

184
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:56,922
I had my Reggie and then
most of my wife's Reggie.

185
00:05:58,392 --> 00:05:59,624
This place is great.

186
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:00,926
It's not just bacon
  and eggs and hash browns.

187
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,127
It's something
    really unique.

188
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,195
Two more goin' down.

189
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,963
Simple and delicious.

190
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,132
Best biscuits in Portland
  I've found.

191
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,767
I'll come back, for sure.

192
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,069
Guys, congratulations.
  Oh, appreciate it.

193
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,372
Dynamite place.
 Killer biscuits.

194
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:15,874
Up next,
 it's St. Louis, Missouri.

195
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:16,775
Oho-ho!

196
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,677
Big-time,
 home-cooked favorites...

197
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,011
What is this,
 about 30 pounds?

198
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,880
...that are doin' the body good.

199
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,583
When your heart's in it,
  and when you believe in it,

200
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,685
and it's --
  it's more than just food...

201
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,720
That's soul food.
   Then it's soul food.

202
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,160
When you think of Southern food,
   you know --

203
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,596
fried chicken, mac and cheese,
  collard greens --

204
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:38,997
the question comes to mind,

205
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,933
when does Southern food
  turn in to soul food?

206
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,503
Here at a place called
 Sweetie Pie's in St. Louis,

207
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:46,438
people tell me
  it's all in the heart

208
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,006
of the folks who are makin' it.

209
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,708
There's a lot of love
    goin' into it.

210
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,942
Hey, sweetie,
    how you doin'?

211
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,712
You got to put some love
  in there, seriously.

212
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:54,980
Is everything
  all right?

213
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,348
This chicken
    is made with love.

214
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,016
Is everything
   all right over here?

215
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,952
And the woman dishin' out
 the love is Robbie Montgomery.

216
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:04,489
She's been servin' soul food
  to St. Louis since '97.

217
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,559
The chicken and the fish,
  the ribs, the pork chops,

218
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:10,595
the macaroni and cheese,
  I mean, it's everything.

219
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,564
What's your favorite thing
   to get here?

220
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:15,000
This, right here.

221
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:18,036
Definitely, the macaroni
 and cheese is my favorite.

222
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,939
It's probably the best mac
 and cheese I've ever had.

223
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,774
You want greens, too?
   Dressing and greens.

224
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,910
Good texture, crisp.
    Sweet potatoes.

225
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:27,279
Can I have
 the baked chicken?
    Chicken. Chicken.

226
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,280
It's so tender.

227
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,981
See how it's fallin'
 off the bone?

228
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,684
The, uh, fried chicken
 reminds me of my grandmother's,

229
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,086
and the cornbread, the way
  she used to make it.

230
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,722
It's so good,
  you don't need any butter.

231
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,724
Nobody cooks
  like Sweetie Pie -- nobody.

232
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:40,792
Nobody?
      Nobody.

233
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,994
So I got to go see
about my pork steaks.

234
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,529
And get this...
It's ready.

235
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,198
...Robbie didn't start out
   as a chef.

236
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,099
Okay, Bobby, I need
  my turkey wings back in.

237
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,001
She started out as a singer.

238
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,236
Met Ike and Tina Turner.

239
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,504
How crazy is that?

240
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,606
And from there, went from that.
    That was crazy.

241
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,408
And you used to cook
 on the road.

242
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,710
Yeah, because things
    were segregated,

243
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:02,047
and we weren't allowed in a lot
  of the better restaurants.

244
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:04,816
But we had
    electric skillets,

245
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,518
and we would cook
    in our room.

246
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,919
So, we got one, two, three.

247
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,788
You got your next pan
  of chicken ready?

248
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,623
And after almost 40 years,

249
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,925
she left one stage
 and jumped up on another.

250
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,093
Peach cobbler up.

251
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,062
I put down the mike
   and picked up a pot.

252
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,396
All of these recipes...

253
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:19,831
Are my mom's.

254
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,166
Are your mom's...
 My mom's.

255
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,701
With your Robbie spin
     on it

256
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:25,537
'cause I got to believe that
 there's always a Robbie spin.

257
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,605
It is. It is.

258
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,807
Durin' my travels,
I picked up little things.

259
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,509
Little...
 Add 'em. Yeah.

260
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,545
Little tit-tats and stuff
and add it to my recipe.

261
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:36,014
Like her macaroni and cheese.

262
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,517
I've been makin' this
    about 40 years.

263
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,018
Right out
 of eighth grade.

264
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,620
Out of eighth grade,
     exactly.

265
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,588
Well, we're gonna start
    with the pasta.

266
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,691
Now, we're gonna add two pounds
   of Velveeta cheese.

267
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,026
Nothin' but Velveeta.
  Noth --

268
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,528
No imitation.
Don't give me any...

269
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,729
Don't stop
    no place else.

270
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,731
Don't give me imitation
 imitation cheese.

271
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:53,732
That's right. No.

272
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,734
So then we got
    a pound of...

273
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:56,835
Cheddar.
     ...cheddar.

274
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:59,337
Colby and jack,
  we got a pound of that.

275
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,772
Then next, we gonna add

276
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,208
two heapin' tablespoons
    of sour cream.

277
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,077
Just, sunshine, so you know,
that's not a tablespoon.

278
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,712
Well, I -- You're right.

279
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,980
That's your spoon.

280
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,649
That's my tablespoon.

281
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:12,450
Then we've got butter
   and margarine,

282
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:13,618
salt, pepper, and sugar...

283
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,922
Five eggs. You can crack,
    and I'll whisk.

284
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:17,856
...a mess of milk.

285
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,591
How much of that?

286
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,326
No idea. Just some.
 Just some?

287
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,628
We're gonna top it
   with the fancy mild.

288
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,297
What is this,
 about 30 pounds?

289
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,165
Feels like it.
 I tell you, it's a heavy pan.

290
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,567
That's ready.

291
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,368
Look at the crispy crunch
 on top of that!

292
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:33,638
Mmm.

293
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,207
Good macaroni, okay.

294
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,877
It's real.
    The pasta is real.

295
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,880
The mixture
   of the cheeses inside.

296
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:46,451
That does me proud to see you
eatin' it more than once.

297
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:49,054
Give me a stool and a bib,
  I'll be here for a day.

298
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,956
Just like mom
 couldn't make.

299
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,124
Just like mama
   couldn't make!

300
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,193
It makes you
    feel like...

301
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,861
Everyone talks
   about Sweetie Pie's.

302
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,363
It's great.
       Hi.

303
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:00,065
And for Robbie,
  what matters most

304
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,534
is makin' sure everyone's
 lovin' what she's servin'.

305
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,469
I wanted to still deal
    with the public.

306
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:05,737
Okay.
  I'm-a go out here.

307
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,872
I go out in the dining room,
 make sure everybody's happy.

308
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:10,108
You look good, too.
You didn't know
that was me up there.

309
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,043
Here you go, baby.
  Thank you.

310
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,746
You know what?
 I like the service.
       Okay.

311
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,548
Is everything all right
for you ladies over here?

312
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,783
And now her son, Tim, is
following Mom into the business.

313
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,884
We're gonna change
    spots.

314
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,386
This is my mom's dream.

315
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,555
I can't let my mom's dream die
    no matter what.

316
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:25,757
And that means cookin'
  for everyone else

317
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,359
the way Robbie cooked for him.

318
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,027
All I know is,
 I been eatin' my mom's cooking

319
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,962
before I was born, you know,
  since before I was born.

320
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,631
Yeah, you were.
      Yeah.
     And I like it.

321
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,900
All of his favorite recipes
 done the same as always,

322
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:38,336
like Robbie's famous
   smothered pork.

323
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,838
We gonna flour it
  and fry it.

324
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,172
Fry it?
  Fry it.

325
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,274
And then
we gonna smother it.

326
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,577
I think the fryin' it
   will have smothered it.

327
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:46,845
You just stack 'em up
     in there,

328
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,079
and then they go to
     the fryer?

329
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,280
Into the deep fryer,
  exactly.

330
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,950
It's like fryin' a pork chop
 in your hot tub.

331
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,785
Exactly.

332
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:55,687
But that looks ready?
    That looks ready.

333
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,522
What am I puttin' on,
 onions and what?

334
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,391
Onions and my little
    special seasoning.

335
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:02,360
And your little special,
"I'm not gonna tell ya."
     That's right.

336
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:05,030
This is gravy
made with that dark roux.

337
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:08,033
Uh, dark roux, right.
  That's it.

338
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:11,136
And this process just
 keeps goin' on all day long.
All day long.

339
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:12,971
Cookin' and makin' it,
   cookin' and puttin' it

340
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,639
and takin' and now goin'
    and servin' it.

341
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,808
Look at the size.

342
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,746
Mmm.

343
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,617
Oho. Oho.

344
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,086
Ho-ho!

345
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:31,222
The texture of the meat
    and the flavor

346
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:34,225
and the deep richness
    of that roux.

347
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,460
Thank you.

348
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:38,229
That gravy --
    that is so good.
 Oh, great.

349
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,699
And they just keep packin' in
  for the smothered pork

350
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,567
and everything else
  Robbie is making.

351
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,269
Taste like food you ate
when you're at home?

352
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:45,170
Just like it.

353
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:46,438
Just like it?
     Mm-hmm.

354
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,774
And you can kind of feel
 the family atmosphere here.

355
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,543
Wings, wings, uh-huh.

356
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,111
This is the real deal
    all the time.

357
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:56,214
You know what? I got one
  disappointment, though.

358
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,284
I wish I had an extra stomach
  to eat some more food.

359
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:01,019
That's my only disappointment.

360
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:03,054
It's really soul food.

361
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,724
When your heart's in it,
  and when you believe in it,

362
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,826
and it's more
    than just food...

363
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,828
That's soul food.

364
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,962
Then it's soul food.

365
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,530
That's right,
 from the soul.

366
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,734
Coming up,
 in Charlotte, North Carolina...

367
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,902
Show-off.

368
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,304
...serious Southern staples...

369
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,005
Tell me
about chicken and dumplings.

370
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,141
...by land and by sea.
There's a lot of crunch
 on that cake.

371
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,414
I'm here
 in Charlotte, North Carolina.

372
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,982
Now, any time I roll into town,

373
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,051
I got to come by
  and see my buddy Greg

374
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:34,419
at the Penguin Drive-in.

375
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,321
You remember --
  deep friend pickles,

376
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:38,256
pimiento cheese,
  the Full-blown Hemi.

377
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,424
Before I go in there,

378
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,659
I got to go about 100 yards
  down the way here

379
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,661
and check out another joint
   for "Triple D."

380
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,964
These folks are serving up
  some Southern classics.

381
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,133
This is Dish.
 Meatloaf up.

382
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,368
It's comfort food.
 It's like going to Grandma's.

383
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,970
Chicken and dumplings.
  They're fantastic.

384
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:53,071
Black-eyed peas.

385
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,806
All the plates come
  with a deviled egg

386
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:56,274
and the biscuit, as well.

387
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,877
It's just great, home-cooked,
  Southern-style food.

388
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,479
In a joint run by a couple
 of former nightclub owners...

389
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:02,447
Hey, sweeties.

390
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,948
Originally,
 it was my idea.

391
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,550
...Penny Craver
  and Maggie Stubbs...

392
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:06,785
Let's head on back.

393
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,287
...who decided it was time
 to serve up more than beer.

394
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,890
We all grew up eating good,
Southern home cooking.

395
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,391
Mac and cheese,
 table eight.

396
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,894
The kind that brought head cook
 Kirstie Floyd to the South...

397
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:17,195
Order up.

398
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,197
...after cooking in Europe
  and all over the U.S.

399
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,298
Meatloaf sandwich.

400
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,599
Most popular item
    on the menu?

401
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,101
Chicken and dumplings.

402
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,270
- That's all I ever get.
- Seriously?

403
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:26,704
I don't think I've ever
  gotten anything else.

404
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,873
Southern classic,
 and they do it very well here.

405
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,608
It reminds me
of when I was a kid.

406
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,210
The dish I would always
 look forward to

407
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,312
that my dad would make
would be chicken and dumplings.

408
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,814
Tell me about
chicken and dumplings.

409
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,615
Okay.
  Start off with a raw bird.

410
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,350
Baste it with a little bit
     of butter,

411
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,485
some salt and pepper mix,

412
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,753
and put it
   right into the oven.

413
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,454
And 350 degrees?

414
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:44,856
350 degrees.

415
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:45,990
55 minutes.
 55 minutes.

416
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,692
Roast it
to give the roasting flavor

417
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:50,295
to get some of that flavor
out of the bones, into the meat.

418
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:50,728
So the bird's
 cooled down now.

419
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,964
for the stock,
to get some of that flavor
out of the bones, into the meat.

420
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,533
and now, it's time
 to "shredify"?

421
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,168
Shredify.

422
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,570
Do you ever growl
 when you do it?

423
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:00,238
Depends on the day.
 Yeah.

424
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,674
After we separate all the
 chicken, we'll put that aside.

425
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,375
Then, we're gonna
start making the stock.

426
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,744
Add the bone and the skin, which
we pulled from the chicken.

427
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,046
About two pitchers
  of water.

428
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,848
And the broth.
    Some of the fat?

429
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,382
Oh, yeah.
 The good stuff.

430
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,351
Some diced white onion.

431
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,053
Pepper --
 a lot of pepper.
      Generous.

432
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,255
Some celery salt because
that's always really good

433
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:18,723
to pull
the chicken flavor out.

434
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:22,193
Granulated garlic,
and granulated onion, as well.

435
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,294
How long
   is it gonna boil for?

436
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:24,896
It'll boil
about 10, 15 minutes.

437
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:27,532
Cool it just a tiny bit
 so it's manageable. Strain it.

438
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,133
Strain it out,
 back into the pot.

439
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:31,202
Now we're gonna get
  into making the dumplings.

440
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,071
The dumplings.
     All righty.

441
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:34,439
Start with flour.

442
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:37,842
Four eggs and a half pound
    of melted butter.

443
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,011
Mix it up.
     Okay.
   We're gonna form it.

444
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,779
All right. Flour.

445
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,948
And just roll it out
   about a quarter-inch.

446
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,216
You don't want them
     too thin

447
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,651
because they tend
    to disintegrate

448
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,219
when you get them
    into the hot water.

449
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,121
And we don't want that.
You want them to puff up.

450
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,055
Puff up.
  Right.

451
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,857
Just cut them
    in little squares.

452
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,159
Oh, look at her doing it
 the backwards way.

453
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,127
Show-off.

454
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,665
Here we go.
Made it look so easy.

455
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:01,699
Thanks.

456
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,067
Handmade at the Dish.

457
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,836
We'll have all these
 ready to go.

458
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:06,537
They're ready to go.
     Go time!

459
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,206
Add our already pulled
  chicken.

460
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,441
We got white and dark
     in there?
 Oh, yeah.

461
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,809
I'm gonna add
 our dumplings.

462
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,544
You don't want to dump
    all at one time

463
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:16,080
because they tighten up as soon
 as they hit that hot water,

464
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,749
and then you got
    yourself this ball.

465
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,118
Big mass of dumpling.
We're keeping them separated.

466
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,819
We're gonna add a basic roux,
just butter and flour.

467
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,187
But you're also gonna
    get some thickener

468
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,056
just coming out
   of that dumpling dough.

469
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,724
And let it go
   for about 30 minutes

470
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,459
to cook those dumplings?
Absolutely.

471
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,827
Ready for a taste?

472
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,429
Oh, look at
    all the chicken.

473
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,197
Mouth is already
 starting to water.

474
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,432
Look at that,
 nice and thick.

475
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,434
Look at that dumpling
 right there.

476
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,037
Mmm.

477
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,605
Awesome.
 Really awesome.

478
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,174
Easier if I get it
 up to the...
     There you go.

479
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,909
We got a super-tender
  dumpling...

480
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,312
And I like the fact that
you roasted the chicken,

481
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,013
so it's got
real chicken flavor.

482
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,482
We've got homemade chicken stock
  with roux,

483
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,051
very simply seasoned.

484
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,119
That is down-home
chicken and dumplings.

485
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,154
Wonderful.
  Mmm.

486
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,555
Cut.

487
00:15:58,758 --> 00:15:59,757
Mmm.

488
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,126
I said to...

489
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,629
The dumplings are my favorite
  part. Just super yummy.

490
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:05,997
The chicken is really fresh.

491
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:07,598
Lots of flavor,
  which is a trademark

492
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,033
of everything
  they put out here.

493
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,335
Chicken
and black bean burrito.

494
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:11,970
This is the kind of place
 I like to work.

495
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,171
I get a lot more
  creativity.

496
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,839
You got the Cajun meatloaf.

497
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,274
The Burrito Del Sur.

498
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,942
Sweet potatoes are
 going in a burrito.

499
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,044
Southern goes Mexico.
    There you go.

500
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,212
A wonderful blend of flavors.

501
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,180
Pot roast.

502
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,448
I can see Mom
in the kitchen cooking.

503
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,782
That's how good it is?
 Yeah.

504
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:28,419
Handmade from scratch,
 like this Southern classic...

505
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,088
Patties up.
  ...salmon patties.

506
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,089
Absolutely phenomenal.

507
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,991
But these don't start
   in a can.

508
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,326
Each time you guys get a fish
in, you break it down?

509
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,928
Yeah, I do.
I like that attitude.

510
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,396
Slice about 8-ounce pieces,

511
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,698
dice it in little cubes,
   soak those in water.

512
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,900
Put all of our ingredients
     together.

513
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:46,070
Parsley, pulverized onions
 because you want that juice.

514
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,138
You want it to break down

515
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,439
because you're not
precooking the onions,

516
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,408
so you don't want big chunk
of onion in there.
      Exactly.

517
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,010
Five whisked eggs.

518
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,511
And have a binder --
     mustard.

519
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,979
That's a lot
 of whole grain.

520
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:57,215
You'd be surprised, though.
   It's not that sharp.

521
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,783
Mayo. Celery.

522
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:02,053
Squeezed lemon juice,
   lemon zest, dill weed.

523
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,654
That's a lot of dill.

524
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:06,290
But dill and salmon
 go hand in hand.
      They do.

525
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,458
Worcestershire sauce.
Okay.

526
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,762
So mix it all up,
with the dill, the whole grain.

527
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:13,097
See, it seemed like a lot,
  but when you mix it up,

528
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,599
it's evenly dispersed.
 It is.

529
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,334
This is just regular
   white-bread bread crumb

530
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:17,735
with a little bit
    of butter on it.

531
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,570
And we like to let this sit
   for a little while.

532
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,806
Let some of those bread crumbs
absorb some of the moisture,

533
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,207
kind of tighten
this whole thing up.

534
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,308
Then we'll form the patty.

535
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,676
Roll it
 in some Japanese bread crumbs.

536
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,712
Oh, so panko.
   Over to the flat top.

537
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,480
Oh, and they go
 pretty thick.
      Oh, yeah.

538
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,849
And now I push them down.
 A little squish.

539
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,117
Four minutes each side?

540
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,319
Four minutes each side,
 exactly right.

541
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,687
We're gonna make
   honey orange butter,

542
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,022
which comes
  with the salmon patties.

543
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,524
Presoftened butter.

544
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:41,159
And then goes the...
      Honey.

545
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:42,994
Then we'll add
    a half an orange.

546
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:44,228
There you go.
  Okay.

547
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,730
All right.
Looks like they're done.

548
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,665
That's a lot
    of salmon patty.
 It is.

549
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,434
The butter for you.
     Okay.

550
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,102
Mmm. That's nice.
That's a lot
    of salmon patty.
 It is.

551
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,837
Dill right off the bat.
 Salmon comes in.

552
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,205
Here's what I dig
  about it --

553
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,973
There's a lot of crunch
 on that cake.

554
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,809
Without having to
   deep-fry it, as well.

555
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:58,876
Without deep-frying it.

556
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,812
The nice little touch
of adding the butter

557
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:02,413
brings it all together.
      Wonderful.

558
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,448
Good job.
     Thank you.

559
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,482
Salmon patties.

560
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,150
It's fresh, it's simple,
spiced just right.

561
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:09,420
The honey orange butter --
  that's what makes it pop.

562
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,756
They're excellent, good as
 everything else on the menu.

563
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:12,590
Barbecue slider.

564
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,860
Fantastic, wholesome, good food.

565
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:16,961
That was on point.

566
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,996
You come in,
  and it's just like home.

567
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,331
You don't feel like
   you have to dress up.

568
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,599
You do have to wear
 clothes and stuff.

569
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,867
You can't come, like,
 in your pajamas.

570
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,103
That's like seeing you guys
here in a couple Snuggies.

571
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,173
Up next on this hour-long
  Southern hoedown...

572
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,975
Want to see
    the dance I do?

573
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,910
No, we don't
 want to see that.

574
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,812
...in Lexington,
  South Carolina...

575
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:38,816
...a country spot
 doing major multitasking.

576
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:43,154
Farmers' market, garden shed,
   of course, restaurant.

577
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,856
...to get the flavor jets going.

578
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:47,425
Right now, there's
a mini Niagara Falls
going on in my mouth.

579
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:55,233
This is Route 1, right between
 Columbia, South Carolina,

580
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,534
and Augusta, Georgia,

581
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:59,570
in a little town on the Carolina
  side called Lexington.

582
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,140
Now, what we have here
  was a farmers' market,

583
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,442
and then it turned
  into a garden center.

584
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,711
And when you have a garden
 center, what do you add next?

585
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:09,547
Yep, of course, a restaurant.

586
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:10,715
This is The Farmer's Shed.

587
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,650
Fried chicken
    and your succotash.

588
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,352
It's typical Southern food.

589
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:16,954
And then veggies.
Macaroni and cheese,
 collard greens.

590
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:20,224
This is home cooking.
 This is what I grew up with.

591
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,426
- Just like Shirley Sease.
- Good evenin'.

592
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,529
You grew up as a farming
 family's daughter.

593
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:26,197
Yep. And then
    I married a farmer.

594
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,765
Moved from one farm
    to another farm.

595
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,768
To running this farmer's market,
  where, eight years ago,

596
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,870
she started cooking
  Southern classics

597
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:34,672
straight from her own farm.

598
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,840
These collard greens are great.

599
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,942
You grow these
    here on your farm.
Yes.

600
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:40,311
I don't know that
  everybody in this country

601
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:42,647
really appreciates
     greens.
 They should.

602
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,215
We got these
  all chopped up ready to go.

603
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:45,850
And this is
   what they look like.

604
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,652
Want to see
    the dance I do?

605
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:49,620
No, we don't
 want to see that.

606
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,789
First thing
  we're gonna add is water.

607
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,691
I'll put a ham hock in.
 Look at that.

608
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:54,692
Smoked ham hock.

609
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,561
Do you think I can
shoot it from back?

610
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:57,828
Do you clean up
    your messes?

611
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:00,798
Hey!
Yeah!

612
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,533
I'm gonna add a little
   chicken base to it,

613
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,834
just to give it
    a little mph,

614
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:06,304
then some black pepper,
   and then some salt.

615
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,839
And we got to cook this
   for about 45 minutes

616
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,875
until the ham hock...
Comes apart.

617
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,210
Then we'll add
    the collard greens.

618
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,945
Feel like I'm feeding horses
 back in Ferndale.

619
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:16,113
Pop a lid on it.
How long do they cook?

620
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,114
20 to 25.

621
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,716
The collards
    should be ready.

622
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,284
Wow, look how much
 that cooks down.

623
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,353
Good for you.
 Yeah.

624
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,989
That's my motto, always
eating what's good for me.

625
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:26,424
Okay.

626
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:29,961
Around here, we eat hot-pepper
vinegar over our collard greens.

627
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:31,829
Oh, yeah, around here,
     we do, too.

628
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,497
Like that?
 Mm-hmm.

629
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,633
Love me some collards.

630
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,335
Mmm. Those are tender,
     sweet,

631
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:39,737
and a little bit of that
   hock meat in there.

632
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,973
Little bit
of that hot-pepper vinegar.

633
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:44,008
I could chug that.

634
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,077
I've had greens
   all over the country,

635
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,412
and these right here
   are some money greens.

636
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,880
Those are worth
    coming to try.

637
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,949
If you don't think you like
  greens, come eat these.

638
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,551
Then, if you don't
     like these,

639
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:56,220
well, then, you were
   just never blessed
   enough to like greens.

640
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,155
And I need
    a side of collards.

641
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:59,924
She seasons them well.
  It's really good.

642
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:03,394
With the ham hock, it just
 melts the flavors together.

643
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,029
They introduced me
    to collards here,

644
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,397
and now I have to
     have them.

645
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:08,065
Got your pork chop
 on this one.

646
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:11,135
I like how they have
the same menu on certain days.

647
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,571
So everybody kind of has their
day that they like to come for.

648
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,473
I just wait for Wednesdays

649
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,842
because on Wednesdays,
    it's chicken day.

650
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:19,243
It's wonderful.

651
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,578
I want that piece.

652
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,746
Want that piece?

653
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,081
Look at that. Mmm.

654
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,283
What's the most
    popular day?

655
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,718
Friday. Shrimp and grits
 with tasso gravy.

656
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,655
I've tried it in other places,
  and she has the best.

657
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:32,223
Okay, so how do we
 start her off?

658
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:33,624
Let's make
    the tasso gravy.

659
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,027
First thing we're gonna put in
  is butter, then the leeks.

660
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,262
So we'll let these just
  sweat down a little bit.

661
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,433
You're going to add
   oregano, black pepper,

662
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,101
some Florida Bay seasoning,

663
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:47,004
paprika, chili powder,
   some garlic powder.

664
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:49,073
Seasoned salt.
    Seasoned salt.
    You're good.

665
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:51,642
Basil.
And a little bit
 of thyme.

666
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,978
And a little bit
    of French thyme.

667
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,746
Oh.
 You know, I'm so...

668
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:59,750
And a little tomato juice,
   a little sizzle there.

669
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,652
Clam juice.
 Okay.

670
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,920
Next, half and half.

671
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,255
Now you're going to get
 the roux in it?

672
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:06,290
And then we just have it
   come back to a boil.

673
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:09,527
Right now, there's
a mini Niagara Falls
going on in my mouth.

674
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:10,728
You should smell this.

675
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,063
And this is tasso ham.

676
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:14,832
Oh, you said "try some ham."
 Mmm, delicious.

677
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,034
And we're gonna cut
 the heat off, and it's ready.

678
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,269
Now we're gonna make grits?

679
00:22:18,271 --> 00:22:20,237
I love grits.
    Good. I do too.

680
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:21,906
Local,
    stone-ground grits.

681
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,040
Local.

682
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,142
So let's get into it.
    I put the water in.

683
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:27,445
Next, we'll add the milk,
    a stick of butter,

684
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:28,479
just a little salt.

685
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:29,914
We'll let it
    come to a boil.

686
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,082
Then we'll add the grits.

687
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:33,150
Just good old grit making.

688
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,318
I'm the grit danada.

689
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,253
Got to try my grits,
you're gonna love them.

690
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:37,488
I promise
 you'll be back.

691
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,889
Is that the consistency
  you want?
      Yes.

692
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,558
Now what?
    We're gonna make
     the shrimp.

693
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,592
I'm gonna put some butter.

694
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:43,060
I love somebody
who cooks with a hot pan.

695
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:44,195
Get her going.

696
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,396
Yeah, that's really hot.
 How many shrimp?

697
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:46,731
All of them.
So just cook those up

698
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,566
till they get a little bit
  of a...
     A little pink.

699
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:51,268
And then we're gonna put
  some tasso gravy on them.

700
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,237
We're not using
    all this tasso.

701
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:56,707
We're not because we're putting
it in the back of a '67 Camaro

702
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,676
that's going back
 to California.

703
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:02,113
Okay, want me to put
some grits on here?
       Sure.

704
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:03,647
So the tasso sauce
  is ready.

705
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,449
Now, can I have
 some of the, uh...

706
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:07,017
Those are called
     field peas.

707
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,121
And, uh, green beans?
Okay, let's try this.

708
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,891
Mmm.
   This has everything.

709
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:17,962
Some seafood, little veggie
  in there, little bit spicy.

710
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:20,431
Mmm, grits are
    perfectly cooked.

711
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:22,266
Real texture to them,
 but real creaminess to them.

712
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:25,736
The tasso and shrimp, this is
the dictionary definition of it.

713
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,105
You can find that dictionary
  at the Flavortown library.

714
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:29,607
Great, delicious,
     fantastic.

715
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:31,375
All right,
  I got a shrimp and grits.

716
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:32,643
Grits are wonderful.

717
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:35,279
Smooth and creamy,
 and they're the yellow grits,

718
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:36,947
which I love.

719
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,215
I love the tasso gravy.

720
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:40,684
It really brings out the flavor
 in the shrimp.

721
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,720
I look forward to Fridays
 to come to Miss Shirley's

722
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,021
and get
  some shrimp and grits.

723
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,122
I love The Farmer's Shed.

724
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:47,158
I got Jefferson chicken.
These things are hot.

725
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,460
It beats any other Southern
  cooking around here.

726
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:51,829
This is like Sunday dinner
 at Granny's house.

727
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:54,265
And around here,
  that means cornbread...

728
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:57,134
I love it.
  ...a Farmer's Shed
   family recipe.

729
00:23:57,136 --> 00:24:01,505
Well, we're gonna use
some yellow cornmeal
that is locally grown.

730
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:03,874
Uh-huh.

731
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:06,744
Self-rising cornmeal,
   so some leavening agent
   is already in it.

732
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:07,845
Yes. And salt.

733
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:09,046
That's a good start
   we did right there --

734
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,114
didn't come out
     of a box.

735
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,516
Add some flour
 and some sugar.

736
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:14,785
See, it's gonna be good.

737
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,588
My secret ingredient.
   It's a savory spice.

738
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:21,759
All right, then, we're gonna
put eight eggs in there.

739
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:23,160
Now, how much milk
    we putting in?

740
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:25,596
Most of this.
We'll stir it and see.

741
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:26,964
You're gambling,
     aren't you?
 Mm-hmm.

742
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,666
Stir this up.

743
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:31,302
Is that the creaminess
   that we're looking for?
We're right at it.

744
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:33,437
And we're gonna put this
    in a hot skillet.

745
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,339
That skillet's
    done some time.

746
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:37,541
We're gonna put some...
   Butter-flavored oil.

747
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:38,776
We're gonna fill it up.

748
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:40,978
Look, that's already
  starting to form up crust.

749
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,780
That pan is so hot
   right now, you can't --

750
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:44,782
My hands from here,
 still too hot to be next to.

751
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:47,117
Then we're going to top it
with some brown sugar.

752
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,653
Now, how long
and what temperature?

753
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,989
425 for about 25 minutes.

754
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,324
Cornbread is ready?
  Ready.

755
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,459
What do you think?
    Look at that.

756
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:56,627
What are those
     over there?

757
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:58,596
What?

758
00:24:58,598 --> 00:25:00,731
Oh, I guess nothing.

759
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,766
Look at the steam
   coming off that thing.

760
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:04,134
All right, let me
   get a piece of this.

761
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:05,736
Like that crunchy stuff.

762
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,471
Mmm, that tastes great
    just by itself.

763
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:10,374
It's moist,
  little bit of salt to it.

764
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:11,642
Sweet.
 A little bit sweet.

765
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:13,310
I get some of that
    butter note from it

766
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:14,612
from that buttery oil.
     Mmm.

767
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:15,946
That is so sweet
     on the top

768
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,615
that that little
    sugar nugget I got,

769
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,483
that's almost like
   a doughnut or a scone.

770
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,352
Great cornbread. You can stay
   in South Carolina now.

771
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:23,254
I won't get run out.
   Nope, you'll be fine.

772
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:24,889
Good old Southern cooking
    right there.

773
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:26,023
Thank you.
     Thank you.

774
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,992
All right,
 and here's your cornbread.

775
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:29,994
It's almost creamy for a bread.

776
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:32,530
They take the extra time to cook
 it the way it needs to be.

777
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,331
I feel like I'm part
  of Shirley's family

778
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,233
when I'm sitting here
  eating her food.

779
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:37,701
Did you enjoy
    that chicken?

780
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:38,969
Yes, ma'am.
       Good.

781
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,304
They just kind of take care
 of everybody.

782
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:41,972
What is it that you like
    most about this?

783
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,542
Dealing with the people
and serving people food.

784
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:46,243
How are the shrimp and grits
     today?

785
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:48,012
And I'll tell you something.
 I had some great food today.

786
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:49,513
That's a neat experience.

787
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:53,751
Farmers' market, garden shed,
   of course, restaurant.

788
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:55,319
Good job.
  Thank you.

789
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:57,688
Coming up,
 in Frankfort, Kentucky...

790
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,822
I want you
   to take a look at this.

791
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:01,492
...a funky joint
 cooking up crazy crawfish...

792
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:03,060
A notch below insane.

793
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,895
...and piling on
  the outrageous oysters.

794
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:05,996
This place
 is off the chain.
