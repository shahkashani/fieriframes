1
00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:03,802
     So when I come off the road
          from doing "Triple-D,"

2
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:05,737
    the first thing I want to do
       is get home to my kitchen

3
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,005
              and cook my food  
               for my family.   

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,540
          And after a few weeks,
               I got to be --   

5
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,409
  Dad, can we just,             
   I mean, please,              

6
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:12,077
 go to a restaurant             
 at least one time?             

7
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:14,880
           They start to revolt.
      So I came up with an idea.

8
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:17,416
          How about we reach out
   to some of our favorite chefs

9
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,418
   and have them send us dinner?
                    Huh?        

10
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,619
  I like that idea.             

11
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:23,355
         GUY: And I know        
     some "Triple-D" joints     

12
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,157
         that would love        
        to send it to us.       

13
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:27,225
    We've got righteous pasta   
      coming from our buddy     

14
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,294
    Tony at Rino's in Boston.   

15
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,029
            He's setting the bar
                really high.    

16
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,798
 Eric at Momocho's in Cleveland 

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,300
          is cooking up         
     some crazy enchiladas.     

18
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:38,370
             You're transported,
          no passport necessary.

19
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,438
    We're getting real-deal,    
        Neapolitan pizza        

20
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,309
 from a real-deal Italian chef, 
   Roberto, at Don Antonio's.   

21
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,844
               It's delicious.  

22
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,913
        And for dessert,        
        our sister Trina        

23
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,648
    at Se7enbites in Orlando,   

24
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,517
       well, she's sending      
    a funnel cake apple pie.    

25
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,653
             We're going to pop.
   I just want you to know that.

26
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,255
  And on top of it all, they're 
  going to video conference in  

27
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,458
           to give us           
 the true "Triple-D" experience.

28
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,525
       I like                   
 the way you think.             

29
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,462
                  Exactly.      
     This is "Triple-D" Takeout.

30
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:04,663
     And there's a few more     
          in the trunk.         

31
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:05,663
 Of course there is.            

32
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:15,541
                     ♪♪         

33
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,075
     Hey, you guys, how are you?

34
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,211
             -Hello.            
      -How are you, buddy?      

35
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:22,147
    Hunter, Ryder, and Guy here,
 hanging out at the Fieri house.

36
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,950
            Let me introduce you
    to some of my favorite chefs

37
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:27,152
               from "Triple-D"  
         doing a little takeout.

38
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,621
      We've got Tony from Rino's
                 in Boston.     

39
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:32,758
   We've got Eric from Momocho's
       all the way in Cleveland.

40
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,294
  We've got Trin from Se7enbites
       in Orlando, and we got...

41
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,830
              What's that guy's 
              name down there?  

42
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:39,297
                I can't think   
                of his name.    

43
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,534
           Oh, Chef Roberto from
 Don Antonio's in New York City.

44
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,303
           We can't make it back
                all the time    

45
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:45,970
               to go check out  
 our favorite "Triple-D" joints.

46
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,039
          So we figured we would
              just call you up, 

47
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,109
              politely request  
                to package up   

48
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,044
               one of your new  
              signature dishes, 

49
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:53,912
            and send it our way.

50
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:56,048
                 Here we go.    
    Ryder's running the cameras.

51
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,249
                  Hunter is     
        the fantastic sous chef.

52
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,919
             And who's up first?
                 Chef Tony?     

53
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,121
           -Yes, sir.           
             -Okay.             

54
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:05,057
                  Chef Tony.    
      Alright.                  

55
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:07,593
      While Hunter unpacks this,
       give me a little rundown.

56
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,795
         What's new in the world
     of Rino's besides everybody

57
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,930
       still has to wait an hour
           and a half to get in?

58
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,332
    Can't complain. You know?   

59
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:16,201
       It's been 150 times      
      that I've called you.     

60
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:17,536
          "Hey, listen,         
     I got a cousin in town.    

61
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,004
   Hey, listen, I got a buddy   
         that's coming."        

62
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,139
      And then                  
   we get them in.              

63
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:21,540
  Yeah, you always get them in. 
No problem.                     

64
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,074
    But I'm not kidding you,    
    if you want to come here,   

65
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,810
     you got to go get ready    
        to wait in line.        

66
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,279
    It's the tiniest, little,   
 busiest kitchen I've ever seen.

67
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:28,613
                  Pick up.      

68
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,549
   GUY: I know that you're known
          for making great pasta

69
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,484
             fresh for service. 

70
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,751
There should be music           
 to this right now.             

71
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,554
This should be a video.         

72
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,890
                There you go.   

73
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,359
  You're following              
all the principles but one.     

74
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,094
                 What's that?   
 Ridiculous portion.            

75
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,362
                   Oh, portions.
  Let me show you.              

76
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,965
    Normal.                     
                Normal. Yes.    

77
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:50,301
Tony, I'm not kidding.          
Easily two pounds of food.      

78
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,970
        Dude,                   
I'm beyond impressed.           

79
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,438
                 Thank you.     

80
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,141
             This is hilarious. 
               He sent a pan.   

81
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:57,442
            Why not?            

82
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,177
 That way you can use that one. 
           That's all.          

83
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,446
I think I'm in trouble.         
I didn't send a pan.            

84
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:04,182
      Why are you trying to make
  the rest of us look bad, Tony?

85
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,516
                And a plate.    

86
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:09,187
       I sent you the dish      
  to plate it up with, alright? 

87
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,388
                  Napkins?      

88
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,325
    I guess so. I don't know.   
       My wife packed it.       

89
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:16,928
    Tablecloth. What is the dish
          that you sent us, Ton?

90
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,464
   We're making pasta al forno  
        with pappardelle.       

91
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,333
         So I got sheeted pasta.

92
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:24,136
            I've got fresh pasta
       that needs to be sheeted.

93
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:25,470
             And I also have... 

94
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:26,471
    Pappardelle already made.   

95
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,606
        Pappardelle ready to go.
          There you go.         

96
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,276
      Let me just tell you other
     three, you better be ready.

97
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,345
                    Okay?       
     He set the bar really high.

98
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:34,546
                  Alright.      
         So let's get into this.

99
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,014
                  Let's get     
             the meatball going.

100
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,483
           In a bowl,           
   add all three ground meats.  

101
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,018
             The veal, the beef,
                  the pork.     

102
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,486
      Add salt and pepper.      

103
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,620
            The Parmesan cheese?

104
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,556
      The Parmesan cheese.      
              Yes.              

105
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,090
                     Okay. Next?
            Parsley.            

106
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,826
              I got the parsley.
      Parsley.                  

107
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,828
            Oregano.            
           How many breadcrumbs?

108
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,830
   I'll tell you when to stop.  
               Go.              

109
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,766
          That's good.          
          That's good.          

110
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,568
      Add some extra virgin     
           olive oil.           

111
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,303
             This is just Tony. 
             He's just ranting. 

112
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,971
       Okay. That's good.       

113
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,706
How many eggs you want in, Tony?
                    Two?        

114
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,774
          Two, please.          

115
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,109
             We're going to mix 
              these meatballs.  

116
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:05,911
     What size do you want them,
                    Ton?        

117
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,245
         Like a quarter.        

118
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,647
                Hold, please.

 Your thumb's on the wrong side.

120
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:12,917
I can't. My arm doesn't         
   twist that way.              

121
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,118
Then do it the right way.       

122
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,987
My pinkie is all bent.          

123
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,989
  This is like putting ski boots
                on your kids    

124
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,325
          when they're toddlers.
       You know what I'm saying?

125
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,927
       Alright. How are we going
        to cook these meatballs?

126
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,662
     Just cook them in a pan    
            with some           

127
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,598
     extra virgin olive oil     
        that I sent you.        

128
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,933
     That's lot of meatballs    
          right there.

  Once the meatballs are fried, 

130
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:32,537
       you're going to add      
   the meatballs to the sauce.  

131
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,005
                    Tony,       
     what's in the tomato sauce?

132
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,674
         A little bit of garlic,
  these beautiful Roma tomatoes.

133
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,343
          Fresh basil,          
        salt and pepper.        

134
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:39,745
           That's it.           
     Extra virgin olive oil.    

135
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,413
                   Got it.      

136
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,481
               So you send me   
     this beautiful pappardelle.

               Run me through   
                 the recipe.

      a little bit of salt,     

139
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,686
          a little bit          
   of extra virgin olive oil.   

140
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,555
      Bind it all together,     
         and that's it.         

141
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:51,756
             That enough pasta, 
                    Tony?       

142
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,024
       Yeah, that's fine.       

143
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,492
             You sent me enough 
               for two orders.  

144
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,428
               Oh, that looks   
                so delicious.   

145
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,163
         Add the ricotta        
          to the sauce.         

146
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,698
                        Okay.   
 The shredded mozzarella, yeah. 

147
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,901
      There you go, Hunter.     
    You're doing a great job.   

148
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,504
                 Thank you.     
          I'll be here all week.

149
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:07,239
     Once the pasta's done,     
          add the rest          

150
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,974
of the mozzarella cheese on top,
  and then bake it in the oven.

152
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,044
                  And then      
                from the pan,   

153
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,379
             we'll slide it off 
               into the bowl.   

154
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,915
      Slide it off the dish     
      if you can handle it.

222
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,425
  I can tell which one is yours.
             It's spray-painted.

223
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,294
       I love spray paint,      
      and I love stickers.      

224
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,828
                What is this?   

225
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,165
   A local artist in Cleveland  
      made us a Guy screen.     

226
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,300
           Two copies           
       in the whole world.      

227
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,237
     One is in your hand and one
 is right next to me at Momocho.

228
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:54,906
      The big, bad flavor daddy.

229
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,242
                Dude, I want    
            to remind everybody,

230
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,910
                 we do pick     
            a best dish in this.

231
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:01,513
          Now, that will involve
             no cash or prizes, 

232
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,180
                 simply just    
              bragging rights.  

233
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,383
             But this right now 
              is a good start.  

234
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:08,186
             Eric, you're taking
  a very strong formidable lead.

235
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,588
              Let's talk about  
             what we're making. 

236
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,525
  Enmolada is a classic Mexican 
  dish that focuses on a mole.  

237
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,993
    Alright, so I got a hot pan.
           What am I doing here?

238
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:20,332
 The way we serve our enmoladas 
   is with lamb, slow-braised,  

239
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,468
  with some citrus, some herbs, 
    and some avocado leaves.    

240
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,605
  If the lamb is that good cold,
                  help us.      

241
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:29,073
            Some of the lamb jus
         into the shredded lamb?

242
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,208
              -Yep.             
 -I wish we had smell-o-vision. 

243
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,344
             What's in the mole?

244
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,746
    The number-one ingredient   
            is time.            

245
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:37,148
        Mole takes a good       
        two days to make.       

246
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,951
     We have corn tortilla,     
         flour tortilla,        

247
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,819
      four different types      
        of dried chilies,       

248
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,155
       tomatoes, raisins,       
           tomatillo,           

249
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:47,559
 bananas, three different types 
      of powdered chilies,      

250
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:50,228
          white sugar,          
        cumin, coriander,       

251
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,897
       Mexican chocolate,       
          salt, pepper.         

252
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,766
          It's a half-hour show,
                    bud.        

253
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,434
               Corn tortillas   
             or flour tortillas?

254
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:57,903
       Let's go with corn.      

255
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:00,037
      Dip them in some oil      
      for like two seconds.     

256
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,107
  And I would do three or four. 

257
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:04,042
          Well, I got got to let
           Ryder and Hunter eat.

258
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,378
         6 to 10, then.         

259
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,780
     Put meat in the middle     
 of each one of those tortillas.

260
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,248
               Smells amazing.  

261
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,519
      Douse that plate with     
  red chili and chocolate mole. 

262
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,721
      Right across the top,     
       a strip of peanuts,      

263
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,657
           a couple of          
      the pickled shallots.     

264
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:21,059

    triangle wedge of Cotija?

00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,306
               We have truffle  
                and burrata.    

332
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,040
          Prosciutto, porchetta.

333
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,043
             This is            
       a 10-topping pizza.      

334
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,444
              Evidently, it is. 

335
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,846
 There's a surprise             
      in here.                  

336
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,380
   That is something for Guy.   

337
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,915
      I'm going to just tell you
                 right now,     

338
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,051
     if it's what I think it is,
                 and it's --    

339
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,723
    Thanks for tuning in, folks.
                Show's over.    

340
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,859
Oh, my gosh.                    
                Look at that.   

341
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:08,860
             -Whoa.             
              -Wow.             

342
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,194
              Nice.             

343
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,930
 You tell me that's not doing it
            for you right there.

344
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,999
         That's amazing.        

345
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,869
            -Cheater.           
-Yeah, cheater is exactly right.

346
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,070
                 Okay, Chef,    
             what are we making 

347
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,606
     with the 90,000 ingredients
               that you sent?   

348
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:24,409
       Pizza with burrata.      
       You take the dough.      

349
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,943
             That's got a little
             whole wheat in it. 

350
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,078
  Yeah. You remember I told you 
           be gentle,           

351
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,748
             the way            
      you touch your wife.      

352
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,082
                Tell me what    
            we're putting on it.

353
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,885
            You cover           
       all pizza on basil.      

354
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:36,420
      All the pizza is in basil?
              More.             

355
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,490
We're trying to put as more     
  as we can, Chef.              

356
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:40,224
    Now put the cherry tomato   
             on top.            

357
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,093
              Is the porchetta  
            going on this, Chef?

358
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,494
     No, on the next pizza.     

359
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,030
              On the next pizza?
              Yes.              

360
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,165
               How many pizzas  
               are we making?   

361
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,499
I thought this was              
   a one dish.                  

362
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,901
           Yes, so now          
      you pick up burrata.      

363
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,570
            With all the truffle
            in it that you make.

364
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,172
     All the truffle inside.    
              Yes.              

365
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:55,573
    Black or white truffles?    

366
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,909
   CAPORUSCIO: There are black  
  and white truffles together.  

367
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,577
   Oh, that sounds delicious.   

368
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,380
            It smells fantastic.
             Okay. In the oven? 

369
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:03,648
           90 seconds.          

370
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,516
              Ryder, follow me. 

371
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,585
                 90 seconds     
           at about 800 degrees?

372
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:11,122
              Yes.              
                        Alright.

373
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,523
          How's that look, Chef?

374
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,858
           Very good.           

375
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,059
                Cut it first?   

376
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,395
           And after,           
   put on top the prosciutto.   

377
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,696
       I love prosciutto.       

378
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,268
              -Oh.              
     -Just give me a piece.     

379
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,136
                Here you go.    

380
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,272
                    Boy,        
           that is so delicious.

381
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,473
     You got some prosciutto    
    on your chin there, Guy.    

382
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,808
                           Do I?
   It's for later.              

383
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,745
           No, that's my goatee.
      Now can we finally eat it?

384
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,346
              Yes.              

385
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:39,016
                     ♪♪         

386
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:44,288
         So just as I was saying
 with Momocho's, or with Rino's,

387
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,090
                when you get    
        these simple ingredients

388
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:49,761
   that you treat the right way,
       you just don't overdo it.

389
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:52,030
          A good amount of basil
            protecting the dough

390
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:55,633
   from the tomatoes, hitting on
that fresh burrata with truffle.

391
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,234
    And then when it's all done,
                you go ahead    

392
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:00,304
         and just lay on some of
 that beautiful aged prosciutto.

393
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,973
             I got to tell you, 
                    Chef.       

394
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,374
  One of the more simple pizzas.

395
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,375
    I think people would see it.
                 They'd go,     

396
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,843
                  "Come on,     
         burrata and prosciutto?

397
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,111
       Is it that big of a deal?
                   Really?      

398
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,113
             We're going to make
       all this noise about it?"

399
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,983
  I will tell you what, it's all
       this noise and then some.

400
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,117
                      Delicious.
           Thank you.           

401
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,852
     And we've got another pizza
                  to make.      

402
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,921
                Here we have    
             a gluten-free dough

403
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:19,524
          that has to be handled
   a little bit more delicately.

404
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,594
     This dough is made with    
    rice starch, cornstarch,    

405
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:25,796
  and they take off the gluten  
         from the wheat.        

406
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,799
      So it's wheat inside      
         but no gluten.         

407
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,066
             Smoked mozzarella? 

408
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,869
        Smoked mozzarella       
        and basil on top.       

409
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,537
       Very good, Hunter.       

410
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,939
                  Alright.      
             Now the porchetta? 

411
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,407
              Yeah.             
       Now the porchetta.       

412
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,208
     Put how much you like.     

413
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,477
   You can cover up porchetta.  

414
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,278
         I can't handle any more
               of this today.   

415
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,413
               Into the oven?   

416
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,883
      In the oven now, yes.     
    Very close to the mouth.    

417
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:45,950
                Don't put it    
                in the back.    

418
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,218
                Put it close    
      to the front of the mouth.

419
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,487
           So we got 90 seconds.
           The pizza is cooking.

420
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,821
                  We got to     
              go to commercial. 

421
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,423
             We have to clean up
               this hot mess.   

422
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,091
    Hey, Hunter, where were you?
              See you in a bit. 

423
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,526
          Sorry, folks.         
         Park's closed.         

424
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,097
                Welcome back.   

425
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,766
             "Triple-D" Takeout 
        here at the Fieri house,

426
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,368
             and we've got some 
           of our favorite chefs

427
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,502
         from around the country

428
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,771
              sending all kinds 
        of delicious ingredients

429
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:08,840
          for us to semi-prepare
                 ourselves.     

430
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,374
               We've got Tony   
                from Rino's,    

431
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,444
            Eric from Momocho's,
           Trin from Se7enbites.

432
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:17,081
   And here we have Chef Roberto
             from Don Antonio's 

433
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,116
                  and Kesté     
              in New York City. 

434
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,651
         We already had a pizza,

435
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,186
        and we got another pizza
                  to make.      

436
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,722
             Smoked mozzarella, 
                 porchetta.     

437
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,323
        It looks amazing,       
            Roberto.            

438
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,659
      I cannot wait to come     
   to New York and visit you.   

439
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,194

             I'm talking about. 

441
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,399

          the gluten-free crust.

445
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,608
          Look at how that crust
              holds itself up.  

446
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,142
             It is screaming hot
                 right now.     

447
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,812
Dad, I don't understand.        
Do you have magic fingers?

     The hotter, the better.    

451
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,619
            There's been so many
             gluten-free doughs 

452
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,089
                that I've had

         and don't have the bite

          question you about it.

        Not just the Fieris, but
 everybody can reach out to you,

460
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,106

         this gluten-free dough.

getting the shot in there.      

497

These are ridiculous.

 And people can have            
this FedEx'd to them?

     -That looks delicious.     

500
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,129
         You better ship        
          to Cleveland.         

501
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,530
That was killer.                
                    Wow.        

502
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,399
      Alright.

      happening right now.      

505
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:53,538
    We're expanding our menu.   

506
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,872
  And what you're about to make 

507
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,740
      is one of the things      
       that we're adding.       

508
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:01,612
 Fair-favorite funnel cake meets
   apple pie -- all Americana.  

509
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,548
    And I made some homemade    
       cinnamon ice cream       

510
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,083
       to go on top of it.      

511
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,085
             We're going to pop.
   I just want you to know that.

512
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,620
                  Alright.      
           How do we start this?

513
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,889
        You got a whip up       
    that funnel cake batter.    

514
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,091
             Flour, funnel cake,
                vanilla milk.   

515
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,227
       The two of those together
                and the eggs?   

516
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,696
   Yes. And then there should   
     also be some cardamom,     

517
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,765
    salt, and baking powder.    

518
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,034
         I see the vanilla seeds
        that just went in there.

519
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,969
    And you're going to whisk   
       that all together.       

520
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,971
  Take out your tortillas, and  
 you're going to lay those flat.

521
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,307
    You're going to use that    
  around the whole outer edge.  

522
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,909
       That's going to be       
        kind of your glue       

523
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:34,512
that's going to hold your little
  funnel cake burrito together. 

524
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:35,980
                   Got it.      

525
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:40,051
   And then I made you some of  
 our standard apple pie filling.

526
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,252
     And you're going to put    
       about two spoonfuls      

527
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,654
     in the center of that.     

528
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,657
         Wow. That is caramel-y.
              What is in this?  

529
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,327
      Granny Smith apples,      
            cinnamon.           

530
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,062
      It's got some of our      
     finished caramel in it.    

531
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,732
And then you're going to wrap it
 up like a tight little package.

532
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,001
        Roll it around in       
    that funnel cake batter.    

533
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,736
                           Okay.
            And then            
     you're going to drop it    

534
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:02,473
         right into your        
       370-degree hot oil.      

535
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,074
      We'll see                 
if it holds together.           

536
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,678
      Good job.                 
    Hey, Hunter.                

537
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,280
      Yes, that's perfect.      

538
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,482
  And then you're going to get  
     that cinnamon ice cream    

539
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:16,287
 and your chipotle caramel sauce
   ready to top that bad boy.   

540
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,422
   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
         who made the ice cream?

541
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:19,690
             I did.             

542
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:20,958
            Where are you going?
      Get on this camera, Ryder.

543
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,895
             You're not part of 
     the tasting team right now.

544
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,430
      How's that ice cream?     

545
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,032
              I wouldn't know,  
      because I'm not eating it.

546
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:31,769
    Ryder said he wouldn't know,
     because he's not eating it.

547
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,971
             The pie filling is 
             to the next level. 

548
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,841
     Because the apple still has
    so much great texture in it.

549
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,376
                There's still   
         a little bit of crunch,

550
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:39,510
                and it's not    
                overly sweet.   

551
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,180
It's just that fantastic balance
               of the cinnamon  

552
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,315
               and the vanilla  
               and the sugar.   

553
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:45,783
             Ryder, you're going
                to come over?   

554
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:49,587
       The caramel, the filling,
     the fry, but in particular,

555
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,521
               the ice cream.   
                Dynamite job.   

556
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,523
        -Nice job, Chef.        
       -Thank you so much.      

557
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,259
      That's it, everybody.     
      That's it. Nice job.      

558
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,661
High five.                      
                 High five.     

559
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:58,329
    The whole reason we did this
           is we wanted to share

560
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,531
               with everybody   
  just how the world's changing,

561
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,533
        and you can find some of
       your favorite restaurants

562
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,336
       all over the country that
    are actually doing delivery.

563
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:07,338
   And you can order it and have
       it brought to you online.

564
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,739
          Look at the experience
                we just had.    

565
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,007
                   Four of      
        our favorite restaurants

566
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,275
         from "Diners, Drive-ins
                  & Dives."     

567
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:12,743
                 And I don't    
             typically do this. 

568
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:15,346
             There's no prizes, 
      and there's no cash award.

569
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:17,081
                   This is      
         simply bragging rights.

570
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,350
       But ladies and gentlemen,
 today's best dish will go to...

571
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,686
           Who's it going to go?

572
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,321
         Ryder thinks he has it.

573
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,890
                I'm going to    
             tell you something.

574
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,091
                 She came in    
             at the last minute 

575
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,160
              and stole it away 
        from the Truffle Master.

576
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:31,561
             -Yeah!             
   -Give it up for Se7enbites.  

577
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,465
     Chef Trin, congratulations.
                 Delicious.     

578
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,100
        -Congratulations        
        -Nice job, girl.        

579
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:37,501
             Thank you so much. 

580
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,703
        We're going to be eating
                  leftovers     

581
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:39,903
         for like the next week,

582
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,173
              but it was really 
          a dynamite experience.

583
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:44,308
         We'll see you next time
          on "Triple-D" Takeout.

584
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,644
                          Adios.
           Peace out.           

585
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:50,981
 Well, most people put all their
     gloves on at the same time.

586
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,850
I didn't think straight.        

587
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,319
                  Hold on.      
            We'll be right back.

588
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,721
    What is this?               

589
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,624
 My thumb is stuck.             
My pinkie is all bent.
