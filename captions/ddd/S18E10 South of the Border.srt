1
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:03,335
         So, here I am,         
      south of the border.      

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,205
   This is "Diners, Drive-Ins,  
  and Dives" in Cabo San Lucas. 

3
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:08,273
          First stop...         
             Tacos!             

4
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,208
           ...the taco shack... 

5
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:11,677
 Simple and delicious.          
I mean, that's the key.         

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,346
       ...doing their take      
         on the tostada.        

7
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,615
Way more than a taco stand,     
      dude. Way more.           

8
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,550
     Then, on the marina...     

9
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:19,551
Let's hit it, brother.          

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,153
 ...a real-deal seafood joint...

11
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:22,221
  Outstanding, man.             

12
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:25,223
          ...serving up         
    some early a.m. classics.   

13
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:26,625
   Can't beat it.               

14
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,160
  Plus, we got a sushi spot...  

15
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,029
       Fresh fish all the time, 
              every day.        

16
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:32,831
         ...just rolling        
      with the good times.      

17
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,233
                 Outrageous.    

18
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:37,769
     It's the sun, the fun,     
      and even some Sammy.      

19
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:39,905
     We in Cabo, baby! Whoo!    

20
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,143
That's all right here, right now
     on "Triple D" in Cabo.     

21
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,392
      Now, as you can see,      
     the '68 didn't make it.    

22
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:02,327
         A little issue         
   getting across the border.   

23
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:03,595
   But don't worry about that.  

24
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,530
       It's a perfect time      
   to drive the Baja racecar.   

25
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,532
  So, I've been coming to Cabo  
        for a long time,        

26
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,402
and everybody's been telling me,
       for the best tacos,      

27
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:12,271
you got to check this joint out.

28
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:13,939
    And in the land of tacos,   
        that says a lot.        

29
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,041
      This is Asi y Asado.      

30
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:20,145
          WOMAN:                
I have pork and arrachera.      

31
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:22,013
       Best food in town,       
         in my opinion.         

32
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,482
             One arrachera taco.

33
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:24,950
   Can't beat the tacos here.   

34
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:27,219
         What makes Asi y Asado 
                so great?       

35
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:31,356
The tortilla and the salsa.     
        That has to be perfect. 

36
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:34,426
 FIERI: And perfection for owner
    and chef Gustavo Jimenez    

37
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,295
     comes from doing things    
          just one way.         

38
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:38,697
     We make handmade tortillas.

39
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,065
       FIERI:                   
You make the tortilla?          
                            Yep.

40
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:43,902
Along with everything else since
  he opened this stand in '06.  

41
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:45,504
      Everything is fresh.      

42
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:49,307
            We have scallops,   
         shrimp, fish, octopus. 

43
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,376
      [ Needle scratches ]      
     Wait, wait, wait, wait,    
      wait, wait. Octopus?      

44
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:53,111
      Two orders, octopus.      

45
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,181
     Yeah, the octopus taco     
         is really good.        

46
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,916
  And we're gonna make octopus  
             today?             

47
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,918
  How do you say it             
     in Spanish?                
                         Pulpo. 

48
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,719
      Taco de pulpo.            
      Look at the size of that. 

49
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,188
                We got it       
         just out from the sea. 

50
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:04,723
     And how are                
we gonna prepare it?            

51
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,191
             We have to boil it 
                a little bit,   

52
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:07,726
              and then we drop  
              to the charcoal.  

53
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,794
         Just add salt, pepper. 

54
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:11,596
Bay leaves.                     
                      An onion. 

55
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:12,464
And a little bit of orange.     

56
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,532
                  So,           
       we just drop the octopus 

57
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,202
              in boiling water  
               for half-hour.   

58
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,604
And what are we gonna serve     
        with this?              

59
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,538
What kind of salsa?             
       The pico de gallo salsa. 

60
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,674
 You make the chips?            
                      Yes, sir. 

61
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,008
                 This is        
         the handmade tortilla. 

62
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,410
               You just put it  
                on the grill.   

63
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,746
You didn't fry them?            
                       No, sir. 
         This is healthy stuff. 

64
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:28,947
      Awesome.                  

65
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,949
 And it's crispier than any chip
        you'll ever try.        

66
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,418
              Pico de gallo.    
           Just onion and lime. 

67
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,420
      And what makes            
really good pico de gallo?      

68
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,156
             The secret is      
       the lime cooks the onion.

69
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:39,091
Really?                         
               You do it first. 

70
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,225
  Crushed tomatoes.             

71
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,494
       Cilantro, Serrano pepper.

72
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,563
           It's hot. Be careful.
           A little bit of salt.

73
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,632
  And let this sit              
  for a little bit?             

74
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,700
                  Yeah,         
         just a couple minutes. 

75
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:50,502
  So, that's ready.             

76
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,904
   So, we got some skewers in   
the water so they don't burn up.

77
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,239
The pulpo is cooled down.       

78
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,641
                We just take    
             a couple tentacles.

79
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,044
              Chop it. Chunks.  
                Small chunks.   

80
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:02,114
       That's it? And then      
 you just throw it on a skewer? 

81
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:03,315
                    Yes.        
                 That's it.     

82
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:04,483
On the grill?                   
              Off to the grill. 

83
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:06,185
And what kind of wood?          

84
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,385
           ...from the mountain.

85
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:08,586
From the mountain?              
                            Yep.

86
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,922
          Got it.               
I like the tortilla press.      

87
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,125
             Yeah. This a gift  
           from my grandmother. 

88
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,930
   We do like 40 kilos every day
        times seven years.      

89
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,999
Really?                         
       Can you imagine how many 
     tortillas this press made? 

90
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,267
  Just this press?              

91
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,403
          Just this press, yep. 
         You have to do by hand.

92
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:26,338
             Just put it there. 

93
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,606
                 Just press     
                a little bit.   

94
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:32,477
               Do it again      
         because it's not equal.

95
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,879
 So, when you turn it the other 
   way, you get an even press?  

96
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,415
You got to basically do it      
          twice.                

97
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,483
   And this is a corn tortilla. 
      Three minutes to cook.    

98
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:40,752
                  We can...     

99
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,020
 Beautiful tortilla.            

100
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,221
You make your own masa?         

101
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,355
                 Yep.           
       That's the secret, buddy.

102
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,390
That's the secret, buddy.       

103
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:49,428
       We start with the skewer.

104
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,762
           Just take like this. 

105
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:51,930
Put some pico on there.         

106
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:59,071
  Mmm. The octopus is so fresh, 
     it tastes like the sea.    

107
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,642
  It's got texture.             

108
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,977
  The pico de gallo             
   really is nice.              

109
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:11,316
The handmade tortilla,          
it's fresh, it's moist.         

110
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:13,518
 Simple and delicious.          
I mean, that's the key.         

111
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,988
   And the rule is less is more,
             you know.          

112
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,790
    Less is more.               
    Outstanding.                

113
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,059
You can taste the octopus.      

114
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,460
     It has a very nice flavor.

00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,147
                Flour there.    

228
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,216
        And we're just gonna    
     cook it down a little bit. 

229
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,151
               Now the water.   

230
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,619
 How long are we gonna let this 
         cook down for?         

231
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,020
     Probably about 20 minutes. 

232
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,957
  Add a little roux to there to 
thicken it up a little bit more.

233
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,026
         Shrimp base to give it 
       a little bit more depth. 
Okay.                           

234
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,761
   A little bit of tomato puree 
      to give it some color.    

235
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,897
              Reduce this down. 

236
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,032
               Strain it off.   

237
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:29,634
      So, now we have           
the lobster reduction done.     

238
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,702
Did you catch the fish?         

239
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,239
 Actually, I did not, but he was
    a happy camper yesterday.   

240
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,440
So this is that fresh?          

241
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,509
       Really?                  

242
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,714
 This is actually what they call
       a true red snapper.      

243
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:44,115
               In Spanish,      
         they call huachinango. 

244
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:51,789
 There's the filets.            

245
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,459
           Basically, you dip it
           in whole-egg batter. 

246
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,593
                  Panko it.     

247
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:59,196
 Then put it in clarified butter
          on the grill.         

248
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,065
    Char them up                
    on the grill.               

249
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,335
Now we're gonna make            
the finishing sauce             

250
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,802
that's gonna go on top          
    of the fish.                
                       Correct. 

251
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:08,272
             A little olive oil,
              a little garlic.  

252
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:12,343
                I'm gonna add   
              tomatoes, onions, 

253
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,612
                mushrooms,      
           and some white wine. 

254
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:18,483
Real typical dish you see       
 in Mexico all the time.        

255
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,485
             Now we're gonna add
             the lobster sauce. 

256
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:24,422
                  Marinara.     
              And heavy cream.  

257
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,424
So, let this reduce down        
      a little bit,             

258
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,959
and then this will go           
 on top of the fish.            

259
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,628
                  Yeah.         

260
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,097
    Plate it up.                
        Okay.                   

261
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,432
              Cilantro risotto. 

262
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,367
               Another piece.   

263
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:39,070
      And now the little sucker 
     that brings it all to life.

264
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,341
                 And there.     
             We're ready to eat.

265
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,513
First, I got to say,            

266
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:52,317
 you could put the lobster sauce
        on a flip-flop...       

267
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:55,453
...and it would taste good.     

268
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:56,921
 I mean, literally.             

269
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,723
    The risotto,                
 with that cilantro,            

270
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,191
is nice, bright, fresh,         
     clean flavor.              

271
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:03,527
The richness of the lobster     
      is outrageous.            

272
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,730
Good one. Really nice.          
Excellent.                      
           Thank you very much. 

273
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:09,067
  Your delicious stuffed fish.  

274
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,936
       It's always flaky.       
       I know it's fresh.       

275
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:14,005
          We get                
the freshest seafood here.      

276
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,608
       It's three or four hours 
         from ocean to plate.   

277
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,143
 FIERI: And you just can't beat 
      watching the sun rise     

278
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,747
      while chowing down on     
 this classic Mexican breakfast.

279
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,749
             WAITER:            
     A dish of chilaquiles.     

280
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,551
If you want real chilaquiles,   
this is the place to come?      
              Yes.              

281
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:30,021
   All right, Chef,             
now, what are we into?          

282
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,089
     We're making the red sauce 
          with chilaquiles.     

283
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:36,828
So, stewed-down tomatoes,       
onions, peppers, garlic?        

284
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,064
                   Uh-huh.      

285
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,699
     Okay.                      
                     That's it. 

286
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:44,836
             Put some olive oil 
             in there.          

287
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:47,304
         Almost get             
         to where it's smoking. 

288
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,173
 We're gonna actually scorch it 
     in the very beginning.     

289
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,308
   The first part goes in there.

290
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,809
            Really want to have 
           that scorched flavor.

291
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,511
 A little pan juice             
      in there.                 

292
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,446
Now we're gonna add a little bit
         of chicken base        

293
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,382
           and salt and pepper. 

294
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,316
          Let that cook down    
       just a little bit longer,

295
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,319
        and then I'm gonna add  
       the tomato sauce in there

296
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,420
         to give it some color. 

297
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:07,391
What's next?                    
            What we're gonna do 
           is take a sauté pan. 

298
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:10,194
     We're gonna pour the sauce 
      we just made into there.  

299
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,196
               Boiled chicken.  

300
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,664
               We're gonna add  
                the cilantro.   

301
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,133
         In with the tortillas. 

302
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:16,868
Fried tortilla chips.           

303
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,338
Nice, big, thick tortillas.     

304
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,874
             Now we're going to 
               start plating.   

305
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,943
      This is fresh cheese      
 actually made here in the Baja 

306
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,544
     they call farmer's cheese. 

307
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,947
             Take a little heat 
               off the palate.  

308
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:34,819
 Red onions, and then some sour 
 cream, and a sprig of cilantro.

309
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,822
       Sprig?                   
That's like a garden.           

310
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:41,225
   Now, I have had              
a lot of chilaquiles.           

311
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,693
You want them to get            
 a little bit soggy             

312
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:45,130
but still have texture          
   in the tortilla.             

313
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,167
A little bit of heat            
      in that.                  

314
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,103
The texture's great,            
the flavor's great,             

315
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:53,637
the spice isn't too much.       

316
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:56,908
  A little sour cream, a little 
    farmer's cheese in there.   

317
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,912
  You'll get a dip              
  of the guacamole.             

318
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:01,980
      Mmm.                      

319
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,314
What I love about it, Chef,     

320
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,382
         is just                
all the little components       

321
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,519
    that you take               
that extra step with,           

322
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:11,388
 and it really makes            
    a real deal.                

323
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:12,857
                       Awesome. 
Outstanding, man.               

324
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:17,562
 Best chilaquiles I ever tried, 
        not even at home.       

325
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,198
           Sorry, Mom.          

326
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:24,268
       When we come back,       
Chef has got a hangover delight.

327
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:27,271
  Killer stuffed French toast.  
    See you in a little bit.    

328
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,407
  "Triple D" in Cabo San Lucas. 

329
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:39,784
    Welcome back.               

330
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,786
     "Triple D"                 
going international,            

331
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:43,321
 across the border,             
   Cabo San Lucas.              

332
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,689
And we're hanging out           
at Solomon's Landing.           

333
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:48,993
  Now, we have tried            
fantastic chilaquiles.          

334
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,062
        We've also tried        
 what they call a stuffed fish. 

335
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,463
         This,                  
this is supposed to be,         

336
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,465
   from what I've heard         
from everybody around here,     

337
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,267
 the hangover cure of all time. 

338
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,603
           Stuffed French toast.

339
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,071
After some tough nights in Cabo,

340
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,140
   it'll help you a little bit  
       with your hangover.      

341
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,541
  What are we into?             

342
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:06,878
        This is the compote     
   for the stuffed French toast.

343
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,081
            Starting out        
     with a little whole butter,

344
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,151
             fresh strawberries,
                  bananas.      

345
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,220
                 Raw sugar.     

346
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,154
     Frozen strawberry compote. 

347
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:19,356
             Now we're gonna add
               a little brandy  

348
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,892
   to really bind these flavors 
           really good.         

349
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:24,896
      Next up?                  

350
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:27,865
A nice, big pullman loaf.       

351
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,500
    You bake it?                

352
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,970
              We have a bakery  
          that bakes it for us. 
Okay.                           

353
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:34,438
      We're just gonna slice    
   a couple pieces off of here. 

354
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:37,175
     Now we're going to put     
 some cream cheese on both sides

355
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,109
             so we can stuff it.

356
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,312
     Now we're gonna stuff it   
   with the fresh strawberries. 

357
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,714
                We try to use   
              a local product.  

358
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:45,115
  A lot of the year, we're able 
to get local-grown strawberries.

359
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:48,319
          Now we're gonna go in 
              for some bananas. 
Okay.                           

360
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:51,022
               Now we're gonna  
              push it together. 

361
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:53,591
Let's hit it, brother.          

362
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,994
Now, what's in our batter       
       over here?               

363
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,529
              Eggs, milk,       
       cinnamon, nutmeg, cream? 

364
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,031
                 And brandy.    

365
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,207
Compote with the brandy.        

366
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,211
     Beautiful.                 

367
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,947
  I'm not a huge breakfast fan, 

368
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:20,217
 but I do appreciate            
 good French toast.             

369
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,887
A little bit of sweet,          
    a lot of fruit.             

370
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,555
    Some banana.                

371
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:25,623
    Really nice.                

372
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,691
No need for any syrup.          

373
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,761
The juice from the compote      
   itself is just great.        

374
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,897
Can't beat it.                  
               Well, thank you.

             It's unbelievable. 

377
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:41,038
            I tell them         
   we can never make it at home.

378

              good people.

 I love this place.

Nice job, Chef.                 
 Well done.

 the deep-fried fusion flavors.

       So, on my final leg

       of Cabo San Lucas,       

388

       back at the marina,

     from Solomon's Landing.

    that my buddy Gorilla --    

391
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,977
 You remember Gorilla Rich from 
 Gorilla Barbeque in Pacifica --

392
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,046
 He says he's been to this place
        a bunch of times.       

393
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,815
       It's off the hook.       
       This is Tiki Bar.        

394

      Fish tacos are ready.     

395
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:32,523
     This is our local spot     
           to come to.          

396
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,192
  It's in kind of               
  a touristy area.              

397
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,793
      Locals and tourists,      
     we mix and mingle well.    

398
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:39,997
 It's right here on the marina. 
  I love the food, everything.

      owner Moises Gonzalez

                  in Cali.

 more like home for the locals,

 advantage of the surroundings.

didn't catch it, my friends did.

406

         That's right --        
    sushi in a Mexican joint.   

409
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,697

   the heavy nagasaki.

426
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,401

 is just mix it up a little bit.

      anything else to it.

00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:22,693
                  Okay.         

456
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,630
   The way you treat the shrimp 

457
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:30,034
        and the tenderness      
   of that shrimp is outrageous.

458
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,769
                 Outrageous.    

459
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:32,970
         Although it was fried, 

460
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,372
   it doesn't have a real heavy 
        fried taste to it.      

461
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,174
              It's very light.  

462
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,978
       The salad has just enough
           of the Sriracha.     

463
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,179
         A little hint          
         of the salmon.         

464
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,648
           This is outstanding. 
Thank you.                      

465
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,050
                 Oh!

  is the greatest in the world.

472
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,738
     Just bring people here.    
     It's a wonderful spot.     

473
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,440
 I'm just like you guys. I mean,
 you go somewhere, you're like, 
    "Where should I go eat?"

00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:13,744
A funky little place -- small --
   and these guys do it legit.

         We got to do more sushi
             on "Triple D."

 So, that's it for this edition

      and Dives" Cabo tour.

 Now, before you leave, there's 
 one joint you got to check out.

479
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:26,790
    It's not about the food.    
    It's all about the rock.    

480
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,827
 This is the Cabo Wabo Cantina.

  I hope Sammy's in the house.

       Yeah! Sammy Hagar!
