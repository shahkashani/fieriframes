I LIKE IT A LOT.                

94
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,822
              SEASON THIS

LAY IT OUT TO COOL.             

95

00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,434
A LITTLE BIT, RENDER SOME OF    
THE FAT, SO IT DOESN'T STICK.   
                           YEAH.

100
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:57,969
BROWN THAT OFF.                 
                  BROWN THIS UP.

101
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:00,438
  GREAT. NOW WE'RE READY        
TO START MAKING THE PIZZA.      
                      THAT'S IT.

102
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,641
        STRETCH IT OUT TO ORDER.
              SO TAKE THAT.     

103
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,910
     THE DOUGH GOES IN THE OVEN 
      FOR ABOUT THREE MINUTES.  

104
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:08,246
              PULL THE SKIN OUT,
                  NICE RISE.    
(whistles)                      

105
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,782
           RED ONION MARMALADE--
            GIVE IT A THIN COAT.
GET THAT MEAT ON THERE.         

106
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,451

             SOME SAUSAGE HERE.

            PIZZA'S ABOUT READY,
              NICE CRUST, BOOM. 

109
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,992
               JUST DRAPE IT    
          WITH SOME OF OUR SLAW.
LOOK AT THAT!                   

110
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,527
                 CUT IT HERE,   
               NICE CRISP CRUST.

111
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:25,397
NO CHEESE AND NO SAUCE.         

112
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,998
DUDE, SMOKIN' THE SLAW.         

113
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,734
GENIUS. (chuckles)              

114
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:30,335
REALLY, REALLY GOOD.            

115
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,604
ON THE TOMATO FRONT,            
LOOKIN' FOR THE ACID.           

116
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,940
YOU'RE GETTING THE ACID         
 FROM THE ONION, MMM.           

117
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,942
BUT THE KICKER--THE SLAW,       
  BECAUSE OF THE MAYO,          

118
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,544
  BECAUSE OF THAT FAT,          
IS REMINISCENT OF THE FAT       

119
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:40,946
THAT YOU'D NEED                 
FROM THE CHEESE.                

120
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,881
I DON'T KNOW THAT IF YOU        
 BLIND-FOLDED SOMEBODY,         

121
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,682
    THE AVERAGE PERSON          
WOULD REALLY BE ABLE TO SAY     

122
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,952
  THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO CHEESE, 
AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO SAUCE.

123
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,287
I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE           
TO STOP EATING THAT.            

124
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,624
             HERE'S YOUR SAUSAGE
               AND SLAW PIZZA.  
IT'S JUST AMAZING.              
  IT'S SO FRESH.                

125
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,293
      I GOT TO TALK             
ABOUT THAT PIZZETTA, MAN.       

126
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:59,064
  GIVE THE BOOZE AWAY, AND JUST 
 CHARGE $9,000 FOR THE PIZZETTA.

127
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,965
             I THINK            
  WHAT REALLY TIES IT TOGETHER  

128
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,767
    IS ACTUALLY JUST THE SLAW   
         AND THE ONION.         

129
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,170

I CAN'T REITERATE THE CARE      

130

INGREDIENTS INTO THE COOKING.

    JUST GREW IN YOUR GARDEN.   

133
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:15,847
  THIS IS A BLT PIZZA. LOOK AT  
THE TOMATOES. THEY'RE HEIRLOOMS.
CRAZY.                          

134
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,983

142
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,666
                  PULL IT OUT,  
                AND MARINATE IT.
OKAY.

           HOISIN, SRIRACHA,    
      FRESH GROUND BLACK PEPPER.

144
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,470

    WE GOT TO EXTRACT SOME OF   
THE LIQUID OUT OF THIS JALAPEÑO.

                 ROUGH-CHOP 'EM.

CRACK OPEN THE CELLS.           
 YES. PUSH IT THROUGH A CHINOIS.
     THIS IS A FINE STRAINER.   

149
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:53,752
PURE JALAPEÑO JUICE.            
 LOOK AT THAT, MAN.             

150
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,154
  NOW WE'RE READY FOR OUR AIOLI.
     START WITH OUR EGG YOLKS,

           MACERATED GARLIC.    
BREAKS DOWN REAL EASY.          

152
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,359
         GIVE IT A LITTLE WHISK.
WHERE'S YOUR OIL?               

153
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:03,228
        WILL YOU DO THAT FOR ME?
 NOW ANY REASON THAT WE'RE      
NOT USING A FOOD PROCESSOR?     

154
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,231
    I LIKE FOREARM WORKOUTS.    
 NOW WE ADD OUR JALAPEÑO LIQUID.

155
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,500
   SO WE SEASON IT WITH A LITTLE
     BIT OF SALT, READY TO GO.  

156
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,169
                     TASTE THIS.

        NOW WE'RE GOING TO SEAR 
      OUR PORK. FIRST, SOME OIL.

159
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:18,043
OKAY.                           
           TAKE OUR LOIN,       
    AND DON'T OVERCROWD OUR PAN.

160
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,244
   YOU CROWD THE PAN.           
THEY SIT THERE AND STEAM.       

161
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,914

    TO THE OUTSIDE OF 'EM.      

162
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,184

287
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,309

     LET'S MAKE OUR MASA.       

292

         CONSTANTLY DOING THIS. 

302
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,676

TO BE KIDDING ME.               

303
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:54,145

PLANTAIN. MEXICAN IS CORN.      
 SALVADORIAN IS PLANTAIN.       

308
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,556
 SO I'LL TAKE A SPOONFUL.

309
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,625
         I'LL TAKE A SPOONFUL,  
       AND GUESS WHAT'LL HAPPEN?

310

              A SMOKED COCONUT. 

479
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,536
WE'RE LITERALLY GONNA SMOKE     
        THIS STUFF?             
              WE'RE GONNA PUT IT
                 IN A SMOKER.   

480
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,206
OH. THAT'S WHAT I MEANT.        
               YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

481

              AND THERE IT IS.  

482
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,211
THERE WE GO!                    
   IF YOU PUT IT IN A 400-DEGREE
      OVEN FOR A FEW MINUTES,   

483
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,013
      IT WILL PULL THE MEAT AWAY
            FROM THE SHELL,     

484
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,482
     MAKE IT EASIER TO GET OUT. 
     GET IN THERE WITH A KNIFE, 

485
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:15,219
    AND IT SHOULD POP RIGHT OUT.
     REALLY.                    
LET'S GO THIS WAY.              

486
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,488
I LOVE THIS GUY.                

487
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,957
WE JUST GIVE 'EM                
SOME THIN SLICES.               
            RIGHT INTO THE BOWL.

488
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,093
DUDE.                           
           GET ENOUGH COCONUT TO
          MAKE A FEW SANDWICHES.

  HE GROUND THIS HIMSELF.       
IT'S GOT A NICE DUST TO IT.     

491
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,368
               DARK BROWN SUGAR.
      AND THAT'S IT,            
JUST A LITTLE CURE ON THIS.     

492
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,970
   ABSORB SOME OF THAT FLAVOR.  
IT'LL LOSE SOME OF ITS MOISTURE.

493
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,772
WE LET THIS HANG OUT            
    FOR 24 HOURS.               

494
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,375
 THEN WE'LL GO                  
TO THE SMOKER?                  
           YEAH, FOR FIVE HOURS.
                READY TO GO.    

495
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:40,311

        LET'S MAKE A SANDWICH.  
     GOT SOME TOFU ON THE GRILL.

           CLUB WHEAT.          

498
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,783
  WE'VE GOT THIS VEGAN          
TOMATO MAYONNAISE WE MADE       

499
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,386
          WITH LEMON JUICE,     
    TOMATO PASTE, DIJON MUSTARD,

500
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,522
               A LITTLE GARLIC, 
              AND THEN SOME OIL.

501
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,991
     PUT THE TOFU ON THE BREAD, 
       ADD SOME BIBB LETTUCE,   

502
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,928
