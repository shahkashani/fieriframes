00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,062
  some bad nachos."             

229
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:21,333
Instead, I get escargot.        

230
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,601
CHRIS: Six mushrooms.           

231
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,669
         Okay, is this new math?
           'Cause you got seven.

232
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,937
         -There you go.         
             -Okay.             

233
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,006
The Belgian escargot.           

234
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,275
Put a little oil in it first    
just to get it started.         

235
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:32,610
 Our garlic butter.             

236
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,345
             So, everybody comes
        to temperature together.

237
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,747
We're gonna take out            
   our mushrooms.               

238
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,149
 Take our escargot.             

239
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:41,086
              -Ohh.             
    -Little provolone cheese.   

240
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,820
              Throw that up in  
             the cheese melter. 

241
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,088
     You got it.                
    There we go.                

242
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,091
                Look at that.   
                    Mmm.        

243
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,360
           That was so delicate.
             it was like buttah.

244
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,029
    You're having               
    the escargot?               

245
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:54,032
             CHRIS:             
   It was on the menu before,   
 and we didn't sell a lot of it,

246
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,767
     but we sold a lot of it    
           after that.          

247
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,370
             FIERI:             
But even their bar-food classics

248
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,971
   are done the Scully's way.   

249
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,974
     Buffalo wings are hot sauce
      and butter, and that's it.

250
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,175
                    Okay?       

251
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,910
         No, no, no, no.        
   We don't make it like that.  

252
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,578
              So, when anybody  
             starts tweaking it,

253
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,980
       I get a little skeptical.

254
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,115
           -Hot sauce.          
           -Hot sauce.          

255
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:11,850
   Worcestershire.              
Fresh, chopped garlic.          

256
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:13,117
        -Whipped butter?        
            -Butter.            

257
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,986
     We fry it.                 
    We grill it.                

258
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,388
     We fry it, we grill it,    
   we toss it into the sauce,   

259
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,623
       and then we eat it,      
            you know?           

260
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,392
 -You have a license to do this?
            -Not yet.           

261
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,995
  He's never seen it like that. 

262
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,530
                Very savory.    

263
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:28,265
Probably gonna get kicked out of
  the national wing-eating club.

264
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:31,336
                 Sacrilege.     

265
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:35,540
             Okay. I'm over it. 
 You can do your wings your way.

266
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,008
                This is some    
            legit food, brother.

267
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,877
      You got them oysters      
         coming, right?         

268
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,345
             FIERI:             
      And wait till you see     

269
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,880
         what he's doing        
     with Buffalo sauce now.    

270
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,683
   Buffalo oyster!              
   Pickup, please!              

271
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:47,352
 Nobody expects Scully's Tavern 
   to have this type of dish.   

272
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,086
  It's more of a gourmet item.  

273
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,889
  I just wanted to do something 
    different and created it.   

274
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,891
          These oysters         
     are from Apalachicola.     

275
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,027
    Then we're gonna put them   
      into our dry batter.      

276
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,162
 Our flour consists of paprika, 

277
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,331
        steak seasoning,        
     and granulated garlic.     

278
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,233
 And then we're gonna fry them. 

279
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:05,036
  We're gonna take our arugula. 
       We're gonna bed it.      

280
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,972
         They are topped        
        with blue cheese.       

281
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,306
    And then, on top of that,   

282
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:11,509
       is pepperoni chips       
   and our Buffalo wing sauce.  

283
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,111
       This is one of our       
      most popular dishes.      

284
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,112
      Everybody loves them.     

285
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,847
              MAN:              
     That hot sauce on them     

286
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,783
       definitely takes it      
      to a different level.     

287
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,451
  I got one Buffalo oyster up!  

288
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,120
     This new buffalo style     
    is definitely closing in    

289
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,923
     as my favorite oyster.     

290
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,859
 FIERI: But that's not the only 
  new trick from this old dog.  

291
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:29,794
       Let's get into the hunch.

292
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,863
              If somebody says  
       they want a fish sandwich

293
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:35,333
 and they look in the dictionary
             for a definition...

294
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,201
               that should be   
                the sandwich.   

295
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,138
    They're not just serving    
 the mahi between bread anymore.

296
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,006
  He's smoking it, chopping it, 

297
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,341
           and making           
     a South Florida staple.    

298
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,211
             CHRIS:             
      Our smoked-fish dip.      

299
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:50,214
    Shallots, Dijon mustard,    
  our horseradish, lemon juice, 

300
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,417
        and a little bit        
 of vinegar-based pepper sauce. 

301
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:55,220
   We're gonna add mayonnaise   
 at the end to bind it together.

302
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:58,156
       Great smoky flavor.      
       Just great texture.      

303
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,424
   Let me have two              
  smoked-fish dips.             

304
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,959
   It's all fish. There's not   
     a lot of filler in it.     

305
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,761
        Has really nice,        
        mild seasonings,        

306
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,897
        and it has nice,        
    big chunks of fish in it.   

307
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,365
      One of my favorites.      

308
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,634
       Lot of people pass us by,

309
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:10,835
               don't know what  
             they're gonna miss.

310
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,170
You don't know, do you?         

311
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,039
   I was here for the original  
     filming when Guy came.     

312
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,042
         You're watching        
  "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

316
