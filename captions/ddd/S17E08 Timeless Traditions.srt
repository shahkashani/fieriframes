           Hey, there!          
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:06,471
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,474
          This trip...          
 Drum roll, please.             

4
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:10,408
        ...we're getting        
    a very authentic taste...   

5
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:11,477
                  Be brave.

     timeless traditions...

00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,147
              All right.        
       Here comes the big deal. 

8
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:17,416
    ...in Denver, Colorado...

00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:18,750
             Come on over here.

00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,418
    ...the soul-food spot...    

11
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,888
 I had food like this           
prepared by my mother.          

12
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,623
       ...going real deal       
        on the rabbit...        

13
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,426
Every time you take a bite,     
   it's more fun.               
                  Have fun.     

14
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:29,161
         ...and the entrails... 

15
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:31,764
 Wow! I bet that's              
 an acquired taste!             

16
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:32,698
                   It is!       

17
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,033
  ...in Scottsdale, Arizona...  

18
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:37,102
   Your kung fu...              
is better than mine.

00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,504
        ...the family-run       
        Italian joint...        
      Mmm.                      

20
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,906
          ...serving up         
 fresher-than-fresh sausages... 

21
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,109
           It's a recipe        
   that's almost 100 years old. 

22
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:47,779
          ...right next         
     to a colossal calzone.     

23
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:50,048
       Roman Centurion calzone. 

24
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:52,450
      Then in Philadelphia,     
         Pennsylvania...        

25
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:53,585
  Looks fantastic.

    ...a Jamaican vacation...   

27
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:56,922
       Just makes me happy      
           to be here.          

28
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:58,657
  FIERI: ...right in the heart  
          of the city.          

29
00:00:58,659 --> 00:00:59,657
   How about you                
   eat one first?

     [ Laughs ]                 

31
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,729
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

32
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,531
         on "Triple D."         

33
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,015
  I'm here in Denver, Colorado. 

34
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,018
  It seems every time I cruise  
 into town, I find killer food! 

35
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:27,085
           Let's see.           

36
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:28,820
    I've had Native American,   
        East Coast deli.        

37
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,756
  I mean, I've been to a joint  
 that was all about sauerkraut! 

38
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:33,091
   So, it's no surprise to me   

39
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,960
       that when I'm here       
      on Colorado Boulevard     

40
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:36,628
 in the Park Hill neighborhood, 

41
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:38,764
  that I'd find some real-deal, 
       Southern soul food!      

42
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,300
    This is Cora Faye's Cafe.   

43
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,040
   Ox tails, black-eyed peas,   
           cornbread.           

44
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:51,442
 I had food like this           
prepared by my mother.          

45
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,778
      One piece of catfish.     
             WOMAN:             
    Growing up in the South,    

46
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:55,314
   this is something familiar   
             for me.            

47
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,116
    The catfish, the chicken,   
         the frog legs,         

48
00:01:58,152 --> 00:01:59,651
     it all feels like home.    

49
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,319
 It feels like how I was raised.

50
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:02,921
             FIERI:             
   To some, it's farm cooking.  

51
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,656
    Others call it soul food.   

52
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,393
 But for owner Priscilla Smith, 
     it's a family thing...     

53
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,994
 It's authentic Southern cooking

54
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,064
          and goes back         
     many, many generations.    

55
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,732
     FIERI: ...'cause a lot     
   of what they ate growing up  

56
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:16,135
  came from what was available. 

57
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,402
             SMITH:             
        Smothered rabbit.       

58
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,271
Now, is this a recipe from home,
      from back in Alabama?     

59
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:21,606
         Yes, it was handed down
            by my mom, Cora.    

60
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,809
           That rabbit          
      is just spectacular.      

61
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,476
     All right.                 
So, let's get into the rabbit.  
                 All right.     

62
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:26,745
         Here's the rabbit here.

63
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,880
How do you explain rabbit       
        to folks?               

64
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:31,016
       It's better than chicken.
        It's a very lean meat.  

65
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:32,818
  It is very lean,              
       right.                   
                 Very tasty.    

66
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,686
Okay. So, the rabbit            
  comes in cleaned.             

67
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,021
                  Yes.          

68
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,990
             And so I cut it up.

69
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,893
              Salt and pepper.  

70
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:43,829
                   Flour.       

71
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:44,863
      Okay.                     

72
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:48,500
  Oil's heating up.             

73
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,434
      Now?                      

74
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,169
           Now we're gonna fry  
               this rabbit      

75
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,570
         the old-fashioned way. 

76
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,172
That's the way to do it.        

77
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,374
             Iron-cast skillet. 

78
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,309
 Now, what's your favorite part 
         of the rabbit?         

79
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:58,577
              I think the wing. 

80
00:02:58,712 --> 00:02:59,777
  The rabbit wings?             

81
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,113
  Good. 'Cause that's           
what I call them, also.         

82
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,580
You actually call them          
      the wings?                

83
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,048
              [ Laughing ] Yes. 
     I love it.                 

84
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:06,251
           I'm just gonna brown 
               on each side.    

85
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,920
              We're gonna take  
              the rabbit out.   
        Okay.                   

86
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:10,189
         And then I'm gonna make
         the roux -- the gravy. 

87
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:11,390
             Then I'm gonna put 
             the rabbit back in 

88
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,991
             and let the rabbit 
               finish cooking.  

89
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,793
                  This is       
           the chicken bouillon.

90
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:18,196
   Okay. So, we're essentially  
 adding a little chicken stock. 

91
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:19,664
                I don't have    
              any rabbit stock. 

92
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,000
   No, if you do,               
let me know where you get it.   
                    Okay.       

93
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:22,968
                    Flour.      

94
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:26,070
                  Pepper, salt. 

95
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:27,139
Gonna get some water?           
                    Yep.        

96
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:30,209
         Mix it up a little bit.

97
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,143
 Now we'll we're gonna          
just plop the rabbit back in?   
                    Yep.        

98
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:35,013
 So, we're gonna let this       
cook down how much longer?      

99
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,414
               Uh, 45 minutes.  

100
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,949
It's just gonna sit there       
and simmer in the gravy?        

101
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:40,084
                  Yes.          

102
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,486
   Rabbit's ready?              
                       Yes.     

103
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,887
            I'm gonna plate it. 
        Okay.                   

104
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,889
        I'm gonna put the rice  
        in the center.          

105
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,292
        Oh.                     
        I love greens.          

106

        Don't be shy on those.  

107
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:51,964
      Tell me about those yams. 

108
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,032
    These are made              
the old-fashioned way.          

109
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,901
    I boil these.               
 I don't bake these.            

110
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,168
          Well,                 
I'm missing a hush puppy.       

111
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,171
       Oh, the hush puppy       
       jumped in my mouth.      

112

                 [ Laughs ]     

113
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,774
             All right, rabbit.

       We add                   
       a little bit of paprika.

261
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,514

            in-house ourselves.

             We try to make sure
             we coat all of it. 

263
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,719
         We'll add some crushed 
           red pepper to this,  

264
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:50,388
 and then a little more paprika,
   'cause this is hot sausage.  

265
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,790
             Now we're gonna add
             some chilled water

00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,893
             to help incorporate
                 the spices.    

267
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,662
 We're bringing out             
     the hopper?                

268
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:58,663
           Bring out the hopper.

   Natural casing?              
       I flushed these already. 

270
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:06,871
         The wetter this is,    
     the easier this will go on.

271

       this end up a little bit 

273
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:13,144
       so it doesn't all shoot  
       right out of the casing.

   If they're a little tighter, 
           it's quicker,        

280
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,094

       a little looseness,

298
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,934
       And then at the very end,
       we add Marsala wine again

299
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,069
           and let that all stew
             for a little bit.  

300
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,804
                 And you get    
             those juices going.

      that they make here.      

337
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:38,689
   You got a good deli counter  

338
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,024
   where you can get the meats  
        and the cheeses.        

339
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,693
     You get imported stuff     
           from Italy.          

340

             Real Italian food. 

342
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,431

       as my barometer...       

343
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,766
      All rise

345

          at DeFalco's          
   Italian Deli and Grocery...  

348
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,677
    Meat and cheese lasagna.    

349
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,813
  FIERI: ...the epitome of what 
   an East Coast Italian deli

          is all about.         

351
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,283
   There's only one curveball.  

352
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,084
  We're in Scottsdale, Arizona. 

353
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,687
 This little gem in the desert. 

354
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:11,689
       WOMAN:                   
 Centurion calzone.             

355
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:12,690
    The calzone is wonderful.   

356
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:14,091
 You can't eat the whole thing, 

357
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,895
       but you can have it      
       for lunch tomorrow.      

358
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:17,896
We're now gonna make the...     

359
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:21,365
       Roman Centurion calzone. 

360
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:24,101
      We're gonna go ahead      
and start off with some semolina

361
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,871
             here on the table  
           to stretch our dough.

362
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,642
         Get it up on the peel. 

363
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,044
               So, we're        
       all stretched out there. 

364
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:35,580
         Pecorino Romano mix    
     with a little bit of spices

365
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,049
        and some garlic --      
   adds a little bit of flavor. 

366
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,517
               This is          
     our house-made mozzarella. 

367
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,986
            We make this daily. 
       Really?                  

368
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:42,854
       Dig in.                  

369
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,588
       I'll make you some       
       if you like.             

370
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:45,923
     So tender.                 

371
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,527
     Just enough salt in there  
     to give it a little taste. 

372
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,264
      Next we're gonna add      
 thin-sliced sopressata to this.

373
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,201
           Some roasted peppers.

374
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:58,536
       We roast these in-house. 

375
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:01,139
     We kind of marinate them   
   in a little bit of olive oil 

376
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,340
         and some fresh parsley.

377
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,076
            Kalamata olives,    
         fresh tomato on there. 

378
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:07,212
       We add some fresh basil. 

379
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,815
           Last layer of cheese.

380
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,683
                Seal her up.    

381
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,219
Little tuck and roll.           

382
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:17,755
       Cut the top a little bit.

383
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:20,357
   So it doesn't steam          
into a gigantic football.       

384
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,427
  And what temperature          
are we running that oven?       

385
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:25,563
       As hot as we can get     
   a deck oven to go, about 600.

386
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,298
            About 10 minutes,   
         it'll be ready to rock.

387
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:28,967
   Bring it on in.              

388
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:29,967
                 All right.     

389
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,970
      All rise                  
 for the Centurion.             

390
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,238
      Wow!                      

391
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:35,373
           Yeah, they're hearty.

392
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,041
  You have to bring             
your own wheelbarrow?           

393
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:39,243
      By the time they get done 
     eating it, you'll need one.

394
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,979
    And this also comes with    
 the sauce that we made earlier.

395
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,381
    Got a little juice coming   
  out of that fresh mozzarella  

396
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,851
  and those tomatoes in there.  

397
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,720
    Look at that.               

398
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:52,023
The basil, the sopressata,      
the house-made mozzarella.      

399
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:55,526
     Oh.                        

400
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,929
     Great dough.               
Some real chew to that.         

401
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,334
The balance is fantastic,       
   the crust is great,          

402
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,002
the oven temperature's          
       perfect.                 

403
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,872
  The tomato sauce              
      is great.                 

404
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,742
  I mean, you'd be              
  very hard-pressed             

405
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,543
if you brought somebody         
  in here blindfolded

       in a New York deli.      

407
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,014
     That's a great compliment. 
             Thank you.         

408

 It's great food, man.

           about Jamaican food? 

453

  Well, my mom's Jamaican, and  
  I have a Jamaican background.

         in the kitchen.

 WILSON: We're the only Jamaican
 restaurant with a jerk pit.    

459
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,639
           So you really get    
       that charcoal, that wood,

460
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,308
              that char to it,  
                that flavor.    
      Exactly.                  

461
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,177
      And that's what makes it  
      real-deal Jamaican.       

462
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:27,512
That's what makes it            
     real good.

00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:29,713
      What's your favorite item

    Jerk chicken.

     with the jerk sauce first.

           on the chicken.

              Then I rub it up.

      wrap this up,
