     You know, I don't know,    
     we should check it out.

  Now, we shot Outrigger Pizza  
  in 2016, but it was by a park 
       down at the water.       

36

     -Let's go check it out.    

40

    This is Outrigger Pizza.

   I saw that Guy has actually  
     been here because I saw    
          the stencil.          

45
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,284

     -There is the stencil.     

48
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:08,260
    I threw that up in 2016,    
     when I found Kevin Laut    
    and his mobile pizza oven   

49
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,862
  parked in a pretty epic spot. 

50
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,797

    How high-stress is this?    

51
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:16,068

52
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,735

     my nephew Jules' turn.

      Although the scenery      
     isn't exactly the same.    

54
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,741
       -We were in Lahaina      
    last time, on the beach.    
            -Lahaina.           

55
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,744
    -On the beach in Lahaina.   
  -Now we're in a parking lot.  

56
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,280
     -Is this a normal hang?    
    -Yeah, this is every day.

58
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,618
     and you just can't miss    
      that big yellow cart.     

59
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,554
      -I love the rig, man.     
    Who built the pizza oven?   
             -I did.            

60
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:37,623
        -Did you, really?       
             -Yeah.             

61
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,692
       -Last time we tried      
           a Kajlua...          
       -The Lilikoi Pork.       

62
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:43,428
    -The Lilikoi Pork, right.   
   -Number one seller by far.   

63
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,097
 -It's the true Hawaiian pizza. 
            -Got it.            

64
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:49,034
   -Lilikoi, what is Lilikoi?   
  -Lilikoi is a passion fruit.  

65
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,370
       -Okay, first we're       
     gonna make pizza dough.    
              -Yep.

69

           -Seriously?          
             -Yeah.             

70
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,313
  -I add my yeast to the water. 
             -Okay.             

71
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,847

72
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,450
         -Five pounds...        
      -I don't want you to      
        take any offense,       

73
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,586
          but I'm gonna         
       stand on this side       
    when you pour the flour.    

74
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,187
      That's the side where     
      the wind's gonna go.      

75
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:10,656
        Okay, fantastic,        
    I'll be right over there.   

76
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:14,193

    bleached flour, semolina,   

77
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:21,199
  and now we're gonna take out  
 four pounds to add that to our 
   second phase of the dough.   

78
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,668
          There you go.         

79
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,271
             -Water.            
    -So what'd you do today?    
    Watched a guy make dough.   

80
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:30,408

  at the park by the water with 
     some weird contraption.

84
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:39,184

        for this to poof.       
              -Oh.              

85
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:43,622
          -To do what?

       -Now that we've let      
         the dough rise,        

87
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:49,361
     we're gonna reintroduce    
    our four pounds of flour.   

88
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,697
       Hawaiian sea salt.       

89
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,966
  -Alright, so that's together. 
  -Two hours later, we're gonna 
        knead the dough.        

90
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:58,437
    And into our plastic bag,   
     and then refrigeration.    

91
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,438
    Let it rest for two days.   

92
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,641
       And we're gonna do       
      a garlic aioli base,      

93
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:06,578
     a little bit of garlic,    
  the pork, Maui sweet onions,  

94
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,646
       sweet bell peppers.      

95
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,782
       Mozzarella cheese,       
     a little bit of Romano.

  Well, that oven's hot, buddy. 

97
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,653

99
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,424
  We'll do some fresh parmesan. 

100
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,098
    And here's our specialty,   
          the Lilikoi.          

101

107
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:47,618
     -I might need a mixer.     
             -Right?            

108
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:48,887

        -Did you finally        
        go with a mixer?        

109
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:53,624
   I got a big 60-quart mixer   
    to help me along my way.    

110
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,694
        -It's been great.       
           -I love it.          

111
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:56,561
     Well, what do you got,     
           what's new?          

112
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,962
        -The Maui onion.        
             -Okay.             

113
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:02,768
    Which is a garlic aioli,    
       Maui sweet onions,       
     rosemary, truffle salt.    

114
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,971
           -I love it.          
        -This is gonna be       
     our garlic aioli base,     

115
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,840
      which is mayonnaise,      
   garlic and a hint of lemon.  

116
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:12,377
      We're gonna press out     
   one of our handmade doughs.  

117
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,847
        Our garlic aioli.       

118
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,382
  Little extra garlic for you.  

119
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,318
       Mozzarella cheese.       

120
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,386
       Maui sweet onions.       

121
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:24,389
          And then just         
      a touch of rosemary.      

122
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,058
    Ready to go in the oven.    

123
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,362
        Add a little bit        
        of truffle salt.        

124
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,397
        Maui sweet onion.       

125
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,165
              -Yes.             
           -Beautiful.          

126
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,233
          That's money.         

127
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,538
        -The rosemary...        
             -Yeah.             

128
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:40,939
        -On top of this.        
       -Isn't it dynamite?      

129
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,875
     -I just kind of wanted     
         a simple pizza.        
             -It is.            

130
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:47,545
        -Something light.       
       -Most importantly,       
     it's really in balance.    

131
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,347
         You've got not         
      too much of anything.     

132
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:53,218
     I mean, I remember this    
       from when we had it      
         six years ago.         

133
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,188
       What I like is that      
     you're not heavy handed    
     with your ingredients.     

134
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:01,960
     It's not supposed to be    
   the gooey cheese stretching  
      off into the sunset,      

135
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,495
  it's supposed to be a balance 
     between all the flavors    

136
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,164
        to where you can        
        taste everything.       

137
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,967
     -Balanced, delicious...    
            -Awesome.           

138
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,770
  I love the Maui sweet onion,  
      the crust is awesome.     

139
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,373
    It's a great white sauce    
      pizza, it's amazing.      

140
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,309
     It's crispy, it's fast,    
         it's delicious.        

141
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,312
   It's a Yahtzee every time.

146
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:31,256

     it is perfectly cooked.    

147
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:32,591
        <i> After home run.</i>

149

    <i> on the sand in Lahaina.</i>    

151

  The rig looks like it's been  
         rode hard, bro.        

152
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,838

  -How many years has it been,  
           six, five?           

153
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,109
 2016. My son was actually born 
     the day the show aired.    

154
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:55,847
 <i> Comes, helps me make pizzas,</i>  
   <i> helps me with the dough.</i>

      -That's really cool.      

156

       Kevin, local legend      
   of the pizza game out here.  

157
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,588
        He's got a great        
 personality, just a lot of fun 
          to be around,         

158
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:04,922
       it's a really nice       
         laidback vibe.         

159
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:08,259
   Driving by, you could smell  
    the kiawe wood fire oven,   

160
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,794
      I have to pull over,      
     I don't have a choice.     

161
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,330
      -Alright, what are we     
        gonna make next?        
        -Italian sausage.       

162
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,665
   -You guys are making almost  
    everything from scratch?    
              -Yes.             

163
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,000
        We're gonna make        
         some red sauce.        

164
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:17,468
     Go ahead, I'm standing     
        over here because       
      I'm in light blue...      

165
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:18,736
       You might get red.       

166
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,739
     I can already tell you     
   that tomato sauce is gonna   
          make a mess.          

167
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,607
      Our ground tomatoes,      

168
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,743
       granulated garlic,       
     one teaspoon of basil,     

169
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:27,612
     one teaspoon of thyme,     
     oregano, black pepper,     

170
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:31,016
   salt, teaspoon of cinnamon,  
  nutmeg, and then we're gonna  
          mix it here.          

171
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:34,753
      We made dough by hand     
      and now you're gonna      
     use an electric mixer?     

172
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,622
         Buddy, you just        
        don't make sense.       

173
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:40,158
      One cup of olive oil.     
        Give it a little        
         bit of flavor.         

174
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:45,630
          Tomato sauce,         
         ground sausage,        
       Maui sweet onions,       

175
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:49,434
       mushrooms and some       
         green peppers.         

176
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,570
       Mozzarella, Romano.      

177
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,940
      -Back into the oven.      
          -90 seconds.          

178
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,376
          There you go.         
      Fresh parmesan again.     

179
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,411
  A little bit of truffle salt. 

180
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,379
        Hear the crunch?        

181
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,652
     Look how thin that is.     
   Nice crust, a little char.   

182
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,387
        -Really nice job.       
           -Thank you.          

183
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,790
    Dynamite. I'm impressed.    

184
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:15,126
         -Any new plans?        
      -I have a plan to put     
       another pizza oven,      

185
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:18,663
      but we'll just put it     
    on the side here because    
       we're just so busy.      

186
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,465
        -It just cranks.        
          -It's unreal.         

187
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,133
  How many pies are we talking? 

188
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:26,404
  -Last night, I think, we made 
           156 pizzas.          
             -Whoa.             

189
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,874
     It's always busy here,     
       but after Triple-D       
         it gets crazy.         

190
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:33,945
   It definitely hit the mark,  
          great pizza,          
      I love the mushroom.      

191
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,680
     White cheddar mushroom     
          is delicious.         

192
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,283
  White cheddar mushroom pizza. 

193
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,352
        Get to stretching       
        some dough here.        

194
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,554
        Looking for a 10,       
         11 inch pizza.         

195
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,023
           And it has           
     the garlic aioli base,     

196
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,490
    this is just our garlic.    

197
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,828
 We're gonna do some mozzarella 
     cheese, white cheddar,     
         and mushrooms.         

198
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,865
   And it's gonna go into our   
        700-degree oven.        

199
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,502
         Slice them up,         
     add some truffle salt.     

200
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,570
  White cheddar mushroom pizza. 

201
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,773
    -White cheddar mushroom.    
     -I love it. Thank you.     

202
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:02,773
        -You're welcome.        
           -Beautiful.          

203
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,843
             -Enjoy.            
      -Look at that crust.      

204
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:10,248
    It is thin, it is crispy,   
     it is perfectly cooked.    
           Well done.           

205
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:11,383
           Delicious.           

206
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,520
     White cheddar mushroom     
    is actually my favorite.    

207
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,656
 When it comes out of the oven, 

208
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,660
          it's got that         
       thin crust crunch.       

209
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,060
          It's amazing.         

210
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,464
      Watch out. You're not     
       gonna look the same      
      in your bathing suit.     

211
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:27,532
   I've got to tell you, bro,   

212
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,934
   I am so... This is actually  
        a fantastic spot.       

213
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,871
 And I can see why you're doing 
     156 pizzas in a night.     

214
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,739
           -Thank you.          
     -Well deserved, buddy.     

215
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,008
         -This is money.        
        -You helped out,        
    thanks, I appreciate it.    

216
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,677
    -I think you need to get    
     yourself another oven.     
           -Yes, I do.          

217
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,247
 -And maybe get us a pizza box. 
             -Yeah.

     I love Gordy's shakes.     

223
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,300
      I mean, here's one of     
     the things I love about    
           this show.           

224
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:07,104
  It's finding the joints that  
  have been doing it old school 
        for generations.        

225
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:09,774
      So here we are, about     
        20 miles south of       
        Duluth, Minnesota       

226
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:13,778
      off Interstate 35 in      
  a lumber town called Cloquet. 

227
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:19,517
  These folks have been rocking 
   over 11 and a half million   
         burger patties         

228
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,586
   since they opened in 1960.   

229
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,254
     And with another decade    
        under their belt,       

230
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:26,391
      the third generation      
  has stepped up to the plate.  

231
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,659
       Hey, guys, how are       
         we doing today?        

232
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,461
 And here's the kicker, they're 
      only open six months      
        out of the year.        

233
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,031
     This is Gordy's Hi-Hat.    

234
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,534
       Three double cheese      
       and a Coney ready.       

235
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,936
      This is a great place     
    for Triple-D to come to.    

236
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,871
   I have to say, it's really   
     kind of my happy place.    

237
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:43,074
   I've got your three Coneys   
        and onion rings.        

238
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:46,811
    After watching Triple-D,    
    I made a point to come to   
         Gordy's Hi-Hat.        

239
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,680
      It's unique and it's      
         one of a kind.

 <i> their son Dan was in charge.</i>  

245
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,759
     When you thought about     
         starting this,         

246
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,162
   did you think it would turn  
           into this?           

247
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:08,099
     Never, especially when     
   Dan took over, he had more   
        ideas than I did,       

248
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,201
      my ideas were getting     
          a little old.         

249
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,440
        I've been coming        
    to Gordy's for 57 years.    

250
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,907
       We used to come up       
         here for lunch.        

251
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:20,845
 You could get a 19 cent burger 
      and 19 cent fries and     
          a dime coke.          

252
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,047
      What's the number one     
    selling item on the menu?   

253
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,650
      Double cheeseburgers      
   with Marilyn on the grill,   
             my mom.            

254
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,385
  The burgers are off the hook. 

255
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,722
   -I heard that you run this   
      better than anybody.      
             -I do.             

256
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:36,594
     I'm the oldest, fastest    
  fry cook in the United States 

257
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,997
    and a TV star, you know.    

258
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,999
     -How many times do you     
           flip them?           
      -Just a couple times.     

259
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,601
       I will put a bun on      
       as they want them,       

260
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,470
          if they don't         
          want mustard          
        or whatever else.       

261
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,871
    -What about those onions?   
      -Put some onions on.      

262
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,273
          -Do you like          
       your cheese melted?      
            -Please.            

263
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,475
   We always melt the cheese.   
      Couple of pickles...      

264
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:52,810
 It's all built right on there. 

265
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,812
    It's all built on there,    
         and then I just        
       put it on the bun.       

266
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,749
    Bun tops are toasted and    
  we put it into the container. 

267
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:01,086
       -This is the number      
           one seller?          
    -Number one best seller.    

268
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,086
     Look at all that juice.    

269
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,688
    When you think about the    
     all-American drive-in,     

270
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,223
    that's the kind of burger   
     they're talking about.     

271
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,758
         Can I help you?        

272
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,761
 My dad's 92, my mom's up there 
    too, and I won't tell you   
        what her age is,        

273
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,896
    but they're slowing down    
          a little bit.         

274
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:15,700
   You can't handle something   
     like this when you get     
          in your 90s.          

275
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:20,371
  Now I'm passing on to my son  
     Sever, who is ready for    
       another generation       

276
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,639
  of doing the same old thing.  

277
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,574
     My dad's been here for     
         his whole life         

278
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,744
      and I basically have      
       been here for mine.      

279
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,447
     Our double cheeseburger    
       has always been our      
       number one seller,       

280
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,517
       it's been a staple       
       for 60 plus years.       

281
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,652
       But the Coney dog's      
      a very close second.      

282
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,523
  Our dealership used to order  
    sometimes 50 or 60 Coneys   
     at a crack at Tuesdays.    

283
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,658
   -As in, a Coney Island dog?  
      -A Coney Island dog.      

284
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:44,662
    We're all the way up here   
    in Minnesota. How do you    
      know what a Coney is?     

285
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:47,065
 Gordy's makes the best Coneys, 
           believe me.          

286
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:50,401
      Coney dogs have been      
        on the menu since       
       we opened in 1960.       

287
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:51,669
   The recipe has not changed.  

288
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,671
        We make our sauce       
       in house every day.      

289
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,539
     We start here with some    
       choice ground beef,      

290
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,108
         we'll get this         
       on the grill here.       

291
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,545
       We'll mix in all of      
           our spices.          

292
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,347
       Chili powder, some       
          black pepper,         
          garlic salt,          

293
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,015
      onion powder, little      
         cayenne kicker,        

294
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,486
     I'll add a little water    
       on top just to help      
      mix these spices in,      

295
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,688
   put it in a pot to simmer.   

296
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,524
        We're gonna cook        
       some Coney wieners.      

297
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,560
  You've got a nice crispy coat 
          on them here.         

298
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,830
 Now our dogs are on the grill, 
   yellow mustard, wiener on,   

299
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,765
        hot Coney sauce,        
     freshly chopped onions,    

300
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:23,234
   and you're ready to serve.   
        Three Coneys up.        

301
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:27,505
     It's like a chili dog,     
   but it does not have beans.  

302
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,440
      A lot of ground beef.     
        They're the best.       

303
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:32,509
     The sauce that they put    
   on top of it is to die for.  

304
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:33,844
     Top it with the onions,    
         best there is.         

305
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:37,515
    The Coney dogs are great.   
     I love the onion rings.    

306
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,984
  -I do onion rings every day.  
       -It's a big onion.       

307
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:41,753
        You go after it.        

308
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,389
   The grease is at about 375.  

309
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,525
          We just serve         
        them with catsup.       

310
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,060
           -With what?          
            -Catsup.            

311
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,362
  I think that means "ketchup". 

312
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,465
      That's a really good      
           onion ring.          

313
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,067
              Mmm.              

314
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,468

          that Guy had?

00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,779
     make sure it's a rich,     
        creamy ice-cream.       

320
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,280
    Big, whole blackberries.    

321
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,315
     Put it in the blender.     

322
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,485
  With a little whipped cream.  

323
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:15,787
 Blackberry shake, ready to go. 

324
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,289
    Got three shakes for you.   
        You got it, bud?        

325
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,690
     I love Gordy's shakes.     

326
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,627
      It's nice and creamy.     
       And berries, yummy.      

327
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,894
     It always tastes fresh.    

328
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,763
     It's always, you know,     
      thick, tough to suck      
        through a straw.        

329
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:26,965
         Can't beat it.         

330
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,834
        [Guy]<i> But you're</i>        
      <i> not gonna find them</i>      
        <i> all year round.</i>        

331
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,403
   Why do you close six months  
        out of the year?        

332
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:33,371
    [Dan] It works, you know.   

333
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,972
       We've always said,       
         what's working         
        don't screw it up       

334
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,910
         and the novelty        
      of opening every year     
         is a big thing.        

335
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,779
       I'm usually trying       
        to get down here        
     as soon as they open up    

336
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:44,916
       and try to get here      
     as many times as I can     
 before they close in the fall. 

337
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:46,117
    What a great institution.   

338
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,785
       You guys have been       
   taking care of these folks   
        for a long time.        

339
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,119
           -Thank you.          
       -Nice to meet you.       

340
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:50,355
   -An honor to have you here.  
           -Thank you.          

341
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,726

      <i> in San Francisco...</i>      

342
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:58,862
     Wow. That pork has got     
        so much flavor...       

343
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,665
        <i> ...a food truck</i>

344
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,334
        It's a big meal,        
          but you won't         
        be disappointed.        

345
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,669
    <i> ...and planting roots.</i>     

346
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,737
     Not Asian, not Mexican.    

347
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:09,407
       -Just Senor Sisig.       
           -For sure.           

348
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:16,581
  So I'm here at San Francisco, 
      in the SoMa district,     

349
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:17,514
        South of Market,        

350
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,183
    to look for a food truck.   

351
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:22,520
  You never know where they're  
  gonna be, so you gotta check  
    'em out on their website.   

352
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:23,988
     Now, I hear these guys     
            are doing           

353
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,657
    a cross between Filipino    
   and Latin-American cuisine.  

354
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:30,795
  It's like a Filipino burrito  
    fusion spot, a taco truck   

355
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,597
  -that you gotta check it out. 
      -You make it so easy      
         to understand.         

356
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,667
     [Guy]<i> And after I track</i>    
    <i> this one down in 2013,</i>     

357

    <i> they exploded all over</i>     
         <i> the Bay area.</i>         

358

      This is Senor Sisig.      

359
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:46,811
    This is Pork Sisig Fries.   

360
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,813
   They have a cult following   
        in San Francisco,       

361
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51,349
          so everybody          
       knows Senor Sisig.       

362
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:52,183
   What does Sisig stand for?   

363
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:53,951
     I saw them, like, hey,     

364
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,421
  those guys were on<i> Triple D,</i>  
 that's actually well deserved. 

365
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,890
   It's flavor town for sure.   

366

       [Guy]<i> And the guys</i>

367

   <i> that would be Gil Payumo</i>    
       <i> and Evan Kidera.</i>        

368
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:09,500
        So whose idea was       
       this festivity here      
          of the truck?         

369
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,769
  I wanted to be on the streets 
        with mobile food,       

370
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,571
        came to my friend       
         who is a chef.         

371
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,772
         Had you worked         
     at a food truck before?    

372
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:15,773
               No.              

373
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,643
         -Had you driven        
      a food truck before?      
             -Never.            

374
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,845
    Having Guy come through,    
 you know, he's a Bay area guy, 

375
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,047
     so, you know, we kinda     
   just got along right away.   

376
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:23,847
        Good looking out.       

377
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:26,084
           -Right on.           
     -Take care of business.

  [Gil] Two pork Sisig Tacos... 

379
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,853
   What does Sisig stand for?   

380
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:31,789
     Sisig is a traditional     
         Filipino dish.         

381
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,392
    -Is this what you grew up   
   eating when you were a kid?  
             -Yeah.             

382
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,060
       Not everyone knows       
          what Sisig is         

383
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:39,430
      and I think that was      
      a good way to put us      
           on the map.          

384
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,799
      Give me the low down.     

385
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,401
  First, we're gonna start off  
     with the pork shoulder,    

386
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,936
 sliced up, quarter inch, thin. 

387
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,471
           We got some          
       soy sauce over here      

388
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,008
     and sugarcane vinegar,     
        pineapple juice.        

389
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,610
     Got our minced garlic,     
        some bay leaves,        
        some white sugar,       

390
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,680
        black pepper and        
        we got some salt.       

391
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,149
     Mix it up a little bit     
      and we're just gonna      
          cover it up.          

392
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,817
   [Guy] You let this marinate  
    and then how are we gonna   
            cook it?            

393
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:03,187
   [Gil] We're gonna basically  
 char grill it then we chop it. 

394
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,624
          There we go.          

395
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,626
       Now you're getting       
        taco truck on me.       

396
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,694
      We're gonna throw it      
        in the marinade.        

397
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,330
         That's gonna go        
        to the flat top?        

398
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:15,500
        [Gil] Sisig goes        
        on the tortillas,       

399
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:16,767
     diced onions on there,     

400
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,437
         iceberg lettuce        
      and cabbage mixture,      

401
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,705
      cilantro cream sauce,     

402
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,174
        a little jalapeno       
         and two limes.         

403
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,177
   [Guy] So you really did mix  
        the two cultures?       

404
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,045
           [Gil] Yeah.          

405
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:30,581
              Wow.              

406
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,351
        That pork has got       
         so much flavor.        

407
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:38,990
     -Salty, spicy goodness.    
          Nicely done.          
   -Yeah. Right on, my friend.  

408
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:40,925
      Two Pork Sisig Tacos.     

409
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,794
       Sisig is delicious       
     and you can get it done    
      many different ways.      

410
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,729
   The pork is the main seller  
      here people come for,     

411
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,599
     but there's variations     
     of protein or the meat     
       that you can have.       

412
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,601
 Here's your Pork Sisig Nachos. 

413
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,538
        It could be pork,       
      it could be chicken,      

414
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,740
   they can be made with tofu.  

415
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:56,607
         I have a Whole         
        Barnyard Burrito        

416
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,543
 and a Pork Sisig Cali-changas. 

417
00:17:58,545 --> 00:17:59,377
           Thank you.           

418
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,680
        I'm having their        
  Whole Barnyard Burrito today. 

419
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,682
     It has all four Sisigs.    

420
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:08,753
   Pork Sisig, Chicken Sisig,   
          Tocino, tofu.         

421
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:12,690
      So the Chicken Sisig      
         and Pork Sisig         
       are made the same.       

422
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,758
   Now, we're gonna start off   
      prepping our Tocino,      

423
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,827
        which is a sweet        
         Filipino pork.         

424
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,497
  First, we're gonna be making  
  our marinade pineapple juice. 

425
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,700
 We got some sugarcane vinegar, 
     granulated sugar, salt,    

426
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,902
       beet food coloring       
   and also red food coloring.  

427
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,704
       This helps identify      
    the Tocino that is sweet.   

428
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,440
    Now we're gonna be taking   
       the pork shoulders,      

429
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:30,841
       it's gonna marinate      
          over 48 hours         

430
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,277
     and it's ready to go on    
  the flat top and grill it up. 

431
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,583
       Now we're gonna be       
       sauteing our tofu,       

432
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:40,851
    throwing down the onions,   

433
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,853
           then we got          
     our chopped jalapenos,     

434
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,856
     some granulated garlic,    
   black pepper and some salt.  

435
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,726
     We're gonna saute this     
  for about two-three minutes.  

436
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,862
        Add my tofu with        
      a sweet chili glaze.      

437
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,665
    For our Barnyard Burrito,   
   fries right in the middle,   

438
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,734
   two ounces of each protein,  

439
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,536
   Pork Sisig, Chicken Sisig,   

440
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,539
   the Tocino, our Sisig tofu.  

441
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,541
      Next we're gonna take     
         our fried egg,         

442
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:06,410
        fresh jalapenos,        
     shredded cheese on top,    

443
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,880
     guacamole, sour cream,     
         Pico de Gallo.         

444
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,883
          There you go.         
     Your Barnyard Burrito.     

445
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,551
             I have             
    a Whole Barnyard burrito.   

446
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:18,222
     It is super flavorful,     
       it's very colorful.      

447
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,690
       You're gonna wanna       
       come back for more       
     every time you have it.    

448
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:22,493
       That Sisig flavor,       
       it's really tasty.       

449
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,895
      It's a well balanced      
    sort of savory and sweet.   

450
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,331
        It's a big meal,        
 but you won't be disappointed. 

451
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,570
      If you've earned it,      
      if you want something     
       a little heavier...      

452
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,172
      -If you've earned it.     
      -If you've earned it.     

453
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,840
      After<i> Triple D</i> aired,     
        you know, I mean,       

454
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,841
        we definitely got       
        a good response.        

455
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,509
    -You have two trucks now?   
          -Two trucks.          

456
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:40,711
           Two trucks?          
     How many you gonna get?    

457
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,713
        [Gil] We've grown       
         to five trucks         

458
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:44,782
        and we also have        
     two brick and mortars.     

459
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:47,218
    This has really just been   
    a dream come true for us.   

460
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,389
          [Evan] I got          
    a Chicken Crunch-a-Dilla.   

461
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:52,723
           I got you.           

462
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,725
         Whenever we see        
     the Senor Sisig truck,     

463
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,661
      it's usually a truck      
      that we hit up first.     

464
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:58,796
 The service is always the same 

465
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,831
    and they give the people    
         what they want.        

466
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,734
   [Gil] Adobo Buffalo Wings.   

467
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:06,804
      What can you describe     
  the spice as, the flavor as?  

468
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:07,804
       I couldn't nail it       
          as Filipino,          

469
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,740
      and I couldn't really     
       hit it as Mexican.       

470
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:12,610
    It's in its own category.   
            Infused.            

471
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,212
  Confused infused, I like it.  

472
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,081
      -Thank you very much.     
             Enjoy.             
           -Thank you.          

473
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,284
  Not too sweet, not too spicy. 

474
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,320
     Not Asian, not Mexican,    

475
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:25,489
        just Senor Sisig.       

476
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,691
   -Yeah. Right on, my friend.  
          -Nicely done.         

477
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:31,562
     Hot fudge shake, Coney,    
       double cheeseburger      
         and some fries.        

478
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,497
    Listen, there is nothing    
          I like better         

479
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:34,898
        than checking in        
       on<i> Triple D</i> chefs,       

480
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,435
     taking the opportunity     
      and running with it.      

481
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,635
         -There you go.         
             -Yeah.             

482
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,571
  Two tortillas on a flat top.  

483
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,707
       We'll catch up with      
     more faces and places,     

484
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,508
  next time on<i> Triple D Nation.</i> 

485
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,776
      What do you do during     
          the holidays?         

486
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,512
    -I sell Christmas trees.    
   -You sell Christmas trees.   

487
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,447
            On Maui.            

488
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,882
    How many Christmas trees    
     do you sell in a year?     

489
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:53,317
              480.              

490
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,319
  480. How many did you order?  

491
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,955
