  BAY LEAF, SAGE, FRESH.

               SEE THE PASTURE, 

145
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,640

     WHERE YOU MAKE THE CHEESE. 

146
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,907
      YOU KNOW,                 
I DON'T DO THAT YET.            

147

THROW SOME GARLIC IN THERE,     
 ADD SOME SALT AND PEPPER.      

148

152
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,121
     I LIKE THE LEMON COMPONENT.
     NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT ONE. 

153
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,123
             KIND OF LIKE WE'RE 
              DOING SOME FISH--

         TO DO BRUSSELS SPROUTS.

164
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:49,948

 SOME STEAM COMING OUT.         
                       WOW, MAN.

                YOU'RE GONNA    
             LET 'EM COOL DOWN. 

168
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,423
          IF SOMEONE ORDERS 'EM,
         HOW DO YOU PREPARE 'EM?
WE GOT A HOT PAN.               

169

               THAT'S ONE ORDER?
ONE ORDER.                      

170
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,560
THEN WE'RE GONNA THROW          
SOME BUTTER IN THERE,           

171
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,829
  GONNA THROW SOME BACON IN     
THERE--IN A LITTLE MORE BACON.  
                     YEAH, YEAH.

172
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,964
SALT AND PEPPER AND THEN        
 A LITTLE BIT OF STOCK.

00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,332
         A LITTLE CHICKEN STOCK?
YEAH.                           

174
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:08,767
                AND YOU MAKE    
            THAT STOCK YOURSELF?
YEAH.                           

175
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,635
ONCE THE BUBBLES ARE GETTING    
   A LITTLE BIGGER THERE,       

176
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,037
THEY'LL BE READY.               
                  WHAT WAS THAT?

177
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,238
  I'M LOOKING                   
AT THE BUBBLES,                 

178
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,973
  AND WHEN THEY START KIND OF-- 
        SEE HOW THEY'RE--       

179
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,808
          SO WE'RE NOT USING    
     THE BLOODHOUND ON THIS ONE?
NO.                             

180
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,310
                    WE'RE USING 
                  THE EAGLE EYE.
YEAH.                           

181
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:19,844
               IT'S NOT TIMING. 
               IT'S BUBBLE SIZE.

182
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,580
           JUST KNOW THY BUBBLE?
KNOW THE BUBBLE.                

183
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,048
       THAT'S A MEAL IN ITSELF. 

184
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:26,451
  DOES IT LOOK HOT? THAT'S NOT  
 A FOG MACHINE COMING OFF THERE.

185
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,119
                EXCELLENT, MAN. 
              THIS IS FOR PEOPLE

186
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,654
          THAT THINK THEY DON'T 
         LIKE BRUSSELS SPROUTS. 

187
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,790
         TENDER, BUT NOT SO DONE
            THAT IT'S MUSHY.    

188
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,658
            THAT IS GREAT.      
       THE BUBBLE METHOD WORKS. 

189
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,926
                   THEY'RE HOT.

HALF A CHICKEN.                 

194

    IT'S ONE OF THE BEST-KEPT   
      SECRETS IN SAN JOSE.

  THAT YOU ROASTED THE CHICKEN, 

299
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,662

329
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:28,720
            YOU WANT THAT JUICE.
 YOU WANT IT                    
TO BREAK DOWN                   

330
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,188

PRECOOKING THE ONION,           

331
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,056

                        EXACTLY.

           IT SEEMED LIKE A LOT,

340
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:56,214
         BUT WHEN YOU MIX IT UP,

IT IS.                          

341
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,615

              ROLL IT IN SOME

FOUR MINUTES EACH SIDE.         
 THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.          

350
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,969

           HONEY-ORANGE BUTTER, 

351
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:19,637

352
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:22,306
            PRE-SOFTENED BUTTER.

           WHICH IS REALLY NICE.

363
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,728
 THE NICE LITTLE TOUCH          
OF ADDING THE BUTTER...         

364
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,262

00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,416
 AND I HEAR THEY'RE KNOCKING OUT
   THE RHODE ISLAND FAVORITES,  

388
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:39,884
       LIKE CHOWDER             
     AND JOHNNYCAKES.           

389
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:42,887
     WE'RE HERE, KIDS,          
     LIBERTY ELM DINER.         
                     SWEET.     

390
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,889
      (woman) JOHNNYCAKES.      
    CHOWDER WILL BE RIGHT UP.   

391
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,090
     THEY HAVE JOHNNYCAKES.     

392
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:47,491
       AND THEY'RE A CROSS      
   BETWEEN PANCAKES AND GRITS.  

393
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,294
   IT'S A RHODE ISLAND THING.   

394
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,496
                 (woman)        
          BOWL OF CHOWDER, JUDY.
         (Guy) MY WIFE          
     IS FROM RHODE ISLAND,      

395
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,231
      AND WHEN YOU GROW UP      
        IN RHODE ISLAND,        

396
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,565
   YOU HAVE A LOT OF CHOWDER.   

397
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,367
       WHAT DO YOU THINK        
        OF THE CHOWDER?         
THE CHOWDER IS FABULOUS.        

398
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,369
 THE FOOD IS GREAT, AND IT'S GOT
  THE CLASSIC FEEL OF A DINER.  

399
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,039
 <i> THANKS TO CAROL DEFECIANI...</i>  
                 OKAY, WE GOT   
             TWO EGGS SCRAMBLED.

400
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,042
      <i> WHO HAD A PROBLEM.</i>       
 I WANTED TO HAVE BREAKFAST     
SOMEWHERE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.   

401
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,310
      SHORT STACK STARTED.      
AND THERE WAS NOPLACE.          

402
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,979
  <i> TILL CAROL FOUND THIS PLACE.</i> 

403
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,981
I KEPT DRIVING BY A DINER       
    THAT WAS CLOSED.            

404
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,116
       <i> SO SHE FIXED IT UP</i>      
   <i> AND STARTED SERVING UP...</i>   

405
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,919
        TABLE ONE IS UP.        
    <i> RHODE ISLAND CLASSICS.</i>     

406
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,988
                   WHO'S GOT    
                THE JOHNNYCAKES?
         JOHNNYCAKES--          
           VERY GOOD.           

407
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,724
JOHNNYCAKES COME FROM           
RHODE ISLAND, YOU SAY?          
                   THAT'S RIGHT.

408
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,392
YOU CAN PROVE IT?               
               "JOY OF COOKING."

409
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:22,727
 HELD TOGETHER                  
WITH DUCT TAPE.                 

410
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:25,797
 "RHODE ISLAND, THE CENTER OF   
THE MODERN JOHNNYCAKE UNIVERSE. 

411
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,197
"JOHNNYCAKES ARE USUALLY        
   EATEN AT BREAKFAST.          

412
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:29,000
       "USE ONLY                
STONE-GROUND CORNMEAL,          

413
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,802
  AND SERVE THE CAKES           
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE."        
                   WELL, THAT'S 
                 WHAT WE'VE GOT,

414
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,738
       STONE-GROUND CORNMEAL    
   RIGHT HERE FROM RHODE ISLAND.

415
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,340
          GONNA ADD THE SUGAR...
OKAY.                           

416
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,942
          A LITTLE BIT OF SALT. 
          GIVE IT A QUICK STIR. 

417
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,477
             SOME BOILING WATER.
RIGHT.                          

418
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,880
         AND IT'S GONNA THICKEN 
        JUST FROM THE HOT WATER.
LIKE GRITS.                     

419
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,213
                 YEP, IT DOES   
               LOOK LIKE GRITS. 

420
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,350
           SO NOW WE'VE GOT     
       A THICK CORNMEAL BATTER, 

421
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,351
              AND IT'S READY    
           TO GO ON THE FLATTOP.

422
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,020
                   THROW        
           A LITTLE BUTTER DOWN.
RIGHT.                          

423
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,022
WE GOT OUR BATTER               
   READY TO GO.                 
                   HOW MANY     
             COME WITH AN ORDER?

424
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,223
       THREE.                   
THEY'RE VERY FILLING.           

425
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,824
             SO YOU PUT A LITTLE
            CRUST ON BOTH SIDES?
YEP.                            

426
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,026
                        FLIP IT.
LET EACH SIDE COOK              
 FOR SIX MINUTES.               

427
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,963
           AND IT'S READY TO GO.
NOW WHAT DO YOU LIKE            
 TO EAT YOURS WITH?             

428
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,731
           I LIKE SYRUP ON MINE.
REALLY?                         

429
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,166
                            YEP.
I LIKE BACON FAT.               

430
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,168
       I'VE HEARD OF THAT, TOO, 
       BUT I'M GIVING IT TO YOU 

431
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,170
           WITH PURE MAPLE SYRUP
                AND BUTTER.     
WITH MAPLE SYRUP                
   AND BUTTER.                  

432
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,906
 IT LOOKS LIKE                  
A POLENTA CAKE.                 
                        IT DOES.

433
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,308
WHAT I HAVE TO DO               
   IS ASK LORI                  

434
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,309
WHY SHE NEVER TOLD ME           
    ABOUT THESE,                

435
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,045
    BECAUSE I'M GONNA BE        
JOHNNYCAKE-ING IT EVERY DAY.    

436
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,447
    I'M A HUGE CORNMEAL FAN.    
 IT'S CREAMY. IT'S GOT TEXTURE. 

437
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,384
                A LITTLE CHEWIER
                THAN A PANCAKE. 
I WAS GONNA SAY, I ENJOY IT     
    MORE THAN A PANCAKE.        

438
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,586
      HERE ARE YOUR JOHNNYCAKES.
IT HAS A LITTLE FRIED FLAVOR    
     TO IT--VERY GOOD.          

439
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:23,854
    WHAT DO YOU THINK           
     OF JOHNNYCAKES?            

440
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,924
    ARE THESE AS GOOD           
       AS NANA'S?               
         YEP, MAYBE BETTER.     

441
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,459
     (whispering)               
    DON'T SAY THAT.             

442
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:30,995
     (normal voice)             
SO WHAT GOES WITH THIS?         
    I'M GONNA SERVE IT WITH     
THE STATE DRINK OF RHODE ISLAND,

443
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,062
                   COFFEE MILK. 

444
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,932
              IT'S COFFEE SYRUP.
ICE-COLD MILK.                  

445
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,200
                  ICE-COLD MILK.
    THIS IS BEFORE              
THEY HAD FRAPPUCCINOS?          

446
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,602
          OH, YEAH, WAY BEFORE. 

447
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,138
IT TASTES LIKE                  
AN ICED LATTE.                  

448
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,540
DEEP, RICH COFFEE FLAVOR,       
 CREAMINESS OF THE MILK,        

449
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:43,540
THAT ALONG WITH                 
 JOHNNYCAKES.                   

450
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,609
  IF YOU MAKE THIS              
FOR A RHODE ISLANDER,           

451
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,678
THIS IS THE STAPLE?             
              THEY WILL LIKE IT.

452
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,547
             I GOTTA GO SEE     
         IF MY WIFE LIKES THIS. 

453
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,882
THAT IS MY FAVORITE. IT'S PRETTY
   MUCH WHAT I WAS RAISED ON.   

454
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,685
    BEFORE I EVEN HAD COFFEE,   
       I HAD COFFEE MILK.       

455
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,553
       LIKE A MELTED-DOWN       
       COFFEE MILK SHAKE.       

456
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,622
    YOU CAN MAKE IT AS SWEET    
   OR AS MILKY AS YOU LIKE IT.  

457
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,158
      THE FOOD'S FANTASTIC.     

458
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,092
   THEIR WHOLE MENU IS REALLY   
    UNIQUE AND REALLY GREAT.    

459
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,896
              (woman) THERE'S   
            YOUR LIBERTY BURGER.
 ROASTED VEGETABLE              
QUESADILLAS--GREAT.             

460
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,031
    (Carol) BLACK AND BLUE.     
GAZPACHO SOUP?                  

461
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,100
THIS DOESN'T REALLY SEEM        
EXACTLY LIKE DINER FOOD.        

462
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,701
                THIS IS WHAT    
             YOU COME HERE FOR. 

463
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,503
           THEY GOT A VEGAN MENU
              AND EVERYTHING.   
    (man) IT'S A GREAT MENU.    

464
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,705
   MOST OF IT'S LOCAL PRODUCE,  
          LOCAL GOODS.          

465
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:17,375
WE'RE TRYING TO SUPPORT         
     LOCAL FARMERS.             
 THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST DINERS
     I THINK THAT WE'VE SEEN,   

466
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,377
                  FARM TO TABLE.
         (Carol) HERE'S         
      A GREEK SALAD, "G."       

467
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,379
       <i> AND THIS ONE...</i>         
                (Carol) CHOWDER.

468
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,381
  <i> THAT'S COAST TO THE TABLE.</i>   
     WE'RE ONLY A FEW MILES     
        FROM THE WATERS         

469
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,182
  THE CLAMS WERE PULLED OUT OF. 

470
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,585
 MONSTER QUAHOGS. WHAT, IS THERE
  A CHEESEBURGER INSIDE OF THAT?
NO, NO, NO.                     

471
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,120
                 THESE ARE GONNA
                 GO FOR CHOWDER.
YEP.                            

472
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,322
WE'RE GONNA OPEN THESE UP.      
  WE'RE GONNA SHUCK 'EM.        

473
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,990
                         SHUCKS.
SHUCKS.                         

474
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,860
   LOOK AT YOU. I GAVE YOU      
THE TOUGHEST ONE IN THE BATCH.  
                    THERE WE GO.

475
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,461
YOU GOT IT.                     
                IT GAVE ME A BIT
                   OF A FIGHT.  

476
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,197
WE'RE GONNA THROW 'EM           
IN THE BOILING WATER.           

477
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,397
AND THERE THEY ARE.             

478
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,667
       WE'LL LET THESE COOK     
   A LITTLE BIT, NOT VERY LONG. 

479
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,869
OKAY, SO WHILE THAT'S GOING,    
   NOW WE'RE GONNA SAUTé?       

480
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,337
       WE'RE GONNA USE A LITTLE 
       OLIVE OIL, EXTRA VIRGIN. 

481
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,006
               AND WE'RE GONNA  
            THROW IN SOME ONIONS

482
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,942
                 AND GET THOSE  
               A LITTLE BROWNED.

483
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:53,745
          NOW WE'RE GONNA STRAIN
           OUR BROTH INTO HERE. 
      WIRE SIEVE,               
AS WELL AS CHEESECLOTH,         

484
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,879
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE LITTLE 
  BITS OF SAND AND SO FORTH,    

485
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,349
   AND WE DON'T WANT            
ANYTHING GOING THROUGH.         
                  JUST IN CASE  
                WE FIND A PEARL.

486
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:01,219
               NOW WE'VE GOT    
           SOME BROTH HAPPENING.
MMM, IT SMELLS GREAT.           

487
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,554
 SMELLS LIKE THE OCEAN. ADD SOME
   FRESH GROUND BLACK PEPPER,   

488
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,089
               A FEW BAY LEAVES,
                 FRESH THYME.   

489
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,757
             GONNA JUST LET THAT
             COOK A LITTLE BIT. 

490
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:07,891
                 NEXT WE'LL ADD 
                  THE POTATOES. 

491
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,961
          LET THESE COOK        
   UNTIL THE POTATOES GET SOFT. 

492
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:11,362
GET FORK TENDER?                
                            YEP.

493
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,564
 NOW WE'RE GONNA TAKE OUR CLAMS 
 THAT WE'VE COOKED AND STRAINED,

494
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,633
                DICE THEM       
        AND ADD THEM TO THE MIX.
OKAY.                           

495
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,768
               AND HERE WE GO.  
            GONNA ADD THE CREAM.

496
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:20,038
    WE'RE GONNA LET THAT COOK   
 FOR A WHILE, AND IT'LL THICKEN.

497
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,373
  PULL SOME OF THE STARCH OUT   
OF THE POTATOES--TIGHTEN IT UP. 
                            YEP.

498
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:25,643
SO HOW LONG ARE WE GONNA        
LET THIS COOK DOWN FOR?         
OH, WE'LL PROBABLY LET THIS COOK
   DOWN ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR.   

499
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,913
        LET ME SERVE YOU A BOWL.
WELL, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA
 PART WITH THE WHOLE POT OF IT, 

500
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:31,782
      SO YEAH,                  
A BOWL WOULD BE FINE.           

501
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:34,719
               THAT'S GREAT.    
          BIG RICH, DEEP FLAVOR.

502
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,387
        PICK UP SOME OF THE     
   HERBACEOUS-NESS OF THE THYME.

503
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,188
   POTATOES ARE NICE AND TENDER.
     CLAMS AREN'T OVERCOOKED.   

504
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,857
         WHEN YOU HAVE THAT MUCH
          CLAM GOING INTO IT--  

505
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:42,660
             THOSE BIG QUAHOGS--
             THE FLAVOR'S REAL. 
TAKE A QUART TO GO?             

506
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,595
                  I'D TAKE      
             MORE THAN A QUART. 

507
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,865
       ACTUALLY, I'LL TAKE THIS.
(laughing)                      

508

    (Carol) BOWL OF CHOWDER.    

509
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,935
     THE CHOWDER IS AWESOME.    
      NICE CHUNKY POTATOES.     

510
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,338
              FILLED WITH CLAMS.
         NOT TOO THICK          
      BUT NOT THIN EITHER.      

511
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,540
 IT'S ALWAYS TOUGH IN CALIFORNIA
TO MAKE LORI HAPPY WITH CHOWDER.

512
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,809
        THIS IS THE WAY         
        YOU REMEMBER IT?        
IT ABSOLUTELY IS.               

513
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:01,145
       IT'S A NICE MIXTURE      
     OF SOME LOCAL SPECIALS,    

514
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,080
     BUT TRADITIONAL THINGS     
  YOU MIGHT EXPECT AT A DINER.  

515
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:06,083
  <i> LIKE A TURKEY SANDWICH...</i>

      <i> WHEN WE COME BACK.</i>       

518

              TURKEY SANDWICHES.
   <i> FOR THE TURKEY SANDWICH.</i>    

525

526
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,944
   NICE FRESH BEEFSTEAK TOMATO  
 RIGHT OUT OF SOMEBODY'S GARDEN.

527
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,013
         AND PEA GREENS,        
   WHICH YOU DON'T SEE A LOT.   

528
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,548
   WE'RE GONNA                  
ROAST THE TURKEY,               

529
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,750
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA MAKE       
A NICE SANDWICH OUT OF IT.      
                      I LIKE IT.

530
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,819
  TAKE A LITTLE BUTTER.         
YOU WANT TO GET INTO IT?        

531
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:44,021
                 NO. I HAVE     
            A SUSPENDED LICENSE.
       DRIVING                  
WHILE BUTTERING TURKEYS         

532
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:46,090
DOESN'T GO OVER WELL            
   IN CALIFORNIA?               
                   EXPLAIN THAT.

533
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:48,626
I'M GONNA TRY TO GET SOME       
     UNDER THE SKIN.            
             WITHOUT PULLING IT 
           AND TEARING THE SKIN.

534
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,027
YEP. ADD A LITTLE PEPPER.       
                           OKAY.

535
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:51,829
      A LITTLE SALT.            
I'M GONNA RUB THAT AROUND,      

536
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,631
CRISP UP THE SKIN               
  A LITTLE BIT.                 
                         DIG IT.

537
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,766
     SOME FRESH THYME.          
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA CHOP IT.     
                  THAT'S THE WAY
                  TO GO WITH IT.

538
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,369
                   GREAT FLAVOR 
                   IN THE STEMS.
ADD SOME FRESH CILANTRO.        

539
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,371
       SO THAT'S ON TOP SO IT'LL
          COOK DOWN INTO IT.    

540
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,839
                     IN THE PAN?
YEP.                            

541
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,174
         POP IT IN THE OVEN AT--
325 FOR 2 1/2 HOURS.            

542
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,777
HERE'S OUR TURKEY.              
            OH. I LOVE THE HERBS
             UNDERNEATH THERE.  

543
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,313
WE'VE LET THIS COOL.            
               LETTING IT COOL  
              REALLY IS THE KEY.

544
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,182
FEEL LIKE CARVING?              
                   THE THEORY IS
                    YOU COME IN 

545
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,450
       AND YOU TAKE THE BREAST  
    ALL THE WAY OFF OF THE BONE.

546
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,986
           IT'LL PEEL RIGHT OFF 
                 BY HAND.       

547
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:16,854
       THEN YOU GET A SUPERCLEAN
            REMOVAL OF IT.      

548
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,990
     YOU JUST COME RIGHT IN HERE
      ON TOP OF THE BREASTBONE, 

549
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,791
              AND THEN PULL BACK
                 A LITTLE BIT.  

550
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,927
     SO NOW YOU SEE HOW IT ALL  
   CAME OFF REAL NICE AND CLEAN?
OH, BEAUTIFUL.                  

551
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,929
           SO WHEN YOU WANT     
       TO GO AHEAD AND SLICE IT,

552
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,864

             UNIFORM SLICES.

                   OH, GOOD,    
                NOT A FLIP-FLOP.

555

                 ON THIS THING. 

558
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,943
      IT'S A RHODE ISLAND THING.
           I FIGURED IT OUT.    

559
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,546
    BIG LOCAL TOMATOES,         
SOME NICE SLICES OF TURKEY.     

560
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,613
GET SOME HERBS IN THERE.        

561
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,148
SOME LOVELY LOCALLY GROWN       
    FRESH PEA GREENS.           

562
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,018

               AS IN GREEN PEAS?
YEP.

            SO THE LITTLE LEAVES
                 FROM THAT?     
MM-HMM.                         

564
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,222
     THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME
      I'VE EVER HAD PEA GREENS  

565
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:52,623
                 ON A SANDWICH. 

566
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,758
          PUT ANY MORE IN THERE,
           I'LL TURN INTO A COW.
NO, YOU WON'T.                  

567
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:57,294
AND WE'RE READY                 
 TO SLICE IT.                   
                   LOOK AT THAT.

568
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,763

              GOT GREAT FLAVOR. 

569
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:01,098
THE BREAD IS THE PERFECT CHOICE,
    CUT THE RIGHT THICKNESS.    

570
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,634
 THERE'S MOISTURE IN THE TOMATO,
 KIND OF MELTED INTO THE BREAD. 

571
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,436
           AND YOUR TURKEY--    
      YOU COOKED THIS ONE RIGHT.

572
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,172
     AND THE PEA GREENS--THE PEA
     GREENS MAKE THAT SANDWICH. 

573
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,441
        THOSE ARE GREAT.        
 IF YOU LIKE TURKEY SANDWICHES, 

574
