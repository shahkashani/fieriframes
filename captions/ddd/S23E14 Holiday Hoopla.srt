1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,135
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:06,137
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,873
          This trip...          
    Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!    

4
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,874
 ...we're celebrating Christmas 
         and Hanukkah...        

5
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:10,876
    Package deal.               

6
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:12,911
         ...with dishes         
       fit for a feast...       

7
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:14,813
Holy moly, that's good.         

8
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:17,750
       ...and Jewish delis      
  all about family tradition... 

9
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:19,485
               That's the key   
                right there.    

10
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:20,752
        ...in Nashville.        

11
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,087
            -Get out!           
            -Get out!           

12
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,889
      We've got heavyweight     
       holiday tamales...       

13
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,157
 This has got to be             
one of the best I've ever had.  

14
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:29,094
 ...and a sugar-glazed knockout 
     that will fire you up.     

15
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,762
Now you're cooking with gas!    

16
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,231
  Then from Florida to Cali...  
             Show me the goods. 

17
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,033
     ...there's matzo balls     
          and latkes...         

18
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,301
                There you go!   

19
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:37,702
    ...cabbage and knishes...   

20
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,970
            It's a delish knish.

21
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,572
      ...all totally legit.     

22
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,975
              The ones I've had 
         do not compare to that.

23
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:45,243
       Plus, in Alaska...       
You're gonna love this.         

24
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,645
      ...traditional turkey     
      with a sweet chaser.      

25
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,848
That is outstanding.            

26
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,050
          So get ready          
   to dig in to the season...   

27
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,284
You're not Santa, are you?      

28
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,254
      ...with this holiday      
          extravaganza.         

29
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,122
  That's the corner             
of delicious and juicy          

30
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:58,790
 right in the middle            
   of Flavortown.               

31
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,126
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

32
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,128
         on "Triple D."         

33
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,606
       Hey. I'm Guy Fieri,      
      north of the lower 48     

34
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,341
    in Alaska, in Fairbanks.    

35
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,277
  And if there's one thing I'll 
 go anywhere for, it's barbecue.

36
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,481
  So here we are -- Big Daddy's 
 Northernmost Southern Barbecue!

37
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:24,215
             HAROLD:            
    Full rack Arkansas ribs.    

38
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,484
   MAN: If you like barbecue,   

39
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:27,286
  this is where you want to be  
         for Christmas.         

40
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:28,353
     WOMAN: St. Louis ribs.     

41
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:29,888
      A little bit of south     
          in the north.         

42
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,289
      Brisket,                  
collard greens, okra.           

43
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,958
     Normal food                
up here in Fairbanks, Alaska?   

44
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,626
          No, it's not,         
   but at Big Daddy's, it is.   

45
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,094
             HAROLD:            
    Pulled pork sandwich up.    

46
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,962
  What do you think             
makes his barbecue so good?     

47
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,565
                   Harold.      
 Harold makes the barbecue good.

48
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:42,167
-That would be Harold Groetsema.
-How's everything going tonight?

49
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:43,969
Your friends call you           
     Big Daddy?                 
                  Yes, sir.     

50
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,838
      And for the holidays,     
 he's serving up some big birds.

51
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,373
  -We do whole smoked turkeys.  
            -Really?            

52
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,908
-People come and get them whole?
              -Yep.             

53
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,910
         The alternative        
    to the big roast turkey.    

54
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:53,645
             FIERI:             
  This one's brined and smoked. 

55
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:54,846
                When it comes   
              to holiday time,  

56
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,249
         brining turkeys, to me,
        is just one of the best.

57
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:58,584
             Give me the rundown
                 here, boss.    

58
00:01:58,586 --> 00:01:59,985
Some water in the pan here.     

59
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,453
    Okay, we got                
  the kosher salt.              

60
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,788
         -Got the sugar.        
          -Brown sugar.         

61
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,589
    Flame her up.               
Stir it till it dissolves.      

62
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,258
  Well, now we add              
the other ingredients.          

63
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,594
       We'll add some soy sauce,
       some apple cider vinegar.

64
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:10,662
Apple cider vinegar and barbecue
  go hand in hand.              

65
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,330
                Black pepper,   
             granulated garlic. 

66
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,399
               Some allspice,   
          and we got some honey.

67
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,668
        Okay.                   
That's still nice and hot.      

68
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,671
     Cool it down with some ice.
 And that should be good enough.

69
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,673
                 Get it down    
      to about 40 degrees or so.

70
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,141
    Come on over                
 to my house later.             

71
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,609
  We're gonna have              
 some turkey punch.             

72
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,411
                 [ Laughs ]     

73
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,480
         Get our brining bucket,
             pour this in there.

74
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,749
           We'll take our turkey
 by the legs, drop her in there.

75
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,151
Make sure it gets down          
in the cavity. You'll love this.

76
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,420
       Then we want to make sure
        it's covered completely.

77
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,888
     This guy's                 
 got all the tricks.            

78
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,556
             Put this in there, 
                cover it up.    

79
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,559
So this goes in the walk-in     
 for about 18 hours.            

80
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,828
            18 to 24 hours, yes.
So we're gonna make the dry rub.

81
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,963
            Yeah. Got the sugar,
             granulated garlic. 

82
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:46,431
        Got your mustard, chili.

83
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,566
 No cayenne on this?            

84
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,101
                 No cayenne.    
             Not that much heat.

85
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:51,036
  Got your paprika, brown sugar,
                black pepper.   

86
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,437
                 And we just    
            mix it all together.

87
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,640
          We sift it just to mix
  all the ingredients real good.

88
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:57,442
   -So you use this rub for...  
       -Just for poultry.       

89
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:00,245
         There's no salt, 'cause
      the brine had enough salt.

90
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,581
         Well, what I like to do
  is I like to separate the skin

91
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,483
                 so the skin    
     gets a little bit crispier.

92
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:05,783
The skin will dry out.          

93
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,986
The skin works as a natural     
barrier to keep the moisture in,

94
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,388
 and it's real hard             
  for that dry rub              

95
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,722
     to make it                 
 through that skin.             

96
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,491
          Take a little dry rub,
      give the meat some flavor.

97
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:13,859
                   I like       
         folding the wings over.

98
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,260
Just so they don't get          
   all burned off.              

99
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:16,728
               That, and it's   
             a good presentation

100
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,129
              when you pull it  
             out of the smoker. 

101
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,965
         Put a little olive oil,
         give it a nice massage.

102
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,933
  -Turkeys love good massages.  
         -Yes, they do.         

103
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,468
    Then I'll just sprinkle some
                   on top.      

104
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,537
Kind of creates a little wet rub
             with the olive oil.

105
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,072
             Pull the legs over,

106
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:29,540
  tie it up with a couple pieces
of rubber band. And there we go.

107
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,276
 Now we're gonna go             
hit her in the smoker.          

108
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,544
              -Yep.             
          -There we go.         

109
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,012
            -Got her?           
              -Ohh.             

110
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,480
     300 degrees                
for about two hours?            

111
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:36,548
          -You got her.         
           -All right.          

112
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,815
        -We ready to go?        
              -Yep.             

113
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,417
         -There you are.        
      -Oh, it smells great.     

114
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,086
 -What are we gonna do with it? 
            -Eat it.            

115
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,021
  Yeah, but I mean,             
do you give me a drumstick?     

116
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,689
              What to you want, 
          a little slice on top?

117
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,823
Give me what you got, man.      

118
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:49,227
  Look at how juicy             
   that turkey is.              

119
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,563
        Mmm.                    
    Oh, my gosh!                

120
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,598
That is outstanding.            

121
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,367
Not salty, not sweet.           

122
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:56,768
   Mmm. Fantastic.              

123
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,037
That's award-winning turkey     
right there. Mega flavor.       

124
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,573
        Then we make a sandwich.
       This is for the holidays.

125
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,842
    We're gonna start putting it
  on our menu as a regular item.

126
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,744
You seriously can't put         
any more turkey on that.        

127
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,512
          -Usually do.          
  -Don't let me get in the way. 

128
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,580
         -We stack her.         
             -Okay.             

129
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,515
 Look at that thing.            

130
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,783
      Mmm. Oh.                  

131
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,385
Holy moly, that's good!         

132
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,387
  That's the corner             
of delicious and juicy          

133
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,257
 right in the middle            
   of Flavortown.               

134
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,125
If that doesn't say holiday     
   in a sandwich,               

135
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:23,328
I don't know what does.         
You're not Santa, are you?      

136
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,465
          [<i> Twinkle!</i> ]          

137
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,933
Your sled is double parked.     

138
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,268
    -Smoked turkey sandwich.    
    -Really tender and juicy.   

139
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,403
The thing I think that jumps out
      is the smoke flavor.      

140
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,339
  The flavor is kind of soaked  
      all the way through.      

141
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,008
         -Look at that.         
    -Hey, you're telling me.    

142
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,409
I ate the whole turkey.         

143
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:40,411
I had Thanksgiving and Christmas
in the back all by myself.      

144
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,413
       The chicken and rib plate
              with baked beans. 

145
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,083
 MAN: It's kind of nice to come 
 and have some southern barbecue

146
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,152
-in the middle of a cold winter.
           -Coming up.          

147
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,421
   FIERI: From -- get this --   
    a Chicago south-sider...    

148
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:50,488
               Burnt ends up!   

149
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,290
   ...who didn't know a thing   
         about barbecue         

150
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,825
    until he moved to Alaska    

151
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,827
          and met a guy         
  who was running a smokehouse. 

152
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,895
                He taught me    
       the good smoked barbecue.

153
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:00,499
    Now I have a passion for it.
           It's just, I love it.

154
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,034
        -So do his fans.        
              -Mmm.             

155
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,568
        -Everything good?       
              -Yes.             

156
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,371
  FIERI: He won best brisket at 
 the state barbecue championship

157
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:07,706
      three years in a row.     

158
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,774
         It's everything        
 you could hope for in brisket. 

159
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:10,842
              Mmm.              

160
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,443
         Brisket can be         
      a great holiday meal.     

161
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:15,180
 FIERI: And Big Daddy's smoking 
    more than 10 tons a year.   

162
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:18,383
    I like using certified Angus
        beef when I do briskets.

163
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,518
                I don't trim    
 unless I'm doing a competition.

164
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,120
               I like to have   
               all the flavor,  

165
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,922
         as much flavor as I can
               out of the fat.  

166
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,658
Dry rub is the same as the one  
we just did for the turkey,     

167
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,860
  -but this has the salt in it. 
     -Salt added to it, yep.    

168
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,728
       We just flop her in there
               and just turn.   

169
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,798
 -Oh, we just -- We load it on. 
              -Wow!             

170
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,732
         -Looking good.         
    -I take it to the smoker.   

171
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,067
                Let's do it.    
                Look at that.   

172
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,268
HAROLD: Put it fat side up.     

173
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,471
        So it moisturizes itself
                as it cooks.    

174
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,006
           -How long?           
    -Between 12 and 14 hours.   

175
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,674
And one thing I learned         
   about barbecue               

176
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,875
is it's done when it's done.    

177
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,211
        Oh, I like that. Look at
    the bark on that. All right.

178
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:47,678
       -Looks good to me.       
          -Slice it up.         

179
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,415
    I'm gonna give you basically
 what we put in for competition.

180
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,884
Okay. Show it to me.            
I am a KCBS judge, by the way.  

181
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,285
      He knows                  
what I'm talking about,         

182
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,888
so he's gonna give me the best  
of his brisket right now.       

183
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,957
         Oh!                    
Juice just running out of that. 

184
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,294
Can I take a little look        
at that? Nice bark on that.     

185
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:04,229
    Don't want it               
to just fall apart in your hand,

186
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,764
but you should be able to just  
very lightly pull it apart.     

187
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,966
   Mmm. Way to go.              

188
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:10,702
    Light smoke.                
 Not overdone. Mmm.             

189
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,836
            Brisket's coming up.

190
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,905
      -I love the brisket.      
     -You love the brisket.     

191
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,707
   A little bit of fat on it.   
    That's the way I like it.   

192
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,108
   We got to talk               
 about dessert now.             

193
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,777
    -What do you got for me?    
     -Holiday bread pudding.    

194
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,645
                     Oh.        
          Probably the best yet.

195
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:21,846
       HAROLD:                  
We'll add some butter,          

196
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,714
start making the custard        
for the bread pudding.          

197
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,183
             -Okay.             
   -We'll add the heavy cream.  

198
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,918
             Dude, heavy cream? 

199
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,587
    -Sure that's not yogurt?    
-Cows up here need to keep warm.

200
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,856
    What, it just comes out like
    ice cream right off the bat?

201
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,726
Just let that heat up.          
Meantime, we're gonna add       

202
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,061
some ingredients over here      
to add to the custard.          

203
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,663
      -First, 24 egg yolks.     
              -Mmm.             

204
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:41,266
  And we'll add our brown sugar.
     And we'll add some vanilla.

205
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,467
  [ Whistles ] Wow.             

206
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,803
You can smell the vanilla       
coming right out of that.       

207
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,137
          Nutmeg, some cinnamon.

208
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,939
         -Minaminamin...

209
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,140
             -Sugar.            
        -'Cause we didn't       

210
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,743
have it handled with the 2 cups 
 of the brown sugar.            

211
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,011
             It's a sweet sauce.

212
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,746
      Then we're gonna temper it
               into our sauce.  

213
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,015
You whisk. I'll pour.           
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!     

214
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,549
       We're going. We're going.
                We're going.    

215
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,151
       And the last thing we add
               is the bourbon.  

216
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,487
French bread that you use       
here in the restaurant?         
                  Yes, sir.     

217
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,222
We got our tempered mixture     
   with our cream.              

218
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,357
                 Let it soak    
              for a little bit. 

219
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:07,092
    -That's a lot of liquid.    
        -A lot of bread.        

220
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,561
         Mix it up a little bit.
      Pour it into a 2-inch pan.

221
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,963
 Sprinkle some raisins in there.
               Add some pears.  

222
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,765
         Wrap it with Saran wrap
           and then foil on top.

223
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,368
And then foil. So you're really 
gonna lock in all the moisture. 

224
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,304
      Pop it in the oven for 325
   for about an hour and a half.

so it doesn't scorch.           

229
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,047
 Shut the heat off,             
and I'll add one egg at a time. 

230

335
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,245
            Mmm, this is killer.

336
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,114
               The matzo ball   
      is super light and tender,

337
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:50,314
       but it has great texture.

338
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,250
   -The flavor is outrageous.   
     -I'm glad you like it.     

339
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,318
         I don't even<i> feel</i> sick,
          I feel better already.

340
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,721
        Good.                   
     [ Laughs ]                 

341
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,589
        -Matzo ball soup.       
    -Matzo balls are perfect.   

342
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,724
     The broth is wonderful.    

343
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,659
          You just know         
   that it was made with care.  

344
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,261
Here's your corned beef         
   and egg salad.               

345
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,996
            The food            
    is absolutely tremendous.   

346
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,197
                Jumbo turkey.   

347
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,132
     -What makes it so good?    
      -It's made with love.     

348
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,801
    Chopped liver and egg salad.

349
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,069
          We love you.          
       We think about you.      

350
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,804
      Give Rho-Rho a kiss!      
          I missed you!         

351
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,872
        We just know you,       
  and we treat you like family. 

352
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,075
 FIERI: And it's been like that 
        for generations.        

353
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,743
         My grandmother         
       started a tradition      

354
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,211
    where we all have brunch    
           on Sunday.           

355
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,346
         -Every Sunday?         
         -Every Sunday.         

356
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,214
        When you can get        
     two of Bubbe's best...     

357
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,016
     -Brisket knishes here.     
      -...stuffed into one.     

358
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,351
       We have                  
such fabulous brisket,          

359
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,819
we decided to make a knish      
     out of it.                 

360
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,420
      -It's a delish knish.     
       -Hey, that's good.       

361
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,156
  Okay, so, give me the rundown.
             How we doing this? 

362
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,691
First of all, we're gonna       
take these briskets.            

363
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,058
                   Fat up       
            so as it cooks down,

364
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,828
        you render down the fat,
         moisturizes it. Got it?

365
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,029
        -Okay, first in?        
          -Carrots in.          

366
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,031
   -And just whole like that?   
        -Whole like that.       

367
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,833
  -Celery in, whole like that.  
        -Whole like that.       

368
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,634
Then we put these lovely        
peeled yellow onions in.        

369
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:44,902
               Thank goodness   
              we cut the onion. 

370
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,438
 At least someone cut the onion.
                    Now?        

371
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
  The pepper, garlic powder --  
             yummy.             

372
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,175
  -And then this an au jus mix. 
           -Beef base.          

373
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,711
        Yeah.                   
We just cover it with water.    

374
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,112
            Okay, so everybody's
                in the pool.    

375
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,514
It's really important to        
cover it really, really tight.  

376
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,517
So, this goes in the oven,      
  400, 5 1/2 hours.             

377
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,519
     Can you go                 
get the briskets out for me?    

378
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,120
            -Come on!           
            -I know!            

379
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,056
          -Be careful.          
              -Ooh.             

380
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,326
        Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
     Juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy.

381
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,861
      Perfect.                  

382
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,130
         -Thanks, dear.         
 -I better get a Hanukkah card. 

383
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:13,898
   Take this off.               
We're gonna put them over here. 

384
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,999
  We're gonna drain             
     this stuff,                

385
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,001
'cause we're gonna make         
a base for our kishka.          

386
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,003
 -Look at that. Smells awesome. 
          -That's good.         

387
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,671
Trim these, and then            
we're gonna make the mix        

388
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,140
for the meat knishes            
    out of that.                

389
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,074
       Don't you think we should
  pick at it and eat some first?

390
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,944
     Well, yeah.                

391
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,311
        Really nice beef flavor.

392
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,213
Cut this into pieces.           

393
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:29,947
                Now this all    
    goes to the buffalo chopper?

394
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,150
              Go. Nothing like  
          big kitchen equipment.

395
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,484
    That's about                
  the consistency.              

396
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,019
   Now we're gonna              
take this out of here.          

397
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,555
On goes the gloves, 'cause      
this gets kind of messy now.    

398
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,590
White pepper. Garlic.           
     Season-All.                

399
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,225
             -Eggs.             
 -A little chicken binder there.

400
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,628
Yep, sauteed onions. So, that   
gets all mixed up really good.  

401
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,097
                  And then,     
            these pastries here?

402
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,166
Put them here on the metal.     
Then we're gonna paint.         

403
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,501
This is just eggs and milk,     
 a little egg wash.             

404
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,504
Scoop it in, bring the ends up, 
      twist it,                 

405
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:54,706
smash it so it looks            
  about like that.              

406
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,507
     -Oh, wow. That smashed?    
    -More. Yeah, yeah, yeah.    

407
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,775
      Put this                  
on that cookie sheet.           

408
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,043
                A little bit    
           of the same egg wash,

409
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,045
              and we knock out  
               50 or 60 a day.  

410
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,447
                Bake them off   
               at, what, 350?   

411
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,983
    350 for about               
   35, 40 minutes.              

412
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,785
      -And that's a knish.      
              -Mmm!             

413
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,586
       -Smells good, huh?       
              -Mmm.             

414
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:09,720
         -That's great.         
             -Good.             

415
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,856
               Nice and flaky,  
          not overly salty. Mmm.

416
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,724
  -So, this is red horseradish. 
              -Mmm!             

417
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,526
  Good stuff, that              
red horseradish, huh?           

418
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,662
    Where have you been with the
 purple horseradish all my life?

419
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,197
   That is the bite right there,

420
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,265
          when you complement it
                with the two.   

421
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,601
               Mmm! Nice job.   

422
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:24,936
      Brisket knish is up.      

423
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,937
    Kind of like a croissant    
          on steroids.          

424
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,407
 -Just tastes like home cooking.
     -Roast beef coming up.     

425
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,142
        You walk in here.       
       You know everybody.      

426
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,544
  You've been eating this food  
  since you were a little kid.  

427
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,146
        -From Reubens...        
        -It's very tasty.       

428
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,815
      -...to potato latkes.     
       -Best in the world.      

429
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,817
 -And something called kishka...
      -There's the kishka.      

430
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,419
     -Kind of like stuffing.    
        -Never had this.        

431
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,554
   Almost tastes like a Jewish  
  meatloaf. It's just fabulous. 

432
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,423
      ...done Rhoda's way.      
         Okay, go to it.        

433
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,158
  Okay, you ready?              
We're gonna turn on my favorite.

434
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,893
              Buffalo chopper?  
                I love this.    

435
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,694
   Carrots whole.               
Get ready. You might cry.       

436
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,630
            -Onions.            
  -I've seen this movie before. 

437
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,698
  This has to grind             
for just a little bit, okay?    

438
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,234
Then we're gonna put in         
    white pepper,               

439
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,401
 poultry seasoning,             
      paprika,                  

440
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,103
     au jus mix,                
   garlic powder.               

441

    You guys are making over 200
         your-recipe items here.

667
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,117
    From scratch.               

668
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,252
       Like Romanian steak      
   with mushroom and onions...  

669
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:37,053
       -Good flavor to it.      
    -...braised lamb shank...   

670
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,256
        -It's delicious.        
      -...and this classic.     

671
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:40,858
 The stuffed cabbage            
   is outstanding.              

672
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,192
   Stuffed with beef and rice   

673
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,261
           and topped           
   with sweet and sour sauce.   

674
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:46,263
    I see the cast of characters
                are out here.   

675
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:48,132
             80/20 ground beef. 
     Some of the liquid chicken.

676
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:49,599
        -Sauteed onions.        
          -I like that.         

677
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,402
                It looks like   
     they're almost caramelized.

678
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:53,938
Yeah, they are. Knead this      
in here. Cooked rice.           

679
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,539
      Did a little chicken stock
                   in it?       
     Absolutely.                

680
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,274
   That's why I see a little bit
            of yellow coming in.

681
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:58,542
      Yes, sir.                 
    Brown sugar.                

682
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,611
     That's the one that I think
          surprises me the most.

683
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:01,878
   It's got to be               
   a little sweet.              

684
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,080
        Salt.                   
A little white pepper.          

685
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,281
               So we got this   
                all mixed up.   

686
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,617
We're gonna do our 4-ounce      
scoops, right across.           

687
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,219
    -So we're done with that.   
    -I'm done with that guy.    

688
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,022
    Now, tell me the story about
   what happened to the cabbage.

689
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:14,024
We actually stick it            
in the freezer for a day.       

690
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:15,292
Boil it after we freeze it.     

691
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:17,093
             Well, if you can't 
         get it tender that way,

692
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,762
             then there's no way
              to get it tender. 

693
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,031
   -We're gonna core this out.  
  -Look at that. Cabbage bling. 

694
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,100
I use the outer leaves          
to line the bottom of the pan   

695
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,701
 so it doesn't burn             
  when we cook it.              

696
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,971
         Lay a little base down.
      Now, what's cabbage sauce?

697
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:29,707
    Tomato puree,               
carrots, celery, onions,        

698
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,509
    brown sugar,                
  red wine vinegar,             

699
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:33,177
    lemon juice,                
  two fresh lemons.             

700
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,445
Gonna make a slurry.            

701
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:36,046
              With corn starch, 
             you tighten it up. 

702
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:38,248
All right. So what we do now    
  is we get a leaf.             

703
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,984
             -Over.             
     -Just like this. Over.     

704
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:41,585
             -Over.             
           -Tucked in.          

705
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,120
               Lay it down in.  
                There you go.   

706
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:46,390
Little bit more sauce on top.   
Cabbage, parchment paper.       

707
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:48,592
                Aluminum foil   
       so it keeps the steam in.

708
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,195
   We serve it up, and do we put
 a little cabbage sauce on that?

709
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:52,796
Cabbage sauce right on top.     

710
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,465
         -Are you okay?         
     -I'm starting to drool.    

711
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:56,800
  Looks good, huh?              

712
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:57,734
        Mmm.                    

713
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:58,802
             Pretty good flavor.

714
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,871
"Pretty good flavor"?           
    Great flavor.               

715
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,339
               So I like mine   
         with a little of lemon.

716
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,541
 Give it a little shot of lemon,
                  taste it.     

717
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,076

718
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,211
  Without question!             

719
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:08,946
You can't let it go out         
without lemon on it.            

720
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,480
                Just kind of    
         brings it all together.

721
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,749
    Package deal.               
Cool, man. Really nice.         

722
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,151
   That cabbage is fantastic.   

723
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,888
   It's like a sweet and sour   
     taste. Very, very good.    

724

            -Oh, boy.

       Have the stuffed cabbage.

It's quite a busy shop.

     from bagels to babkas.     

734
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:35,239
We make about 30 varieties      
     of cookies.                

735

       And only on Friday,      
    his famous potato knish.    

736
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:40,778
    It's flaky and delicious.

    the knishes.

 This is pre-boiled.

I'm gonna start chopping them   
into little sections.           

740
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,586
              And we're leaving 
                the skins on.   

741
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:50,253
Yes, that's very healthy.       

742
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,255
Add the onions to it.           

743
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,057
This is the white pepper,       
       garlic.                  

744

     Yeah, okay.                
And this is the salt.

                I heard you.    

747

Now, this is the butter.        
I'm not gonna put all of it in. 

748
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,868

    a little bit.               

749
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,736

             putting it all in.

   Mix it all up.

00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,187
    -So it gets a nice sheen.   
             -Right.            

778
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:59,256
             You put on egg wash
             like I paint fence.

779
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,325
    -It will go in the oven.    
     -For about 20 minutes.     

780
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,060
        We're gonna have trouble
              eating all those. 

781
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,594
              Is there a method 
             of eating it, or...

782
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,129
       Try it                   
with a little mustard.          

783
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,932
               Mmm. Delicious.  

784
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:09,399
      The phyllo dough is great.

785
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,667
            -Uh-huh.            
          -It's light.          

786
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,803
     The potato is nice and hot.
           You know what I like?

787
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14,672
           You left the skins on
             and you roasted it,

788
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,339
                so it kind of   
              gives some color. 

789
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,142
 Mmm. But you're right, buddy --
                the mustard.    

790
00:26:18,144 --> 00:26:19,677
                I haven't had   
              a lot of knishes, 

791
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,145
          but the one's I've had
         do not compare to that.

792
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,279
   Oh, thank you.               

793
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,349
        And the stuffing        
      is really excellent.      

794
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:26,884
    Nice. It's light, flaky.    

795
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:28,018
           Delicious.           

796
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,019
Meatloaf's in the window.       

797
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,754
        I've never, never       
         had a bad meal.        

798
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,289
       -The food is great.      
       -Good job, fellas.       

799
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,224
It's a big family operation,    
though. It really is.           

800
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:35,558
             FIERI:             
    And everybody knows you.    

801
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,494
    -We're Flakowitz people.    
        -We love it here!       

802
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:40,096
You did a very nice job on that.
Well, you did a good job.       

803
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,098
    I'm surprised               
that you did it very well.      

804
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,967
       -I figured it out.       
     -Pleasure meeting you.     

805
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,902
         You're a fantastic man.

806
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,170
    Coming up in Tennessee...   

807
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,239
    I don't even really know    
   what to say at this point.   

808
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:51,508
 ...when it comes to the hog... 
  It's pretty ham.              

809
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,176
...things are really heating up.

810
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,311
 I have far too much            
  hair-care product             

811
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,181
to be messing around            
with a torch like that.         

812
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:59,116
       And in Long Beach,       
          California...         

813
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,384
     John, boy,                 
you know how to cook.           

814
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:03,186
         ...a local cafe        
putting their stamp on stuffing.

815
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:04,121
       Whoa! Really good.       

816
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:12,463
     I'm in the great state     
         of Tennessee --        

817
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:13,663
      one of my favorites.      

818
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,866
              Why?              
   Well, home of Jack Daniels,  

819
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:18,736
       the Grand Ole Opry,      
    and some killer barbecue.   

820
00:27:18,738 --> 00:27:22,205
   Now, I'm in Hendersonville,  
 about 10 miles from Nashville, 

821
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,408
  on the corner of Center Point 
         and Main Street        

822
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,876
      to check out a joint      
  that's got a ton of character 

823
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,278
     and a bunch of stories.    

824
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,014
 This is Center Point Barbecue. 

825
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:36,953
       Brisket. Corn on the cob.
               Spicy red slaw.  

826
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,489
 The best barbecue in the south.

827
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:39,890
                Pulled pork.    

828
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:41,758
        This is authentic       
      as you're gonna get.      

829
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,760
 Everybody loves their barbecue.

830
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:46,029
   FIERI: 'Cause when it comes  
        to smoking meat,        

831
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:48,098
        owner Robert Duke       
      doesn't mess around.      

832
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,700
 You're the cleanest            
 pit master I know.             

833
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:52,569
     Well, I cleaned up for you.
        This is my Sunday best. 

834
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:55,706
      And the smell coming      
    from his three smoke pits   

835
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:58,908
 is like a come-and-get-it bell 
         for the locals.        

836
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,711
   Generally, I think you can   
   smell it about a mile away.  

837
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:04,381
   Just makes your taste buds   
   want to drop by and eat it.  

838
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:07,784
 FIERI: Whether it's a full rack
  of ribs, smoky beef brisket,  

839
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,786
  or one of Robert's down-home  
       family traditions.       

840
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,321
                Pulled pork.    

841
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:14,257
 This little restaurant's been  
 here since I was a little kid. 

842
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,727
 Some of my first memories here 
           with my dad          

843
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:17,861
  getting a barbecue sandwich.  

844
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,531
    I remember coming in here   
        as a little girl,       

845
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,398
         and it would be        
      wall-to-wall people.      

846
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,068
       FIERI:                   
Great barbecue, tons of history,

847
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,537
    but I got to                
 tell you something.            

848
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:29,139
There's one thing I have heard  
about Center Point Barbecue,    

849
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:33,076
and it is this sugar-glazed,    
  honey-smoked ham.             

850
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,878
          -Is it time?          
     -We're ready to do it.     

851
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,747
      -Bring on the brine.      
          -Let's do it.         

852
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:40,150
               We'll start off  
 with two gallons of water here.

853
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,484
                    Salt.       

854
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:43,353
                   Sugar.       

855
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:45,488
Equal parts salt and sugar.     
      Got you.                  

856
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,557
              Cloves. Cinnamon. 

857
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,691
 Cinnamon-amon-amon.            

858
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,560
Little pickling spice?          
             Just a little bit. 

859
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,163
                  And then      
             white clove honey. 

860
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:55,231
 White clove honey.             
  How do you know?              

861
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,967
     -Says it on the bottle.    
             -Okay.             

862
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,171
          We're gonna bring this
                 to a boil.     

863
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:02,305
Then let it cool down.          

864
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,574
         So, our ham trimmed up,
            going in the brine. 

865
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,042
How long are we gonna           
    let it brine?               

866
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,378
       We're gonna go four days.
    Four days                   
it's gonna brine? Nice.         

867
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,247
Does it go to the smoker?       
                Ready to go.    

868
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:13,250
           It's about six hours.
               225. That's it.  

869
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,520
  It's pretty ham.              
      Next up?                  

870
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:18,522
              Making the glaze. 
                Brown sugar.    

871
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:20,791
                   Cloves.      
                Black pepper.   

872
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:22,726
              Sugar. Cinnamon.  

873
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:23,994
             Mix that together. 

874
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:26,463
     Get the moisture out of it,
        put it in the shaker,   

875
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:29,032
             And we're ready to 
             glaze the ham then.
  Okay.                         

876
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:32,803
                 Ready, Guy?    

877
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:35,138
  Hang on a second.             

878
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,808
        Let's warm this thing up
                a little bit.   

879
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,810
 Now you're cooking             
      with gas!                 

880
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:42,279
        Sugar                   
in the ham seasoning.           

881
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,181
      This is the ham seasoning.

882
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:49,285
 I have far too much            
  hair-care product             

883
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,087
to be messing around            
with a torch like that.         

884
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,156
         [ Laughter ]           
        We got to let that rest.

885
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,825
   Oh, you think?!              
                           Yeah.

886
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:56,560
I don't even really know        
what to say at this point.      

887
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:58,228
I have seen some things         
     in my day.                 

888
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,831
 That one, I'm gonna

Well, actually, we don't put    
too much in it after, either.   

959
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:34,918
 What I normally do             
is I refrigerate it,            

960
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,319
then skim the grease            
      off of it                 

961
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,054
and add some red wine,

      -Little corn starch.      

963
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,791
Just let it come to a boil      
and see what happens.           

964
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,860
            Way more flavor than
        I anticipated. Now what?

965
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:46,463
We sauté apples and onions for  
the stuffing for the pork chop.

00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,398
   Start out with               
a little butter, oil, too.      

967
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,000
 Butter for flavor,

970
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:53,136
             Nice, firm texture.

971
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,271
  Salt and pepper,              
   and that's it.               

972
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:55,806
                  Take that     
     and mix that into the bread

      the stuffing and the chop.

                    Yep.        
      Start with some rye bread.

975

Now the sauteed apples          
and onions that we did.

             Dried cranberries. 

978

So, currently, you're not       
putting your currants in?

980
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,152
 A little cinnamon,             
   a little salt.               

981

          Black pepper, one egg,
                veggie stock.   

982
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:12,622
        Just mix it up just till
      it kind of comes together.

983
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:14,323
        -Okay, that's it.       
   -All right, grab the chop.   

984
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,959
             We're gonna lightly
             marinate the chops.

985
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:17,561
     Chopped garlic, some honey,
                black pepper,   

986
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:18,628
       a little salt, soy sauce.

987
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,163
 Some of my favorite            
  ingredients here.             

988
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,664
     -A little lemon juice.     
         -Little citrus.        

989
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,166
               Some olive oil   
          to dissolve the honey.

990
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,035
So, marinade is made.           
Tell me about the chops.        

991
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:26,302
               They're already  
               lightly brined.  

992
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,371
       -From your butcher?      
              -Yes.             

993
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:28,772
Okay, so we go ahead,           
     set 'em up.                

994
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:30,841
Good looking glaze there.       
How long will these marinate?   

995
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:31,975
             Two or three hours.

996
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,577
   And then we'll               
stuff them to order.            
                    Yes.        

997
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:35,778
I like it. Open wide.           
This one's ready to go, then.   

998
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,780
             -Yeah.             
         -Let's cook it.        

999
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:38,381
                 Olive oil.     
              I just brown it.  

1000
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,716
            -Dig it.            
        -Salt and pepper.       

1001
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:40,917
Once I think it's brown,        
      I flip it                 

1002
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:42,652
and then just go ahead          
and throw it in the oven.       

1003
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,187
          Finish it in the oven,
           seven, eight minutes.

1004
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,389
             And what will this 
               be served with?  

1005
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:46,722
              Mashed potatoes,  
              fresh vegetables, 

1006
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:47,791
                our beautiful   
               homemade gravy.  

1007
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:50,860
        -The magic gravy.       
           -All right.          

1008
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,196
Hmm. I tell you what,           
John, boy, you know how to cook.

1009
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,999
Chop is super tender.           
The stuffing is just --         

1010
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:58,668
That's all the rave. The apples 
and marinade on the outside     

1011
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,871
the garlic and the soy,         
  a little citrus.              

1012
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:02,739
 -You tie it all together, man. 
           -Thank you.          

1013
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:04,541
           -Way to go.          
  -Mm-hmm. Thank you very much. 

1014
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,676
      Nice job.                 
[ Chuckles ] Really good.       

1015
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:07,877
             Pork chop for you. 

1016
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,479
  I have never had a pork chop  

1017
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,948
    that was any more tender    
      and juicy and moist.      

1018
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,283
  The gravy is wonderful, too.  

1019
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:14,417
        It is delicious.        

1020
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,486
 Moist, tender, very flavorful. 

1021
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:18,754
            -Perfect.           
  -This is great. I love this.

1027
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,366
      Pricing is important,     
   but even if it were more --  

1028
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:31,768
             Oh, no!            
       I was gonna say --       

1029
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,836
Even it was more expensive?     
          [ Laughter ]          

1030
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,172
    Don't worry.

    -No, I did not say that.    

1032
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:38,909
        Did not say that.

         of the East...

    So, I'm here in beautiful   
   San Francisco, California.   

1041
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:04,134
      Now, you've heard of      
    Fisherman's Wharf, right?   

1042
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:06,069
           Okay, good,          
  'cause we're not going there. 

1043
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:08,538

   a mile south on Polk Street  

1044
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,274
  to exactly what you'd expect  
    to find here in San Fran,   

1045
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,676
       an East Coast deli.      

1046

        This is Miller's.       

1047
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:19,683
       I love                   
the corned-beef sandwich.       

1048
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:22,552
        Get in on that. Come on.
              Release the jaw.  

1049
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:23,954
  Best pastrami I've ever had.  

1050
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:25,755
          Big sandwich.         
   Like, bigger than my face.   

1051
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:27,691
  I want to see a Guy Fieri bite
               on this thing.   

1052
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:28,758
                There you go!   

1053
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:32,162

       a pastrami Philly?

      a Baltimore bloodline     

1057

     or blintzes and bagels.    

1058
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:42,638
   My grandparents              
were kosher caterers.           

1059
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,707
  All of my cousins             
     have delis.                

1060
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:48,778

       this place in 2001,      

1061

 his very loving mom handed over
     all the family recipes,

00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:54,917
 including this deli classic... 

1063
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,654
I got the chicken-noodle soup   
  with matzo balls.             

1064
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,856
...that's been in Robby's family
        for generations.        

1065
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,591
       The matzo-ball soup      
          is delicious.         

1066
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:03,927
                Matzo balls.    

1067
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:05,528
             Do you have license
               to matzo ball?   

1068
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,330
 I got a grandmother            
    and a mother.               

1069
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,732
                    Okay.       
God rest them.                  

1070
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:09,999
    Rose and Rae                
  made matzo balls.             

1071
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,668
                Rose and Rae.   
      Fire up the chicken stock.

1072
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,604
A little bit of olive oil.      

1073
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:19,542
Some mirepoix -- a couple       
of big onions, celery, carrots. 

1074
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:20,877
A couple of big chickens.       

1075
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:23,346
  Those are big. Those look like
         San Francisco pigeons. 

1076
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:26,216
A big thing of parsley.         

1077

                [ Whistles ]    

1078
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,285
      A fistful                 
   of peppercorns.              

1079
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,753
             And some bay leaf. 

1080
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,156
   A lot of water.              

1081
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:35,158
                 All right,     
      how long is this gonna go?

1082
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,694
   Come to a boil,              
bring it down to a simmer --    

1083
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:38,694
  about 90 minutes.             

1084
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,497
                 Strain it,     
             shred the chicken, 

1085
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,166
       and while that's working,
              we're going to -- 

1086
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:44,434
Make some matzo balls.          

1087
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:47,170
Matzo meal, some salt,          

1088
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:49,105
    a little bit                
of white ground pepper.         

1089
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:51,507
You want to mix that up         
     real good.                 

1090
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,843
 That's all the dry.            
Now you got all the wet.        

1091
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:56,379
So, for each cup of matzo meal, 
 you got four eggs.             

1092
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,248
     1/4 cup of                 
  schmaltz per cup.             

1093
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,117
         So, what's the schmaltz
                 all about?     

1094
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,919
Schmaltz is flavored            
    chicken fat.                

1095
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:05,789
    You're gonna                
 mix that together.             

1096
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:06,823
  So, all the wet.              

1097
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:12,796
                Look at this.   

1098
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:14,731
           That's all she wrote.
            So we let this set. 

1099
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,599
      Then, after it forms up --

1100
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,801
  Just gonna take,              
 you know, an inch.             

1101
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,738
                And how long    
               will they cook?  

1102
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,275
 They're gonna cook             
 about 45 minutes.              

1103
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:27,877
A little bit of schmaltz.       

1104
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:33,015
Some mirepoix -- onions,        
some carrots, some celery.      

1105
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,218
  They're all nice              
  and sweated out.              

1106
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,420
  We're gonna throw             
the chicken stock on top        

1107
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:40,489
and then let it cook down       
for about 30 minutes or so.     

1108
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:41,891
         Now that's cooked down.
                  Now what?     

1109
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,959
  Now we add fresh,             
  shredded chicken              

1110
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:47,297
   from the stock               
and then the matzo balls.       

1111
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:51,367
And then we get a little bit    
of cooked egg noodles.
