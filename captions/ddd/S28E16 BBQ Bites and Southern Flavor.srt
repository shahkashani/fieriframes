6

        We're grabbing a        
       bite of barbecue...      

7

        Southern flavors.

   Mmm, mmm, mmm.               

10
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:18,817
  That means hearty home style

11
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,585

44
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:38,330

             shuttle fuel tank? 

45
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,299
No, it's an old thousand-gallon 
    propane tank.               

46
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,767

55
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,587
     FIERI: And custom made.    

56
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:03,522
We call it saw dust, it's       
more of a Kansas City rep.

58
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,326
So, we've got granulated garlic,
  granulated onion,             

59
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,928
cayenne powder, chili powder.   

60
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,996
 We've got paprika,             
brown sugar, black pepper.      

61
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:12,931
             Coarse grind, okay.

62
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,065
Then we've got kosher salt.     

63
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,600
     All right, I see some ribs.

64
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:16,802
                 And this is    
              a St. Louis cut.  

65
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:17,936
       It means they clean it up

66
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,238
         to make it a little bit
                more uniform.   

67
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,739
             Are you gonna peel 
              the silver skin?  

68
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,074
    That membrane on the inside.

69
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:23,141
I usually just score it.        

70
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,277
    I've started to leave it on.

71
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,479
It holds the rib together       
better when it's more tender.   

72
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:31,083
         All right, this goes on
      in this 375 degree smoker.

73
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:33,018
Once it gets that good,         
dark mahogany color,            

74
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,419
after about two and a half      
   to three hours,              

75
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,554
add a little bit of spritz      
of apple juice into it,         

76
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,290
and just a touch of sauce.      
                           Okay.

77
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:40,626
Then we put it back on for      
about an hour and a half.       

78
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,294
 It's about a five,             
five and a half hour rib.       

79
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,695
          Oh, this I got to try.

80
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:44,896
               Now we're into   
               barbecue sauce.  

81
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,232
Start off with ketchup,         
   yellow mustard,              

82
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,167
apple cider vinegar,            
Worcestershire sauce.           

83
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,302
             Washersister sauce.
             [Worcestershire]   

84
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:53,038
 Molasses, kind of a            
 deep, darker sweet.            

85
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,573
Louisiana hot sauce,            
    chili powder,               

86
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,574
   cayenne pepper,              
 granulated garlic,             

87
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,511
  granulated onion,             
brown sugar, kosher salt,       

88
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,712
    black pepper,               

89
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,681
and then from there,            
let it simmer about an hour.    

90
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,885
                Foil capital    
             of the world here.

92

93
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,424
              Juicy, nice bark. 

94
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:15,861

   nice big smoke ring in there.

97
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,799
              Wow. When you get 
               a lot of folks   

98
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,135

              from the Midwest, 

99
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:24,670

                 the bread?     

100
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:27,272
 The Midwest purists            
definitely appreciate it.       

101
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:28,807
 It's like an edible            
   napkin, right?               

102
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:29,808
             Mm-hmm. Delicious. 

103
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,543
             Sauce is fantastic.

104
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,544
                 Well done.     

105
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,145
     SERVER: Ribs and beans.    

106
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,681
     It falls off the bone,     
   but it doesn't fall apart.   
                     That's key.

107
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,283
        Taste the smoke,        
     you can taste the wood.    

108
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,619
Especially the hickory wood that
 he trucks in here from Kansas. 

109
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,887
    FIERI: Which he's mixing    
    with post oak from Texas.   

110
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,823
            You're stick burning

111
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,825
            you are consistently
              running this with 

112
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,227
               the fluctuating  
         temperature of Seattle.

113
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,894
   And no gauges.               
                         Really?

114
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:50,829
     They have mastered it.     

115
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,297
     Three briskets all day.    

116
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,966
 Any BBQ place I go to, I always
    judge it by the brisket.    

117
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,768

    brisket next.

Get rid of the deckle,          
 the big hard fats.             

120
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,506
Then there's also some real     
silky fat surrounding it.       

121
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:02,641
                          Right.
I want to keep that fat.        

122
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,176

It's a coarse ground            
black pepper, kosher salt.      
                Lay it on heavy.

           go in the smoker for?
11 to 12 hours.

you pull the briskets off,

Wrap them in butcher paper,     
 then put them back

00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,758
on the smoker until they        
reach around 205 degrees.

00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,489
   He owns this down-home spot  
         with his family        

235
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:38,689
          who helps out         
      at the restaurant...      

236
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:39,557
                Good morning.   

237
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,826
  ...and with the inspiration.  

238
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:44,195
It's food that I learned from   
my grandmother's and my mom.    

239
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,231
                You were born   
              and raised here?  
   Yes.                         

240
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,766
So, the whole premise was,      
make North Carolina shine.      

241
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,502
 Use the purveyors,             
    the farmers.                

242
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,772
And that local flavor stands out
   in this pumped-up classic.   

243
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,709
        The Dirty South Biscuit.

244
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,644
        The sausage gravy       
       just reeled me in.       

245
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,315
   Add the bacon, the chicken,  
          it's perfect.         

246
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,049
          Tell me about biscuits
             in North Carolina. 

247
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,251
               I mean, I think  
             that's what you get

248
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,852
             judged by in life, 
                  isn't it?     

249
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,587
            Like, can you make a
            good biscuit or not.

250
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,389
   We like to use               
really good buttermilk.         

251
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:14,325
Flour mixed with baking powder, 
 some butter flakes.            

252
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,327
We try to put a little bit      
more shortening in ours         

253
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,795
to make them a little bit       
    more tender.                

254
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,397
              'Cause you're not 
         necessarily the doctor?

255
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,799
Right, I'm the chef.            

256
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,466
   Powdered sugar               
 and baking powder.             

257
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,868
             Together again for 
               the first time.  

258
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,937
Little iodized salt,            
  work that by hand             

259
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,206
until we get the dough          
to the proper consistency.      

260
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,474
                    Okay.       

261
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:30,542
 Roll them out next.            

262
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:31,610
   You don't want               
   to overwork it,              

263
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,612
 and if there's some            
cracks, that's okay.            

264
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,613
           No one said it had to
            be a pretty biscuit.

265
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,215
    Throw them in               
 a 335 degree oven.             

266
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,286
                  Not 340?      
Not 340, 335,                   

267
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:42,687
for about 18 minutes.           

268
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,556
Now we're gonna make            
our country sausage.            

269
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:45,757
         Let's start this party.

270
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,492
 Lot of kosher salt,            
  red pepper flake,             

271
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,495
onion powder, dried sage.       

272
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,697
              Sage and sausage. 
             Isn't that a band? 

273
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,898
              Sage and sausage? 
It should be.                   

274
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,102
Coarse black pepper,            
fresh sage, white pepper.       

275
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,102
      And then the kitchen sink.

276
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,571
Fresh rosemary and thyme.       

277
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:00,972
     The country sausage's done.

278
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,974
We're making the gravy.         
Got a little oil blend.         

279
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:03,908
            What was that again?

280
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,976
        Ole.                    
                        Ole.    

281
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,444
 That's how they say            
  it in the South.              

282
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:10,248
Whole butter, onions, chorizo,  
our country sausage mix.        

283
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,516
                [ Whistles ]    

284
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:14,252
Hit it with cayenne,            
 sage, heavy cream.             

285
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,387
And then we're gonna add        
our thickening agent,           

286
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,455
some culinary cream.            

287
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:18,924
      It's got                  
some emulsifier in it.          

288
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:19,924
     Whole milk.

             the gym next door. 

290

I have a man cave in there      
for them too, to relax.         

291
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,663
                There you go,   
             just keep it going.

292

                 then a B&B.    

293
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,999
We're gonna let it simmer,      
   and then we're               

294
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,001
gonna add some green onion,     
    black pepper,               

295
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,803
kosher salt, dried sage.        

296
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,672
      Did we think about putting
          any sage in this dish?

297
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:34,805
I've got a lot of sage.         

298
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,007
                Sage advice.    

299
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,942
We're gonna let it simmer       
for about 30 minutes.           

300
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,144
         Next up, fried chicken.

301
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:40,545
 We're gonna go with            
 some North Carolina            

302
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:43,481
buttermilk, hot sauce,          
and then salt and pepper.       

303
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,750
Whisk that up, then we          
put our chicken in there.       

304
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,685
            That goes for a day.
           Now what are we gonna
               bread this in?   

305
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,887

coarse ground pepper,           

306
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,223

a little garlic powder.         

307
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,291

  After it's fried,             

309
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,761
we're gonna put a piece of      
pepper jack and Muenster cheese,

310
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,630
and put it in the broiler       
for about 30 seconds.           

311
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:00,432
       Where's that cheese from?

00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,909
           they just get to have
        an extra scoop of gravy?

317
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,110
        Yup.

              No, people don't  
             really pick it up. 

320

  And then a little             
  kitchen bouquet.              

579
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:53,030
               You already know.
Come on now.                    

580
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,032
           I'll let these go two
             hours, medium heat,

581
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,501
          and then they'll taste
           like a million bucks.

582
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58,636
Okay, now what are we           
gonna serve them with?          
                 Collard greens.

583
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,971
Okay, do you know that my       
middle name is collard green?   

584
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,439
It's not, but it should be.     

585
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,908
 When they're good,             
they're really good,            

586
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,709
and when they're bad,           
I'll still eat them.            

587
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,445
        We add our smoked turkey
                to the water.   

588
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,246
               You let it boil  
           for about 30 minutes.

589
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,515
 So, the greens have            
  been cleaned off,             

590
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,449
  those all go in.              
You got a lot going in there.   

591
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,851
               Gonna put that   
             salt in here, Guy. 

592
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:16,120
          Black pepper, cayenne,

593
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:17,788
             granulated garlic, 
             smoke flavor base. 

594
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,923
    There you go.               

595
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:21,992
         Red peppers, sugar, put
          those onions in there,

596
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,728
   a bell pepper, pan-fried oil.

597
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,197
   Green vegetables can be dull.

598
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,198
  That's giving it              
   a little sheen.              

599
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,666
             Add a little flavor
                 to it, too.    

600
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,401
    These are gonna cook for two
     hours, till they're tender.

601
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:31,936
 And it's gonna get             
dangerous right now.            

602
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,137
          It's about to go down.

603
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,338
        Got beans and rice, Guy.

604
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,872
                  Ox tails.     

605
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,608
And the greens?                 
       Oh, those collard greens.

606
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,111
  Oh, look at that.             

607
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,549
        So...                   

608
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,817
             That's how you eat 
                 an ox tail.    

609
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,018
You got to get it all.          

610
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,886
                 You really     
            like those ox tails.

611
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:53,023
Well, you're cooking them       
     just right.                

612
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,893
The flavor and the depth        
   and the texture              

613
00:19:55,895 --> 00:20:00,097
and the unctuous fat and all    
that you get from that ox tail, 

614
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:02,433
 you can't get that             
    out of state.               

615
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:03,434
              Greens are good?  

616
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:04,435
        Good?                   

617
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:07,171
    You guys are                
fantastic ambassadors

621
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,912
I'm a big fan of ox tails,      

622
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,114
 and these remind me            
 of my grandmother.

00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,583
             WOMAN:             
   I love the collard greens.   

624
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:21,986
  You can taste the onions and  
 the smoked meat that's inside. 

625
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:23,054
         It's delicious.

  Breaded pork chop, dinner up. 

627
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,458
             You have to eat it 
               to believe it.   

628
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,260
 That should be the             
tagline of the restaurant.      

629
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:30,761
 "You got to eat it

      Nice job.

     Watch out.

      So, was this a great
