232
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,560
       that when Tal Caspi

243
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,579
        and then they add       
 that tahini sauce on the side. 

244

     It's nice and garlicky

252

    Yes. I'll have one of those.

                      Okay.     
Which is from Aleppo in Syria.

00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,875
Exactly. That gives it          
the fishy flavor. Urfa biber.

    No clue what that is, folks.

 from Turkey. Salt.

             pepper from turkey.

 We're going to mix
