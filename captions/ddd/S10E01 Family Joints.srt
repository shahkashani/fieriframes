    THAT'S ABOUT IT.

           OH, YEAH. SO WE JUST 
          WRAP IT AROUND, PINCH.
YOU DON'T WANT IT               
     TO OPEN                    

317
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,284
     IN THE MIDDLE              
OF THE BOILING PROCESS.         
                   THAT'S RIGHT.

318
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,486
KEEP 'EM ON THE FLOUR TRAY      
 SO THEY ABSORB THE FLOUR       

319
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,555
SO THEY DON'T GET ALL WET       
   FROM THE MOISTURE.           

320
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,224
IF THERE'S TOO MUCH MOISTURE    
      IN THAT FILLING,          

321
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:42,560
THEY'LL START                   
TO FALL APART.                  
   YOU GOT IT. GET 'EM ALL MADE,
        AND WE BOIL 'EM UP.     

322
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:43,828
ALL RIGHT, SO, UH...            
               THEY'RE FLOATING.

323
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,430

         GET SOME BUTTER ON IT. 

329
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,775

POTATO CHEESE HERE,             

331
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,846

       AND SAUERKRAUT.          

332

THERE, THERE.

        MMM. THAT'S SAUERKRAUT. 

336
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,656

        GARLIC BITE IN THERE.   

338
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,927
      THE TEXTURE OF THE MEAT-- 
     IT'S LIKE A POLISH RAVIOLI.

339
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,597
                      I LIKE IT.
    POTATO CHEESE.              
THOSE ARE MY FAVORITE.

LORI WOULD NOT BE HAPPY         
      ABOUT THIS.               

377
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,864
YOU WANT TO GET IN THERE AND SEE
   HOW BIG THE MIXER IS FIRST?  

378
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:02,800
(as Darth Vader) LUKE,          
I'LL MAKE YOUR SAUSAGE.         

379
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,802
            ALL RIGHT, YOU DONE?
(normal voice) YEAH.            

380
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,938

    LINE OF ALL TIME.

00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,675
 WHAT WAS THAT                  
WE JUST PUT IN?                 
              THE PORK FAT BASE.

382
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:13,344
WHAT ARE WE MAKING--            

383
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,879
              WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?
THAT'S IT.                      

384
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,747
            WE'LL START WITH    
         A LITTLE BIT OF SUGAR, 

385
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,550
           A LITTLE BIT OF SALT.
RIGHT IN THERE.                 

386
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:23,288
                  CURING AGENT, 
                  WHITE PEPPER, 

387
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,622
                         MAIZE. 

388
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,157
GRANULATED GARLIC.              
                     YOU GOT IT.

389
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,627
  NOW WE MIX. MIGHT WANT TO KEEP
  YOUR HEAD OUT OF IT THIS TIME.
LOOK AT THAT!                   

390
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,430
         ADD SOME WATER TO MAKE 
         SURE IT'S NOT TOO DRY. 

391
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,432
       THAT'S ICE IN THERE, TOO,
           TO KEEP IT COLD.     

392
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,502
COLDER THE BETTER.              
  WE MAKING PâTé?               

393
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:39,103
            THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA 
           KEEP IT NICE AND FIRM

394
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,440
       WHEN WE FINALLY SMOKE IT.
MAKES THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE 
    IN MAKING THE SAUSAGE.      

395
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,442
I WOULD HAVE NEVER              
 HAVE KNOWN THAT.               

396
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,643

NOW WE PUT THE REST OF OUR SALT,

398
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:49,914
                 CURING AGENT...
OKAY.                           

399
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,316
              THEN WE MIX AGAIN.
A LOT OF WORK FOR SAUSAGE.      

400
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,786
                    READY?      
               FIRE IN THE HOLE!

402
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,458
                  NOW WE LOAD UP
                    THE HOPPER. 
YEP.

              LOOK AT THIS.     

405
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,930
NOW WE'RE GOING TO STUFF IT     
     INTO OUR CASING.           

406
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,933
MAKE SURE THAT THE STUFFING'S   
   RIGHT UP AGAINST HERE,       

407
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,934
OTHERWISE WE'RE GONNA GET       
      AIR IN THERE.             
             AIR IN THERE, OKAY.

408
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:13,537
          I KNEW THAT I BROUGHT 
          GLASSES FOR A REASON. 

409
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,741
                           WHOA!

      SLIDE IT OFF.
