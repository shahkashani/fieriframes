1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,201
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,669
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:07,139
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:08,139
          This trip...          

5
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:10,209
My mouth is watering so bad     
     right now.                 

6
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:12,544
    ...we're getting sweet...   
I'm digging this.               

7
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,813
          ...savory...          
Ridiculous flavor.              

8
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,548
  ...and even a little saucy... 

9
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,217
I'm halfway through the book,   
and I just can't put it down.   

10
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,954
 ...In Bakersfield, California. 
You want to wrassle?            

11
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:24,756
       An old-school joint      
    rocking a café classic...   

12
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,291
I've done a lot of chili        
   on "Triple D."               

13
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:27,359
This is some of the best.       

14
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,360
 ...alongside a decadent twist. 

15
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,096
You're probably gonna           
   lose your mind.              

16
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,031
       Then across town...      
                     I like it. 

17
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,234
         ...a funky spot        
  building up their burgers...  

18
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:36,568
      That's a complete program.

19
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,637
    ...and putting breakfast    
          into dessert.         

20
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,706
  Who puts bacon in ice cream?  
         That's like --         

21
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,774
  Well, these guys              
are a little whacked.           

22
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,509
             FIERI:             
   And in Phoenix, Arizona...   

23
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,645
Oh, my goodness.                
   ...full-flavored Mexican...  

24
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,980
This is like Mexican            
Thanksgiving in a taco.         

25
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,049
          ...taking me          
      on a righteous ride.      

26
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,318
That's like Mexican mole        
     Disneyland.                

27
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,386
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

28
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,790
     on "Diners, Drive-Ins,     
           and Dives."          

29
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:13,338
     So, here I am downtown     
    Bakersfield, California,    

30
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,008
      on a very busy street     
  to meet a guy that, get this, 

31
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,745
  is a third-generation coffee  
   shop and truck stop owner.   

32
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,448
 You don't hear that every day. 
  This is the 24th Street Café. 

33
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:27,219
              Huevos rancheros. 

34
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:29,555
     When you walk into it,     
it's like walking into the past.

35
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,925
      I've been coming here     
       for about 27 years.      

36
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,894
     Salmon dip,                
   share, please.               

37
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,963
        24th Street Café        
       is an institution.       

38
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,166
FIERI: Because of chef and owner
           Mark Huggs,          

39
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:43,836
       who grew up working      
  in his family's restaurants,  

40
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:46,538
   including locally renowned   
       Milt's Coffee Shop.      

41
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,309
 Then in 1987, he bought a diner
     dating back to the '50s    

42
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,177
 and turned it into this place. 

43
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,980
How does it keep going          
if it's been here since '53?    

44
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,381
          It's all my employees.

45
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:57,649
      How long                  
have they been here?            

46
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,450
             George -- 27 years.
                Larry -- 22.    

47
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,786
 So, we're talking,             
  like, lifetimes.              
                Yeah, everybody.

48
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,656
              MAN:              
 Donna and the other waitresses,
 they know how I like my coffee,

49
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,124
          how far away          
     to keep the mayonnaise.    

50
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,927
   And let's not forget about   
 the scratch-made comfort food. 

51
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,862
   Chili, please.               

52
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,531
   Chili's always a mainstay.   

53
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,333
   It's really tasty, hearty.   

54
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:16,602
What are we gonna make          
       today?                   

55
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,270
                   Texas chili. 
Let's get after this.           

56
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:20,906
         We have our top sirloin
               and our chuck.   

57
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,143
              I'm gonna cube it 
                into strips.    

58
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:27,079
       This is what we grind for
 all of our hamburger and chili.

59
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:28,347
       Got it.                  

60
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,748
Who's this character?           
              This is my father.

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,817
That's the Milt?                
How are you, sir?               
        Good to meet you.       

62
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,818
      So, Milt,                 
you had the truck stop.         

63
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,954
Your kid worked for you.        
            Oh, yeah.           

64
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,623
          [ Laughter ]          

65
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:38,890
      He was a hard worker.     

66
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,425
     I was happy to see him     
       get out on his own.      

67
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:41,960
            I thought           
      it was a great idea.      

68
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,829
  All right, Milt.              
                   Thanks, Dad. 

69
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,631
 So now here we are.            
We got coarse ground meat.      

70
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:48,634
 And all we do is add our onions
               and our garlic.  

71
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:49,767
        Okay.                   

72
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,636
                 So all this    
              is just mixed up. 

73
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:55,908
Take it to the oven and brown it
            at 350 for one hour.

74
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,976
Now we're working on the peppers
   for the chili.               

75
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,444
             This is the sauce. 
   Got it.                      

76
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:02,514
      So first guajillo peppers,
                 California.    

77
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,982
They're my favorites.           

78
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,450
          And then the pasillas.

79
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,252
               Garlic. Water.   

80
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,420
      And now?                  

81
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:10,054
               Now these seep.  

82
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,257
Then we'll take all that,       
     simmer it,                 

83
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,659
      blend it,                 
run it through a strainer?      

84
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:15,794
                    Yes.        

85
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,262
       Got it.                  

86
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,997
       This is our browned meat.

87
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:24,403
Yo, it smells good enough       
    to get in it.               

88
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:27,539
   Now we're gonna add our salt,
             our cayenne pepper,

89
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,809
                chili flakes,   
                black pepper.   

90
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,044
My mouth is so watering so bad  
     right now.                 

91
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,813
               Paprika, cumin.  

92
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,115
   So we get this               
  nicely mixed up.              

93
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,350
       Then, can you believe it?

94
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:39,884
Go old school on it.            

95
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,020
             I do oatmeal in it.

96
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,822
  This is gonna be              
     our secret.                

97
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,757
So this is what's gonna         
  soak up the fat.              

98
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,825
                 That's it.     

99
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:47,892
It's gonna add texture.         

100
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,960
           This is a good flavor
                 right here.    

101
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,162
I should probably taste this    
      in here.                  

102
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,031
                  Oh, good.     

103
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:56,301
I'm halfway through the book,   
and I just can't put it down.   

104
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,569
   What's up next?              

105
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,304
                Chili sauce,    

106
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,174
        and then we're gonna add
      our fresh stewed tomatoes.

107
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,841
  This is real-deal             
     old school.                

108
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,178
You should wear a cowboy hat.   
I should call you Hoss.         

109
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,379
               I got my boots.  

110
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:08,380
How long is this gonna go       
back in the oven for?           

111
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:09,715
             About another hour.

112
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,217
       Hit it.                  

113
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,255
                 This is it.    

114
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,257
              We finish it off  
  with tillamook cheddar cheese.

115
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,792
                  Green onions. 
Got to have it.                 

116
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,794
     Fresh Spanish white onions.

117
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,263
If there's one thing I love     
  about truck stops             

118
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,599
  or counter cafés              
      is chili.                 

119
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,067
With a little bit of            
the French fry going in there.  

120
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,669
  I mean, come on.              

121
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,006
        Mmm.                    

122
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,275
The texture of the meat         
     is spot-on.                

123
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,277
Totally the right grind.        
You really cooked this down.    

124
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,745
You let all these flavors       
   come together.               

125
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,081
You rendered that fat           
  out of the meat.              

126
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,216
You brought it together         
  with the oatmeal.             

127
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,419
              Gonna eat it all? 

128
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,721
You want to wrassle?            

129
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,758
I've done a lot of chili        
   on "Triple D,"               

130
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,226
but I will honestly tell you,   
this is some of the best.       

131
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,763
 Mmm, out of bounds.            

132
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:59,665
    Outstanding.                

133
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,703
  It's got a little heat to it. 
     Not greasy on the top.     

134
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:08,840
     Absolutely you can tell    
 they're making it from scratch.

135
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,109
In the world of chili,          
how do you rate that?           
                This is top 10. 

136
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,911
   He really has a great menu.  

137
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,446
         WOMAN: Chicken piccata.

138
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,048
             FIERI:             
   Which can be eaten up at --  
   what you don't see too much  

139
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,917
        anymore -- good,        
  old-fashioned counter space.  

140
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,119
When you sit at the counter,    
there's always something to do. 

141
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,456
 People are talking.            
A waitress comes by.            

142
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,525
Just the ambiance of a true café
       is a real landmark.      

143
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,329
All right, so if you could take 
something as average as chili   

144
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,530
and make it that fantastic,     

145
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:33,465
 when we come back,             
we're gonna make pancakes.      

146
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:34,466
Not just any pancakes.          

147
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,068
              Pumpkin pancakes. 

148
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,804
 My taste buds have never tasted
       pancakes this good.      

149
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:40,472
  Pumpkin pancakes,             
"Triple D" in Bakersfield.      

150
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:41,807
    We'll see you               
  in a little bit.              

151
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:43,542
Gonna take me that long         
  to eat the chili.             

152
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:50,849
    Welcome back.               

153
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,252
We're at the 24th Street Café   
here in Bakersfield, California.

154
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:55,586
I just had a bowl of chili.     

155
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,456
Well, it was kind of like       
 the bowl of chilis             

156
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,657
 of bowl of chilis.             

157
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,991
    Outstanding.                

158
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,194
So, I agreed that, if the chili 
 was that fantastic,            

159
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,195
I will try pancakes.            

160
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,930
    I heard that                
the pumpkin pancakes are        

161
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:06,798
     [Whistles]                 
 out of this world.             

162
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,300
                  They are.     

163
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:14,806
   They're just light, fluffy,  
  melt-in-your-mouth yumminess. 

164
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,941
              Pumpkin pancakes, 
           double share, please.

165
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,944
      The pumpkin pancakes      
     are my guilty pleasure.    

166
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:22,414
      Got a great cinnamon,     
         pumpkin flavor.        

167
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,817
    And then you've got that    
    pecan brown sugar butter    

168
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:28,487
      that is unbelievable.     

169
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,822
              This is more like 
                pumpkin pie.    
I'll take it.                   

170
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,357
           First ground pumpkin.

171
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:37,696
      Nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla,
             salt, brown sugar. 

172
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,397
               Condensed milk.  

173
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,833
So this is from scratch?        

174
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,367
                    Yes.        
                 Whole milk.    

175
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,703
In Bakersfield, they still      
have milk in the glass jars.    

176
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:46,971
               Milk in a jar.   

177
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,040
                    Eggs.       

178
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,775
              And a little oil. 

179
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,445
How long have the pumpkin       
pancakes been on the menu?      

180
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:55,580
        Ooh, 20 years, at least.

181
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,650
            So we just mix this,
and then we mix the dry mixture.

182
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:03,921
             All-purpose flour, 
 baking powder, salt, and sugar.

183
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,057
   A little sugar.              
So just like baking a cake.     

184
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,126
  Wet mix, dry mix.             
  You add it to it.             

185
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,329
All right, and then that's gonna
get served with what?           

186
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,597
                  Pecan butter. 
 Pecan butter?                  

187
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,266
Boy, where you from?            

188
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,801
                Bakersfield.    
 Bakersfield.                   

189
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:18,670
        Okay,                   
 so whipped butter.             

190
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:22,340
            Pecans, brown sugar,
           pure vanilla extract,

191
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:25,944
            cinnamon, and clove.

192
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,579
     I love it.                 

193
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,983
All right, now we're gonna      
 cook the pancakes?             
                          Yes.  

194
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,189
                There you go.   

195
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,561
        Now,                    
because my friend Kat,          

196
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:44,162
 who is the producer            
 here of "Triple D,"            

197
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:47,232
is such a fan of pumpkin        
pancakes, so I'm doing this.    

198
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,500
            This is all for Kat.

199
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,236
        Mmm.                    

200
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,439
     That's hot                 
 pumpkin cheesecake.            

201
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:57,441
Not as heavy and dense.         
The cakes are nice and light.   

202
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:00,044
It's actually the pecan butter  
that really ties it all in.     

203
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,913
Getting a little of that        
saltiness and the crunchiness   

204
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,314
    in the nuts.                

205
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,317
Anybody that's a pancake fan,   
anybody that's a pumpkin fan -- 

206
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,986
If you're a fan of both, you're 
probably gonna lose your mind.  

207
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,991
             WOMAN:             
 It's like jamming Thanksgiving 
     pumpkin pie year-round     

208
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,726
         in your mouth.         

209
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,596
     MAN: Pancakes are big,     
       and they're fluffy,      

210
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:19,698
    and you better be hungry    
       if you order them.       

211
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,469
                   Is this      
            a step back in time?
    Yeah.                       

212
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,404
It's the kind of restaurant,    
 when you move away             

213
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,873
and you come back in town       
and you want your favorite meal,

214
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,875
this is where you come to.      

215
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,410
    This is my "Cheers" bar.    

216
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,881
I would much rather come to Café
     than go any place else.    

217
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:37,415
       FIERI:                   
This is the kind of place       
    that you wish               

218
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,384
was right down the street       
  from your house.              

219
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,153
 Diamond, baby.                 
                   There you go.

220
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,222
   It's a diamond.              

221
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:47,225
        FIERI: Coming up,       
we're sticking to Bakersfield...

222
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,426
      I'm feeling encouragement.

223
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,095
      ...to see if a joint      
      has what it takes...      

224
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:52,296
         I'm almost ready to try
the peanut butter crunch burger.

225
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,365
          ...to conquer         
     one of my burger blues.    

226
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,233
               I never thought  
              it would happen.  

227
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,575
          So, I'm here          
    off the West Side Parkway   

228
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,044
  right by some railroad tracks 

229
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,980
      in an industrial park     
   in Bakersfield, California.  

230
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,583
    Sounds exciting, I know,    
but hang on, this is a good one.

231
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:14,118
  I'm here to check out a joint

00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,986
   right into our batch freezer,
                 turn it on.    

346
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,721
                 This takes     
            about eight minutes.

347
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,923
             So now we're ready 
                 to extract.    

348
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,525
  When do we start              
sprinkling the bacon?           

349
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:48,660
        You can do it right now.

350
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,594
  I'm digging this.             

351
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,464
So if you wanted to serve it    
gelato style, we're ready to go.

352
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,599
             We're ready to go. 

353
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,469
        Wow.                    

354
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,005
You know what plays off this    
so well is that maple syrup.    

355
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,574
That accentuates the bacon      
flavor right off the bat.       

356
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,743
    Super creamy.               

357
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,145
Out of the 10 scoops            
  I've already had,             

358
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:09,347
   I've got bacon               
 every single time.             

359
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,148
               That's the love  
                right there.    

360
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,084
    You the man.                
  Great job, dude.              

361
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,352
 I'm gonna tell ya,             
 you have delivered             

362
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,953
  how much you said             
 you were gonna do.             

363
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,021
    Outstanding.                

364
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:21,092
   The ice cream is so smooth,  
           so creamy.           

365
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,028
   This is the best ice cream   
          in the world.         

366
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,364
          So I thought          
       the perfect people       

367
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,365
    to ask what they thought    
         of Moo Creamery        

368
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,368
   would be my management team  
    from the Johnny Garlic's    

369
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,836
      here in Bakersfield.      

370
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,170
   They get everything locally  
              here,             

371
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,372
        giving right back       
        to the community.       

372
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,907
     I love the originality.    

373
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,309
           Now, you worked here.
And six years later,            

374
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,445
   it's cracking,               
just as it was day one.         

375
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:45,583
    This place is definitely    
   the X on the treasure map.   

376
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,319
I like to see that young people 
   like yourselves              

377
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,588
are jumping in there,           
trying to make this happen,     

378
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,656
doing it as a couple.           

379
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:53,257
     That's why                 
they're so successful.          

380
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,660
Great place, you guys.          

381
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,995
             FIERI:             
 Up next in Phoenix, Arizona... 

382
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,464
 Oh, that's so good.            

383
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,265
       ...the Mexican spot      
    tricking out tortillas...   

384
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,201
 That's why it says             
gourmet taco shop out front.    

385
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:05,069
 ...and taking mole to the max. 

386
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:08,672
I would stand with that pot     
of mole on the side of the road 

387
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:09,507
and serve it to people          
   in their hands.              

388
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,651
          So, I'm here          
      in Phoenix, Arizona,      

389
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,452
  in the barrio of Barrio Café. 

390
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:24,321
  You remember, Chef Silvana -- 
     real-deal Mexican food.    

391
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,657
    I'm about two blocks away   

392
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,858
          to check out          
    another real-deal joint.    

393
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,060
           This time,           
  they serve it all in a taco.  

394
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,930
      This is La Santisima.     

395
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,537
   I've never had Mexican food  
           like this.           

396
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,072
                   Ready.       

397
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,206
   This is real Mexican food.   

398
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,076
     When someone genuinely     
    puts their soul into it,    

399
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,944
          you can taste         
      a little bit of that.     

400
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,881
FIERI: Here, the soul comes from
     owner Christina Guzman,    

401
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:52,617
       a Mexican immigrant      
 who traded in the furniture biz

402
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,285
   for family recipes in 2010.  

403
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,289
You take all the different      
specialties of Mexico           

404
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,723
and put it in a taco.           

405
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,160
 That's why it says             
gourmet taco shop out front.    

406
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,962
Santisima, what does that mean, 
     Santisima?                 

407
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:08,165
    The Santisima is -- It comes
       from the Day of the Dead.

408
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,833
          It's a big celebration
                 in Mexico.     
No, I know it, yeah.            

409
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,770
      They just entice you      
 with ingredients that they use.

410
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,906
        The nagada tacos        
has a little bit of fruit in it.

411
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,575
             WOMAN:             
     It symbolizes the flag.    

412
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,445
 You have your white, your red, 
         and your green.        

413
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:22,646
  So, this is like              
a pretty important dish.        

414
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,183
    It's really important, like,
            in Independence Day.

415
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,317
     All right,                 
so let's get started.           

416
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,587
           Olive oil with onion.

417
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,389
                Some garlic.    

418
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,158
       Ground beef, ground pork.

419
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:36,727
              It's kind of like 
                 piccadillo.    

420
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,396
It's like piccadillo,           
        okay.                   

421
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:42,333
       We add the raisins, salt,
            pepper -- that's it.

422
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,202
       Now we have to do the mix
                of the fruit.   

423
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:45,269
     Olive oil.                 

424
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,804
                   Garlic.      

425
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,073
               We have onion.   

426
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,008
       Pears?                   
                   Pears, yes.  

427
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,411
In Mexican food?                
                     Of course. 

428
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:56,080
               Apple, prunes.   

429
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,548
 I'm just gonna keep            
all the prune jokes to myself.  

430
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,350
      Cinnamon.                 

431
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,686
                Add tomatoes.   

432
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:02,887
 And salt and pepper            
      on this?                  

433
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,222
             A little bit, yeah.

434
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:05,957
    We're gonna do the stuffing.

435
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,092
      So, we start with the mix.

436
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:10,628
    We're gonna mix it right now
 with the fruit mix that we did.

437
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,830
           Then we're gonna heat
        a little bit of peppers.

438
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:13,898
      Roasted?                  

439
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,800
                   Mm-hmm.      
   Got it.                      

440
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,838
What's in the sauce?            

441
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,174
          Milk, walnuts, cherry,
                goat cheese,    

442
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:24,642
           and Mexican cinnamon.

443
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:28,980
        Then we add some pepper,
                pomegranate.    

444
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:30,982
      The color                 
of the Mexican flag.            
                         Yeah.  

445
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,719
  Oh, my goodness.              

446
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:39,390
It's rich, it's creamy, complex,
has a lot of texture.           

447
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,325
This is like Mexican            
Thanksgiving in a taco.         

448
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:43,928
      A little bit of sweet     

449
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,997
        and a little bit        
    of a spiciness, as well.    

450
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,998
     Pomegranate seeds on it    
 give it a little bit of crunch.

451
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,267
       It's just something      
          you can't get         

452
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,335
       in all these other       
      Mexican restaurants.      

453
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,938
             FIERI:             
Same goes for the mega salsa bar
       topping things off.      

454
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,873
       You can always tell      
       they're made fresh.      

455
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,875
       What's your favorite one?
The peanut one.                 

456
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,544
             FIERI:             
   And another saucy favorite?  

457
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:01,345
  FIERI: Holy mole.             
Let's talk about mole.          

458
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:02,413
                 Mole, yeah.
