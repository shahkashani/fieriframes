1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:01,800
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,268
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,671
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,806
          This trip...          

5
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,541
          [ Rattling ]          
                 That was quiet.

6
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:10,742
That's the loudest thing        
     we do here.                

7
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,477
...I'm taking my Vitamin C, mom,

8
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:16,147
   'cause it's chicken, chili,  
          and chowder.          

9
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,683
                 All right,     
              let's make this.  

10
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:20,018
       In Toronto, Canada,      
   the real-deal smokehouse...  

11
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,420
      Anything you don't want to
          eat in your lifetime, 

12
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,822
              smear that on it. 

13
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:25,157
   ...doing the funky chicken   

14
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:27,426
     right next to a burger     
       loaded with butter.      

15
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:29,094
                  Brother,      
            that is the balance.

16
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:32,030
    In Burbank, California...   

17
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,699
He put his finger in it.        
  Did you see that?             

18
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,167
 ...the old-school chili house. 

19
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,768
              You're gonna say  
                 this is...     

20
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,769
     Number one.                

21
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,639
...rocking a 65-year-old recipe.

22
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,508
I don't think I've had it       
  offered that way.             

23
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,977
      And in Philadelphia,      
         Pennsylvania...        

24
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:47,179
          the shot bar          
     turned gourmet hot spot    

25
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:51,049
      cooking up a chowder      
    with an Italian surprise.   

26
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,117
                    Wow!        

27
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,986
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

28
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:56,855
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

31
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:12,804
  So I'm right between downtown 
 and midtown in Toronto, Canada,

32
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,940
  in the Hillcrest Village area 
    of St. Clair Avenue West    

33
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,543
   to check out a joint that's  
   serving up the kind of food  

34
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,812
 you'd expect in these parts -- 
          a smokehouse.         

35
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,382
     This is The Stockyards     
      Smokehouse & Larder.      

36
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,153
   One barbecued beef brisket.  

37
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:29,554
The best barbecue I've ever had.

38
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:30,622
          It's insane.          

39
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,625
      It's not your typical     
        Southern cuisine.       

40
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:36,428
      We need to drop fries     
 and the green tomatoes, please.

41
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,830
  MAN: It's unique. It's Tom's  
     take on those flavors,     

42
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,099
 but he does it in his own way. 

43
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,167
             FIERI:             
 That would be the Tom Davis way

44
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:43,502
   developed on the runway...   

45
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:45,770
          You're a runway model?
  Back in the day.              

46
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,573
         ...and tweaked         
       in his own kitchen.      

47
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:49,441
      Order up!                 
 Two Butter Burgers!            

48
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,042
       DAVIS:                   
  One of my dreams              

49
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,245
was to open up my own           
sort of smokehouse and diner.   

50
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:55,247
    I was smoking               
   in my backyard.              

51
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:56,648
People just started digging     
  what I was doing.             

52
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,986
  In '09, he went from catering 
  to his own brick and smoker.  

53
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,255
 He puts his heart and soul into
  everything that he does here. 

54
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:04,990
   Hot, hot, hot!               

55
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,658
     Everything on this menu    
          is brilliant.         

56
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:10,462
  Giant chunks of fried chicken 
  and griddle-cooked hamburgers 

57
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,997
           done right.          

58
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,800
  Butter Burger -- best burger  
I've ever had in my entire life.

59
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,135
Out of all the burgers          
you've had in your life?        

60
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:17,803
             It's sin on a bun. 

61
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,072
  We're gonna make              
 the Butter Burger.             

62
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:21,340
               Butter Burger.   
              With bone marrow? 

63
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:22,741
  With bone marrow.             

64
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,276
      These are                 
 veal marrow bones.             

65
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:25,610
              So, line them up? 

66
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,413
             This is like chess 
               in Flavortown.   

67
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:32,751
Put this into the oven          
for about 45 minutes at 425.    

68
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,486
                 Very cool.     

69
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,287
               So, these have   
              all cooked down,  

70
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,956
            and how are we gonna
               get those out?   

71
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,625
   We're gonna use              
a handy cocktail spoon.         

72
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:42,094
They should come out            
     real easy.                 

73
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:43,562
                That fatty,     
                delicious...    

74
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:44,563
    Fatty beauty.               

75
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,902
      So now that we've got all 
      the marrow out, next step?

76
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:51,570
 Red-wine reduction,            

77
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,972
  unsalted butter,              
  our blue cheese.              

78
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,642
 And then we combine            
all the ingredients together    

79
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:57,909
till you start sweating.        

80
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,311
   The warm marrow              
is melting everything.          

81
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,347
           Kind of help tying it
                all together.   

82
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,450
               That is killer.  

83
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,518
  Anything you don't want to eat
              in your lifetime, 

84
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,054
              smear that on it. 

85
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,689
    A good glob.                

86
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,060
     Roll it up                 
   like a sausage,              

87
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:17,329
  and we put those              
into the fridge to let them...  

88
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:19,531
                    Congeal.    
 Congeal and harden.            

89
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,532
              So, special grind 
          with the hanger steak.

90
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,600
     Six ounces.                

91
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,270
     Kosher salt                
right on the griddle.           

92
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,005
     Custom-made                
   burger smasher.              

93
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,407
Hold down for one second.       

94
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:31,142
Helps create a nice,            
beautiful crust on the burger.  

95
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,343
     Salt that.                 

96
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,078
 About three minutes            
      per side.                 

97
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,480
                           Bun? 
 Our butter roller.             

98
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,215
 Put a nice browning            
     on the bun.                

99
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,149
Shall we do the flip?           

100
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,151
           Do you see the juice?

101
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:40,886
The juice is loose.             
                      Very nice.

102
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,055
                Look at that    
      really nice crust on that.

103
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,758
    Butter puck.                
                        Nice.   

104
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,294
  Beautiful...                  
                     Nice toast.

105
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:50,295
  ...color on that.             

106
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,331
    Just put down               
   butter lettuce.              

107
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,267
                    Whoa.       

108
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,137
And then we top it off          
with the fried onion.           

109
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,375
                   Pardon me.   
  Yeah, please do.              

110
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,546
               The bun is just  
          soaking up the butter.

111
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,720
    You may need                
    one of those.               

112
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,256
       That's the kind of napkin
                  you need      

113
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,524
                with a burger   
                 like this.     

114
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:20,859
              It's so decadent. 

115
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:24,863
           It's got this smooth,
           silky, velvety appeal

116
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:27,666
       with these rich flavors, 
      and then, all of a sudden,

117
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,467
            you get that crunch.
   Crunch, right.

because that blue cheese        

129

gives it that tanginess         
and that crust on the meat.

through from the crème fraiche,

        the salt, the crunch of 
the coating of the green tomato,

181
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,620
                the richness    
or a little bit of that smoke --

182
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,555

  coming through from that bacon

              for half an hour, 

338
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,719
             and then we'll add 
         our chili-powder blend.

339
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:44,188
 But eating that...             
        Whoo.                   

340
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,325
Dummy put his finger in it!     
  Did you see that?             

341
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,327
              This has to stir  
              for half an hour. 

342
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,995
             The final spice -- 
                hot cayenne.    

343
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,730
     Let this go                
for another half an hour,       

344
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:54,599
 and then we put it             
 on the steam table.            

345
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,501
        Okay.                   
   I love it, man.              

346
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:02,006
So here at the chili dome,      
 how can I have it?             

347
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,073
              However you want. 

348
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,710
    Some beans...               
  Some spaghetti...             

349
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,413
  Some hot chili...             
Some cheddar cheese...          

350
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,214
    Some onions.                

351
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,283
I have done it up with the      
majority of the ingredients.    

352
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,422
        Mmm.                    

353
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,959
Yeah, there's nothing like      
    that extra suet.            

354
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:23,228
I don't think I've had it       
  offered that way.             

355
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,029
                    Nope.       
      Nobody makes it like this.

356
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,898
 Mmm. Not too spicy.            

357
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,368
I like the mixture of the beans 
  to the spaghetti.             

358
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,103
Nicely done, my friend.         

359
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,572
I can't keep shoving it         
in my mouth fast enough.        

360
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,507
          It's spiced perfectly.
It's good, man.                 

361
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,576
       It's the best chili      
     I've had in California.    

362
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,645
   Well, 65 years               
speaks pretty well for it.      

363
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:43,781
        I don't think we have to
        really get into much    
        more detail, do we?     

364
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,384
 You can tell it's all homemade 
      with heart and love.      

365
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:52,723
    FIERI: Have you guys changed
            any of the recipes? 

366
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,260
ALEC: Only addition, no changes,
  no subtractions.              

367
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:58,529
     Out of all the chili joints
      you've got in California, 

368
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:01,199
     you're gonna say this is...
Number one.                     

369
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:04,402
 This is the place that you will
        kick yourself, Burbank, 

370
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,070
     that you've been driving by
            for this many years 

371
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,471
              and you've never  
                  tried it.     

372
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,073
   You got to come check it out.
          Thanks for having me. 

373
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:14,078
         FIERI: Up next,        
      We're Philly bound...     

374
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,613
              This is awesome.  

375
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,481
        ...for a scrappy        
      neighborhood joint...     
             I like this method.

376
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,516
  ...making my kind of chowder. 

377
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:20,885
                Clam chowder    
                and gnocchi?    

378
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,728
 I'm here at a great "Triple D" 
     town -- Philadelphia --    

379
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,331
   in southwest Center City --  
      to check out a joint      

380
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,733
      that for 60 years was     
   just a shot-and-beer place.  

381
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,536
     Now it's three stories     
      of upscale bar food.      

382
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,138
        This is Sidecar.        

383
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:42,941
   And that's also a sidecar.   

384
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,143
   Pork nachos up!              

385
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,046
   It's a neighborhood joint.   

386
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,749
   And the food is fantastic.   

387
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,551
        Some of the best        
     that I've ever tasted.     

388
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,686
    You just feel like you're   
      a part of something.      

389
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:56,955
      [ Engine turns over ]     

390
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,690
       FIERI: Yep, part of      
  Adam Ritter's midlife crisis. 

391
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:00,825
I was working in sales.         

392
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,960
I was selling forklifts         
and warehouse designs.          

393
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,730
I wanted to become a chef.      
I wanted to open up             
something like this.            

394
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,366
        Whoo!                   

395
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:09,700
     So he cut to the chase     

396
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,503
   and picked up this property  
            in 2005.            

397
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:15,039
Next think I know, my wife and I
own a shot-and-beer bar.        

398
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,774
            So you weren't even 
         in culinary school yet?
No.                             

399
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:19,977
      That's when he leaned     
        on Brian Lofink,        

400
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,312
             a local            
     who<i> is</i> a culinary grad.    

401
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,315
     MAN: It's an incredibly    
         original menu.         

402
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,716
      Everything that they      
     come up with is a twist    

403
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:26,917
    on something that I know.   

404
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,187
     But don't be expecting     
     your mama's burger...      

405
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,788
  Piggy burger up!              

406
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,390
       ...or your granny's      
          clam chowder.         

407
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:33,791
    WOMAN: They actually have   
    potato gnocchi in there,    

408
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,993
   and it's so heavenly good.   

409
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,862
         Oh, to die for.        
           [ Laughs ]           

410
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,263
       Clam chowder and gnocchi?
Yep.                            

411
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,898
It's our little spin            
 on a clam chowder.             

412
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,199
                 Let's roll.    

413
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,068
                 Hot potato?    
Hot potatoes.                   

414
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,203
We're going to cut these        
      in half.                  

415
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,005
You got to do it right away.    

416
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,340
Otherwise, the potatoes         
get real gummy, and it makes    
a really poor product.          

417
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,543
 I take it we're gonna just kind
     of rice them through this? 

418
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,746
 Take it right here,            
 pop them right out.            

419
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,684
Now with this spoon,            
we push them right through.     

420
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,085
         I like the method, man.

421
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,754
 Yeah, it works out             
    pretty good.                

422
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:06,757
And at this point, what I'm     
gonna do is I'm gonna season it 

423
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,227
 with freshly ground            
    black pepper.               

424
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,828
 Some salt. Butter.             

425
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,764
Some extra-virgin olive oil.    
    There we go.                

426
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,632
I'm gonna crack two eggs        
      in here.                  

427
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,500
             Going pretty rustic
                on this one.    

428
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,902
  It's what we do.              

429
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:21,171
Little chive.                   
                This is awesome.

430
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,372
Then we're gonna mix            
all this up together.           

431
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,774
                    Okay.       
         All with a bench knife.

432
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,910
     That's it.                 

433
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,712
Everything's all mixed together 
   and happy now.               

434
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:28,846
Then we add in our flour.       

435
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,714
We're just gonna cover the top  
     of it here.                

436
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,716
We don't mix it all together    

437
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,050
  'cause it creates             
  too much gluten.              

438
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,185
We're gonna cut this baby       
      in half,                  

439
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:35,453
and we're just gonna keep       
  folding over top,             

440
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:36,521
     pressing it                
  and pressing it.              

441
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,388
               Kind of almost   
          in the biscuit theory.

442
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,523
      Exactly.                  

443
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:42,393
    I don't think I've ever done
             the cut and stack. 

444
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,661
    This has got to be some nice
        and light gnocchi, huh? 

445
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,130
Yeah, it pretty much            
just melts in your mouth.       

446
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,265
             I like this method.

447
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:49,667
 So after we get it             
 all mixed together,            

448
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,602
we're gonna let it sit          
for about a half-hour.          

449
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,404
It had a chance to rest,        
so we take this off.            

450
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,673
  We just dust this             
with a little bit of flour.     

451
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:57,408
Cut a little edge off           
     like that.                 

452
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,743
                    Okay.       

453
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,811
We roll it out nice and light.  
We be gentle with it.           

454
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,848
Then we just kind of come       
to the edge here and cut down.  

455
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:07,618
                    Yeah.       

456
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,089
Sprinkle some bench flour       
   over top of it.              

457
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,758
          So they don't dry out.
               Scoop them up.   

458
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,359
  Just toss it up.              
                      Beautiful.

459
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,695
All right, so now we're gonna go
       and make the clam stock? 

460
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,964
We're gonna take our clams --   
littleneck clams, by the way.   

461
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,966
          [ Rattling ]          

462
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:22,900
               That was quiet.  

463
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:23,968
That's the loudest thing        
     we do here.                

464
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,436
We're gonna take our onions,    
    add them in.                

465
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,438
  Carrots. Celery.              

466
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,439
              So the mirepoix.  

467
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,907
Little bit of garlic.           
    Fresh thyme.                

468
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,842
   Fresh parsley.               
      Bay leaf.                 

469
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:32,976
Whole black peppercorns.        

470
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,111
 We just cover this             
     with water.                

471
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,514
             This will also make
                 the broth.     
   Yep.                         

472
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:38,448
Cover this with foil.           

473
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,783
                 Fire it up,    
         let them go 10 minutes.

474
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,253
              You'll strain it. 

475
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,455
These are the cool clams        

476
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,457
that we're gonna pick           
for our clam chowder.           

477
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,427
We're gonna assemble the whole  
clam chowder right here.        

478
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,396
      So we got                 
applewood-smoked bacon here.    

479
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,865
 We're gonna get it             
   nice and crisp.              

480
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:58,469
Add in our shallot, garlic.     
Get our light toast on this.    

481
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,404
  Add in our clams.             
     Clam stock.                

482
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:07,478
We drop our gnocchi.            

483
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,679
These gnocchis are rising,      

484
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,147
so we're gonna add these        
     to our pan.                

485
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,416
    The starches                
 from these gnocchi             

486
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:13,884
is gonna help thicken           
     the sauce.                 

487
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,486
 Now a little cream.            

488
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,486
                  Mount it      
           with a little butter.

489
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,488
     Season with                
a little bit of salt,           

490
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,856
    a little bit                
  of black pepper.              

491
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,291
               Tighten it up.   

492
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,093
And we're ready to plate.       

493
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,295
             That's ridiculous. 

494
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,769
      Take some                 
of our crispy shallots here.    

495
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:32,703
                     Oh!        

496
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,438

497
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,773
And we finish it with           
a little celery-leaf salad.     

498
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:36,874
                 Very nice.     

499
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,448
       The gnocchi's delicate --
              depth and flavor, 

500
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,717
       and you get a little bit 
 of the clam and the creaminess.

501
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,652
     But it's not the creaminess
                in the sauce,   

502
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,755
            it's the creaminess 
          in the gnocchi itself.

503
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,524
                    Mmm.        
       And then the salad on it.

00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,995
           The salad on the top 
          is what makes it. Wow!

506
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:00,264
           This is literally one
           of the best gnocchi  
           dishes I've ever had.

507
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,199
  Oh, awesome, man.             

508
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,034
                  Amazing.

  Clam chowder up!              

510
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:10,341
    The gnocchis are so light   
           and fluffy.          

511
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:13,678
  The salt and the cream ratio  
       is like just right.      

512
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,879
    And that little celery salad
                   on top?      

513
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:15,879

                    Ohh.        
It's excellent.                 

516
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:19,617
              It's ridiculous.  

517
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,488
           Real food.           
      Nothing pretentious.

 for this Flavortown road trip.
