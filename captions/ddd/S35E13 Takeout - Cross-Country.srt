00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:03,268
     So when I come off the road
          from doing "Triple-D,"

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,870
    the first thing I want to do
       is get home to my kitchen

3
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:06,805
              and cook my food  
               for my family.   

4
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:09,541
    And after a few weeks --    
      -Dad, can we just --      

5
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:12,077
I mean, please go to a

   to some of our favorite chefs

00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,351
                and have them   
            send<i> us</i> dinner? Huh?

      your average bologna.     

445
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,305
        I could just tell       
      from all the texture      

446
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,706
   and particulates in there.   

447
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,509
 Yeah, so we make it            
      in-house.                 

448
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,444
  I mean, I figure,             
if you're gonna do something,   

449
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,045
  you might as well             
    do it right.                

450
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,781
It's a pork and beef blend.     
Add some more dry rub,          

451
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,518
a couple other seasonings       
      in there.                 

452
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,987
  We'll grind it up             
  two, three times.             

453
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,722
      Definitely got smoke.     

454
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,458
    Got great moisture to it.   

455
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,792
    How thick do we want it,    
        'cause I'm gonna        

456
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,861
  just keep eating it like this 
      if you don't tell me.     

457
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:47,498
About a quarter to a half-inch, 
somewhere right in there.       

458
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,665
   Griddle it up.               

459
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,067
          Tell me what          
      you did on the fries.     

460
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,137
They're hand-cut, and then we   
blanch them at about 325,       

461
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,205
    fry them 375                
till they're crispy.            

462
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,008
             That fry seasoning,
            it's got our dry rub

463
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,144
       and a little bit of sugar
                   in it.       

464
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,547
   How's that bologna looking?  
          -Really good.         

465
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,749
  Take some of that             
 Texas toast bread,             

466
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,884
and you're gonna butter         
that up and toast it.           

467
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,953
 I've opened up the corn chips, 
      and I'm eating those      

468
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,287
        'cause I thought        
        you wanted me to.       

469
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,622
                  Save some     
              for the sandwich  

470
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,024
  And where's the cheese going? 

471
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:14,558
  Those are pimento             
   cheese patties.              

472
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,293
 Once the bologna's             
      griddled,                 

473
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,962
add that pimento cheese         
on top of one of the slices     

474
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,298
   and cover it up              
  and let it melt.              

475
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,101
            The sandwich name is
               the Carl Ruiz.   

476
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,169
         You guys named         
       this after "Cuban"?      

477
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,705
          The winner of         
   the championship belt is...  

478
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,441
     Carl "The Cuban" Ruiz.     

479
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,176
    Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha!

             and...             

482
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,047
  We all miss him.              

483
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,984
     -Carl likes this dish?     
 -It was his favorite sandwich. 

484
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,986
  I want to go get              
a bologna sandwich now.         

485
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,320
       So when                  
that bread's toasted,           

486
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,788
  you want to take              
that barbecue mustard           

487
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,990
and throw on each side.         

488
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,992
       Alright, so bologna      
          coming over.          

489

    Stack it up.                

490
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,328
You want to take a big handful  
 of those corn chips            

491
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,730
and smash them on there.        

492
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,932
   Like you're in third grade,

  and you're piling everything  
        on your sandwich.

        bologna sandwich.

518
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:49,453
       This is definitely       
  an elevated bologna sandwich. 

519
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:50,854
       And matter of fact,      
even call it a bologna sandwich,

520
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,789
       I think people go,       
           "Come on."           

521
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,858

  more than a bologna sandwich.
