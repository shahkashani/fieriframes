1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,734
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
     and we're rolling out,     

2
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:06,271
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

3
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:07,272
         On this trip...        

4
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:09,475
                           Ah!  
   ...I'm hitting the exit...   

5
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:11,810
        Keep going. Keep going. 
   Okay. We're good. We're good.

6
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:14,145
           ...for some          
      savory sensations...      

7
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,014
     This is all                
   100% made here.              

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,616
  ...in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. 

9
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,284
 Brother, I'm gonna             
tell you something --           

10
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:20,686
   You've got it                
   going on here.               

11
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:23,288
     The real-deal diner...     
I like the way you roll.        

12
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,158
       ...serving up some       
   seriously eclectic combos.   

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,227
[ Southern accent ]             
Now we're gonna cook it         
in the country oven.            

14
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:30,695
And in Grandy, North Carolina...

15
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,631
Can I get some music            
in the background, please?      

16
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:36,635
   ...the brewery/farm stand/   
       restaurant combo...      

17
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:39,371
    What in the wild, wild world
           of sports was that?! 

18
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,240
      ...with all the tools     
          of the trade.         

19
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:44,376
                Holy shnikey!   

20
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:48,047
                    Dude!       
        That was out of control.

21
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:51,783
     That's all right here,     
    right now on "Triple D."    

24
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:08,133
    I'm just over the bridge    
         from Manhattan         

25
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:10,936
 in a cool, little neighborhood 
     known as Williamsburg.     

26
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:13,338
     I've heard it described    
as kind of like a college campus

27
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,542
    just without the college,   
  so you know they got to have  

28
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,511
    cool, little joints like    
  this place -- Jimmy's Diner.  

29
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:27,219
      Got The All American      
           with bacon.          

30
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:28,887
         It's heaven on a plate.

31
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:31,957
          Chico Grande.         

32
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,291
         It's perfect breakfast,
              lunch, or dinner. 

33
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,560
       MAN: Fried chicken.      

34
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:36,294
        They fry it just enough,

35
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,829
        but they keep it healthy
                just enough.    

36
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,498
WOMAN: It's all I want to eat   
on a weekend morning,           

37
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,966
especially if you've been       
out late the night before.      

38
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,502
       FIERI: No worries,       
     'cause in the morning,     

39
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:47,172
  Josh Cohen and Blair Papagni  
       got you covered...       

40
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:51,310
    like they have since 2007   
   when they opened the joint.  

41
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:53,245
         Like that awesome diner
             in a college town. 

42
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:54,713
    But you guys                
  have no college.              

43
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,583
   Oh, that's not true. This is 
 like the unofficial NYU campus.

44
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:59,584
NYU's in... [Whistles]          
                   In the city. 

45
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,920
    This is just                
 the commuter burb?             
             Exactly.           

46
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,655
  COHEN: And Blair made the menu
         when she was pregnant. 

47
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:04,523
     You do have                
 fried pickle chips?            

48
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:05,657
      With a peanut-butter      
           milkshake.           

49
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:06,525
   You have those?              

50
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,327
           Absolutely.          
Crazy.                          

51
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:11,462
        Interesting combinations
               of ingredients   

52
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,731
       like pulled pork and eggs
               for breakfast.   

53
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,467
              Boozy milkshakes. 

54
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,468
           Little Jack          
       in your milkshake.       

55
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,937
     That's it.                 
Give me a membership card.      

56
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,273
    The skillet apple waffle.   

57
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,742
         With pancetta and apple
                   on top.      

58
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:26,645
   This meat-candy sensation,   
       which is brilliant.      

59
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,549
       What is                  
a skillet apple waffle?         

60
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,083
        Well, we're calling this
                 a skillet,     

61
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,419
              hence the apples  
 that are gonna be cooked in it,

62
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,488
             and it'll be on top
                of a waffle.    

63
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,223
And we're gonna have pancetta   
   in this, also?               

64
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:39,625
                     Correct.   
I like the way you roll.        

65
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:41,759
                  Gonna put     
              the pancetta in.  

66
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,562
               The pancetta --  
               I blanch first,  

67
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,765
  take a little of the salt out,
         a little bit of the -- 

68
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,367
     And it also                
 speeds it up a bit.            

69
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,102
                       It does. 
Copious amounts of butter.      

70
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:52,771
          Then I add our apples.

71
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,106
                I'm gonna add   
             some white sugar --

72
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,041
               just a little.   

73
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,342
              Some brown sugar. 

74
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:03,582
Okay, so, it reduces down.      
Now we hit with maple syrup?    

75
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:05,183
                        Yep.    

76
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,052
This is waffles gone wild.      

77
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,955
               We're gonna do   
      a little nutmeg, cinnamon.

78
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,225
             Then I'm gonna add 
            a little lemon zest.

79
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,930
             It'll cut a little 
      of the flavor of the sweet

80
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:20,465
                 and the fat    
              of the pancetta.  

81
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,634
     I like this                
pancetta-and-apple idea.        

82
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,203
Now we're gonna make            
    the waffles.                

83
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,807
        We have AP flour, sugar,

84
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,143
       some baking powder, salt.

85
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,211
       Mix that up a little bit.

86
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,547
     Add some of our buttermilk,

87
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,817
            and then the butter,
                and vanilla.    

88
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,286
                I'm gonna add   
                a little oil.   

89
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:42,620
   Thank you, sir.              

90
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,223
         Keep going. Keep going.

91
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,158
              Okay. We're good. 
         We're good. We're good.

92
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,160
That looks like pudding.        

93
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:50,094
     That's it?                 
No more moisture than that?     

94
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,731
      It's usually pretty tight.
        Okay. So, we have that. 

95
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,267
          Gonna add a little bit
          of lemon zest in it...

96
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,838
                  ...mix...     
              and there we go.  

97
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,613
       Really?                  
So we're putting in pudding.    

98
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,584
               We have magic.   

99
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,520
            It's beautiful, huh?

100
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,722
             Okay, so, we'll put
              the waffle down.  

101
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,124
         It's Chinese roast pork
                 and apples.    

102
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,394
  Look at this. Oh!             

103
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:23,594
           Little lemon drizzle.

104
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,830
You and your lemon zest --      
     I love it.                 

105
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,604
Part savory, part sweet.        

106
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,840
 The pork, the salt.            

107
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,877
   Great waffle --              
nice and tender, good crust.    

108
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,812
You get a little bit            
of the maple syrup in there.    

109
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,414
You can definitely taste        
  that lemon zest,              

110
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,148
the essence of the lemon.       

111
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,817
         Oh!                    

112
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,353
   That's a waffle              
that eats like a meal.          

113
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,954
        Mmm!                    

114
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,690
  Killer job.                   
                   Thanks, man. 

115
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,825
             FIERI:             
 When we get back to Jimmy's... 

116
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,493
              Chico Grande's up.
      ...it's round two...
