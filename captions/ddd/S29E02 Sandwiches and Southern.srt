232
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,655
        when Kathryn Gold       
         and John Hinkle        

233
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,191

Unfortunately, John passed away,

236
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:46,464
    so Kat recruited longtime   
 employee Jake Brown-VanAusdall

 -This is our red tamale sauce.

00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,508
Now, how long are we gonna let  
this sit here and simmer down?  

261
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,175
    They just have to rehydrate.
  Gotcha.                       

262
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,510

264
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,314
   So bloom that,               
 kind of wake it up.

268
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,253
  That was a smidge, wasn't it? 
            -Smidge.            

269
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,255
                  Puree it      
      with an immersion blender.

270
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,759
    Next, I'm going to add water
   with veggie base mixed in it.

272
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:51,663

          about 10 more minutes,

273
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,332
             and then it's ready
              for the tamales.  

274
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,967
  That's delicious.

00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,870
just warm it up, make a soup.

down, now, for how long?        

289
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,694
        -15 minutes max.        
      -Just so it's tender.

                Yeah, just so   
           it's slightly tender.
Cooked and tender.              

291

   -And then we'll steam them.  
   -About an hour and a half.

That's a big tamale.            

315
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,807
   You're looking

    look pretty.

322
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,620
