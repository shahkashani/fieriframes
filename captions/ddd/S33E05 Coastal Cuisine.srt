    It was cocked perfectly.    
    The seasoning was great.    

349
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,018
         The vinaigrette        
      doesn't overpower it.     

350
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,886
 It really compliments the fish.

 About two minutes?

some nice heat to it.

462
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,162
     I mean, it's just fun.     

463
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:21,165
   Sweetened, condensed milk,   
          heavy cream,          

464
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,234
dark Belgian chocolate, vanilla,

465
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:25,837
     and then we have ground    
         instant coffee.        

466
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,905
      And then we're going      
     to add the whiskey in.     

467
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:30,975
Throw that into the coffee press
    to press out any grounds    

468
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,511
       and any fine spots.      
 Once it's completely finished, 

469
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:35,513
        we're going to it       
   with the sweet chili sauce   

470
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:37,181
    and then it's ready to go   
         for our lumpia.        

471
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,250
                     ♪♪         

472
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:43,854
      It's nice and crispy      
 and the pork is full of flavor.

473
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,724
 It is like a Filipino egg roll.

474
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:49,260
           It's sweet           
   and it's different flavors   

475
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:52,396
         from different         
       parts of the world.      

476
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:55,399
  Privateer's Cove donates 100% 
         of its profits         

477
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,668
    to run a community center   
           run by us.           

478
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,069
      This was a big deal.      

479
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:02,006
 He's going to make great things
   happen for this community.   

480
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,142
  TRAXLER: We have a children's 
    center, a veteran center,   

481
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,476
     and we do free movies.     

482
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,745
 WOMAN: It serves many different
       community projects.      

483
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,280
         It's very Kona,        
       it's very relaxed,       

484
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,817
    and it's delicious food.    

485
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,086
     FIERI: Like his version    
     of seafood cannelloni.     

486
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:19,290
    We've spiced it up using    
a Hawaiian chili pepper Alfredo.

487
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,225
    Hawaiian chilies, garlic,   

488
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:24,362
           table salt           
  and some white wine vinegar.  

489
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,697
        And that will sit       
    for six months to a year.   

490
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:30,635
 We mix one tablespoon with one 
quart of cream. That's our base.

491
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,236
     Then we're going to use    
      another cup of cream      

492
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,837
   just to thin that out more.  

493
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,707
     Otherwise you're going     
         to burn people.        

494
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,777
      We heat up the cream      
 with a little bit of Parmesan. 

495
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,512
     Now we're going to make    
     our seafood cannelloni.    

496
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,581
    We're going to start out    
     with little bit of oil,    

497
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,915
         butter, garlic,        

498
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,385
      and a little teaspoon     
  of our Hawaiian chili sauce.  

499
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:51,055
     Now we're going to add     
   in the shrimp and scallops.  

500
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,122
     Throw it into the bowl.    

501
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,124
         The next thing         
      we've got is the crab     

502
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:58,596
and then from there, mozzarella,
    Parmesan, ricotta cheese.   

503
00:19:58,598 --> 00:19:59,931
     Some mascarpone cheese.    

504
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,866
        And that's going        
        to be a filling.        

505
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,867
And then we're going to throw it
       all in a piping bag      

506
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,136
 and we're going to pipe it out 
     on these pasta sheets.     

507
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,838
 We'll roll up the pasta sheets,

508
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,340
            top them            
 with a little bit of mozzarella

509
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,842
      and throw in the oven     
 for about eight minutes at 350.

510
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,744
     I put the chili Alfredo    
          on the plate          

511
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:14,945
   and then we're going to put  
         the cannelloni         

512
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,814
    right on top off the pan,   

513
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:19,884
  garnish it with green onions, 
      and then send it out.     

514
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,685
             SERVER:            
 Seafood cannelloni right there.

515
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,488
The cheese mixes it all together
    with Alfredo sauce on top   

516
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,957
          and the spice         
    from the Hawaiian chili.    

517
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,492
         Just excellent.        

518
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,828
              MAN:              
The sauce is creamy, has garlic.
      It's a lot of flavor.     

519
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,830
 It's pasta like I've never had,
     but I love the flavors.    

520
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,633
I want to give you something new
            in a way            

521
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:38,769
 that you don't normally see it,
  but we want to do it in a way 

522
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,972
        that we can help        
     our community as well.     

523
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,710
  Dishing out and giving back,  
  now that's the way to do it.  

524
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,579
  Just like how our other spots 
  are still doing it up right.  

525
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,848
        Like my pal Reno,       

526
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,852
        pounding out poke       
  at Fresh Catch all over Oahu. 

527
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:57,521
     And the Braun brothers,    
  serving straight off the hook 

528
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:59,657
   at Blue Water in San Diego.  

529
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:02,460
 Plus there's plenty more tales 
      to tell next time on      

530
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:04,127
       "Triple D Nation."       

531
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:05,930
                Rubbish man?    
     Rubbish?                   

532
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,466
                Rubbish man.    
              Pick up rubbish.  

533
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:09,734
       Trash.                   
            Yeah. Trash man.    

534
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:11,802
You call it rubbish, though?    
                 Yeah, rubbish. 

535
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,171
 Sounds a lot sexier            
   than trash man.              
                     [ Laughs ]
