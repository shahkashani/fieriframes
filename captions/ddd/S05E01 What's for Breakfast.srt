297
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,733
SHOULD CHANGE THE SIGN--        

298
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,269
    "WELCOME TO NEW ORLEANS--

311
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,828
I'LL TAKE AN APPLE GINGER

00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:45,637
        IT REMINDS ME           
OF MOWING THE LAWN AS A KID.    

316
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,239
              IT'S NOT A SIPPING

00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,370
                           STOP.
I DID STOP.                     

405
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,239

407
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,442
ALL I DID WAS HOLD IT.          

408
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,111

00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,714
               YOU WANT A TOWEL?
     ALL I DID                  
WAS POUR THE BATTER.

420
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:45,209
IT'S A PUTTY KNIFE.             
       WELL, AFTER WORK I PAINT.

421

             LITTLE POWDER,     
         I DIDN'T GET IT ON YOU.

THAT IS THE DENSEST PANCAKE     
      I'VE EVER HAD.            

425

I MEAN, IT'S LIGHT.             
   IT'S FLUFFY.                 

426
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,821
BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY            
     A HOTCAKE.                 

427
00:15:56,823 --> 00:16:00,424
   IT IS MORE LIKE CAKE         
THAN IT IS LIKE A PANCAKE.      
                         MM-HMM.

428
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,893

       I DON'T USE BUTTER.      

429
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:04,429
    I DON'T USE SYRUP ON THEM   
          OR ANYTHING.          

430
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:05,562

               PUMPKIN PANCAKES.

436
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,311
    HAVE YOU EVER HAD           
PUMPKIN PANCAKES ANYWHERE?      
                      NO.

    SOMEONE'S KITCHEN EATING.   

458
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,821
        A BUNCH OF OUR CUSTOMERS
                 CAME IN        

459
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,557

00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,428
RASPBERRY FRENCH TOAST.         
               IT WAS DELICIOUS.

462
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,363
           WE'RE GONNA START OFF
              WITH FOUR EGGS,   

463
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,431

           WE'RE GONNA PUT THIS 
               TO THE SIDE.     

466
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,838
                'CAUSE NOW THIS 
               IS CREAM CHEESE.

                   I DO IT SLOW.

00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:30,781
                 WE'VE GOT      
           SOME RASPBERRY JELLY.

471
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,583
IT TASTES LIKE SUGAR FUEL.      

472
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:36,721
    I HAVE ONE MORE INGREDIENT--
            CORN FLAKES.        
OH. SILLY RABBIT.               

473
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,524
   FIRST YOU TAKE SOME BUTTER,  
 SLAP IT DOWN ON YOUR HOT GRILL.

474
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,059
    THAT IS THE MIXTURE OF      
THE VANILLA, EGGS AND THE MILK. 

475
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:44,662
       DUNK IT IN MY CORN FLAKE 
         MIXTURE, BOTH SIDES,   

476
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,398

  I LIKE THE WAY                
YOU'RE DOING THIS.              

477
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,467
              SOON AS I FLIP IT,
                   I CUT IT.    

478
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:50,868
     TAKE THE FRENCH TOAST OFF. 

479
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,538
