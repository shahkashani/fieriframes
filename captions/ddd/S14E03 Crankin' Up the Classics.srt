                    NICELY DONE.

GONNA PUT IT IN A PAN HERE.     

338

                 'CAUSE YOU LIVE
                   ON THE EDGE.

346
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,818
        (foil rustling)         

347
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820

         PULL-APART TENDER.

       NOW CHOP IT UP. SO YOU'RE
         GONNA GET SOME CHUNKS. 
YOU'RE GONNA GET SOME CHUNKS.   

349

SO THAT'S OUR HOUSE SEASONING   
       FOR THE BURGER.          

352
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,397
 WE'LL ADD SOME                 
GRANULATED GARLIC               

353
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,633
  AND SOME GRANULATED ONION     
IN IT, AND RIGHT ON THE GRILL.  

354
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,367
            WHAT ARE WE BURNING?
MESQUITE WOOD.                  

355
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,503
      GIVES IT THAT             
GREAT FLAVOR, AND REALLY--

          THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD.

BURGER'S ABOUT MEDIUM           
     RIGHT NOW.                 

358
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,710
           AHH! THAT STEAK SAUCE
               IS RIDICULOUS.   

359
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:00,111
           I LIKE ALL THE LITTLE
          PARTICULATES IN THERE.

360
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,247
   TOP IT WITH A COUPLE         
OF PIECES OF SLICED BACON.      

361
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,783
   SMOKED CHEDDAR CHEESE.       
SLIDE THIS RIGHT IN THE OVEN    

362
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,452

365
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,191
SO THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE BURGER 
ON, IT ALMOST COOKS THE ONIONS--

366
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:14,658
                  THAT'S THE WAY
                  TO DO IT, MAN.

367
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,660
     AND THAT IS                
OUR CHOP HOUSE BURGER.

           AND WE LOVE CONTRAST.

376
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,885
             THEN YOU BACK IT UP
              WITH THE MESQUITE.

377
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,754
       ANYTIME YOU CAN PUT SMOKE
        ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS--

378
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:44,355
                   LOOK AT THAT.

379
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,225
                   FANTASTIC.   
                BUT THE KICKER--

00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,364
               IS THAT.         
     THAT SENDS IT OVER THE TOP.

382
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,234
                            MMM!

383
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,568
 (mouth full) THAT'S A DIFFERENT
       CATEGORY OF BURGER.      

384
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,037
          YOU ROCKED THAT, DUDE.

385
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,439
            GET READY. TROUBLE'S
            COMING TO YOUR DOOR.
(laughs)                        

386
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:02,640
  I HAVE A CHOP HOUSE BURGER.   

387
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,842
      THE MEAT TOGETHER--       
   THE MIXTURE--IS WONDERFUL.   

388
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,645
LISTEN, THAT STEAK SAUCE        
   HE PUTS ON THERE--           

389
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,979
MMM!                            
         IT'S AWESOME, ISN'T IT?

390
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,715
FORGET ABOUT IT.                
       BURGERS COMING UP.       

391
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,984
THE THING THAT MAKES THIS PLACE 
           WHAT IT IS           

392
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,453
     IS THE DEDICATION THAT     
   KENNY PUTS IN THE KITCHEN.   

393
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:16,720
      WHERE'D YOU LEARN TO COOK,
                KENNY?          

394
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,857
I'VE BEEN COOKING SINCE I WAS   
          ABOUT 15.             

395
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:19,991
I WAS DOING STEAKHOUSES         
      IN DALLAS.                

396
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,392
I TURNED 50 AND I THOUGHT,      

397
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:22,927
   "WELL, IT'S TIME             
FOR A MIDLIFE CRISIS."          

398
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,529
   I COULDN'T GET               
THE RED CONVERTIBLE,            

399
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,064
SO I GOT THE RESTAURANT.        

400
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,266
     <i> AND DECIDED TO STICK</i>      
       <i> WITH THE BASICS.</i>        

401
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:29,934
              BURGER GOING DOWN.

402
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,669
     AND BEFORE YOU FINISH      
       YOUR FIRST BURGER,       

403
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,204
       YOU'LL BE PLANNING       
      YOUR SECOND BURGER.       

404
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,873
      <i> AND THERE'S PLENTY</i>       
        <i> TO CHOOSE FROM.</i>        

405
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,541
        TEN BURGERS ON THE MENU?
RIGHT.                          

406
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,609
      BUT EACH ONE'S GOT A FUNKY
              UNIQUENESS.       
YES.                            

407
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,210

               THE HOLY TRINITY.

503
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:57,708
BUT WE'RE REALLY NOT            
 GONNA SAUTÉ THEM.              

504
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,309
I WANT KINDA CRUNCHY            
     IN THERE.                  
                      ALL RIGHT.

505

   THE BAY LEAVES.              

507
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,383
A LITTLE BIT OF PAPRIKA.        
   A LITTLE CAYENNE.            

508
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:08,119
        NOT VERY MUCH CAYENNE.  
      AIN'T GONNA BE VERY SPICY.
NOT YET.                        

509
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:10,387
GRANULATED GARLIC. ALL RIGHT,   
 THEN WE GOT SOME CLAM BASE.    

510
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,056
                   CHICKEN BASE?
AND A LITTLE BIT                
OF CHICKEN BASE.                

511
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,058
                           OKAY.
THEN WE'RE GONNA ADD            
 ALL OF OUR WATER.              

512
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,327
ABOUT 3 GALLONS OF WATER.       
             JUST DUMP AND STIR?

513
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:17,462
DUMP AND STIR.                  

514
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:18,996
AND THEN YOU JUST LET IT GO     
    FOR A LITTLE WHILE.         

515
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,265
BUT NO COOKING THE SAUSAGE DOWN,
     RENDERING OUT THE FAT?     

516
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,533
NO, I ACTUALLY LIKE THE FAT     
         IN THERE.              

517
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,202
  WE PUT IT IN                  
AT THE VERY END.                

518
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:25,470
               ARE YOU GONNA PUT
                A ROUX IN THERE?

519
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,004
     YEAH, WE GOT               
A DARK CHOCOLATE ROUX.          

520
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:29,273
      THAT'S ROUX-LICIOUS, DUDE.
             LOOK AT THAT!      

521
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,209
    WHEN DOES THE SAUSAGE GO IN?
RIGHT AFTER THAT.               

522
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,743
           IF YOU DON'T HURRY UP
                  WITH IT,      

523
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,278
              IT'S GONNA BE DOWN
               TO HALF A BATCH. 
(laughs)                        

524
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,280
ALL RIGHT, SO WE TAKE SOME      
OF THE STOCK OUT OF THERE,      

525
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,883
AND WE'RE GONNA TEMPER THE ROUX 
   WITH IT. GET A NICE STIR.    

526
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,751
       YOU'RE THINNING THAT ROUX
           OUT A LITTLE BIT.    

527
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,154
         BRINGING IT UP TO TEMP.
AND IT REALLY--                 

528
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,355
 TEMPERING THE ROUX KEEPS IT    
FROM MAKING LITTLE DUMPLINGS.   
                      DUMPLINGS.

529
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,758
YEAH.                           

530
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,092
IT'S TIDYING UP                 
 REALLY NICE.                   

531
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,028
                  NOW WHAT'S UP?
THE SAUSAGE.                    

532
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,765
NEXT WE'LL TAKE OUR OKRA.       

533
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,166

535
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,170

536
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,705
CRAB MEAT. CRAWFISH.            

537
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:03,440
     NOW IT MAKES SENSE THAT YOU
    PUT THAT CLAM BASE IN THERE.

538
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,709
    STIR IT ALL UP NOW. HOW LONG
     TILL WE'RE READY TO SERVE? 

539
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,912
TEN MINUTES.                    
                  JUST TO GET   
                EVERYTHING WARM?

540
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:09,780
 JUST BRING EVERYTHING          
BACK UP TO TEMPERATURE.         

541
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,049
      SERVED OVER A LITTLE RICE.
THAT'S IT.                      

542
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,852
AND A LITTLE BIT                
 OF THE JUICE.                  
                      ALL RIGHT.

543
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,587
            IT'S A CORNUCOPIA   
         OF VEGETABLES IN THERE.

544
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,589
                I LIKE THE OKRA.

545
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:19,723
                            MMM!

546
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,192
               (mouth full)     
         VEGGIES DO HAVE CRUNCH.

547
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:22,793
   AND THEN THERE'S SOME OF THAT
        SAUSAGE RIGHT THERE,    

548
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,728
     THAT EARL CAMPBELL SAUSAGE.

549
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,797
                            MMM!

550
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,599
               HOW MUCH IS THAT?
 $4.49.                         

551
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,335
        DUDE, IN A BOWL PROBABLY
         BIGGER THAN I CAN EAT? 

552
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,104
                          $4.49?
IT'S A BARGAIN.                 

553
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,873
                            MMM!

554
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,474
                   COME ON DOWN.

555
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,210
              (mouth full)      
        YOU'RE A ROCK STAR, MAN.
THANK YOU.                      

556
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:41,746
        MAKE ME UP ANOTHER BOWL.
             EARL'S WAITING.    
ALL RIGHT.                      

557
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:42,880
  THE BIG 'OLE BOWL OF GUMBO.   

558
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,987
               WHAT DO YOU THINK
               ABOUT THAT GUMBO?
GOOD. CRAWFISH.                 

559
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:53,291
                   THAT SAUSAGE.
I THINK THE SAUSAGE             
   KICKS IT OFF.                

560
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,092
THE CHEF MAY KNOW               
WHAT HE'S DOING.                

561
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:58,863
             AND IT'S REAL-DEAL?
IT'S THE REAL DEAL.             

562
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,367
YOU DO A GOOD JOB, THOUGH,      
   MAN, WITH YOUR SHOW.         

563
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,901
YOU HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE, TOO.  

564
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,771
MY MOM TOLD ME SOMETHING        
       ONE TIME.                

565
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:08,639
IT TAKES A LOT TO BE            
  NASTY TO PEOPLE.              

566
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,975
IT DON'T TAKE THAT MUCH         
  TO BE NICE TO THEM.           

567
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,710
AND I'VE ALWAYS TRIED           
  TO REMEMBER THAT.             

568
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,979
          I CANNOT TELL YOU,    
      THIS IS, WITHOUT QUESTION,

569
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:18,115
     ONE OF THE GREATEST MOMENTS
        IN TRIPLE "D" HISTORY,  

570
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:21,385
         AND--AND ME PERSONALLY 
        AS JUST GUY FIERI, SO...

571
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,321
              THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELL, THANK YOU                 
VERY MUCH, MAN.                 

572
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,788
                 YOU'RE AWESOME.

573
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,890
             THAT'S PRETTY MUCH 
            LIST IS OVER FOR ME.

574
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,793
THAT'S--                        
           YEAH, I HAVE TO CLIMB
                 A PYRAMID      

575
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:30,461
             AND RIDE A UNICORN,
                THEN I'M DONE.  

576
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:31,929
          (both laugh)          

577
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:34,064
  SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP,   
        BUT DON'T WORRY,        

578
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,934
 THERE'S PLENTY MORE TRIPLE "D" 
  JOINTS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!  

579
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,669
    I'LL BE LOOKING FOR YOU     
           NEXT WEEK            

580
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:41,472
     ON "DINERS, DRIVE-INS      
          AND DIVES."           

581
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,674
"NO, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT       
   THAT GUY THAT DOES           

582
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,142
THE COOKING TIME                
WITH THAT HAIR?"                

583
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,610
THEN I SAY, "OH, MAN."          

584
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,145
WE'RE REAL FANS, MAN.           
  ON FRIDAY NIGHT,              

585
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:50,281
YOU'RE THE DEAL, MAN.           

586
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:53,017
I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.    
 WHEN YOU'RE ON THAT SHOW--     

587
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,352
                LET ME JUST--   
            LET ME JUST BREATHE.
NO, NO, LISTEN.                 

588
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:57,354
             LET ME JUST BREATHE
                FOR A SECOND.   
NO, LISTEN.                     

589
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,390
          (laughs) THIS HAS BEEN
                 AMAZING.
