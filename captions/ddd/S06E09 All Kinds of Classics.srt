    FOR AN HOUR.                

308

        THAT YOU WORK ALL THIS  
       INGREDIENT BASE TOGETHER.

320
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:57,181
    IF YOU WERE WORKING THIS    
 EACH TIME AND YOU HAD THE FISH,

321
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,184
          IT WOULD BE FISH MUSH.
OH, YEAH.                       

322

00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:51,789
 YOU JUST INCORPORATE IT ENOUGH 
   TO GET IT OUT OF THE BOWL,   

397
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:54,258
    BUT YOU STILL GOT           
SOME WORK TO DO, CORRECT?       
                        EXACTLY.

398
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,727

404
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,475
                JUST BELOW 400, 
               12 TO 15 MINUTES.

405
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,278
  HIT IT WITH                   
A LITTLE BUTTER.                
      ABOUT TWO TO THREE MINUTES
        BEFORE WE PULL 'EM OUT. 

406
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:17,482
I'M GONNA TRY TO PICK OUT

                  LITTLE PAPRIKA
                 FOR SOME COLOR.

417
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:41,673
I DIG IT. OKAY.

  AND IT'S LIGHT,               

421
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:52,049

          TO IT.                

422
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,252

WOW. MMM. KILLER.               

425
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,723
    I'D SAY THESE ARE SOME OF   
THE BEST BISCUITS I'VE EVER HAD.

426

   THIS IS ACTUALLY SELF-RISING.
COARSE GROUND PEPPER.           

448
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:51,775
        SO WE'LL WHISK THIS UP. 
       THEN WE GOT THE EGG WASH.

  ON TOP OF THAT,               

454

          WITH PEPPER AND SALT. 

498
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:40,851
          POUR IT IN A PAN--    
     SMALL BATCH, ARTISAN GRITS.
AND WHERE ARE THEY?             

499
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,588
 CAN I SEE WHERE THEY'RE COMING?
      GET THOSE IN THE CAR.     

500
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,590
         MAKE A LOAF OUT OF IT. 

501
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,658
         WE START BY MAKING     
     A COUPLE LITTLE GRIT CAKES,

502
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:50,595
       AND WE'LL FLOUR THESE UP.
 OKAY, SO WHAT                  
DO WE GOT HERE?                 

503
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,664
      GOT SOME                  
FRIED GREEN TOMATOES.           
          YEP. WE PRE-PREPPED   
       THE FRIED GREEN TOMATOES.

504
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,132
THE CHICKEN.                    
             THAT'S THE CHICKEN.

505
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:57,801
WE'LL PUT THE FRIED GREEN TOMATO
 AND THE CHICKEN IN ONE BASKET. 

506
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,803
              PUT THE GRIT CAKES
                 IN THE OTHER.  

507
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,806
         THOSE WILL TAKE THREE, 
          FOUR MINUTES TO FRY.  

508
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,808
     WE TAKE THE JOHNSTON COUNTY
      COUNTRY HAM, SLICED THIN. 

509
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:07,612
THIS IS SOUTHERN PROSCIUTTO.    
                     YOU GOT IT.

510
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,012
           WHITE SHARP CHEDDAR. 

511
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:11,482

   A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT ON THAT 

512
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,484
           AND MELT THAT CHEESE.
          THAT'S A TOPPING ALSO?
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

513
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:15,486
       WHILE THAT'S HAPPENING,  
    WE'RE MAKING PIMENTO CHEESE.

514
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,020

            MAYONNAISE VERSION. 

517
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,694
  THE PIMENTOS--                
THOSE WERE JARRED.              

518
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,896
             SEASON IT UP,      
       SALT AND PEPPER TO TASTE.

519
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:28,966
             AND ROASTED GARLIC.
WOW.                            

520

           SESAME OIL AND THYME.
AND THEN THIS IS BUTTER.

00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,578
    THAT'S THE MOST UNIQUE      
PIMENTO CHEESE I'VE EVER TRIED. 

524
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,979
IT'S GOOD, THOUGH.              

525
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,448
   I THINK WE'RE GOOD. PLATE 'EM
      UP, AND WE'LL TOP 'EM.    

526
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,050
