126
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,485
All right, chicken broth.       

127
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,956
Then we start adding            
good old tomato paste.

        Just keeps cooking down.
Keep cooking in, yep.           

130
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,899
Then we add tomatoes...         

131
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:01,900
       salt...

     ...parsley,

...and red-pepper flakes.       

136
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:14,512
 By touch, by feel,             
 and my last one's a            
 pow right there.               

137
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,649
  You stir that in,             
   and that's it.

          [ Sizzling ]          

141
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,459
We use brown meat only          
    in this dish.               

142
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,794
  And this is where             
we overseason the chicken,      

143
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,130
 because we're gonna            
lose a lot of it in the pan.    

144
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:34,399
              So, brown it off, 
                 both sides.

   2 1/2.                       

149
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,016

     Yep.                       

150
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,819
           And then we're gonna 
        serve that over polenta.
Yep.                            

151
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,588
So, nice, steaming-hot          
    polenta here.               

152

 All right, chicken.            

153
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,828
        At least that's not like
               9,000 degrees.   

154
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,096
          Where are you gonna go
                 with that?     

155
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:05,964
     Right here.                
 We had her dialed.             

156
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,904
                 And you get    
         an extra thigh with it.
  That's it. Yep.               

157
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,306
                       Mmm.     
 And mix this up.

          The sauce cooking down
            for a couple hours. 

159
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:19,311
  A little Parmesan             
    for garnish,                

160
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,179
 parsley for color.             

161
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,782
       If that isn't old-school 
  Italian, I don't know what is.

162
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,484
   Just look at that chicken.   

163
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,852
                    Mmm!        

164
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,454
       I tell you, that is about

165
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:32,457
      one of the most comforting
            things you can eat. 
   Yep.                         

166
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,993
                It's exactly    
         what I wanted it to be.

167
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:38,196
           You said you would do
           an old-school Italian
           chicken cacciatore.  

168
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,598
                   This is      
      what it should taste like.

169
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,134
               Tender chicken,  
               creamy polenta.  

170
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,402
              A little texture  
              to that polenta   

171
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,670
              still not cooked  
              all the way out.  

172
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,406
                 Everything     
             done the right way.

173
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,475
               Excellent dish.  
               Just excellent.  

174
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,377
                And your pops   
             deserves mad props.

175
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,913
                    Mmm!        

176
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,416
     Chicken cacciatore up.     

177
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,085
     There's nothing like it    
         in this county.        

178
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,354
         Really tender,         
       really good sauce.       

179
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:05,156
 Pretty much just like mom made,
        but even better.        

180
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,591
           Sorry, mom.          

181
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,360
                 It's being     
            in this environment,

182
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,363
    sitting in the old Ivanhoe, 
   and the way you decorated it.

183
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:14,031
        You guys really put the 
  nostalgia back into the place.

184
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,034
One of the most moving things   
that we went through --         

185
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,302
the community showed up.        

186
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,369
People would show up --         

187
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,638
 a husband and wife             
with a bucket of tools --       

188
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,908
and say, "What do you           
want us to do today?"           
        I think my uncle Dane --

189
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,976
                Dane Cowan --   
          did some work for you.
    Oh, yeah.                   

190
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,445
They put our windows in.        
             Yep. Saw a bunch   
           of pictures of that. 

191
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,449
   Everybody was glad to hear   
 that the Ivanhoe was back open.

192
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,918
          Four minutes          
   on the sausage and risotto.  

193
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,053
                 You taught     
    half of these meals to Dave.

194
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,722
              Out of everything 
             he has on the menu,

195
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:38,856
           what's your favorite?

196
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,124
 I like the risotto.            

197
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,927
  Risotto, Italian sausage, up. 

198
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:44,596
 WOMAN: The Ferndale meat market
       makes the sausage,       

199
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,064
      so it's locally made.     

200
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,599
   It has really good flavor.   

201
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:49,601
             All right, brother,
                   hit it.      

202
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,469
   So, we're gonna              
drop some sausage in            

203
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,938
right in the water there.       

204
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,541
We use olive oil and butter     
     to start.                  
                          Okay. 

205
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,009
            Flavor and browning.

206
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,279
 Add garlic.                    
                Garlic in, okay.

207
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,014
I like to open the garlic up    
    a little bit.               

208
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,549
                Arborio rice.   
     Yep.                       

209
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,687
    So, you just                
get that toasted brown.         

210
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,356
 Our chicken stock.             

211
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:15,093
Then we just keep adding slowly 
and letting it cook down.       

212
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,428
               This will take   
              about 25 minutes  

213
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,697
      to get this risotto cooked
           all the way through. 

214
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,265
      The point                 
 of adding saffron.             

215
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,702
        A lot of saffron, buddy.

216
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:26,504
It's a natural resource         
  here in Humboldt.             

217
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,306
Then we just let that blend in, 

218
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,876
and the rice will finish off.   

219
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,414
All right, last step --         
nice Parmesan cheese.           

220
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,587
      Good-looking risotto, man.
   Yeah.                        

221
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:43,889
 You can't be cheap             
   on the saffron.              

222
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,158
        Hey!                    
  Italian sausage.              

223
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,763
      Perfect.                  

224
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,266
          At least it's not hot.

225
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:55,767
        Yeah.                   

226
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,138
   Parmesan cheese              
 and fresh parsley.             

227
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,807
  Risotto Milanese              
with homemade Italian sausage.  

228
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,210
     And that's what you call it
                 right here.    

229
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:10,949
                    Mmm!        

230
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:14,218
               I'm very picky   
               about risotto.   

231
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,022
                 The grains     
             of the Arborio rice

232
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:20,291
               are very tender  
            but firm, not mushy.

233
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,426
              A lot of saffron. 

234
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,227
                    Mmm!

00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,158
This is a very influential      
 person in my life.             

457
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,894
When I started the pretzel cart,
I was in sixth grade,           

458
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,429
   and by the time              
I got to eighth grade,          

459
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,165
 I was in full force            
of Awesome Pretzel Cartness.    

460
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,500
Now, Miss Moriarty --           
   she inspires me              

461
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,436
   to do a report               
on the history of the pretzel.  

462
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,105
So, we do National History Day, 

463
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,774
  and I win.                    
     And you get to go to state.

464
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:33,444

I just automatically won.       

465
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,512
       So they                  
sent me to nationals.           

466
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,381

00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,677
            This big courier bag
                 of apples?     
           Yeah.                

568
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,479
    I should probably check this
       and make sure it's okay. 

569
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:30,814
            How many do you eat 
            when you're picking?

570
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,283
          Oh, I usually         
      have a couple a day.      

571
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:33,350
                     Really?    
            Yeah.               

572
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,885
                You guys look   
           pretty lean and mean.

573
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:37,087
             Doesn't look like  
             you've been picking
             bacon or anything. 

574
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,956
   [ Laughs ]                   

575
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,958
     That is a Spitzenburg.     

576
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,561
   That was Thomas Jefferson's  
         favorite apple.        
                        Oh!     

577
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:46,230
         This is the best apple 
       I've ever had in my life.

578
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:48,299
               It's as crunchy  
                as a carrot.    

579
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:50,567
            All right, I think  
            the only thing I got
            to do now is say,   

580
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,536
              will you teach me 
    the art of the cider-making?

581
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,705
           All right.           
Yeah.                           

582
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,775
     FIERI: And while they      
     import about 25 tons of    
     apples for their cider,    

583
00:22:57,777 --> 00:23:01,711
    they're growing the other   
  70 tons they need right here. 

584
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,380
              CLIF:             
 We call this fresh apple cider.

585
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,917
       It's unpasteurized       
     and it's pressed fresh,    

586
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:09,453
          chilled down,         
      and immediately sold.     

587
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:12,389
        Let's get this straight.
          The press is how old? 

588
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,258
    It's a 1916.                

589
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,094
             So, this is really 
     a hodgepodge of everything?
            Yeah.               

590
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:20,063
 A mix of tart, older varieties,
      like the Smith cider,     

591
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,199
    and then a good mix of,     
    like, sweeter varieties,    

592
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,668
           like Fujis           
      and blushing goldens,     

593
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,069
        and, like Mutsus.       

594
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,138
                You can tell    
     just by looking at each one

595
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,273
                what they are?  
           Yeah.                

596
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:30,941
       How many gallons of juice
               will this make?  

597
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:33,477
          That's maybe          
        20 or 30 gallons.       

598
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:35,279
      Something like that,      
            I'd say.            

599
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:37,281
            All right, so,      
            can you just walk me
            through the process?

600
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:39,349
            So, yeah,           
   apples get dumped in here,   

601
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,018
      just out of the box,      
           washed off.          

602
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,020
      They go get a little      
  extra wash in the water here. 

603
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,354
               So, the apples   
                 go in here.    

604
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,289
          They'll just bunch up 
          as much and fall back?

605
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,359
There's someone here            
who's kind of, you know,        
assisting so that --            

606
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,829
          I know. So not too    
          many people are in the
          tunnel at one time?   

607
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,764
   Exactly. Yeah.               
                 So, it goes up.

608
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,432
  This hammer mill              
  grinds it all up.             

609
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,368
                  That just     
           pulverizes the apple.
Yeah, it pulverizes them.       

610
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,305
And then this green             
hopper -- this fills            
up with the pulp.               

611
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:02,840
There's a little trapdoor       
     under here.                

612
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:06,176
              So, you're gonna  
             pull the pulp door.
   Yep.                         

613
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,645
And we have these cloths.       
This is a press cloth.          

614
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:11,381
            We got this trolley,
            essentially, that   
            moves on the track. 

615
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,183
              We have our cloth 
             that lays in there.

616
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,519
                 And, yeah,     
        this fills up with pulp.

617
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:18,656
        You pull this trapdoor. 
     Pulp goes right into there.

618
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:21,391
    And then you fold this up --
 Over itself?                   

619
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:24,261
           Yeah, you fold it up 
  into one unit, just like that.

620
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:25,529
    You put a divider on it.    

621
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:28,598
Lay that back on it.            
       Do the whole cloth again.

622
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,600
        How many people?        

623
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:30,600
      Two.                      
                          Two.  

624
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:31,935
            You two?            
  Yeah.                         

625
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,571
     Oh, this I got to see.     

626
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,380
     CLIF: Ready to hit it?     
FIERI: Okay. Here we go!        

627
00:24:47,687 --> 00:24:50,754
        Ohh!                    
  Get out of here.              

628
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:53,757
 It's like we're                
 sending apples into            
 a big wood chipper.            

629
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,626
      FIERI: There are particles
                of apple-ness   

630
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,095
            spraying everywhere.

631
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:59,930
          There is nowhere safe.

632
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:05,369
              I got apple juice 
                all over me!    

633
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,705
  Let me just clean you up here 
            a second.           

634
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:12,843
    But look at this natural    
           just juice.          

635
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,978
              Ahh!              

636
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,848
            It's like           
      nectar from the gods!     

637
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,784
DREW: All right, well,          
shall we squeeze this           
cheese, as they say?            

638
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:22,553
                 All right,     
           we're ready to juice.

639
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,858
                Oh-ho-ho-ho!    
      Yeah.                     

640
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:31,862
                  See, I am     
       such a fan of this joint.

641
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:34,265
       This is like getting milk
          right from the udder. 

642
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,402
                  Awesome.      

643
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:41,338
                 Getting it     
            right off the tap --

644
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,007
                  okay? --      

645
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:46,010
      it tastes exactly the same

646
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:48,012
              as when I buy it  
             out of the cooler. 
   That's right.                

647
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:49,413
               That's amazing.  

648
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:50,981
  FIERI: So, now...             

649
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:55,486
                  So, yeah.     

650
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:57,487
     And there's                
nothing we can do with this?    

651
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,690
This just makes compost?        
                        Yeah.   

652
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:01,692
     Couldn't we                
sell this to somebody to make,  

653
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:05,029
 like, apple snacks             
    or something?               

654
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:07,097
       Yeah, I think, you know, 
   people have made horse treats

655
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,499
                 out of it,     
             that sort of thing.

656
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:10,901
You know, it's food grade,      
  so, you know,                 

657
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,103
    I always let                
the kindergarten kids           

658
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:15,105
   that come tour               
      eat some.                 

659
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:17,174
 Kind of dry, but...            

660
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:19,643
      You got to be able to     
   make something out of this.  

661
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:28,152
 They have the best apple cider 
       that I've ever had.      

662
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:31,422
    They're top of the line.    

663
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,260
             No wonder you guys 
           have been in business

664
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,796
                   and are      
             so highly regarded 

665
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:40,464
           in Humboldt County --

666
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:41,932
                     now        
           all over the country.

667
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,802
               But this is --   
          I am blown away, guys.

668
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,070
                What a visit.   

669
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:48,138

 on this side of the Eel River, 

679
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:18,068
     I figured I'd cruise up    
     Highway 101 a few miles    

680

           at Eureka High School

694
00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:55,972
  and I was teaching agriculture

00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:58,308
          one of my students    
          came in and said, "How
          do you make cheese?"  

696
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,510
         I said, "I don't know."

704
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:21,198

have this any closer

is if you had the dairy

00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:01,424
               And we're gonna  
       gently start to roll this

778
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,360

            stick back together.

     after that?                

780
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:11,368
                 We're gonna    
          drain it down halfway.

00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,370
                 About 12.5%    
            of this total volume

782
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,706
               is gonna end up  
                 as cheese.     

783

of everything we see here       

785
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,643
will turn into cheese?          
              And the rest of it

786
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:21,844
                  goes out      
              to feed the cows. 

787
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:22,979
         No.

788
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,448
         And then we're going to
               put a filter on  

789
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,384
               and we're gonna  
             put cold water back

790
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,119
               and we're gonna  
             cool the curd down 

791
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,921
            to about 84 degrees.

792
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:33,123
             And, at that point,
              the cold water's  

793
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:35,392
             gonna be reabsorbed
               into the curd,   

794
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,795
           and that's how we get
           the additional yield.

795
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:42,665
          Then they're gonna go 
         another 15, 20 minutes.

796
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:46,737
      And then they're going to 
    drain all of the liquid off.

797
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:49,139
     And when they got the curd 
  down on the bottom of the vat,

798
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:51,341
         they're gonna go ahead 
         and they will add salt.

799
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:57,614
       And then the cheese curds
       are put into these boxes.

800
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:01,818
          And they'll be pressed

802
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:08,291
            And in the morning, 
        they're gonna unwrap it.

803
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,293
        And they're gonna put it
        in a vacuum-packed bag. 

804
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,362
          And then they're gonna

   And the result of all this   

806

   Yeah.                        

884
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:34,731
                You'd just be   
        fighting it for a while?
    [ Laughs ] Yeah.            

885
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:37,334
 Now, are we gonna let this rest
         before we roll it out? 

886
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:39,669
     We're gonna                
dump it onto our surface        

887
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:42,038
and we're gonna knead it        
for about eight minutes.        

888
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,880
              Let's talk about  
             the caramel sauce. 

889
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,349
  All right, first,             
we're gonna add the butter.     

890
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:56,953
 Gonna let that melt            
 just for a minute.             

891
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:58,855
   Then I'm gonna               
add my brown sugar to that.     

892
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:03,426
 Now we're gonna add            
our corn syrup to this.         
                 There you go.  

893
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,262
      And then                  
we'll add our cream.            

894
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,302
        Okay,                   
we'll spread that around        

895
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,071
      and we'll                 
crush the pecans up.            

896
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,441
           That's a lot of nuts.

897
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:19,576
        Yeah,                   
it's quite a bit of nuts.       

898
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:22,245
Now we're gonna mix the         
brown sugar and the cinnamon.   

899
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:24,781
         You buy the brown sugar
           by the tanker truck? 

900
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:26,316
      And where's this gonna go?

901
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:28,318
  This is gonna go              
on the cinnamon-roll dough      

902
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,452
when I get it rolled out.

      coated with butter...     

905
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:40,330
           and covered          
 with cinnamon and brown sugar. 

906
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:42,265
    Then it's rolled back up,   

907
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:43,867
          sliced thick,         

908
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:46,603
           and dropped          
  on top of caramel and pecans. 

909
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:49,205
Okay, now we're gonna let this  
rise for about 45 minutes       

910
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,808
and then we're gonna bake them  
in a 350-degrees oven

00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:09,572
                  Okay, so,     
        we brown down the bacon.

990
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,008
              Then we'll add in 
       the flour, make the roux.

991
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,210
        That'll be the beginning
                of the gravy.   
    Yep.                        

992
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,080
Stir this till it's brown.      

993
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:18,615
   Throw some milk              
    in there now.               
                        Okay.   

994
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,351
     Fast. Fast.                

995
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,287
         Faster, faster, faster!
Faster. [ Laughs ]              

996
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:26,622
              So, that's gonna  
                 tighten up.    
     Yep.                       

997
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,125
We're gonna add our bacon.      

998
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:33,229
Little salt and pepper.         

999
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,865
 Now onto the scone.            
                    Excellent.  

1000
00:40:47,646 --> 00:40:50,779
               That looks like  
    a good heaping helping of --

1001
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,949
          Look at that now, huh?

1002
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:59,522
               That was awesome.
 [ Laughs ] Thank you.          

1003
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:02,458
   It's great. I mean, it's what
        you love about a scone. 

1004
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,261
               Nice and light,  
           but then super-savory

1005
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:07,931
     with the ham and the cheese
               and the onions.  

1006
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:10,033
             That's ridiculous. 

1007
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,072
        I love the smell.       

1008
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:18,107
         It is amazing.         

1009
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:20,877
    Every time you come here,   

1010
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:22,345
     you try something new,     
   and it's your new favorite.  

1011
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,414
                   This is      
    what Ferndale's all about --

1012
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,417
         scratch-made, homemade,

1013
00:41:27,419 --> 00:41:29,619
                locally owned   
                and operated.   

1014
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:31,187
                  Excellent job.
 [ Laughs ] Thank you.          

1015
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:38,827
          So, that's it         
    for this special edition    

1016
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,897
of "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives"
          in Ferndale.          

1017
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:44,167
     I'll see you next time     
         on "Triple D."         

1018
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:46,435
   You want me to               
dump it in as I go, or...       

1019
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,837
             If you could get it
             to come from there 

1020
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,506
                into the bag    
            by itself magically,

1021
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:51,507
          I'll definitely watch.
Okay, let's watch.              

1022
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,642
             'Cause you can get 
  right out of the meat business

1023
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,712
                  if you can    
               make that happen.

I'm not Uri Geller.             
                         Dang!  

1025
00:41:57,582 --> 00:41:59,616
'Cause if that was gonna happen,
                  I was in.
