       MAKE THOSE INTO PICKLES. 

97
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,632
     WE MAKE OUR OWN KETCHUP.   
   WE PUT LOCAL HONEY IN THERE. 

98
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,500
ADD THE MAYONNAISE. YOU MAKE    
A THOUSAND ISLAND DRESSING.     

99
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,502
AND THEN--                      
                   LOOK AT THAT.

100
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,571
           I DON'T EVEN KNOW    
      IF I'M WORTHY TO EAT THIS.

101
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,640
         THEY SHOULD HAVE A SHOT
         OF THAT IN THE LOUVRE. 

102
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:05,644
                  I DON'T       
           HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY.

103
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,713
         LOOK AT THE GOOSEBUMPS 
               ON MY ARM.       

104
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,649
         THAT BREAD, THAT KRAUT,
           WITH THAT CORNED--   

105
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,584
      I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S BETTER
            ON ALL OF THIS.     

106
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,320
            NOW WE'RE GONNA HIT 
           THE THOUSAND ISLAND. 

107
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:16,855
                         MMM.   

108
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,524
    I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU SHOULD
       ACCEPT MONEY FOR THESE.  

109
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,860
        BRING US YOUR FIRSTBORN.
         RICH, BUTTERY,         
          IT'S YUMMY.           

110
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,730
        ALL THE STUFF COMES     
  RIGHT FROM THE GARDEN OUTSIDE.

111
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:27,265
OH, THAT'S GREAT.               
             ISN'T THAT AMAZING?
               I-I-I LOVE THAT. 

112
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,800
NO, WHAT'S AMAZING              
     IS YOU.                    
      ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS.      

113
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:31,670
  I HAVEN'T HAD ONE ITEM HERE   
     THAT I HAVEN'T LIKED.      
HOW WAS BRUNCH TODAY?           

114
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,738
                   IT WAS GREAT.
        ALL OF HER FOOD         
         IS BEAUTIFUL,          

115
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,873
          AND IT TASTES         
      AS GOOD AS IT LOOKS.      

116
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,875
HOLY GRANOL-Y,                  
HOW WAS THAT?                   
           I LOVE IT.           

117
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,877
         WHEN IT'S MADE         
       IN-HOUSE EVERY DAY,      

118
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,813
      YOU CAN REALLY TELL       
        THE DIFFERENCE.         
                          TA-DA.

119
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,482
  I FEEL LIKE I'M TAKING A BIT  
OF THE MONA LISA RIGHT NOW. MMM.

120
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,684
   IF YOUR KID IS HOOKED        
ON SUGAR CEREAL, BRING HIM      

121
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,953
  TO THE RECOVERY CENTER        
AND GIVE HIM SOME OF THIS.      
                      (laughing)

00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,756
        TONS OF FLAVOR.         
YOU GET ALL THE LOCAL FRUITS    
        WITH GRANOLA            

123
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,758
THAT SHE DOES HERSELF.          
          WHAT MAKES IT SO GOOD?

124
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,495

     REALLY CREATIVE IDEAS.     
              STEEL-CUT OATMEAL.

125
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:59,831
   (woman) WITH BAKED APPLE.    
  IT TASTES LIKE AN APPLE PIE.  
         IT'S OUT OF THIS WORLD.

126
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,766
     WAFFLES, PEACH COMPOTE,    
         CARAMEL ON TOP.        

127
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,369
   I REALLY LOVE                
BISCUITS AND GRAVY.             

128
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,571
      FOUR MINUTES TILL BISCUIT.
HOMEMADE BISCUITS,              
 CAN'T BEAT THAT.               

129
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,506
   HOUSE-MADE SAUSAGE GRAVY--   
         IT'S FANTASTIC.        

130
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,842
WHAT KIND OF SAUSAGE            
   ARE WE MAKING?               
               BREAKFAST SAUSAGE

131
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:14,646
      THAT THEN WE'RE GONNA TURN
          INTO SAUSAGE GRAVY.   

132
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,915
        SO THIS IS PORK BUTT    
     WITH A NICE AMOUNT OF FAT. 

133
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,718

135

   WE FOUND ONE OF TWO CERTIFIED
     ORGANIC BUTCHERS IN OHIO.  

136
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:26,658

                      ICE WATER.
AND THE ICE WATER               
   BECAUSE...                   

140
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,667
   IT BINDS EVERYTHING AND ALSO 
    HELPS DISSOLVE THE SPICES.  

141
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:39,404
   GROUND CLOVES, GROUND GINGER,
      GROUND CAYENNE PEPPER,

    AND SAGE AND PORK           
ARE LIKE MICKEY AND MOUSE.

    THROUGH MY HAIR.

       LOLA AND BAR SYMON.

GET A RUNDOWN HERE.

GOES TO WASTE IN THIS JOINT.    

163
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,591

164
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,926

      YOU WANT ME TO WHISK      
        WHILE YOU POUR?         
               OH, YOU ARE GOOD.

                            OHH.
    OH, MAYBE THE BEST GRAVY    
        IN THE COUNTRY.         

174
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:58,750
               YOU ARE SO KIND. 

175
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,686
             THIS IS THE TOASTED
              CHEDDAR BISCUITS. 

176
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,756
WHY ARE THERE TWO PLATES?       
JUST YOU AND ME, HEATHER?       

177
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:07,625
                   PUT SCALLIONS
                   RIGHT ON TOP.
WOW.                            

178
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:09,627
              OH, THIS IS NUTS. 

179
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,629
           SAGE, MEAT,          
   THE SCALLION, THE CHEDDAR.   

180
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,698
           I LIKE THAT THERE'S  
         TEXTURE TO THE BISCUIT,

181
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,633
     BECAUSE THEN IT BECOMES    
REFORTIFIED INSIDE OF THE GRAVY,

182
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,635
           HITTING THOSE ONIONS 
            AT THE LAST MOMENT. 

183
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,771
YEAH, A LITTLE SHARP AT THE END,
   CUTS THROUGH THE RICHNESS.   

184
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:23,174
  AND YOU CAN TASTE THE CHEDDAR 
  IN THE BISCUITS. WHAT'S THAT? 

185
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:26,111
         WHAT? OH, HE THINKS    
     THIS IS MY FIRST RODEO? NO.

186
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,714
        HOUSE-MADE SAUSAGE GRAVY
              AND BISCUITS?     
        JUST A BIG PLATE        
      OF SAVORY GOODNESS.       

187
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,917
        THE CHEDDAR             
AND THE SCALLIONS MAKE IT.      

188
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,853
                 THE SAUSAGE    
              IS VERY GOOD, TOO.
 EVERYTHING ON THE PLATE

                    PULL BACK...
NO.                             

478
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:35,773
                       AND TUCK,
WE HAVE JAMMED THE LEGS         
  THROUGH THE SIDES.            

479
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:39,510
NOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN--WE'LL COOK
     IT ON THE MOON SURFACE?    

480
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,911
                   PAN SPRAYED  
                WITH CANOLA OIL.

481
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,648
      WOULD YOU DO ME THE HONOR 
     OF STICKING IT IN THE OVEN?

482
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,050
       AIM RIGHT THERE. WE GOTTA
        WATCH THAT AND TURN IT. 

483
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,719
               TURN IT, TURN IT.
OH, LOOK AT THAT.               

484
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:51,789
IT'S A BEAUTY. I USUALLY DEGLAZE
  THE PAN WITH SOME WHITE WINE. 

485
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,725
   AND THEN WHEN WE SERVE OUR   
 CHICKEN, WE JUST KINDA GO DOWN 

486
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:58,462
           THE BACKBONE, POP IT,
           DOWN ALONG THE SIDES 

487
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,598
              AND THEN POUR     
         A LITTLE JUICE ON THEM.

488
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,533
     LET'S TRY                  
THIS BAD BOY. MMM.

TO SELL HERE, BUDDY.            

490

 COOKED. MMM.                   

491
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:07,938
BUT THIS MUSHROOM               

492
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,741
 THAT YOU PUT IN WITH           
MAGIC FINGERS MAKES IT.         

493
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,610
THAT'S GREAT.                   
                  IT'S A WINNER?

494
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,212
THAT'S WINNER, WINNER,          
    CHICKEN DINNER.             

495
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,548
I'D DO THIS ALL DAY LONG. IT'S  
RIDICULOUS. NICE JOB, "B-RAD."  

496
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,616
        THIS CHICKEN IS TO DIE. 

497
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:22,953
MOIST, TENDER, WELL DONE,       
 JUST PHENOMENALLY GOOD.        

498
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,755
    JUST TO COME IN AND SMELL IT
          IS LIKE I'M FULL.     

499
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:27,891
SO SMELL-A-VISION               
IS ALIVE AND WELL.              
            IN THIS STORE IT IS.

   WITHOUT A DOUBT.             

503
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,501
         DON'T GET FOOLED BY    
    THE FUNNY CHICKEN OUT FRONT.
