        RIGHT THERE.            

300
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,199
SO WE LET THIS COOL OVERNIGHT,  
  AND THEN WE'LL COOK IT UP.    
                      ALL RIGHT.

301
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,201
                    OLIVE OIL,  
                   NOT TOO MUCH,

302
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,604
                    A LITTLE BIT
                      OF STEAK. 
OH, NICE PORTION                
    OF THAT.                    

303
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,874
  SO WE'RE GONNA PUT A NICE     
LITTLE PAN-FRY ON THAT? MMM.    

304
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,676
   SOMETHING ABOUT HAVING       
THAT SALT IN ALL THAT MIXTURE   

305
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:21,079
    GETTING A LITTLE MARINADE   
KIND OF DOESN'T DRY THE MEAT OUT

306
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:24,014
   BUT PULLS OUT SOME OF        
THE MOISTURE, AM I CORRECT?     
                   YES, PERFECT.

307
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:27,685
               PEPPER, SALT,

     THERE A LITTLE BIT?        

310
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,492
       YOU GOTTA LEAVE IT ALONE,

00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,961
 YEAH, YOU GOTTA LET IT         
    BUILD THE CRUST.            
        DON'T TOUCH IT TOO MUCH.

312
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,564
IF YOU MESS WITH IT TOO MUCH,   
  IT DOESN'T GET THE CRUST.     
         THE CARAMELIZED ONIONS.

313
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,499
    WHAT ABOUT

                   NOW YOU GOTTA
                   MESS WITH IT.

      LET ALL OF 'EM GET MARRIED

315
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,704
           AND LOVE EACH OTHER, 
         GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.
YOU MAKE 'EM GET MARRIED        
  AND LOVE EACH OTHER           

316
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,706
BY JAMMING A RUBBER SPATULA     
         INTO 'EM?              
                  IN BETWEEN 'EM

317
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:51,175
            AND THEN PUSHING 'EM
                ALL TOGETHER.   
NOW WE'RE GONNA LET IT

                NOW THEY'RE ALL 
              MARRIED AND HAPPY.

320
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,647
                THEY'RE GONNA   
             GET A LITTLE DRUNK.
NECESSARY.                      

321

FIVE PIECES OF PROVOLONE.

A RIDICULOUS SIZE.              
                   NO, IT'S NOT.

332
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,408
      THE SECRET, COLD TOMATOES.
COLD TOMATOES.                  

333
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:26,544

                 A LITTLE BREAK.

   STUFF IT IN, AND CLOSE IT UP.

421
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,405
      I DO THIS, EACH MEATBALL, 
    ONE AT A TIME, ALL DAY LONG.

422

426
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,581
IT BURNS THE MEATBALL,          
 PUTS THE LOTION ON.            
                   LOW AND SLOW.

427
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,619
             NOW WE'RE GONNA    
        DO THE SPAGHETTI. DON'T.
IT'S COLD.                      

428
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:58,222
   DON'T. IT'S NOT GONNA BE COLD
           IN A MINUTE.         

429
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:00,157
                         AH, AH.
IT'S COLD.                      

430

                   YES, YOU CAN.
                   YOU KNOW WHY?

432
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,231
      BECAUSE MY GRANDMA'S SAUCE
            IS GOING ON IT,     

433
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,300

436
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,973
                  AND SHE MAKES 
                  THE TOMATOES. 

437
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:16,975
IT TASTES BETTER WHEN MY GRANDMA
     DOES IT WITH HER HANDS.    

438
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,642

    WE'RE GONNA HAVE            
TO PUT MORE SAUCE ON IT.        

444
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,124
    GRANDMA'S GONNA BE          
SMASHING A LOT OF TOMATOES.

     IS SO CREAMY,

 YOU KNOW, I WAS WONDERING WITH 
  ALL THOSE COLD CUTS IN THERE  

453
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,211
 IF THERE WAS GONNA BE TOO MUCH 
  SALT--A REALLY NICE BALANCE.  

454
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,213
  A LITTLE SWEETNESS            
COMING OUT OF THAT HAM,

     WE DO SOUTHERN FOODS.      
             FULL SLAB OF RIBS  
            GOING IN THE WINDOW.

494
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,467
     OH, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE,     
   THE SMOKINESS, THE FLAVORS,  

495
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,469
          THE BARBECUE,         
      IT'S RIGHT IN THERE.      

496
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,471
         WE STARTED OUT         
       AS A BARBECUE PLACE      

497
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,607
     AND JUST KIND OF SLOWLY    
  BUT SURELY KEPT ADDING STUFF. 

498
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:32,810
 <i> STUFF LIKE SCRATCH-MADE CAJUN</i> 
     <i> AND SPICY HOT TEX-MEX.</i>    

499
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,812
 CAJUN MEAT LOAF IN THE WINDOW. 

500
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:37,147
      I GOT THE COCHINITA.      

501
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,951
 <i> HE'S EVEN SERVING UP A TASTE</i>  
       <i> OF THE YUCATáN.</i>         
                 COCHINITA PIBIL

502
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,485
        COCHINITA PIBIL.        
                      THANK YOU.

503
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,087
    IT'S GREAT COMBINATION OF   
      FLAVORS, A LITTLE BIT     

504
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,755
  OF THE TEX-MEX, A LITTLE BIT  
      OF SOUTHERN GOING ON.     

505
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:46,223
       IT'S REALLY GREAT.       

506
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,692
        (Chuck) IT'S PORK       
      THAT'S SLOW-ROASTED.      

507
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,426
      NORMALLY, IT'S BURIED     
          UNDERGROUND.          

508
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,428
    IT'S SHREDDED AFTERWARDS    
  AND SERVED IN ITS OWN JUICE.  

509
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,164
   AND HERE WE DO IT IN A PAN.  

510
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,499
   <i> BUT HE KEEPS IT OLD-SCHOOL</i>  
     <i> BY USING BANANA LEAVES</i>    

511
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,501
        <i> INSTEAD OF FOIL</i>        
        <i> TO LINE THE PAN.</i>       

512
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:59,036
   WE LAY OUR BANANA LEAVES IN  

513
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:00,838
        AND THEN THROW IN       
        OUR PORK ON TOP.        

514
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,973
  WE'RE PROBABLY GOING THROUGH  
     100 PORK BUTTS A WEEK.     

515
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,042
WE'RE MAKING THE ACHIOTE PASTE--
      APPLE CIDER VINEGAR,      

516
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,044
 ACHIOTE, GARLIC, ORANGE JUICE, 

517
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,714
  SALT, OREGANO, BLACK PEPPER.  

518
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,316
     THEN WE JUST MAKE SURE     

519
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,318
 WE GET THE ACHIOTE RUB IN THERE
          REALLY GOOD.          

520
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,387
       MY MAIN PHILOSOPHY       
     IS THAT YOU WANT STUFF     

521
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,121
   TO BE COMPLETELY SEASONED.   

522
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,790
    I DON'T WANT THE CUSTOMER   
           TO HAVE ADD          

523
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,892
   A BUNCH OF SALT AND PEPPER   
     AND DUMP KETCHUP ON IT.    

524
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:23,860
           I COVER IT           
   WITH SLICED YELLOW ONIONS,   

525
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,896
    TOP IT WITH BANANA LEAVES   
         AND THEN FOIL,         

526
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,632
 AND THEN WE POP IT IN THE OVEN.

527
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,266
        <i> 12 HOURS LATER,</i>        

528
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,268
     <i> THE BANANA LEAVES HAVE</i>    
 <i> STEAMED UP SOME RIGHTEOUS PORK</i>

529
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,070
 <i> AND GIVEN IT A LITTLE FLAVOR.</i> 

530
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,938
   NOW THAT WE'VE ROASTED OFF   
            THE PORK,           

531
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,674
 WE DRAIN THE JUICES INTO A POT,
        REDUCE THAT UNTIL       

532
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,209
 IT'S GOT A NICE STRONG FLAVOR. 

533
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:40,011
   NEXT, WE TAKE OUR COCHINITA  
         OUT OF THE PAN,        

534
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,946
     THROW IT IN THE SMOKER     
       FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.       

535
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,348
   LET IT GET A LITTLE SMOKE,   
  A LITTLE CRISPY OUTSIDE MEAT. 

536
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,484
      THEN WE SHRED IT UP,      
   HIT IT WITH THE PAN JUICES.  

537
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:48,018
      IT'S READY TO SERVE.      

538
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:50,087
  WE LIKE TO SERVE AN HABANERO  
 SALSA WITH OUR COCHINITA PIBIL.

539
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,223
          WE START OUT          
 BY ROASTING RED ONIONS, GARLIC,

540
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,358
  GREEN ONIONS, AND HABANEROS.  

541
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,694
        NOW WE'RE TAKING        
      OUR ROASTED VEGGIES,      

542
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,963
   PUTTING 'EM IN THE BLENDER,  
    ADDING OUR ORANGE JUICE,    

543
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:01,599
      LIME JUICE, CILANTRO,     
        SALT, AND SUGAR.

 LIKE, THE BEST TACO DISH EVER. 

547
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:12,310
     THE MEAT IS DELICIOUS.     
        IT'S INCREDIBLE.        

548
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,378
            HOW'S THE COCHINITA?
OH, I LOVE IT, MAN.

        IS IT GOOD? ONE BRISKET 
      SANDWICH, FRIES, AND SLAW.

550
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,516
           IT'S WORTH           
       STUFFING YOURSELF,       

551
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:19,917
      LOOSENING THE PANTS,      
         AND GOING HOME.
