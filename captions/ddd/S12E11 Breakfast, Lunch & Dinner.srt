THE SEEDS OUT.

WITH A LITTLE BIT OF THE LARD   
 THAT WE COOKED THE PORK IN.    

285
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,579
            RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS IS GNARLY.

      RIGHT THERE.              

287
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,184
      YOU GOT TO COOK OFF       
A LITTLE BIT OF THAT BITTERNESS.

288
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:01,119
           I'M GONNA PUT        
  THE CARNITAS ALREADY SHREDDED.

289
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,655
 AND WE'RE JUST GONNA SIT THERE 
AND COOK THIS UP, LET IT COAT...
                         RIGHT. 

290
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:05,857
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA MAKE       
       THE TORTA.               
                   THAT'S RIGHT.

291
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,859
      HE CAN'T MAKE             
THIS SANDWICH FAST ENOUGH.      

292
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,328
SO THIS IS HOMEMADE BREAD.      
             YEAH. REFRIED BEANS
               AT THE BOTTOM.   

293
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,863
                SO NOW WE PUT   
            THE CHILORIO ON TOP.
REFRIED BEANS ALMOST WORK       
  LIKE THE MAYONNAISE.          

294
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,865
                   THAT'S RIGHT.
OKAY, A LITTLE QUESO.           

295
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,402
      A LITTLE QUESO ON TOP,    
  SOME JALAPEÑOS, THEN TOMATOES,

296

CABBAGE.                        

297
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,540
 DON'T BE STINGY                
WITH THE CABBAGE.               
                  (laughs) OKAY.

298
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,709
                   AND CILANTRO.
                    HERE YOU GO.

299
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:27,345
LOOK AT THAT.                   

300
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,881
           MMM.                 
THAT'S OUT OF BOUNDS, DUDE.     
                      ALL RIGHT.

301
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,684
THE FRESHNESS OF THE BREAD      
    RIGHT OFF THE BAT,          

302
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,353
   THEN YOU GET THIS HOT,       
LITTLE BIT SPICY OF THE MEAT.   

303
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,688
THEN YOU GET THE CRUNCH         
     OF THE ONION               

304
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,624
AND A LITTLE SNAP               
FROM THE JALAPEÑO.              

305
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,960
 MMM. THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF 
THE BEST TORTAS I'VE EVER HAD...
                      ALL RIGHT.

306
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:46,030
I MEAN, ONE OF THE BEST, DUDE.  
  MMM. THAT SANDWICH ROCKS.     

307
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:48,899
      I LIKE MEXICAN PORK,      
 AND THIS IS THE PORKIEST PORK. 

308
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,901
            (man) THE TENDERNESS
                 OF THE MEAT    

309
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,104
         AND THE CRUNCHINESS    
     OF THE VEGETABLES IN THERE,

310
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,173
     JUST LIKE YOU'RE IN MEXICO.
          (bell dings)          

311
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,241
 TWO TACOS CHICHARRóNES SPECIAL,
         RICE AND BEANS.        

312
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,510
     (man) THE TACO BUS--THERE'S
    REALLY NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT.

313
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,647
       THIS ONE WAS HERE        
 BEFORE FOOD TRUCKS WERE COOL.  
      THE NICE THING            
IS WE DON'T MOVE IT AROUND.     

314

             OF TACO BUS NATION.

317

              THEY'RE OPEN 24/7.

319
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,395
 FOR ME, IT'S THE HEALTHY FOOD  
       WAS WHAT SOLD ME.        

320
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,130

   (Rene) GRILLED TOFU TACOS.

00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,602
I'M HAVING THE VEGGIE BURRITO   
RIGHT NOW, AND IT'S AMAZING.    

323
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:26,805
        MY NEW FAVORITE         
IS THE BUTTERNUT SQUASH TOSTADA.

324
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:30,307
      <i> YEAH, HE'S PUTTING</i>       
<i> BUTTERNUT SQUASH ON A TOSTADA.</i> 

325
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,543
(Rene) IT'S STILL MEXICAN.      
   IT'S NOT WELL KNOWN.         

326
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:35,013
AND THAT'S SOMETHING UNIQUE     
THAT BRINGS YOU TO MEXICO.      

327
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,547
THIS IS DELICIOUS.              

328
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,883
A SQUASH.                       
      YOU WAIT UNTIL YOU TRY IT.
           IT'S FAMOUS HERE.    

329
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,018
OKAY.                           
              WE START          
   WITH BUTTERNUT SQUASH, FRESH.

330
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,954
           I'M JUST GONNA CUT IT
             INTO LARGE PIECES. 

331
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,823
   AND WHERE'S                  
THIS RECIPE FROM?               
                        YUCATáN.

332
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:48,025
  SO THAT'S IT? BOIL IT WITH    
THE SEEDS AND EVERYTHING IN IT. 
                          RIGHT.

333
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,961
DOWN IN THE WATER?              
                   THAT'S RIGHT.

334
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,363
HOW LONG?                       
             ONCE IT BOILS,     
       ABOUT TWO, THREE MINUTES.

335
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,365
           IT'S GOT TO BE TENDER
             BUT NOT TOO MUCH,  

336
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,767
       BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT GETS
               ALL MUSHY.       
    DON'T WANT                  
TO GET IT MUSHY.                

337
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,170
ALL RIGHT, SO NOW IT'S BOILED   
  AND COOLED A LITTLE BIT.      

338
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,839
NOW WE'RE GONNA TAKE            
  THE SEEDS OUT?                
           RIGHT. WE'RE ALSO    
        GONNA TAKE THE SKIN OFF.

339
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,841
WE'RE GONNA CHOP IT UP?         
                          RIGHT.

340
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,511
WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?           
          WE'RE GONNA PUT       
  A LITTLE BIT OF OIL, ONIONS...

341
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,312
RED BELL PEPPER.                
                   TOMATOES,    
               HABANERO PEPPERS.

342

(whistles)                      
             I'M GONNA COOK THIS
                 A LITTLE BIT   

343
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,252
                BEFORE I ADD    
           THE BUTTERNUT SQUASH.
SQUASH.                         

344
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:17,188
   NOW THE BUTTERNUT SQUASH IS  
 GONNA GET A LITTLE SOFTER HERE.
   WE'RE GONNA                  
JUST COOK IT DOWN               

345
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,390
UNTIL IT'S A LITTLE BIT         
     MORE TENDER?               
                   THAT'S RIGHT.

346
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,259
WE READY?                       
                    WE'RE READY.

347
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,728
          SO WE'RE GONNA TOP OFF
           OUR TOSTADA WITH IT. 

348
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,664
 LOOKS LIKE HE'S PUTTING        
A FRUIT COCKTAIL ON THERE.      
             TOMATOES, ONIONS,  
           CILANTRO, AND CHEESE.

349
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,867
                   THERE YOU GO.
IT'S A LOT.                     

350
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:32,202
                  YOU CAN DO IT.
                   THERE YOU GO.

351
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,939
    IT'S GOT GOOD TEXTURE.      
THE TOSTADA'S NICE AND CRUNCHY. 

352
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:38,743

NOT FALL-APART SOFT.

BELL PEPPER AND THE ONIONS

  OF THE HABANERO               

355
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,483
WAS REALLY DONE                 
THE RIGHT WAY.                  

356

A HEARTBEAT. IT'S REALLY NICE.

CAN'T BEAT THAT.                

389
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,341
           HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD
              THE BEACH PUB?    
     MY WIFE'S FATHER           
HAS OWNED IT FOR 35 YEARS.      

390
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,609
I BOUGHT HALF THE RESTAURANT    
       17 YEARS AGO.            

391
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,278
         WHICH HALF DID YOU BUY,
            BACK OR THE FRONT?

   THE OYSTERS                  
ARE ALWAYS FRESH.               

394
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,419
YOU CAN TASTE THE OYSTER.       
YOU CAN TASTE THE SPINACH.      

395
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:31,556
 YOU CAN TASTE THE CHEESE.      
IT'S A REALLY GOOD MIXTURE.     
       I'M AN OYSTER ROCKEFELLER
               JUNKIE.          

396

              ON TUESDAYS.      

397
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,360

              JUST 1 STEP       
      OF SHOVING IT IN MY MOUTH.

411
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,794
        SEE? YOU GOT TO GET THAT
                IN THERE.       
     WE GOT SOME

SOME PECORINO ROMANO CHEESE,    

413
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:16,467
      AND THEN WE GOT           
SOME HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM.      
    NOW ARE WE GONNA MIX THIS UP
          AND LET IT SET UP     

414
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,936
       BEFORE WE PUT IT ON OR...
   WE'RE GONNA                  
GO STRAIGHT TO IT.              

415
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:21,405
       AS SOON AS IT'S MIXED,   
   IT'S READY GO ON THE OYSTERS?

               THEY'RE ENORMOUS.

421
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,428
   A LOT OF SPINACH, NICE LITTLE
      SALTINESS OF THE BACON.   

422
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,231

                   TO THE TOP,

              OYSTERS ROCK, MAN.

426
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,440
  SERIOUSLY, THAT'S WORTH COMING
    DOWN HERE JUST ON ITS OWN.  

427
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,442
                       NICE JOB.

   (Dan) I GOT CLAM FRITTERS.   

431
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,385
   THE FOOD IS ALWAYS GREAT.

  AND TWO ORDERS OF FRITTERS.   

435
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:16,326
     FISH HASH IS FABULOUS.     

436
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,196
               FISH HASH--      
        THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ODD.

437
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:20,764
  (Dan) A FAMILY RECIPE, IT'S   
PROBABLY CLOSE TO 80 YEARS OLD. 

438
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,200
 IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN FIND
     IN ANY OTHER RESTAURANT.   
  NO, IT'S SOMETHING            
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT,           

439
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,736
AND WE'LL SHOW YOU              
  HOW TO DO IT.                 
                 I KNOW         
        WE'RE SCALING SOMETHING.

440
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,738
RIGHT.                          
      THAT IS A SCALING MACHINE.

441
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,141
IT'S COOL, ISN'T IT?            
        IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT I USE
             TO DO MY HAIR.     

442
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,409
IT WORKS.                       
          NO, I DON'T DO MY HAIR
                LIKE THAT.      

443
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,411
            FISH HASH--YOU SURE?
FISH HASH.                      

444
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,881
           THE SPOT IS THE FISH.
   YEAH, THEY GOT               
A LITTLE SPOT ON 'EM.           

445
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:39,483
   THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT SPOT?
THEY WEREN'T REAL CREATIVE      
  BACK THEN, WERE THEY?         

446
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,419
   BOY, THEY WERE REALLY LOOKING
      FOR A NAME ON THAT ONE.   
YOU READY? WE'RE JUST GONNA     
   SCALE IT REAL QUICK.         

447
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,489
         HOW MANY OF THESE      
  WILL YOU GO THROUGH IN A WEEK?
WE CAN GO THROUGH 100 POUNDS    
    OF THESE IN A WEEK.         

448
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,491
                           OKAY.
AND YOU CUT HIS HEAD OFF.       

449
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,694
           YOU SAY IT SO NICELY.

450
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:52,163
              WE'RE JUST GONNA  
           CUT HIS HEAD OFF NOW.
AND WE'RE JUST GONNA MAKE       
 A LITTLE INCISION HERE,        

451
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,365
  AND WE'RE JUST GONNA TAKE     
A LITTLE BIT OF THE GUTS OUT.   

452
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,767
IT COMES RIGHT OUT.             
WE'RE READY TO GO.              
               YEAH, PARTY TIME.

453
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:59,236
JUST GONNA RINSE THESE OFF.     
    THREE TO AN ORDER.          
       THAT'S ALL FOR ONE ORDER?

454
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,238
ONE ORDER.                      
      DID WE SEASON THIS AT ALL?
               NOTHING?         

455
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,374
NOTHING.                        
              THAT'S THE OLD WAY
                  TO DO IT.     

456
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:05,442
REMEMBER, OPEN MIND.            
      SO ONCE YOU GET IT DONE...

457
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:08,112
USE THE STEAMER.                
      TWO FISH HASHES IN,       
   JUST GIVE ME SIX MINUTES.    

458
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,114
       QUICK POP IN THE STEAMER.
IT GOES QUICK, YEAH.            

459
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,516
                      ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO, 
  WE'RE GONNA PICK THE FISH.    

460
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,785
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT       
 THE SKIN WITH THE HASH.        

461
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,987
YOU DON'T WANT THE BONES        
     WITH THE HASH.             

462
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,989
  YOU REALLY GOT                
TO TAKE YOUR TIME.              

463
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,191
 WE SEND THIS OUT               
TO THE TABLE FIRST              

464
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,461
AND LET THE CUSTOMER            
 PICK THE MEAT OUT.             
       AND THEY KNOW TO DO THIS?

465
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,663
WELL, NOT EVERYBODY             
KNOWS HOW TO DO IT.             

466
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,798
THE HELP WILL SHOW 'EM          
 EXACTLY WHAT TO DO.            

467
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,201
   IT'S FAIRLY SIMPLE           
ONCE YOU START DOING IT.        
                DON'T WORRY,    
           LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

468
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:32,270

482
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,369
