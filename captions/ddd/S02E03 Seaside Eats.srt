DO IT RIGHT.                    

212
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:00,545
NOW IS THAT THE NORMAL          
  SIZE OF THE BURGER?           

213
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:02,547
 ACTUALLY, THE DOUBLE'S A LITTLE
      BIT BIGGER THAN THAT.     

214
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,416
   THE DOUBLE'S                 
BIGGER THAN THIS?               
                YEAH, AND THAT'S
                   A DOUBLE.    

215
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:06,885
 IT'S MESSY, AND IT'S DELICIOUS.

216
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:10,622
    WHAT SHOULD I               
      TRY TODAY?                
               THE BACON        
             CHEESEBURGER.      

217
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:12,090
      THE BACON                 
    CHEESEBURGER?               

218
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,959
 <i> EACH BURGER STARTS WITH FRESH</i> 
   <i> GROUND BEEF--NEVER FROZEN.</i>  

219
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,961
               'CAUSE THAT MAKES
               A BIG DIFFERENCE.
YES.                            

220
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,964
                     SO GO DOWN?
YES, PLEASE.                    

221
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,432
                       ANYWHERE?
AHH, ANYWHERE.                  

222
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:21,900
                       ANYWHERE?
ANYWHERE.                       
                       ANYWHERE?

223
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,903
ANYWHERE. NOT THERE,            
 BUT ANYWHERE ELSE.             

224
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:28,373
HERE'S WHAT I QUESTION.         
    THAT'S THE BUN.             

225
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:31,375
THE BURGER IS BIGGER            
    THAN THE BUN.               

226
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,644
I MEAN, LOOK AT THAT.           
 YOU HAVE NICE BUNS.            

227
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,981
            THANK YOU. WELL,    
         I'M KNOWN FOR MY BUNS. 

228
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,982
           <i> ...AND FOR</i>          
     <i> THE OUT-OF-BOUNDS WAY</i>     

229
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,385
      <i> HE'S GONNA TURN EACH</i>     
 <i> OF THESE INTO A BACON BURGER.</i> 

230
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:43,321
                   WHAT IS THIS?
IT'S BACON. IT'S BACON.         
      IT'S BACON.               

231
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,857
           IT'S LIKE BACON SOUP.
I WANT THE BURGERS              
    TO BE BIG.                  

232
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:48,593
 I WANT THE BACON--I DON'T LIKE 
   TWO LITTLE STRIPS OF BACON.  

233
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:52,263
      LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD
      MAKES BACON CHEESEBURGERS?
EXACTLY.                        

234
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,733
                 YOU DON'T WANT 
                 TO FOLLOW THAT?
  WE WANT TO MAKE               
LIKE A BACON PATTY.             

235
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:58,269
THAT'S WHAT                     
THIS DOES.                      
                  SO YOU BOIL   
             THE BACON IN WATER?

236
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:00,338
YEP.                            
             THEN THIS SITS HERE
               AND STRAINS OUT? 

237
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,008
YEP. PUT IT ON THE GRILL,       
     FLATTEN IT OUT,            

238
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,209
TURN IT OVER.                   

239
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,413
 IT LOOKS ALMOST                
LIKE HASH BROWNS.               

240
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,749
                   THERE YOU GO.
  HOW DO YOU                    
WANT TO DO IT?                  

241
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,351
  WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, 
    WAIT. DID I PUT TOO MUCH,   

242
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,820
'CAUSE THAT'S AS BIG            
   AS THE BURGER?               
             NO, THAT'S PERFECT.

243
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:18,289
THAT'S HOW IT GOES?             
                   YEAH, IT WAS 
                  A LITTLE LESS,

244
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,291
                BUT THAT'S FINE.
THAT'S A LITTLE LESS?           

245
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,293
          THAT'S A LITTLE LESS, 
          BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT? 

246
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,295
TWO SLICES?                     
                   TWO SLICES   
               OF CHEESE ON TOP.

247
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:25,830
NOW A TYPICAL BURGER            
     GETS WHAT?                 

248
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,566
LETTUCE, TOMATOES, ONIONS,      
   PICKLES, MAYONNAISE,         

249
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,035
MUSTARD AND KETCHUP,            

250
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:32,704
'CAUSE I LIKE                   
 MAYONNAISE.                    
                     GO GREASY  
                     OR GO HOME.

251
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,706
  MAYONNAISE IS GOOD            
FOR YOU. THAT'S RIGHT.          

252
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,375
 NOW MUSTARD HAPPENS TO BE      
A LITTLE BIT SHARPER TASTE,     

253
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,844
SO YOU DON'T                    
USE AS MUCH.                    
                  WAIT A SECOND,

254
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,779
               ARE YOU DOING    
          A FOOD SHOW RIGHT NOW?

255
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,115
   NOW THE ONIONS,              
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO--           

256
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,850
  YOU'RE BUILDING               
A FOUNDATION HERE.              

257
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:48,653
  TURN IT OVER. YOU'RE BUILDING 
       YOURSELF A LITTLE--      

258
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:51,256
A LITTLE ONION CASTLE,          
    IF YOU WILL...              

259
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,724
IF YOU WILL.                    
                   ONION CASTLE?

260
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,125
ONION CASTLE.                   
                         GOT IT.

261
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,528
YOU GOTTA PUT THE KETCHUP       
  ON TOP OF THE ONIONS.         

262
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,930
IT KIND OF NEUTRALIZES IT       
      A LITTLE BIT.             
                   LIKE A SCARY 
                 ROLLER COASTER.

263
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,264
YEAH, ISN'T THAT                
   SOMETHING?                   

264
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,667
   PICKLES JUST ADD TO IT,      
A COUPLE SLICES OF TOMATOES.    

265
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:07,271
  NOW WE DO THE LETTUCE, AND WE 
 CALL THIS THE LETTUCE SNOWBALL.

266
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:10,141
BADA-BING. NOW YOU              
PUT THAT ON THERE.              

267
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,143
                  AND THEN THIS?
SLIDE IT ON THERE.              

268
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:18,082
LOOK AT THAT.                   
LOOK AT THAT.                   
       OKAY, I GOTTA JUST HAVE  
     MY PICTURE TAKEN WITH THIS.

269
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,351
                   NOW WHAT'S IT
                    WRAPPED IN? 
THE BURGER DIAPER.              

270
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:22,754
 AND ONCE YOU PICK IT UP,       
DON'T LET IT GO, YOU KNOW?      

271
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:26,357
                   YOU GOTTA    
                CODDLE THE BABY.
WE GIVE LESSONS ON WEDNESDAYS   
        ON HOW TO EAT.          

272
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,493
   WE HAVE GRADUATES WHO WILL   
 BE DOWN TO, LIKE, TWO NAPKINS. 

273
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:33,031
          IS SHE DOING          
       THIS RIGHT, MIKEY?       
YEAH, SHE'S                     
DOING GREAT.                    

274
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,233
         DOES SHE HAVE          
           THE HAND--           
         THIS ONE'S             
    NOT DOING IT RIGHT.         

275
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,835
        HAVE YOU NOT BEEN       
    TO THE WEDNESDAY LESSON?    

276
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:40,105
(Guy) DID YOU EAT               
THE WHOLE THING?                
                       UH, YEAH.

277
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,774
                  THIS IS WHAT'S
                   LEFT OF IT.  
THE DIAPER.                     

278
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:45,043
ALL RIGHT, NOW THIS             
IS VERY IMPORTANT,              

279
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:47,045
VERY, VERY IMPORTANT.           

280
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:49,714
  A LITTLE                      
NIP AND TUCK.                   

281
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:52,817
LOOK AT THAT. SEE, YOU CAN SEE  
JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ON THERE. 

282
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:54,185
  THAT'S WHAT                   
YOU WANT TO DO.                 

283
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,187
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE             
TO SEE EVERYTHING,              

284
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,323
BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW,           
90% OF YOUR TASTE BUDS          

285
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,859
ARE IN YOUR EYEBALLS.           
                           DUDE.

286
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,129
 AND THAT'S WHAT                
THE CUSTOMERS GET.              
       I NEED, LIKE, A ROAD MAP 
      TO EAT THROUGH THIS THING.

287
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,931
DON'T LET THAT BURGER           
   INTIMIDATE YOU.              
                  WELL, IT'S NOT
                  INTIMIDATING. 

288
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,332
                 I'M JUST TRYING
                  TO FIGURE OUT 

289
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,268
           AM I WORRIED ABOUT   
         THE REST OF MY WARDROBE

290
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,737
                    FOR THE REST
                    OF THE DAY? 
LEAN OVER. LEAN OVER.           

291
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:16,007
TROUGH IT. TROUGH IT.           

292
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,476
OH, HE'S A NATURAL. HE'S BEEN   
   EATING HIS WHOLE LIFE.       

293
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,478
    I CAN TELL                  
BY LOOKING AT HIM.              

294
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,814
     LOOK IT.                   
YOU WEAR IT WELL.               
                    THAT'S OUT  
                 OF BOUNDS, MAN.

295
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,485
THAT'S SOMETHING.               
         JUST FOR THE SHOW,     
    I'M GONNA TAKE ANOTHER BITE.

296
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:30,488
                NORMALLY, I'M   
            A VERY PETITE EATER.

297
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,023
   <i> AND AFTER ALL THE JOKING,</i>   

298
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,025
        <i> MIKE'S OBSESSED</i>        
 <i> WITH MAKING SURE EVERY BURGER</i>

  <i> IS EVERYTHING IT OUGHTA BE.</i>  

300
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,695
           WELL, I ALWAYS PLAYED
