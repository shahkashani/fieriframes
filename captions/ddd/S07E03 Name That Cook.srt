00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,567
             I ALWAYS WANTED IT 
           TO BE ABOUT THE FOOD.
         THERE YOU GO.          

96
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,636
               A LOT OF DISHES  
             THAT WE SERVE HERE,

97
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:59,904
                PEOPLE COME BACK
                 FOR THAT DISH. 
     <i> AND KEEP COMING BACK.</i>     

98
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:01,974
           BRANDY...            
             THEY KNOW YOUR NAME
              WHEN YOU COME IN. 

99
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,508
           AND SUSAN.           

100
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,910
  THE PEOPLE THAT WE MEET, THEY 
MAKE IT, AND THEY LOVE HIS FOOD.

101
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,381
 THE FOOD IS EXCELLENT.         
      IT REALLY IS.             
   I'M HAVING THE PORK CHOP.    
           IT'S HUGE.           

102
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:12,116
  THE MEAT OF TWO CHOPS         
BUT IN ONE. LOOK AT THAT.       

103
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,720
       MMM,                     
THAT'S A TOP CHOP.              

104
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:16,722
               SALMON B.L.T.    
     IT'S DELICIOUS.            

105
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:20,058
KILLER SUN VALLEY CLUB.         
               THE POLICE CHIEF,
                COUNCIL MEMBER, 

106
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,928
   THE MAYOR AND THE FIRE CHIEF 
    ALL HERE AT THE SAME TABLE. 

107
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,330
        I'M ACTUALLY HERE       
 BECAUSE THESE WINGS ARE SO HOT,

108
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,998
            THEY MAY            
     SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUST,     

109
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,201
     AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED     
      THE FIRE CHIEF HERE.      

110
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,602
ARE WE DEEP-FRYING THE WINGS?   
    GIVE ME THE RUN-DOWN.       
                             NO.

111
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,072
OKAY.                           
       SO WE'RE GONNA SEASON 'EM
         WITH SALT AND PEPPER.  

112
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,074
         THEY'RE GONNA GO INTO  
      THE OVEN ABOUT 15 MINUTES,

113
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,875
        GET 'EM A LITTLE BROWN. 

114
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,145
      WHILE THAT'S IN THE OVEN, 
     WE'RE GONNA MAKE OUR SAUCE.
RICE WINE VINEGAR.              

115
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,080
              YES, IT'S NATURAL.
SAMBAL OELEK.                   

116
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,483
                        EXACTLY.
SOMETIMES YOU'LL SEE IT ALSO    
CALLED A CHILI GARLIC PASTE.    

117
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,284
SOME FRESH GARLIC.              
                     CHOPPED UP.

118
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,820
     I LIKE WHERE               
THIS IS GOING ALREADY.          
             AND A LITTLE SUGAR.

119
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,822
WHITE WINE VINEGAR'S            
    A LOT SHARPER               

120
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,692
THAN THE RICE WINE              
     VINEGAR.                   
     IT'S GONNA GIVE IT A LOT   
  MORE OF THAT VINEGAR FLAVOR...

121
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,827
RIGHT.                          
         THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR,
                THAT TANG.      

122
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,962
          TAKE JUST A LITTLE BIT
              OF GREEN ONION.   

123
00:04:58,032 --> 00:05:00,432
                    WE LET THIS 
                  SET OVERNIGHT.
  SO REALLY TO MARRY            
THOSE FLAVORS TOGETHER.         

124
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,134
                     ABSOLUTELY.
 AND THEN WE GET INTO           
MAKING THE CELERY SLAW.         

125
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,038
   CELERY SLAW--SOME BLUE CHEESE
   CRUMBLES, SOME MINCED ONION. 

126
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,840
     THEN YOU TAKE A LITTLE BIT 
           OF PEPPERCORN.       

127
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,176
        A LITTLE FRESHLY CRACKED
              BLACK PEPPER.     

128
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,378
WHEN I HAD LEARNED THIS         
      IN SCHOOL,                

129
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,514
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS,          
    BAM! I GOT 'EM!             

130
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,916
THERE WAS NOTHING               
   LEFT OVER.                   
                 NOT A WHOLE LOT
                 OF PEPPERCORN. 

131
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,451
NO.                             
                           YEAH.

132
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,986
            A LITTLE SOUR CREAM,
               JUST A LITTLE.   
YEAH.                           

133
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:24,923
  A LITTLE MAYONNAISE, A LITTLE 
  WORCESTERSHIRE, A LITTLE SALT 

134
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,858
         AND JUST A TOUCH       
   OF WHITE PEPPER--REAL BASIC. 

135
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:30,262
    USING GOOD BLUE CHEESE HELPS
     TO GET GOOD FLAVOR FOR IT. 
OH, THAT'S THE KEY.             

136
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:33,064
        TAKE SOME CELERY--      
   NOT TOO THICK, NOT TOO THIN. 

137
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:35,333
THAT WAS IT?                    
                WE ONLY DRESS IT
               WHEN IT GOES OUT,

138
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,736
                SO YOUR CELERY'S
                  STILL CRISP.  
SO YOU GOT THE WINGS.           

139
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,738
       I'M GONNA TAKE OUR SAUCE.
WOW.                            

140
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:42,206
THEN WE'RE GONNA ADD            
  A LITTLE BUTTER.              
                    SO LET THIS 
                    REDUCE DOWN.

141
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,008
TILL IT CARAMELIZES.            
     OUTTA HERE.                

142
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:46,345
   GIVE IT NICE                 
LITTLE GRILL MARKS.             

143
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,347
      GET SOME                  
MORE CARAMELIZATION.            

144
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,349
       THAT SUGAR'S SNAPPING UP 
         ON THOSE REAL QUICK.   

145
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:53,084
AND THEY'LL GO BACK             
   INTO THE PAN.                
            THAT'S A NICE TOUCH.

146
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:55,086
      TAKE A LITTLE BIT         
OF OUR BLUE CHEESE DRESSING.    

147
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,955
         THEN YOU TAKE THE DILL.
WOW.

   A LITTLE SPICE TO IT.        

153
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,306

GOOD BALANCE OF FLAVOR.         

154

 OF THESE LITTLE CELERY NUGGETS.

155
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,312
  YOU COULD TURN ME             
VEGETARIAN WITH THAT.           

156
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:22,647
NICE JOB. MMM.

SOME OF MY BURGERS.             

204
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,433
IT'S ABOUT A HALF A POUND,      
  SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE.       

205
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,035
                 75/25 BURGERS. 

206
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:27,171
    YOU GIVE THAT SIZE OF BURGER

$4.25.                          

207
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,974
                  FOR 5 BUCKS.  
                 I'M TELLIN' YA.

208
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,044
            YOU JUST ROLL 'EM UP
               AND PATTY IT.    
      I TRY NOT                 
TO PACK 'EM TOO TIGHT.          

209
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,513
 NO, 'CAUSE YOU PUSH ALL THE FAT
  OUT OF THEM WHEN YOU COOK 'EM.
OH, ABSOLUTELY.                 

210
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,482
               AND THAT'S IT.   
            LET'S GO COOK THESE.
ALL RIGHT.                      

211
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,051
FIRST I USUALLY PUT SOME ONIONS 
    AND GET THEM SAUTéING.      

212
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,053
               A LITTLE BUTTER. 
               A LOT OF BUTTER. 

213
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,656
GET 'EM GRILLIN' DOWN GOOD,     
 THEN PUT OUR BURGERS ON.       
                       YOU THREW

214
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,659
    THE BALL OF FUN ON THERE,   
AND THEN JUST SMASH IT ON THERE?

215
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:50,328
 I LIKE THAT YOU GET THE BUNS-- 
  THEY'RE KINDA GETTIN' COOKED  

216
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,731
      ON THERE AND SOAKIN' UP   
   A LITTLE JUICE WHILE THEY DO.

217
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,733
                  THIS GRIDDLE'S
                   PRETTY HOT.  
YEAH, THE HOTTER THE GRILL GETS,
   THE GREASE GETS TO FLYING,   

218
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,735
AND THAT WHAT MAKES THE--       
  GLAZES THE BUNS OVER,         

219
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:00,472
AND PUTS A LITTLE EXTRA.        
        YOU SEE THE WAY HIS EYES
          SPARKLE A LITTLE BIT  

220
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:02,473
               WHEN HE STARTS   
             TALKING ABOUT THAT?

221
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,008
                  HE SCARES ME. 

222
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,077
       THE ONIONS JUST SIT THERE
          AND DO THEIR MAGIC.   

223
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,079
IF YOU COOK 'EM TOO FAST,       
      THEY SKIN UP,             

224
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,348
LOSE THE JUICE                  
 AND ALL THAT.                  
               A MESS OF ONIONS.

225
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:13,284
             NOW WHAT CAN I GET 
           WITH THESE AS A SIDE?
   FRENCH FRIES                 
OR MASHED POTATOES.             

226
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:16,354
                  WELL, LET'S DO

  <i> THAT'S JAVON'S DEPARTMENT,</i>   
      <i> ONE SPUD AT A TIME.</i>

HE CUTS 'EM UP TO ORDER,        
  75, 100 POUNDS A DAY.         

228
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,759
 COOK 'EM ALL                   
IN PEANUT OIL.                  

229

YOU KNOW, IT TAKES A LITTLE     
  MORE HEAT, NOT BURNIN'.       

230
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,962
      PUT THE CHEESE            
ON THE BURGER THE SAME TIME     

231
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,764
THAT I DROP THE FRIES.          

232
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,100
     THEN YOU GIVE              
THE CHEESE TIME TO MELT.        
                        4 BUCKS.

233
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,102
$4.25.

                A NORMAL SET-UP?

237
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,512

              DUDE, THAT'S HUGE.

A BURGER'S SUPPOSED TO BE.      

243

     ONIONS ARE KILLER. MMM.    
 NO FRILLS, STRAIGHT-UP QUALITY.

244

          I DON'T NEED A FORK   
      LIKE THE REST OF THEM USE.
OHH!

266
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,647

  DOESN'T TAKE ANY MORE ORDERS. 

267
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,450
                SO LET'S TALK   
            ABOUT FRIED CHICKEN.
WELL, FIRST, I'M GONNA MAKE     
A SEASONING FOR MY CHICKEN.     

268
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,452
I PUT MY SEASONING SALT.        

269
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,454
                AND WHERE'D YOU 
              LEARN THIS RECIPE?
MYSELF.                         

270
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,456
DO A LITTLE TONY'S CREOLE.      
                CAJUN SEASONING.

271
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,859
YES, SIR, AND THEN A LITTLE     
BLACK PEPPER, A LITTLE BIT      

272
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,261
   OF GARLIC SALT AND THEN TOP  
 IT OFF WITH SOME ONION POWDER. 

273
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,663
      MIX IT UP,                
SEASON UP THE CHICKEN.          
             SO NOW WHAT ARE YOU
                 GONNA MAKE?    

274
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,998
I'M GONNA MAKE MY DREDGE.       
          WHAT DID WE JUST MAKE?

275
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:09,801
 WE JUST MADE                   
THE SEASONING.                  

276
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,203
  I SEASON THE CHICKEN BEFORE I 
THROW IT IN THE SEASONED DREDGE.

277
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,673
HERE WE GO WITH THE FLOUR,      
  A LITTLE BIT OF CREOLE.       

278
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,608
SOME SEASONING SALT,            
    BLACK PEPPER                

279
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,476
AND A LITTLE TABLE SALT.        

280
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,878
 THEN I JUST MIX IT UP,         
PUT ME A COUPLE IN THERE        

281
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,880
    AND THEN                    
I MIX 'EM AROUND.               

282
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,550
 SO YOU GET SOME SEASONING THAT 
   LAYS UNDERNEATH THE FLOUR,   

283
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,018
              SO IT REALLY COATS
                TO THE CHICKEN. 
  ABSOLUTELY, YOU'LL            
TASTE IT IN EVERY BITE.         

284
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:30,421
OH, PLEASE. A LITTLE BIT OF OIL.
   SO WE TALK ABOUT PAN-FRIED.  

285
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:32,490
    SO WE GO WITH               
A THIN AMOUNT OF OIL.           

286
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,893
THE CHICKEN'S ACTUALLY GONNA SIT
   ON THE BOTTOM OF THAT PAN.   

287
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:37,362
   JUST A LITTLE BIT. I THINK   
IT GIVES A LITTLE THICKER CRUST.

288
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,364
BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT            
   KIND OF COOKING              

289
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,432
VERSUS JUST SUBMERGING IT       
    AND DEEP FRYING.            

290
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:44,169
  THAT'S GONNA HAVE             
A NICE CRUNCH TO IT.            
             TRY AND GET IT UP  
           TO ABOUT 165 DEGREES.

291
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,137
       WHICH IS                 
THE COOKING TEMPERATURE         

292
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,106
YOU'D LIKE TO SEE               
YOUR CHICKEN AT.                
                     ABSOLUTELY.

293
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,508
   IF YOU COOK IT OVER, YOU LOSE
    THE WHOLE JUICINESS OF IT.  

294
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,510
           THIS TAKES SOMEWHERE 
            AROUND 40 MINUTES.  

295
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,913
 LET IT GO FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES,
       BUT THE TOP ON IT,       

296
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,182
   TENDERIZE IT WITH SOME STEAM 
         THEN TAKE IT OFF       

297
00:11:57,184 --> 00:12:00,118
                AND BROWN IT    
            THE LAST 15 MINUTES.
LOOK AT THAT.                   

298
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,786
         MMM, THAT'S DELICIOUS. 

299
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,788
               LOOK AT HOW JUICY
               THAT CHICKEN IS. 

300
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:07,192
          AND LOOK AT HOW CRISPY
               THAT SKIN IS.    

301
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:09,194
                  THAT'S MADE   
              IN SOMEBODY'S HOME

YOU SQUEEZE THE MIDDLE,         

375
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,712
   SO THAT THE DAHL             
JUST GOES ALL AROUND...         
                           OKAY.

376
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,714
    BUT YOU WANT                
TO BE TENDER WITH IT.           

377
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,117
            AS SOON AS YOU'RE   
        DONE HOGGING THE ROLLER.

378
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,786
 IF I CAN ACTUALLY TRAIN PEOPLE 
       TO WORK LIKE THAT,       

379
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:24,522
     I WOULDN'T BE              
SO TIRED ALL THE TIME.          

380
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,124
                   GIVE ME SOME.
SO NOW WE COOK THIS.            

381
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,593
   BIG AIR BUBBLE               
IN THE MIDDLE, FOLKS.           
                           YEAH.

382
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,129
COULD BE RISKY.                 

383
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,731
OOH, AND THEN A DOUBLE HAND-OFF,
     WIGGLE-WAGGLE WITH IT.     

384
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,467
THAT JUST LOOKS LIKE A BIG      
OLD HUGE TRINIDAD TORTILLA.     

385
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,536
          SO THAT'S A DAHL PURI.
OKAY, GO TIME NOW.              

386
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,139
        GOOD, YES,              
WE DO IT WHEN PEOPLE ORDER,     

387
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,140
SO IT'S REALLY                  
NICE AND HOT.                   

388
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,543
PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE            
  AND YOU FOLD IT.              
                      LIKE THAT.

389
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:48,412
YES. YOU'RE HIRED.              
YOU'RE JUST HIRED.              
                           OKAY.

390
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,549
         MMM, THAT'S GOOD.      
   IT'S GOT A LITTLE HEAT TO IT,

391
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,218
             GREAT TEXTURE,     
         A LITTLE FLAVOR TO IT. 

392
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,753
YEAH.                           
                        AWESOME.

393
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,356
         COULDN'T HAVE THIS MEAL
            WITHOUT THE BREAD.  
IT'S PERFECT.                   

394
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:00,959
       <i> FOR SCOOPIN'...</i>         
        YOU KINDA USE IT        
      AS A SECOND UTENSIL.      

395
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,628
        <i> FOR SOPPIN'...</i>         
             IT SOAKS UP ALL    
         THE SAUCES REALLY WELL.

396
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,362
        <i> AND FOR WRAPPIN'</i>       

397
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:08,366
<i>ANY ONE OF THEIR SIX DIFFERENT</i>  
     <i> CURRIES CALLED ROTI.</i>      
           LAMB ROTI.           

398
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:09,967
CHICKEN ROTI.                   
           BEEF ROTI.           

399
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:11,969
          SO THAT'S A GOAT ROTI.
          (bell dings)          

400
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:14,772
               I LIKE THE GOAT  
            BECAUSE OF THE BONE.
          THIS IS HOW           
   IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DONE,    

401
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:17,842
    MEAT RIGHT OFF THE BONE.    
    WE'RE GONNA MAKE CURRY GOAT.
       WE START WITH THE OIL.   

402
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:20,378
OKAY.                           
         AFTER IT'S HEAT UP,    
    I PUT A LITTLE BIT OF CUMIN.

403
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:22,914
CUMIN.                          
           THAT TELLS ME WHEN   
        THE OIL IS NICE AND HOT.

404
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,183
'CAUSE YOU CAN START            
TO SMELL THE PERFUME.           
                           YEAH.

405
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,785
SO WE HAVE JUST A TRADITIONAL   
    MADRAS CURRY POWDER.        

406
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,187
                  FROM TRINIDAD.
A LITTLE BIT OF TURMERIC        
    FOR SOME COLOR.             

407
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,189
                 YEAH, BUT FRIED
                  INTO THE OIL  

408
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,726
           BECAUSE IT BRINGS OUT
            MORE OF THE FLAVOR. 
I LIKE IT. ONIONS.              

409
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,127
         GARLIC. CAN NEVER HAVE 
            TOO MUCH GARLIC.    

410
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,530
I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT.       
   NOW GOES THE GOAT.           

411
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,599
                  THIS IS A PART
                    OF THE LEG. 

412
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:44,068
SO WE JUST CUT THE LEG UP INTO  
ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF PIECES.  
           YEAH, YEAH. CILANTRO.

413
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,270
 CILANTRO'S BIG                 
IN TRINIDAD, TOO?               
                             NO.

414
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,007
OKAY.                           
        BUT WE DO HAVE SOMETHING
          THAT IS SIMILAR TO IT 

415
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,009
             CALLED CHADON BENI.
OH, YEAH.                       

416
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,011
                 HAVE YOU HEARD 
                 OF CHADON BENI?

417
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,013
NO, SHADOW BOXING, BUT NOT      
PROBABLY ANYTHING LIKE IT.      

418
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:57,015
HABANEROS, A LITTLE BIT         
 OF HEAT ON THAT GOAT.          

419
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,283
              BLACK MASALA,     
         AND IT'S FROM TRINIDAD.
OKAY.                           

420
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,886
          THIS IS ROASTED CUMIN.
                 SMELL IT.      
 (whistles)                     
SMELLS GREAT.                   

421
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,288
   THAT IS GOOD, YEAH. A LITTLE 
   SALT, A LITTLE BLACK PEPPER. 

422
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,290
 OKAY, SO WE'LL                 
PUT A SEAR ON IT,               

423
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,226
THEN WE'RE GONNA PUT IT         
 IN A PRESSURE COOKER.          

424
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,228
     RIGHT. I PRESSURE THE GOAT 
      BECAUSE IT'S TOUGH MEAT.  

425
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,964
  A LITTLE BIT OF LIQUID, 20    
MINUTES IN THE PRESSURE COOKER. 

426
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,699
    WOW. OH, I'M DRIVIN'. YOU   
  DON'T HAVE TO GIVE ME IT ALL. 

427
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:18,169
SO THIS IS THE GOAT.            

428
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,571
                      MMM. OHH. 

429
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,041
 NICE CURRY, GARLIC AND ONIONS, 
       GOAT BALANCES OUT.       

430
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:27,445
      EXCELLENT DISH, EXCELLENT 
     TRY-IT-ONE-MORE-TIME DISH. 

431
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,914

                   KILLER.      

432
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,317
        IT'S DELICIOUS.         
IT'S VERY JUICY                 
  AND TENDER.                   

433
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,987
   WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE FOOD   
  IN GENERAL IS IT'S HOMEMADE.  

434
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:38,388
  SOMETHING NEW. EVERY TIME, I  
WANT TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

435
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,524
            PELAU...            
           I'M HAVING THE PELAU.

436
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,327
             IT'S THE SPICES    
         THAT MAKE IT SO UNIQUE.
  IT'S KINDA LIKE               
TRINIDAD JAMBALAYA.             

437
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,796
                WITH A WHOLE LOT
                  MORE FLAVOR.  
UH-HUH.                         

438
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,732
WHEN YOU COME BACK,             
 YOU'RE GONNA SEE               

439
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,734
 WHETHER OR NOT IT IS           
BETTER THAN JAMBALAYA.          

440
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,103
