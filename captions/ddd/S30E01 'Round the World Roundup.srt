          -I'm coming.

00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:16,882
    This is like                
    a magic show.

00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,418
   We got lights-out Lebanese   
         in Salt Lake...

00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,219
    That's my jam

 ...knock-out tacos in Austin...

12
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,023
That's about as real-deal       
  as it goes, man.              

13
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,092
   ...and a funky Asian joint   
          in Georgia...

00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:28,427
Definitely what we look for     
   on "Triple D."

    a joint in Austin, Texas,   

27
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,930

   straight from the taquerias  
       of their homeland.       

38
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,621
   -Who's the taco aficionado?  
          -We both are.         

39
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:32,424
     No, you're too skinny to be
         taco aficionados, okay?

40
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,560

            have some legitimacy

00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:37,496
              in the taco game, 
      but these two skinny guys?

42
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:38,697
      So, what makes good tacos?

43
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:41,233
      Quality ingredients,      
      handmade and natural.     

44
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:42,634
      I got two Yucatecos.

Right now, I'm eating           
   Taco Yucateco,               

46
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,171
     and it just                
 takes me back home.            

47
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:50,442
 It has beans, some meat in it. 
 It's reliably good every time. 

48
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,244
      -What are we making?      
       -The Taco Yucateco.

    is the beans?

 Well, the traditional plate has
  black beans and the cochinita.

     We're just gonna roll it up

the old Mexican secret.         

67

          of banana leaves here.

79

is the flavor factor.

       About an hour and a half.

She always wanted her tacos with
 cheese and on a flour tortilla.

In Mexico, we don't use         
flour tortilla a lot.

         of everything.         

448
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,180
     The Mediterranean lunch    
     has tabbouleh, hummus,     

449
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,915
    and then it has a kibbeh.   

450
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:54,451
     Such a nice combination    
  of just really nice flavors.  

451
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,586
  All right, Chef.              
 Let's get into it.             

452
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,921
 -We are making tabbouleh salad.
             -Okay.             

453
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:01,726
  Parsley, tomatoes, fresh mint,
       quinoa, and green onions.

454
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,327
               It usually has   
               cracked wheat,   

455
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,862
       but in order to make this
                gluten-free,    

456
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,397
             we've added quinoa 
              in there instead. 

457
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,531
        Okay.                   
     Next step?                 

458
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,601
              The stuffing for  
      the potato kibbeh. Onions.

459
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,202
I've always known kibbeh        
     to be meat.                

460
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:13,805
         This is a vegan version

461
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,672
         that you sometimes find
               in the country,  

462
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:16,874
                but you don't   
             typically find it. 

463
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,576
             -Okay.             
       -Garlic, mushroom.       

464
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,278
                  Gives it      
             that meaty texture.

465
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,747
              Add this mixture  
             with the potatoes. 

466
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,949
               Pepper, curry,   
                veggie base,    

467
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:27,351
              crushed walnuts,  
                and parsley.    

468
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,822
 And set that on the side before
    we start making the patties.

469
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,890
            -Got it.            
 -This here is boiled potatoes. 

470
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:34,091
             -Okay.             
             -Cumin.            

471
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,426
      -Veggie base. Curry.      
             -Curry.            

472
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,694
         -Black pepper.         
         -Black pepper.         

473
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,095

474
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,764
             -Nice.             
          -Corn starch,         

475
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,099
               and some water.  

476
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:42,633
  I'm dying to see              
what's gonna happen here.       

477
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,435
    I do not know               
where this is going.            

478
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,571
             Knead this really, 
            really, really well.

479
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:47,905
                  Form this     
             into an egg shape. 

480
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:49,373
             -Okay.             
          -Open it up.          

481
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,641
              Put the stuffing  
                  in there.     

482
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,176
        Huh.                    
   Seal it all up.              

483
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,112
          -Interesting.         
      -Yeah. Pat this down.     

484
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,646
            And then you fry it.

485
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,515
    -What are we making next?   
     -We are making a kafta,    

486
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,318
       which is Lebanon's, like,
             favorite meat dish.

487
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,319
So it's not just vegetarian     
   and vegan here.              

488
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,987
 -Oh, no, no. We're everything. 
             -Okay.             

489
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,722
      This is ground beef 90/10.

490
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,459
          Diced onions, parsley,
          and some tomato paste.

491
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:09,860
        Pepper and salt mixture.

492
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,995
              Cumin. Allspice.  
                  Cinnamon.     

493
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,131
         -Ground garlic.        
         -Fresh garlic?         

494
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:16,000
  Yep. Usually, it's weighed out
                to 5 ounces.    

495
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,535
       Really?                  
That big of a piece?            

496
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,405
      Yeah. We're just gonna add
       some tomatoes and onions.

497
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:22,406
     -Ready to plate it up?

               some tabbouleh,

500
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,345
            which is lemon juice
               and olive oil.

        That's really one

536
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,887

541
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,830
So we start out with some smoked
      paprika. Ground coriander.

542
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:55,700
        White pepper. Cumin goes

                 Canola oil.    
            Apple cider vinegar.

545
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,239
               Crushed garlic.  

546
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,241
               Traditionally,   
       this is made with yogurt.

00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:06,310
         For some of our clients

              mustard instead.  

549
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,380
  So you're getting             
a little more flavor?           

550
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,515
                    Yep.        
                Tomato paste.   

551
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,183

we gonna serve this?

a dance move you started.       

554
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:16,988
       -Yeah, just like --      
     -We're doing the pita.     

555
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,257
All right. Let it marinate 24   
hours. Cook it in the skillet.

        -What's up next?        
         -Tahini sauce.         

557
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:23,527
     We're gonna start with some
      garlic, salt, lemon juice,

558
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,397
          and tahini, and that's
    just ground-up sesame seeds.

559
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,932
               Add some water.  
       And you're gonna nuke it.

560
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,735
              I mean blend it.  

561
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,203
How did you go from "blend"     
     to "nuke"?                 

562
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,137
         -I don't know.         
  -Now we can put it together?  

563
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,274
       Yep. We're going to start
      with veggies, the chicken,

564
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,677
              pickled cabbage,  
             and wild cucumbers.

565
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,812
     We usually add fries in all
        of the wraps in Lebanon.

566
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,080

              pepper and salt,  
   and this here is called toum.

568
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,285
              Toum is a potent  
                garlic sauce.   

569
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,353
             About a tablespoon 
       is five cloves of garlic.

570
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,822
       Wow.                     
              The tahini sauce  
             that we just made, 

571
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,824
             and then that goes 
            on the panini press.

572
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,225
          -Oh, really?          
             -Yeah.             

573
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,827
