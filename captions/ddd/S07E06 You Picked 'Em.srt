             IS JUST RIDICULOUS,

       TURNS INTO A NICE CRUST, 

104
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,634
            BECAUSE OF THE FLOUR
              AND THE CORNMEAL. 

105
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,769
      BUT, BOY, IT'S GOOD.      
 IT'S COOLED DOWN TO A POINT NOW

106

109
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:07,512
          TASTES LIKE           
   MY GRANDMOTHER'S CHICKEN.    
                    IT'S CRISPY.
                   IT'S CRUNCHY.

110
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,648
      I KINDA LIKE TO MIX IN    
   THE BREAD AND BUTTER PICKLE.

     AND THEN YOU GO AT IT.     

113
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,588
        YOU HAVE TO HAVE        
     A BITE OF YOUR CHICKEN     

114
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,324
    AND A BITE OF THE PICKLE    
      AND A BITE OF ONIONS.     

115
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,592

116
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,128

         I DON'T KNOW.          

118
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,668
                             NO?
I'VE NEVER ORDERED              
ANYTHING BUT THE...             

119
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,670
I'VE SEEN BIGGER MENUS          
    AT A BALL GAME.             

120
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,672
         THE ROAST BEEF         
          IS VERY GOOD.         

121
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,674
     FRIED OKRA IS PERFECT.     

122
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,409
HOW ARE THE SALADS?             
             WHAT?              

123
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,277
              (man) DO THEY HAVE
                  SALAD HERE?   

124
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,346
    (woman) FRITO CHILI PIE--   
         IT'S DELICIOUS.        

125
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,081
           ALWAYS HOT,          
        MELTS THE CHEESE.       

126
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,617
                   HE MAKES     
             THE HOMEMADE CHILI.
   OKAY. WELL, WE GOTTA MAKE    
         SOME OF THAT.          

127
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,619
            <i> SAME WAY</i>           
     <i> IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MADE,</i>    

128
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:48,887
  <i> AND THAT'S GEORGE'S RECIPE,</i>  
              <i> TOO.</i>             

129
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,757
 FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE TO PUT IN 
 HALF A GALLON OF SALTED WATER. 

130
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:54,692
I DON'T SEE ANY SEASONING.      
                    OH, NOT YET.

131
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:55,894
OH.                             
                     THEN WE ADD

132
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,497
        APPROXIMATELY 10 POUNDS 
        OF GROUND BEEF TO THAT. 

133
00:04:58,499 --> 00:04:59,898
                  THEN I MIX IT 
                  IN THE WATER. 

134
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,899
        THEN I'LL ADD THE REST  
       OF THE GROUND BEEF TO IT.

135
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,302
SO YOU JUST MUSH THAT UP        
    ON THE BOTTOM...            
                         MM-HMM.

136
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,838
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA PUT       
 THE LOGS OF FUN UP TOP?        
                         ON TOP.

137
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,907
AND HOW MANY POUNDS             
   IS THIS HERE?                
       40 POUNDS. THEN I'LL MUSH
             THEM A LITTLE.     

138
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,511
       MUSH IT UP A LITTLE MORE.
IS THAT "MUSH"?                 

139
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,979
 MUSH. (laughs) NOW WE'RE READY 
 TO JUST COVER IT UP WITH FOIL. 

140
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,449
   WHAT'S GOING ON              
WITH THE SPOON, BOSS?           
           GOTTA STIR THE CHILI.

141
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,252
WAIT A MINUTE.                  

142
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:22,854
YOU'RE JUST GONNA LEAVE         
  THE SPOON IN THERE?           
        WHILE IT'S COOKING, YES.

143
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,657
WHY?                            
             BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS
            BEEN DONE LIKE THAT.

144
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,125
                       (laughs) 

145
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:31,596
 SO THE RULE IS YOU'RE GONNA    
LEAVE THE SPOON IN THE MEAT...  
                    IN THE MEAT.

146
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,599

148
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:38,336
              THAT'S THE WAY    
           WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IT.

149
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,037
WHEN DOES THE FLAVOR            
     COME TO IT?                

150
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:43,475
  WHEN I'M ABOUT DONE COOKING,  
 I PUT ALL THE SEASONING IN IT. 

151
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,877
WE'RE GONNA GO PUT THIS         
 ON TOP OF THE STOVE?           
                            YES.

152
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,747
OH, AWESOME.                    
                 COOK LOW       
         FOR SIX OR SEVEN HOURS.

153
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,682
        MEAT A LA SPOON IS DONE?
MM-HMM.

NOW WE'RE ADDING OUR SALT,

AND SOME CHILI POWDER.          

161
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,432
WE'RE GONNA WORK THAT           
   INTO THE MEAT.               
           SO THEN WHAT HAPPENS?

162

     PEPPER AND GARLIC MIXTURE. 

385
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,837

00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,839
          AND WE'RE JUST GONNA

        FOR ANOTHER THREE HOURS.

390
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:43,915
  TRY TO TELL                   
ME ALL OF THAT                  

391
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,517
 WITH YOUR HANDS                
BEHIND YOUR BACK.               
                I CAN'T DO THAT.

392
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,519
                 YOU'RE ITALIAN.
YEAH. HEY, COME ON,

393
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:50,521
    WE COULD GET                
LOCKED UP LIKE THAT.            
                     ABSOLUTELY.

394
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,590
           ALL RIGHT, SO WE GOT 
           OUR NICE HOT BRISKET.

               BEAUTIFUL, RIGHT?
   OH, LOOK AT                  
THE COLOR ON IT.                

396
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,728
   IS IT ILLEGAL                
TO DO A LITTLE--MMM.            
                  NO, YOU CAN DO
                   A LITTLE BIT.

397
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,596
  OH, IT'S GOT                  
A TON OF FLAVOR.

         THE TRADE SECRETS OUT. 

400
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,936
 UNCLE SEYMOUR, IT'S OKAY.      
I'M NOT GONNA TELL ANYBODY.

00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,741
THE WHOSE?                      
         THE SCHMALTZ. IT'S FAT.

403
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,943
 DON'T POINT AT ME              
AND SAY "SCHMALTZ."             
               GONNA CUBE IT UP,

404
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,879
  AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GRIND IT 
  WITH SOME CARAMELIZED ONIONS. 

405
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:17,148
THAT'S GONNA BE                 
THE SWEETNESS.                  
                          RIGHT.

406
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,683
                   WE'RE GONNA  
                GO TO THE MIXER.

               THAT'S IT.       

410
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,558
                  WE'RE GONNA   
               LET IT COOL DOWN.
AND THEN WE MAKE                
   THE DOUGH?                   

411
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,226

414
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:34,899
          WE'RE GONNA TURN THESE
               INTO SQUARES.    

415
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,800
       AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TAKE
         OUR KREPLACH FILLING,  

416
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,636

           MAKE BALLS OUT OF IT.

OR FLAT OVER? OKAY.             
               CORNER TO CORNER.

419
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,509
       AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA GO 
     AND STRETCH IT. STRETCH IT.
WHOA! STRETCH IT.

                 AND LIKE THAT. 

421
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,846
              MAKE SURE IT'S ALL
                SEALED UP NICE. 

422
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,516
      WE'RE GONNA TAKE THESE    
   AND WE'RE GONNA BOIL 'EM UP, 

423
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:52,917

OKAY.                           

424
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,653
           AND WHEN THEY RISE UP
               TO THE TOP--     
HOW DO THEY DO THAT AGAIN?      

425
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:57,655
                    WHEN THEY...
       (together) RISE UP       
         TO THE TOP...          

426
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,590
            THEY'RE READY TO GO.
OKAY.

YOU CAN HAVE IT ALSO            
 WITH A MATZO BALL,             

434
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,406

THAT'S RIDICULOUS.              

445
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,365
 I GUESS I COULD JUST SIT THERE
