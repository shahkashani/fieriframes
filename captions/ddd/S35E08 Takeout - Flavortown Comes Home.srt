00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:03,802
            Man, it sure is nice
        to have the Camaro home.

2
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:05,404
  It's never here.              
                That's right.   

3
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:07,339
                And you know,   
      since we're quarantined...

4
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,474
The car's quarantined.          

5
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:09,741
        ...the car's quarantine.

6
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,744
          Now, we've been making
            some fantastic meals

7
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:14,012
        here at the Fieri house,
     but what do we really want?

8
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,881
     I just want                
  to go out to eat.             

9
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,348
               Well, we can't   
               go out to eat.   

10
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,686
         But we can get takeout,
 and I know some Triple D joints

11
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:23,488
               that would love  
              to send it to us. 

12
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,023
 FIERI: From Fairhope, Alabama, 

13
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,892
  Panini Pete is going to send  
      some paella fritters.     

14
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:29,294
          Bro, this is dynamite.

15
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:32,364
 And then our buddy John Conley 
      coming out of Arizona     

16
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,766
       is going to send us      
  some kind of a crazy tamale.  

17
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,235
         This is exactly        
    what we wanted it to be.    

18
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,970
    Nina from Forte in Vegas    

19
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:41,106
        is going to send        
      this great dumplings.     

20
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:43,308
    Take a look at that, huh?   
          [ Whistles ]          

21
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,977
Then from Kansas City, Missouri,
   we got our buddy, Stretch,   

22
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:49,314
 and he's going to send us some 
 burnt-end Philly cheese steaks.

23
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:52,518
     This is taking the best    
  of Philly and the best of KC  

24
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,653
   and putting them together.   

25
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,122
 On top of it all, they're going
     to video conference in     

26
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,591
       to give us the true      
     "Triple D" experience.

  Very.                         

28
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:03,328
                  Exactly.      
    This is "Triple D: Takeout."

         we are, folks.         

32
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,278
       These are our first

00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,555
     the one and only, from     
 Fairhope, Alabama, Panini Pete.

37
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:31,423
           Then out of          
     Kansas City, Missouri,     

38
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,826
    there's our boy, Stretch,   
       with a fine hairdo.      

39
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:36,895
 And then he's from Salsa Brava 
         and Fat Olives,

00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,565
  the one and only John Conley. 

41
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:42,367
    And our good friend Nina    
     from Forte in Las Vegas    

42
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,969
        where Hunter had        
      his graduation party.     

43
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:45,504
              Huh?              
That's some good times.         

44
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:47,572
                 All right,     
 so Hunter and I are quarantined

45
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,575
        here with Lori and Ryder
             here at our house. 

46
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:53,444
             And so we asked you
         to send us a great dish

47
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,113
           that you're currently
                 working on,    

48
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,182
      something that's exciting,
             that is on the menu

49
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,717
                  or going      
             to be on the menu, 

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,119
             so we are prepared,
       depending on what fashion

51
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,654
         you sent this to us in,

52
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,990
             to do a little bit 
      of heating and warming up.

53
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,992
          Hunter, any questions?
        Did we start this right?

54
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,259
        Yeah.                   
 We're doing great.             

55
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,729
      We have absolutely no idea
              what we're doing, 

56
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,264
          but this is the reason
                we did this.    

57
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,399
                  As chefs      
        and as restaurant owners

58
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,000
         and as people that work
              in the industry,  

59
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,802
              we know how hard  
       the industry is being hit

60
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,137
               and that's why   
       we're wearing our shirts.

61
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,939
           This is the R.E.R.F.,

                Relief Fund.    

63
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,544
          We've been doing a lot
         of fundraising for that

64
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:28,347
       and helping the employees
           that are out of work.

65
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,682
  Everybody needs a little love,
         needs a little support.

66
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,751
          And so what we thought
   we would do is show everybody

67
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:35,287
     how you could go to some of
       your favorite restaurants

68
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:38,623
       and get takeout and enjoy
some of this great food at home.

69
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,691
                 All right,     
           so who's going first?

70
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:40,959
                Panini Pete,

     in all of the Panini Pete's

72
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:47,165
         and Sunset Pointe Grill
 in the Fairhope, Alabama, area?

73
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,100
     PETE: All of our places    
         are shut down.         

74
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,835
       We did takeout for       
          a little bit,         

75
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,637
     and we decided to give     
       everybody a break.       

76
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,838
        Go home, be safe.       

77
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,240
                And where are   
               you right now?   

78

82
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,852
               You're probably  
              going to love it. 

83
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,120
            Look at that nugget.

84
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,390
     Done?                      
         I'll go away right now.

85
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,926
   Out of bounds.               
You're doing it the right way.  

86
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,661
    FIERI: All right. I said    
      send me a great dish      

87
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,997
    that you're doing at your   
 restaurant for when you reopen.

A couple of boxes coming to you.

         what's in here.        

90

  You know, I never             
 miss an opportunity            

91
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,339
 to show some love.             

92

                     Oh!

    in Alabama there, Panini?   

102
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,827

00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,498
 the paella fritter dish, baby. 

106
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,968
     You take a paella rice     
      and kind of clash it      

107
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,970
    with an arancini, make it   
  a fried little fritter ball.  

108

                 [ Laughs ]     

109
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:02,841

       actually send ice?       

110
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,642
                   It says      
           "Ice for a cocktail."

111
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,377
That's awesome.                 
   I put the ice in there, too. 

112
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,714
             So walk me through 
              the paella rice.  

113
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:12,050
   So we started off with just  
 sauteed some onions and garlic.

114
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:15,253
      We added in the rice      
  with some stock and saffron.  

115
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,023
    Chorizo's going in there,   
     then we have our peas.     

116
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,857
                Got it. Next up?
     Grilled chicken thigh.     

117
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:20,992
                      Okay.     
         There should be        

118
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,594
        a small container       
    of a sliced green onions.   

119
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,731
     Manchego cheese has got    
      to go in there, too.      

120
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,065
                 All right,     
             mixing it together.

121
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,267
       Scramble that egg.       

122
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,934
         This egg that's in here
         that's already cracked,

123
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,271
      that's still in the shell,
         it's completely gnarly.

124
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,505
                    [ Groans ]  
        It was whole when       

125
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,474
       I put it in there.       

126
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:36,541
          I should have         
       bubble wrapped it.       

127
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:37,809
          [ Chuckles ]          

128
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,078
                 If I don't     
             hate egg enough... 

129
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,413
        So, basically now, Pete,
              you have paid off 

130
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,950
              your egg dilemma  
             with the skateboard

131
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,718
      and you're at ground zero.

132
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,620
 Add that in there as a binder. 
         Mix it in good.        

133
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,555
 And then we're going to be able
     to roll it into balls.     

134
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,891
                  Bread crumbs? 
    That's breading mixture.    

135
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,293
        All you got to do       
     is dump and stir, baby.    

136
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,561
                 Corn meal.     

137
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,296
              Yeah.             
     Everybody in the pool.     

138
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,565
       Guy, it looks like       
  complete chaos on this side.  

139
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,166
        How is it there?        

140
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,769
                 A chaos is     
     an understatement, Stretch,

141
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,638
         but thank you very much
              for checking in.  

142
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,707
   Panini, what do we have here?
             Spice for breading?

143
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,508
          That goes in          
     with the breading mix.     

144
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,511
                   I know,      
        but what are the spices?

145
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,112
     It's got salt, pepper.     

146
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:17,382
    It's got garlic, cayenne,   
paprika, and some dried oregano.

147
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,518
    Okay, so Hunter can go ahead
             and form these up. 

148
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,253
   I have some egg wash there.  

149
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:23,121
              This is milk that 
              you sent us here, 

150
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,923
             and you need an egg
               added to that.   

151
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,324
        There was an egg.       
               Oh.              

152
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,794
 No, Panini, they're all broken.
                Don't start.    

153
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:29,928
              Is this the size  
             we're looking for? 

154
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,264
      Yeah, golf ball size      
         looks perfect.         

155
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,732
      You got this, Hunter.     

156
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,133
          Hunter's going to take
               the paella ball  

157
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,534
              with the chorizo. 

158
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,603
             It's got the cooked
               chicken thigh.   

159
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,405
             It's got the peas, 
         and you had already hit

160
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,607
                 that paella    
              with the saffron, 

161
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,076
                 so it's got    
           that beautiful color.

162
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:46,878
          Then we're going to go
     into this milk and egg wash

163
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,814
             into the multi mix 
             of every ingredient

164
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,283
             you possibly have, 
 and that's going to go together

165
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,485
            into the oil at 350.

166
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:55,086
      You got it. Perfect.      

167
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,821
            Now let's talk about
             the romesco sauce. 

168
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,156
           What do we got, Pete?

169
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,425
    Alright, so you got some    
   roasted red peppers there.   

170
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,561
              Toasted almonds,  
                red vinegar.    

171
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:05,764
  Some oil down there, as well. 
        Parsley in there.       

172
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,899
               Green onions?    
       Green onions. Yep.       

173
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,367
             Is that lemon zest?

174
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,569
         Yep. Go ahead.         

175
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:11,770
                 Everybody's    
                in the pool.    

176
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,438
             Any salt or pepper 
              into this Panini? 

177
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,839
     Yeah, salt and pepper.     

178
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,441
                 And this is    
             the romesco sauce. 

179
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:17,975
      All right, so here's      
      the deal, everybody.      

180
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,511
        Panini Pete from        
       Fairhope, Alabama,       

181
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,180
           has sent us          
       a fantastic recipe       

182
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,449
       that we got to cook      
      completely ourselves.     

183
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:27,252
     Ryder's on the camera.     
     Hunter's on the paella.    

184
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,253
      I'm making a romesco.     

185
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,722
       When we come back,       
       "Triple D: Takeout"      

186
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,857
         happening here         
       at the Fieri house,      

187
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:32,991
   and we'll see you in a bit.  

188
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,726
          Panini, these         
      better taste awesome.     

189
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,328
     All right, keep an eye.    

190
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,339
         Welcome back to        
      "Triple D: Takeout",      

191
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:49,674
      a special edition of      
   "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives"  

192
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,009
         happening here         
     in Northern California     

193
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,143
       at the Fieri house.      

194
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,879
      I've got my main man      
      Ryder on the cameras.     

195
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,948
         I've got Hunter        
     doing the sous chefing     

196
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,483
         and co-hosting.        

197
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,685
     And four of my favorite    
        "Triple D" chefs        

198
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:03,154
       are joining me here      
     via a video conference.    

199
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,490
     We got the Panini Pete.    
       We've got Stretch,       

200
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:08,092
      John Conley, and Nina     
    from Forte in Las Vegas.    

201
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,961
          We're working         
       on Panini's recipe,      

202
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,764
        a paella fritter,       
    but he didn't make them.    

203
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,732
   He sent us the ingredients   
          to make them.         

204
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,634
       Here's the romesco.      

205
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,302
    So we usually               
a little arugula salad          

206
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,504
    with a little               
    vinaigrette.                

207
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,239
   How do you like our plating  
         so far, Panini?        

208
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,975
You're looking good, man.       
You're looking good.            

209
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,176
     All right.                 

210
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,878
       Little bit of steam      
       coming off of that.      

211
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,715
               Mm.              

212
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,650
          There you go.         
        How is it, Ryder?       

213
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:33,985
              Nice!             

214
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,587
  Here's what I love about it.  

215
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,523
        The saffron rice,       
        perfectly cooked.       

216
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,325
 The chorizo is nice and salty. 

217
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,928
      It's got that chorizo     
       kick that you want.      

218
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,130
My favorite part about it is the
 manchego and the chicken thigh.

219
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,199
    HUNTER: Yeah.               

220
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,802
     Bro, this is dynamite.     
      This is paella to go.     

221
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,606
    I don't think I've had it   
  in this form, in this style,  

222
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:55,806
      this good, good ever.     

223
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,741
         Congrats, man.         

224
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,342
                  Oh, brah,     
                thanks, Guy.    

225
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,677
   Thanks, Hunter.              
   Good job, man.               

226
