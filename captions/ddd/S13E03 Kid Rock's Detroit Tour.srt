       ADD HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM.

73
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,978
 SO HEAVY CREAM REALLY          
ADDS THE RICHNESS TO IT.        
         ADDS THE RICHNESS, YEP.

74
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,114

91
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,420
                 AND WE'RE GONNA
                 LET IT THICKEN.

92
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:43,888
            NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD 
           SOME PARMESAN CHEESE.

OR ARE WE JUST GONNA STAND HERE 
    AND LOOK GOOD AT THIS?      

94
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,159
    I THOUGHT YOU JUST TOOK     
     SOME NOODLES, CHEESE,      

95
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:48,693
       AND SOME PET MILK        
   AND THREW IT IN THE OVEN.    

96
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,629
WHAT'S PET MILK?                
           IT'S LIKE            
         A CREAM SAUCE.         

97
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,497
       YEAH, IT'S, LIKE,        
   FOR YOUR DOG OR SOMETHING.   

98
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,766
       THAT'S PET MILK.         
    GUYS FROM CALIFORNIA,       
WE DON'T KNOW STUFF LIKE THIS.  

99
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:58,103
   OKAY, SO NOW YOU CHILL IT    
BEFORE YOU ADD IT TO THE PASTA, 

100
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,171
AND THEN YOU ADD THE COLD PASTA 
  AND THE COLD CHEESE SAUCE,    

101
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,839
YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER.        
                         MM-HMM.

102
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,708
THIS COULD FIX YOUR POTHOLE     
    PROBLEM IN DETROIT.         

103
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,377

       ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE GONNA
            ADD THE SAUCE.

00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,114
NOW WE'RE GONNA PUT MORE CREAM  
   IN--MORE HALF-AND-HALF.      

106
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,050
 YOU ARE NOT SHORT ON           
THE DAIRY ON THIS, MAN.         

107
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,118

      SO YOU CAN FEEL THE LOVE. 

108
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,721
THAT'S IT.                      
                 THAT'S HOW     
             YOU KNOW IT'S DONE.

109
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,656
               AND WE'RE GONNA

CHEESE? THIS SUPER CHEDDAR?     

112
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,662
        I WOULDN'T KNOW         
        WHAT TO CALL IT.        

113
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:27,265
      I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW      
     HOW TO PRONOUNCE THAT.     
IT COMES IN A WHEEL.            

114
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,933
OH, GOOD STUFF, MAN.            

115
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,002
   YOU'VE GOT A LAYER           
OF THAT CHEESE IN THERE,        

116
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,937
TWO LAYERS OF THE MAC.          
            SHARP WHITE CHEDDAR.

117
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,741
   NOW YOU GO WITH              
A LITTLE PANKO ON TOP?          
                   A LITTLE BIT.

118
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,742
ALL RIGHT, SO WE TAKE THIS.     
 WE'RE GONNA BAKE IT OFF.       

119
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,679
WHAT TEMP?                      
          425, ABOUT 12 MINUTES.

120
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,684
 AS YOU CLIP IT OPEN AND LET IT 
      STEAM A LITTLE BIT,       

121
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,286

124
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,559

THE CHEESE RIGHT IN THERE.      

127
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:01,766
THEN YOU'VE GOT THE CREAM.      

128
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,635
  THEN YOU'VE GOT THE CRUNCH    
ON TOP WITH THE WHITE CHEDDAR,  

129
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,570

282
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:26,383
 THE BUN IS PERFECT BECAUSE IT  
WORKS AS A VESSEL TO GET IT IN. 

283
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,253
  THE LINK HAS GOT              
SOME NICE HEAT TO IT

COMING FROM THE PORK.           

287
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,993

IS THAT CAROLINA MUSTARD        

288
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,728
 AND THE VINEGAR

    FROM THE BACON.             

291
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,933
THIS MAY BE 3-WAY PIG,
