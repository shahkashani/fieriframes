Start with the water,           
   our soy sauce,

00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,072
               Not too salty,   
               not too heavy.   

66
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,008
Black pepper, bay leaves.       

67

     And a bunch of brown sugar.

69
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,213
We'll put this over the ribs.   

70
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:29,747
        Wrap her up. So, they're
            gonna get the steam.

71
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:30,949
   They're gonna get the braise.

72
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:34,219
Pop them in the oven,           
350 for about 5 hours.

00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:35,554

   and some honey.              

78
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,299
Boil and then simmer it         
  for a little bit              

79
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:48,900
to get the flavors together.    

80
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,970
Tighten it with a little        
 cornstarch slurry.             

81
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,772

          hit them on the grill.

82
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,241
        Give them a little mark.
Put them in the sauce.

             it's a nice touch. 

92
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:19,264
        You're making kalua pork
                 in the pan,    

93
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,867

 One Iniki Burger in the window.
           Pick it up.          

118
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,519
       The Iniki Burger is

119
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,322

               all over again.  

120
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,259
 This was a concept             
of Todd's and Michele's.        

121
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,459

             -SPAM.             

122

125
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,199
     Throw it in the frying pan.

126
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,334
Gives it a little texture.      

127
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,535
             Pulls a little bit 
              of the salt out.  

128
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,203
             -Yeah.             
      -Now into the 80-20.      

129
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,938
          We're gonna form these
                into patties.   

130
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,606
And then some pickled           
  vegetable on top.             

131
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,142
     -Do you make that also?    
          -Yes, we do.          

132
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,576
        You're an underachiever.

133
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,146
We're gonna start with our      
rice wine vinegar, water...     

134
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,413
         A whole bunch of sugar.

135
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,949
...fresh ground garlic...       

136
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,951
                        Salt.   
...and a little bay leaf.       

137
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,419
Just bring it to a boil.        

138
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,020
              Shredded carrots. 
  Red onions.                   

139
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,823
       And thin-sliced jalapeño.
              And let it steep. 

140
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,959
    This goes for about 24 hours
             before you use it? 

141
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,361
 Yeah. Slaw goes on             
the bottom of the burger,       

142
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,895
mayonnaise, fresh thyme.        

143
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,898
          That's a lot of thyme.
I like that thyme flavor.       

144
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,134
                   Evidently.   
Fresh garlic, white pepper.     

145
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,437
 I've seen a lot of dressings --
          never that much thyme.

146
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,907
Grated carrots, Napa cabbage,   
and some radish sprouts.        

147
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,042

Slaw dressing on the bottom.

"How can I use my chef skills

 The Thai Curry chicken sausage 

231
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,217
          is one of my          
      favorite sandwiches.      

232

     It's got a great amount    
            of spice.           

233
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,755

it blasts in your mouth.

Alright, so, today we're

  pork fat, garlic,

And then we're gonna let it     
  cool to about 107

             I found this place 
           about two months ago,

611
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,368
             and I've been here
