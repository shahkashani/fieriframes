           Hey, there.

 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,740
          This trip...          
That is outstanding.            

5

        ...we're getting        
        big-time bites...

                I don't know    
         how to break this down.

00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:15,880
   ...of some serious flavor.   

8
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,482

     of Queens, New York...     

10
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:23,021
                    Oh, my gosh!
 ...the "where are we?" joint...

11
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,089
             Never seen anything
                 like this.

      real-deal Vietnamese.

         I could eat this thing 
         till my head falls off.

                    Is that you?

17
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:37,770
        Yes.                    

18
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:40,772
  ...for an out-of-bounds take  
          on a classic.         

19
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,708
                It really is    
             a dynamite burger.

      is always the answer.     

24
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:52,985
              You're gonna make 
                   a mess.      

25
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:54,519
       Is that                  
what we're gonna with?          

26
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,121
                 Yeah. Yeah.    
            Yeah, just going to.

27

 I'm here in Ridgewood, Queens. 

32
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,607
  Now, I'm about, let me think, 

33
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,843
   about a thousand miles away  
    from downtown Manhattan.    

34
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,277
Actually, I'm only 5 miles away,

35
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,946
        but it seems like       
        I'm way out here.       

36
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,614
             I mean,            
  I'm in this industrial park.  

37
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,549
            We've got           
   a scrap-metal joint there,   

38
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,351
   we've got a concrete plant   
           over here.           

39
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,687
         You're saying,         
 "Guy, why are you so far out?" 

40
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,623
 Listen, I hear they got a joint
 with the bomb Vietnamese food.

it just hits my heart, you know?

           I love it.

     It's like you're eating    
           in Vietnam.

  Central Vietnam, to be exact, 

49
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,509
    where Chef Jimmy Tu's mom   
      and dad were raised.

    what his mama taught him    

52
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:57,649
  and tricked out a menu loaded 
  with Vietnamese street food.  

53
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,919
       We got about five minutes
           on these pork chops. 

54
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,589
   The grilled pork chops here  
   are absolutely incredible.   

55
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:04,723
       It is my favorite.       

56
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:05,791
               All right, so,   
         what are we gonna make?

57
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,726

00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,796
                    Okay.       

61
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,333
   We got garlic,               
 Thai chili peppers.            

62
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:15,267
                    Okay.

00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,137
               And this is all  
          just for the marinade?

65
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,172
        Yeah.                   

66
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,208
          And we're gonna put it
                   in here      

67
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,676
                 and hit it     
     with the mortar and pestle?

68
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:25,611
        Yeah.                   

69
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,012
                     So,        
             breaking this down.

70

        Yeah.                   

71
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,681
             So, this is really 
               opening it up,   

72
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,216
                bringing all    
              that flavor out.  

73
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,284
Now we're gonna put it          
     in a bowl.                 

74
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,956
    And to this,                
we're gonna add sea salt.       

75
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,758
                        Sugar?  
       Sugar.                   

76
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,829
Fish sauce, canola oil,         
and this is Chinese XO sauce.   

77
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,899
      It's like                 
a Chinese barbecue sauce.       

78
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,635
    Stir that up.               

79
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,706
             You could marinate 
            a seat cushion in it

80
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,773
                 and that'd

  right in here to the marinade?

87
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,221
       Mix it                   
      in there.

00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,196
           Oh, my God.          
      It's just delicious.      

116
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:25,364
                       Mmm.     
Beef going out.                 

117
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,666
       It's a type of food      
that you come here, and you eat,

118
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,000
  and you're thinking about it  
            all week.           

119
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,802
             FIERI:             
   It's that kind of obsession  

120
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,871
      that makes this place     
   a pilgrimage worth making.   

121
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:38,143
   I like it for the quaint view
            of the scrap metal. 

122
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,277
                What was here   
                 before you?    

123
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,545
When we started here,           

124
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,347
    we were doing               
boutique seafood distribution.  

125
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:45,283
                     Okay.      
Hence the weird location.       

126
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,886
But then Sandy hit us,          
   we got flooded.              

127
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,087
                      Here?     
  Yeah.                         

128
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,355
 It was a mess.                 
                        Really? 

129
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:51,489
        Yeah.                   

130
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,691
              So, you came in,  
             you built this out?

131
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,160
   I always wanted              
to do Vietnamese street food.   

132
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,895
 So, while the flooded building 

133
00:04:56,897 --> 00:05:00,565
 became the inspiration for the 
 name, the menu is pure comfort.

134
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,768
          We're talking         
     lemongrass short ribs,     

135
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,770
caramelized shrimp, or this dish

136
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,173
           that comes           
   with a fanatical following.  

137
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:10,308
        The crispy crepe        
        changed my life.        

138
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,509
          What's the first thing
              we're gonna make? 

139
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,978
Our banh xeo batter.            
                     Fire it up.

140
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:18,983
We got rice flour, turmeric,    
  sea salt, water.              

141
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,186
  It's very simple.             

142
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:27,492
Once that's nicely mixed,       
 add our scallions.             

143
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:30,862
                    That's it?  
That's it.                      

144
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,331
  Get this pan hot,             
  add a little oil.             

145
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,000
This is Heritage bacon          
   that's smoked,               

146
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,936
      combined                  
  with the shrimp.              

147
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,670
                   I like       
        that you're cooking hot.

148
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,605
        Yeah.                   

149
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,808
Now we add the batter.          

150
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,810
                    Nuts!       

151
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:49,748
That rice flour falls underneath
     the oil and the bacon fat, 

152
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,283
     and it's just soaking it up
              at the same time. 

153
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:52,951
                    Whoa!       

154
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,752
              Easy on the egg.  
       Trying to cut down on it.

155
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:55,987
               There you go.    
               That's plenty.   

156
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,824
       We add                   
 some bean sprouts.             

157
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,626
  This looks good.              

158
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:04,429
  We fold it over.              

159
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,764
             Never seen anything
                 like this.     

160
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,199
   Trim this off.               

161
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,571
 And this is how it gets served,
           on the bamboo board? 

162
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:13,571
        Yeah.                   

163
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,373
          Okay, so, I load it up
                 like this?     

164
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,308
        Yeah.                   
Grab whatever herbs you want.   

165
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,643
                   Basil,       
               a little mint.   

166
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,044
        Yeah.                   
     Wrap it up.                

167
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,780
               Dip it like this?
  Yep.                          

168
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:24,783
                    Mmm.        

169
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,518
                 That is nuts!  
[ Chuckles ]                    

170
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,586
                   See --       
                Oh, my gosh!    

171
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,189
                I don't know    
          how to break this down

172
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:34,593
                 about what     
             is more fantastic. 

173
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:37,929
  This right here with the bacon
              and the scallions 

174
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,432
             and the crispiness 
               and the shrimp.  

175
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,469
            That is wicked good,
                    dude.       

176
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,071
                    Mmm!        

177
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,605
 Banh xeo going out.            

178
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,407
It's crispy, but it's also soft.

179
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,742
         It's all melty.        

180
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,343
          The freshness         
      of the bean sprouts,      

181
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:56,080
         the savoriness         
  of the bacon and the shrimp.  

182
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,150
    Bun-Ker food has probably   
        the best aspects        

183
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,353
    of every Southeast Asian    
   cooking cuisine out there.   

184
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,889
             I think            
 if it's the last meal on earth,

185
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,691
  I'm gonna have it right here. 
                            Mmm.

186
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,962
I've eaten great food, but this,
 without question, is dynamite. 

187
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,431
                 Excellent job. 
Thank you, man.                 

188
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:16,968
        FIERI: Up next...       
                       Oh, yeah.

189
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,370
        Practically a whole duck
             and half of Idaho. 

190
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,973
        We're headed over       
   to Manhattan's East Village  

191
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,241
    to put a buddy's claim...   

192
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:26,444
This burger is, in my opinion,  
the best hamburger in America.  

193
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,646
         ...to the test.        
                          80/20?

194
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,714
       70/30.                   

195
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,216
                   70/30?       
             My kind of burger. 

196
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,662
    I'm here in New York City   
       in the East Village      

197
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,130
to check out a joint that I hear

198
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,265
       has this eclectic        
       scratch-made menu,       

199
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:50,001
    but better yet, it comes    
    really highly recommended   

200
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,469
      from a buddy of mine      
          who is, like,         

201
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,538
  a big-shot burger aficionado. 

202
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,307
    This is the Brindle Room.   

203
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:01,613
         Baked oysters.         

204
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,481
    Just melts in your mouth.   

205
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,550
      Duck Confit Poutine.      
     MAN: It's a hidden gem.    

206
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,218
     One of the better meals    
    you'll have in this area.   

207
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,887
          Mexican Moules Frites.

208
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,489
             FIERI:             
 And Chef Jeremy Spector's menu 

209
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,356
           is keeping           
    the interest level high.    

210
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:15,960
       From Pumpkin Gratin      
  and beer-battered pork belly, 

211
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,629
        to -- get this --       
        potato doughnuts.       

212
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,898
     That's totally Jeremy      
     to do something crazy.     

213
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,299
       WOMAN: He's worked       
 at some of the best restaurants

214
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,634
          in the city.          

215
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,569
    And he wanted to give up    
       all the cool flash       

216
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:25,971
   and do a neighborhood joint  

217
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:28,173
       where you can come       
     and eat stuff you like     

218
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,542
    but push it a little bit    
         into the edge.         

219
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,045
   FIERI: But he's knocking it  
         out of the park        

220
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,780
  with a familiar classic, too. 

221
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,849
      Brindle Room burger,      
     medium, with American.     

222
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,051
      It is the best burger     
        I've ever eaten.        

223
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,386
                So, the buddy   
              I told you about  

224
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,454
                  really is     
   a big-shot burger aficionado,

225
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,190
            and that's this guy,
                Josh Ozersky.   

226
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,524
    This burger,                
  the Brindle Room,             

227
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,860
 is in my opinion --            
my professional opinion --      

228
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,395
 the best hamburger             
     in America.                

229
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:53,665
    FIERI: And it all starts    
     with a high-end grind.     

230
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,268
                   This is      
                for burger?!    

231
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,539
This and this outer cap         
   is for burger.               

232
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,007
       So, you got a big bone-in
               prime rib here,  

233
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,943
                  pull off      
         all that beautiful fat,

234
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,078
                 mix it here    
   with this big piece of chuck?

235
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,146
        Yes.                    

236
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,348
A little bit of extra fat,      
   and that's it.               

237
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,749
 Nothing weird.                 
                       80/20?   

238
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:12,884
       70/30.                   

239
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,085
                   70/30?       

240
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,420
It's a lot of fat.              
              My kind of burger.

241
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,755
So, I'm gonna mix this up       
    with my hand.               

242
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,892
I'm just gonna activate         
the proteins just a little bit. 

243
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,628
          Activate the proteins.

244
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,296
   Everybody makes              
their burgers differently.      

245
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,031
     Some people                
don't pack them at all.         

246
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,633
     Some people                
 pack them lightly.             

247
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,435
    We pack them                
a little bit medium.            

248
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,569
                    Okay.       

249
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,105
       I have                   
   this pipe here.              

250
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,373
  Put that on top.              

251
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,242
       And we                   
  form our burger.              

252
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,111
      It's only                 
   about 6 ounces.              

253
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,179
                    Okay.       

254
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,715
And there's our patty           
    right there.                

255
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:44,783
                [ Whistles ]    

256
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,117
                 How are we     
              gonna cook this?  

257
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:49,721
Salt, pepper, just a drop       
of oil, cast-iron skillet.      

258
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,724
                 Fire it up,    
                    dude.       

259
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:56,261
          Super hot, both sides.

260
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,663
       We have                  
  American cheese.              

261
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:01,466
 We add a little bit            
of caramelized onions on there. 

262
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,270
    Toasted bun.                

263
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,272
            And the two pickles?
Just to garnish.                

264
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,739
                 And that's     
               all she wrote?   

265
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:09,708
     That's it.                 

266
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,810
                 No tomato,     
                   no...?       

267
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:16,681
No tomato, no lettuce,          
just a very pedestrian bun.     

268
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,551
            It's only 6 ounces, 
 but it's very meaty, very rich.

269
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:20,952
                   The bun      
            works out fantastic.

270
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,887
    Caramelized onions are nice,
      a little sweetness to it. 

271
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,356
            Crust that you built
             in that screaming, 

272
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:26,090
                 smoking-hot    
             cast-iron skillet. 

273
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:30,761
     I like the juiciness of it,
     the cheese melting into it.

274
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,097
                    Mmm.        

275
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,466
                It really is    
             a dynamite burger. 

276
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:42,173
     The first time I bit in    
   that burger, I was amazed.   

277
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,509
        It tastes unlike        
  any other burger in New York. 

278
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:47,111
    I think it's really juicy   
      and really excellent.     

279
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,113
        He's been cooking       
     since he's 7 years old.    

280
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,649
            His food            
   has always been delicious.   

281
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,050
             FIERI:             
 And while he's picked up skills

282
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,919
       cooking everywhere       
       from Cali to London      

283
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,253
  to Food Network's "Chopped,"  

284
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:59,524
        he's also drawing       
      a little inspiration      

285
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,726
    from a late-'70s sitcom.    

286
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:04,996
               So, talk to me   
        about Mel's Diner, baby.

287
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,332
 That's our buddy Mel Sharples, 

288
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,267
       the old-school cook      
     on the TV show "Alice."    

289
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,338
                    Mean.       
                Opinionated.    

290
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,607
     Yeah.                      
           Kind-hearted, though.

291
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,342
       Yes.                     
                   Loved people.

292
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,010
                  Is that you?  
   Yes.                         

293
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,546
    And when we come back...    

294
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,214
                 Here's your    
            Duck Confit Poutine.

295
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:26,084
      ...he's gonna show us     
         just how much.         

296
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,152
             What are you doing 
           serving duck poutine?

297
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,354
I'll serve whatever I want      
  and when I want.              

298
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,322
                That's right,   
                   Alice!       

299
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,398
 FIERI: At the Brindle Room in  
 the East Village of Manhattan, 

300
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,634
       Chef Jeremy Spector      
       has created a menu       

301
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:45,302
of rocking American favorites...

302
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,437
                  Killer burger.
Killer burger?                  

303
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,705
               Killer burger.   

304
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,808
       ...to go with some       
 international comfort classics.

305
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:53,444
           Here's your          
      Duck Confit Poutine.      

306
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,247
    FIERI: A high-end version   
    of the Canadian favorite.   

307
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,582
   It's delectable and savory.  

308
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:00,485
           It's, like,          
the perfect combination of food.

309
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,655
                   FIERI:       
            Are you from Canada?

310
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:05,056
         No.                    

311
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,858
                  From France?  
Not quite.                      

312
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,327
             What are you doing 
           serving duck poutine?

313
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,129
I'll serve whatever I want      
  and when I want.              

314
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,665
                That's right,   
                   Alice!       

315
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:14,799
        Yeah.                   

316
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,134
                     So,        
         what are we gonna make?

317
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:19,137
We're gonna make our jus        
for our Duck Confit Poutine.    

318
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:20,471
                    Okay.       
           Let's get after this.

319
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,608
First, I'm gonna add my roasted 
chicken bones, roasted carrots. 

320
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,342
                     Mirepoix.  
Got onions, celery.             

321
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,612
  Now I'm gonna add             
my brown chicken stock.         

322
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:28,880
            So, we're gonna cook
                 this down?     

323
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,214
        Yes.                    

324
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,951
We're gonna strain it, and then 
we're gonna further reduce it,  

325
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,886
so we get a really thick,       
  flavorful gravy.              

326
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,922
                   Dig it.      

327
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,690
                    Okay.       
               Break it down.   

328
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,959
     All right.                 

329
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,426
I got my Long Island duck       
     right here.                

330
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,762
              And are we saving 
                 this skin?     

331
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,032
So, the skin we're gonna        
render down for the duck confit.

332
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:49,234
                    Okay.       

333
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,436
   And we take out              
      the leg.                  

334
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,103
                           Okay.
So, I have my duck carcass.     

335
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,906
   We're gonna use              
to make this a stock.           

336
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,507
                      Got it.   
Get that out of the way.        

337
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,376
Legs for confit right here.     
                          Great.

338
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,678
And I have a few more           
    already done.               

339
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:08,519
Next, I'm going to add cinnamon,
bay leaf, whole garlic,         

340
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,523
a little bit of orange rind,    
whole black peppercorns.        

341
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,858
                  Shallots?     
  Shallots.                     

342
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,396
    Thyme, sage,                
and rosemary and salt.          

343
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,998
  This is gonna sit             
     overnight.                 

344
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,533
             So, we're gonna do 
            kind of a dry brine?

345
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,600
      Exactly.                  

346
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:23,734
                Bring it out,   
       hit it with the duck fat,

347
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,270
                 fill it up,    
               go to the oven.  

348
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:26,905
And when we roast it in the oven
          with the duck fat...? 

349
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:28,539
250 for three hours.            

350
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,608
            250 for three hours.
                    Okay.       

351
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,743
         So,                    
this is our finished confit.    

352
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,011
                Cooled down,    
                    yes?        

353
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,013
    Cooled down.                

354
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:37,414
We're gonna pull the confit,    
    save the fat.               

355
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,350
   And when I fry               
 my French fries...             

356
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,284
                    Yes?        

357
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,753
 ...that's gonna go             
      in there.                 

358
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,387
     You drop a little in there.
                   Gotcha.      

359
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,089
   I'm gonna pull               
      the meat.                 

360
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,557
                   Look at that.
It's nice and tender.           

361
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,559
                  Gorgeous.     

362
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,961
                     Oh,        
                that's tasty.   

363
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,896
    A little of that orange peel
               coming through,  

364
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,564
             a little cinnamon. 

365
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,433
          Outrageous, my friend.

366
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:56,501
                    Okay,       
                 next step.     

367
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,037
 So, we got our duck            
      in a pan.                 

368
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,371
   We're gonna put              
     our jus in.                

369
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:01,706
 I'm gonna let that             
      heat up.                  

370
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,707
I'm gonna bring it to a boil,   
and I'm gonna add the slurry.   

371
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,076
                Then we'll go   
          to the slurry. Got it.

372
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,514
   All right, so,               
we have our hand-cut fries.     

373
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,648
                    Nice.       

374
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,317
We got our duck skin            
      in here.                  

375
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:15,386
We are going to toss in         
  our cheese curds.             

376
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,721
  A little tossing.             

377
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,456
      The trick                 
is that you layer everything    

378
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,592
     so each bit                
  has cheese curds,             

379
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:25,597
  has French fries,             
and it has duck and sauce.      

380
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,932
 So, we're gonna put            
 a little bit down,             

381
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,336
top it off with another layer of
French fries and cheese curds.  

382
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,004
                 Duck skin.     
                    Nice.       

383
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:36,407
And finally, one more layer     
 of sauce and duck.             

384
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,209
Finish with parsley.            
       And that's all she wrote.

385
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,611
     That's it.                 

386
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:44,883
      Well, we have practically 
 a whole duck and half of Idaho.

387
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,955
                 [ Scoffs ]     

388
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:54,759
                   This is      
               out of bounds.   

389
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,694
             I got to tell you, 
             this is ridiculous.

390
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,396
                   The way      
         you confit your duck...

391
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,100
              ...with the peel  
    and garlic and the shallots,

392
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,769
                 and putting    
              all this together 

393
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,305
         with the hand-cut fries
         and the cheese curds --

394
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:08,940
      and look at the creaminess
                  of this.      

395
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,709
              It's outrageous.  

396
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:15,513
Every aspect of that dish works.

397
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:19,249
 It's salty, it's cheesy, it's  
 gooey, crunchy with the fries. 

398
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,619
     All my favorite things     
          on one plate.         

399
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:22,920
       I love this place.       

400
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,289
               Excellent job.

402
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,062
                   This is      
              mushroom mayhem!  

403
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,864
          We're headed          
    to Eureka, California...    

404

[ Whistles ]                    
  ...where a brick-oven spot... 

405
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:36,734
      And into                  
   the magic oven.

       some serious heat.

That is outstanding.            

408
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,581
 So, I've been wanting to shoot

409
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,650
 up here in Northern California

410
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,385
         And when I say         
      Northern California,      

411
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:56,988
  I'm talking about my hometown 
    area of Humboldt County.    

412
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,324
      Now, a few years ago,     
       I was at this joint      

413
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,326
 enjoying their wood-fired oven 

414
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,061
          and their use         
      of local ingredients.     

415
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,729
   I knew one day I'd be back.  

416
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:06,064
      This is Brick & Fire.

   is always amazingly fresh.

       in Humboldt County.

       across the street,       

422

        or three of them.       

442
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,655
                  What are      
                we on to now?   

443
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:05,789
 Now we're gonna do             
the Wild Mushroom Cobbler.      

444
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,058
     So, first,                 
 what we're gonna do            

445
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,993
is start off soaking            
some dried wild mushrooms --    

446
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:12,463
porcinis, chanterelles,         
  morels in there,              

447
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,998
      and some                  
  dried shiitakes.              

448
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,001
Just gonna cover that           
 with enough water.             

449
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,469
                     So,        
          dried mushrooms first.

450
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,404
             So, let these steep
               and rehydrate.   

451
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,338
                And how long?   

452
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,208
      About 15,                 
     20 minutes.                

453
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,410
           While that's working,
                 what's up?     

454
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:27,211
   Start the base               
of the cobbler here.            

455
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:33,885
Olive oil, chopped shallots,    
     and onions.                

456
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,285
           Okay, so, sweat down 
    the shallots and the onions?

457
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,287
      Exactly.                  

458
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,755
  Now I'm gonna add             
  some cold butter              

459
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:40,024
and the mushrooms that          
we roasted in the brick oven.   

460
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,393
                Fresh oyster,   
                  creminis.     

461
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:48,966
Got the mushrooms in there now  
stewing in the butter.          

462
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,369
  And we can add in             
some sherry vinegar.            

463
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:53,971
               Now we come in   
   with the dehydrated mushrooms

464
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,907
          that we reconstituted?
Yep.                            

465
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:56,841
Chopped them up fine.           

466
00:17:56,843 --> 00:18:01,311
                   This is      
              mushroom mayhem.  

467
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,913
      And then,                 
just for some more mushroom,    

468
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,048
       we take                  
dried porcini mushrooms         

469
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,316
    and put them                
in the coffee grinder.          

470
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:06,383
                There we go.    

471
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,651
      Powder.                   
                    There we go.

472
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,853
         'Cause if we don't have
         enough mushroom flavor,

473
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,656
          we're gonna inject it.
That's right.                   

474
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,724
    And a little                
    fresh thyme.                

475
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:16,327
      Let that                  
    reduce down.                

476
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:17,395
       Water.                   

477
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:18,795
             The steeping juice 
                from before.    

478
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,797
        Sure.                   
Adds a little flavor.           

479
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,468
           A little heavy cream.

480
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,736
               And a little S&P.
A little salt and pepper.       

481
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,074
                 Excellent.

   Then it all comes together   

483
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,946
          with the help         
 of Jimmy's enormous wood oven.

00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,881
       How hot                  
   is this thing?               

485
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:39,217
                    Well,       
       it starts at about 700...

               baking powder.   

490
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,227
     Okay.                      
               Get a little mix.

491
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:55,566
            Milk, melted butter,
                 and cheese.    

492

   all she wrote?               

493
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:59,704
                   That's it.   
 Okay.

             will go in the oven

496

           for about 20 minutes.

497
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,252
     So, we take our cobbler mix
                that we made.   

498
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:19,790

503
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,269
               Yeah, it'll get  
           a little brown color.
