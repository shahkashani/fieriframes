  checked out in that one city

       when you were doing      
  "Triple D," how they doing?"  

4
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:10,809

     We should check it out.

00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:13,678

       and tasted it all.

          the beginning         

8
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,818

      have been blowing up,

    So, 11 years.               
                       I was 16.

71
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,690
    You were 16?

00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,426

75
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:43,928
                It's the guy    
              with two thumbs.  

76
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,698
                  This guy.

77
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,099
  When we came here             
   the first time,              

78
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,501
I didn't have any idea          
  who your dad was.             

79
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,370
 I didn't know what             
an institution "Hodad's" was.   

80
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:52,504
                HARDIN: Yeah.   

81
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,972
                What is this?   
  It's bacon.                   

82
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,640
I don't like two little         
  strips of bacon,              

83
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:56,975
so we came up with this.        

84
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,710
      Like the rest of the world
      makes bacon cheeseburgers.

85
00:02:58,712 --> 00:02:59,978
 Exactly.                       
              You don't want to 
                follow that.    

86
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,780
We want to make, like,          
   a bacon patty.               

87
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,181
That's what this does.          

88
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,317
                So, you boil    
             the bacon in water.

89
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,187
 On the grill, looks            
almost like hash browns.        

90
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,788
What's it wrapped in?           

91
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,656
 The burger diaper,             
and once you pick it up,        

92
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,058
  don't let it go,              
      you know?                 

93
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,392
              You got to coddle 
                  the baby.     

94
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,394
   We give lessons              
   on Wednesdays.               

95
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,129
   This one's not               
   doing it right.              

96
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:18,997
  Have you not been             
to the Wednesday lesson?        

97
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,733
When you get done, we'll        
hose you off out back, alright? 

98
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,068
                    Mmm.        

99
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,004
          The bacon patty thing,
      that's out-of-bounds, man.

100
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,273
         And the entire         
       Fieri family agree.      

101
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:29,941
            It's the best burger
               I've ever ate.   

102
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,076

Still does good?                

110

                  Oh, yeah.     
              It's killing it.  

111

00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,023
You make the chili, too?        
                            Yep.

530
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:16,160
     Brown the ground beef,     
  and we add the diced onions,

00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,764
  beef bouillon, chili powder,  
   ground black pepper in it,

      seasoned salt, cumin,     
       red pepper flakes,       

533
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,503
       granulated garlic.       

534
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:26,971

535
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,240
       spiced chili beans,      
          tomato sauce.         

536
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:32,510
  Simmer for about 30 minutes.  

537
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:34,778
    That chili is               
  the Schnitz-nad.              

538
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,446
Okay. Let me tell you           
another thing you could make.   

539
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,049
Tortilla and some of the chili  
over the top with some lettuce  

540
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,785
and some cheese and some avocado
and some sour cream.

542
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,056
        so we actually do       
     the chili dog burrito.     

543
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:50,595
    Sour cream, French fries,   
cheddar cheese, house red chili,

544
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:55,299
grilled diced onions, jalapeños,
    all-beef hot dog, bacon.    

545
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,605
 Chili dog burrito.             

546
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,540
         A little spicy.        
    You can taste the chili.    

547
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,676
      It really complements     
      the hot dog in there      

548
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:06,878
    as well as the jalapeño.    

549
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,347

     a chili dog with bacon

00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,948
 and French fries in a burrito?

was in the episode back in 2007.

557
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:23,227
And you've been here

 sandwich, the Godfather Omelet.

562
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,505

      It's really popular.      

564
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:42,512

    burger patty, smoked ham,   

565
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:47,785
  two slices of the pineapple,  
    shredded cheddar cheese,    

566
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:51,656
        Thousand Island,        
 teriyaki sauce, lettuce, onion.

567
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:54,124
  Everything is all stacked on, 
           piled high.          

568
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,661
    Kahuna Burger, order up.    

569
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:58,062
      It's sweet and sour.      

570
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,597
  The combination's delicious.  

571
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,331
  It's an explosion of flavors. 

572
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,867
  It's got a great sauce on it. 

573
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,201
Tried to eat it with both hands,

574
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,070
        and it was trying       
      to get away from me,      

575
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,539
      so I'm using a knife      
      and fork to make sure     

576
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,741
     I get every little bit.    

577
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,343
          Is it what you thought
              it was gonna be?  

578
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,145
 I think it's better            
than what I thought it would be.

579
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:15,379
      It's fun.                 

580
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,482
 I enjoy the people,            
a lot of characters.            

581
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:20,084
     Good to see                
   you guys again.              

582
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,218
            You are a character.

583
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,686
It's a wonderful life.          

584
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,890
    All is good.                

585
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,892
     I mean, why even do it     
  if you don't love it, right?  

586
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,161
     These guys put so much     
of themselves into their joints.

587
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,464
  I'm just glad that the nation 
        has taken notice.

         [ Both laugh ]         

589
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:38,235
Like Hodad's in San Diego, where
things are still smooth sailing,

590
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,704
       even though we lost      
         the "Bossman."         

591
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,373
         And at Matt's,         
whose big breakfast has expanded

592
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,042
        all over Arizona.       

593
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:47,444
       In Salt Lake City,       
  where the Lone Star Taqueria  

594
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,982
       is still serving up      
real-deal Mexican to the masses.

595
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:53,450
     And the Coffee Cup Cafe    
         in Boulder City        

596
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,586
          that's still          
      putting family first.     

597
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,322
But those, ladies and gentlemen,
      aren't the only ones.     

598
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:00,391
 We'll check in on more diners, 
      drive-ins, and dives      

599
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,326
          next time on          
       "Triple D Nation."

                       Oh.      

601
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,196
             That's gonna leave 
                   a mark.      

602
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,265
MAN: Are you all right?         

603
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,533
                 Drilled it.    
               I even bent it.  

604
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,401
                That so hurt.
