1
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:03,068
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,471
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

3
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:08,874
           This trip,           
  we're making a special visit  

4
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:10,542
     to Chico, California...    

5
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:13,412
  I don't think many people know
             how great Chico is.

6
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:16,215
  ...which lies in the vicinity 
        of the deadliest        

7
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:19,952
  and most destructive wildfire 
  in California state history.  

8
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:22,287
        Our community and county
        got hit hard right away.

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:23,622
               I mean, we got   
             8,000 firefighters 

10
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,490
                at one point    
                on the lines.   

11
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:31,230
        2018's Camp Fire        
   scorched over 153,000 acres  

12
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,232
        and wiped out the       
  neighboring town of Paradise. 

13
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:37,035
We came up here during the fires
          to help cook,         

14
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,570
and we met so many great people.

15
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,105
           That's why we brought
              "Triple D" here.  

16
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:43,108
   To see how this incredible   
   community is rising back up  

17
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,711
     strong and to celebrate    
  its righteous restaurants...  

18
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,380
      Way more                  
than I was expecting.           

19
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,916
   ...like a place that rocks   
       sweet and savory...      

20
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,251
               Well done, man.  

21
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:54,719
     ...a joint going fresh,    
        hot, and local...       

22
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,187
             Dreamy.            

23
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,057
 ...and an Irish pub that thinks
      it's an Asian bistro.     

24
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,325
 You're taking folks            
   international,               

25
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:01,994
 and they don't need            
     a passport.                

26
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:03,796
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

27
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:06,565
on "Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives."

28
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:12,071
                     ♪♪         

29
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:17,743
                     ♪♪         

30
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,278
 All right, Hunter, you hungry? 
           -Oh, yeah.           

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,147
How many places we going to --  
   one, two, five?              

32
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,016
  Three?                        
     Slow it down, slow it down.

33
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:25,617
           The first place we're
      checking out on this Chico

34
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,420
     "Triple D" visit is a joint
          where the chef is from

35
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:29,822
         Boston, but the menu --

36
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:33,225
     well, it's pretty worldwide
     with a big Asian influence.

37
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:34,426
              You're gonna love 
                 this place.    

38
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,961
            This is The Banshee.

39
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:39,030
             Put this on first. 

40
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,165
               Got some wings.  

41
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,534
         Banshee is like        
    Chico's best-kept secret.   

42
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,235
            Is it a bar or is it
                a restaurant?   

43
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,238
       Mostly, it's a bar       
     with really good food.     

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,373
   Mac and cheese               
     for bar 12.                

45
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,375
             WOMAN:             
 Will's amazing in the kitchen. 

46
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:52,978
     He comes up with things    
    you never would think of.   

47
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,980
   GUY: Which are nothing like  
         what Will Brady        

48
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:57,582
  was serving at his old joint  
       on the East Coast.       

49
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,051
    Part of my flaw in Boston   

50
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:02,387
          was having the typical
          lousy, frozen burgers.

51
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:03,789
 Yeah, it's not just            
  a frozen burger,              

52
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,390
    it's a lousy,               
   frozen burger.               

53
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,793
       It doesn't take that much
       to acquire fresh produce,

54
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,728
    fresh meats, and give people
             something in Chico 

55
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,530
              that they haven't 
                 maybe had.     

56
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:13,665
     Headline --                
"Banshee, Home of the..."       

57
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,735
          "...Not-Lousy Burger."

58
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,336
     Table 4, Pho-rench Dip.    

59
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:19,872
 The Pho-rench Dip is excellent.

60
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:21,740
 You get the pho as your au jus 

61
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:23,675
      like you would get in     
 an actual French dip sandwich. 

62
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,811
    Two of my favorite dishes   
        all in one dish,        

63
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,145
     and it blows your mind.    

64
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,147
 What are we starting off with? 
              The Pho-rench Dip.

65
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,348
     "Pho" like                 
   Vietnamese pho?              

66
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,816
                      Yes.      
      P-h-o.                    

67
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,018
And then we're gonna make       
a meat dip sandwich out of it?  

68
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,220
                    Yes.        

69
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,488
          We're just gonna start
            by making the broth.

70
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,024
      Water, we add a Vietnamese
               soup-base mix,   

71
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,359
             our sachet goes in.

72
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:41,492
        What's the sachet       
          filled with?          

73
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,029
        Cinnamon, cardamom pods,
          coriander, star anise.

74
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,098
 Next?                          
             Jalapeños, onions. 

75
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,232
       This would be the braise.

76
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,034
How did we just get to braise   
  all of a sudden?              

77
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,769
                Well, we have   
             like a circular... 

78
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,638
 So this is the last            
  brisket's broth?              

79
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,839
                    Yes.        

80
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:54,973
      So you're just continually
              using this broth  

81
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,374
 and building flavor            
      as we go.                 
                        Yes.    

82
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,377
           What I saw in Vietnam
          was people were famous

83
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,712
              for having broths 
        that were 100 years old.

84
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:03,181
            Oh, wow.            
Getting all fancy               
at The Banshee.                 

85
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,317
                     Fish sauce.
And how long will that simmer?  

86
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,651
             Just about an hour.

87
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,720
So, now what we have to do      
is go make the next brisket...  

88
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:09,988
                           Yes. 
...to pour the broth.           

89
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,191
                        Yes.    
       Got it.                  
We're gonna make a rub.         

90
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:14,793
               Salt, pepper --  
         fresh-ground, always --

91
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,395
             Chinese-five spice.
  Whoa!                         

92
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:17,863
                  Mix that up.  
            Brisket.            

93
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:18,997
            Oh, yeah.           
          Look at that.         

94
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,399
  Trim a little bit             
     of the fat.                

95
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:22,668
  We dry rub and then we sear it
             in the fry-a-lator.

96
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,269
   That's a fryer.              
When you're getting fancy       

97
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,604
   at The Banshee,              
you call it a fry-a-lator.      

98
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:26,738
                   Exactly.     
           I like it.           

99
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,940
   It's gonna put               
a fantastic crust on this.      

100
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:29,074
                    Yes.        

101
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,944
So, the fried-off brisket       
     now gets...                

102
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:33,545
                ...Vegetables   
              underneath it --  

103
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,546
                  cilantro,     
             onions underneath, 

104
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,416
     Thai chilies, some bruised,
              whole lemongrass. 

105
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,419
       Do you bruise them       
          yourself, or?         

106
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,420
                  There you go. 
      Ow.                       

107
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:42,754
        That's excessive.       
                    That's it.  

108
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,556
            Brown sugar goes in,
                 jalapeños.     

109
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,691
That many jalapeños?            
                           Yeah.

110
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,827
      Jalapeños tend to mild out
             after a long cook. 

111
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,495
You got to mild out now.        

112
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:53,831
         Ha!                    
     "Mild out!"                

113
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,302
             And we'll finish it
        with our rotating broth.

114
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,237
  Oh, I like this,              
it's got good beginnings.       

115
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,039
How long's that gonna go?       
                      Overnight.

116
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,574
            Now we're gonna make
             pickled cucumbers. 

117
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:06,178
   Okay.                        
            Salt, garlic, sugar,
                 fish sauce.    

118
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,913
 I'd have never been            
into a bar like this            

119
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,180
that's running                  
any fish sauce.                 
           No. Never.           

120
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,049
                 It's maybe     
            the best ingredient.

121
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,450
                Chili paste.    

122
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,720
  It will sit for about an hour,
         it will be ready to go.

123
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:16,121
  All right, Chef.              
    Let's see it.               

124
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,857
             First, we toast off
               a French roll.   
 Okay.                          

125
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:19,924
           We got our spicy mayo
    and then we add the brisket.

126
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,326
Nice, big portion.              
          Look at that.         

127
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,328
                         Onions.
You build a sandwich, holmes.   

128
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,598
     Carrots, pickled cucumbers,
some Thai basil, mint, cilantro,

129
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,435
  and we're gonna get the broth,
             some green onions, 

130
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,736
             and some cilantro. 

131
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,405
Last but not least...           
          ...a little chili oil.

132
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,206
      Way more                  
than I was expecting.           

133
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,476
Let me get into this.           

134
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,011
           Fantastic.           

135
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,813
  When you dip it in the broth, 
          that's nice.          

136
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,349
 It's the right bun,            
it's the right cut of the meat, 

137
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,818
getting that true big,          
deep beef flavor in there.      

138
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,554
The fortified mayo with         
a little bit extra of the spice.

139
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,889
When you bring in Thai basil    
    and the mint,               

140
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,425
     that really                
  hammers it home.              

141
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:54,559
  Boom, boom, boom,             
     boom, boom!                

142
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,295
     Delicious.                 

143
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:58,162
 I would eat that for breakfast,
       lunch, and dinner.       

144
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,365
 "Pho-get" about it.

   Pickled veggies that meets   
   all the right flavor notes.

00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:15,847
And they have a good selection

            but it's interesting
               to see how much  

159
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,126
               this community   
           supports one another.

      it starts with Asian

00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,139
     and ends with Mexican.

 The Asian influence            
 is out of control.

       the banh mi tacos.

      some onions, some carrots.

221
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,216
       What do you pickle       
       those carrots with?      

222
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:33,552
           Vinegar, sugar, salt,
                 fish sauce.    

223
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,220
    Pickled cucumbers, cilantro.

224
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,420
      That's a heavy dose.      

225
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,556
          Fresno chilies on top.
Coming in hot.                  

226
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,926
      I would recommend throwing
      a little lime on this one.

227
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,562
            That has            
      some serious flavor.      

228
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:45,964
     Nice little kick, too,     
       with those peppers.      

229
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:46,832
              Whoo!             

230
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,833
When I saw very similar         
    ingredients,                

231
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,635
    well, between               
  the banh mi taco              

232
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:54,572
and the Pho-rench Dip, I'm like,
"Mm, lot of similarities,"      

233
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,241
but because the baseline        
of the Adobo and the pork       

234
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,978
    is so forward               
in its spiciness and flavors    

235
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,380
of the dried chilies,           
right there you separate.       

236
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:05,116
And that's the beauty of a chef 
   cross-utilizing              

237
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:08,319
his ingredients -- two dishes,  
two totally different results.  

238
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,122
            Oh, yeah.           
  Fantastic.                    

239
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,791
     Got your banh mi tacos.    

240
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:15,059
      It's one of the most      
   tender tacos I've ever had.  

241
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,862
   MAN: You have the richness   
           of the pork          

242
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:18,997
     and then the freshness     
        of the vegetable.       

243
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,599
     It's always great food.    

244
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,199
             Chorizo quesadilla.

245
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,735
  You become an addict, and you 
   come back again and again.   

246
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,804
I think you're taking your chef 
 energy and attitude            

247
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,808
 and just masking it            
behind this cool hangout bar.   

248
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,109
 You're taking folks            
   international,               

249
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,677
 and they don't need            
     a passport.                

250
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,945
       Here in                  
 Chico, California,             

251
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,680
   come on down to              
The "Fanshee" Banshee.          

252
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,748
       And it's not lousy.      

253
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,083
               And the burgers  
               aren't frozen.   

254
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:41,486
          [ Laughter ]          

255
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:44,890
  GUY: Up next, an off-the-hook 
         bakery café...         

256
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,358
       Someone knows Flavortown.

257
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,226
...cooking up local favorites...

258
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,427
              Man, that's just  
              hands down good.  

259
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,030
        ...including one        
     I just couldn't refuse.    

260
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,498
       She told me that is      
      the "Mmm Pork Salad"      

261
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,934
         so that's what         
       I want to try next.      

262
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,506
    GUY: Right now "Triple D"   
        is headquartered        

263
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,174
      in Chico, California,     

264
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,911
  which recently became refuge  
     to thousands of people     

265
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:08,179
      from the nearby town      
      of Paradise after it      

266
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,715
           was ravaged          
     by a devastating fire.     

267
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,917
         12,500 homes were lost.

268
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,053
 It would have been             
so much more devastation        

269
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,789
   had it not been              
for the Cal Fire team.          

270
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,524
 This is a community            
 that's rebuilding.             

271
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:20,925
                There's a lot   
               of good energy,  

272
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,260
             and there's things 
              that coming back  

273
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,861
              to the community  
               that were lost.  

274
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,663
          But one thing         
      that's remained here      

275
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,933
    is the awesome food scene   
  that we've been digging into. 

276
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,136
 Dad, this umbrella             
   is ridiculous.               

277
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:34,739
   Listen, it's not the umbrella
  that makes us look ridiculous.

278
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,008
         Anyhow, this next place
            I'm taking you to --

279
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,610
                this is like    
              the Chico staple. 

280
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,344
          I mean, it's been here
                for 30 years.   

281
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,546
           This husband-and-wife
                    team,       

282
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,280
              they worked here  
              for like 7 years  

283
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:44,616
            and then they bought
                 the joint.     

284
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,151
       You ask anybody in Chico,

285
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:49,687
     they'll tell you you got to
      check out the Upper Crust.

286
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,556
    JEFF: I have a California   
         chicken ready.         

287
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,825
    Upper Crust is definitely   
          a Chico icon.         

288
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,226
       Pastry platters up.      

289
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,963
         It's a bakery and café,
      restaurant, almost a deli.

290
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,031
        Like a community        
        gathering place.        

291
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,099
   GUY: And it's the community  
    that lured owners Shelby    

292
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,901
        and Jeff Plummer        
          back to town.         

293
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,103
        I loved growing up here.

294
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,304
              All of my family  
         kind of came back here.

295
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,308
     And locally grown chef,    
     Ryan Derra, never left.    

296
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,643
Bake all your breads,           
 all your pastries.             

297
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:14,179
      -Everything scratch.      
              -Yes.             

298
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,446
                   SHELBY:      
           I'm a cake decorator.

299
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,248
   I do all the savory dishes.  

300
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,718
WOMAN #2: I can't imagine people
   who are better at creating   

301
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,387
       that local feeling       
      with incredible food.     

302
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:25,390
Black bean chili with           
a jalapeño cornbread muffin.    

303
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,258
           I'd die for          
      the black bean chili.     

304
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,794
     Spicy with this, like,     
      sort of pesto on top.     

305
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,664
      And that muffin makes     
    everything come together.   

306
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,999
     GUY: The black bean chili's
              a big thing here. 

307
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,334
If we don't have this,          
people legitimately get mad.    

308
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,202
                 What are we    
             starting off with? 

309
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:38,603
 Our cilantro pesto.            

310
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:39,937
        All right, let's see it.
   Cilantro.                    

311
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,338
               Stems and all.   
Garlic.                         

312
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,807
                    Salt.       
               Hot sauce, huh?  

313
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:47,145
Lime juice and then slowly      
add the whole oil to emulsify.  

314
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,280
   Add our Romano,              
   a couple pulse.              

315
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,749
      That's it                 
  right there, sir.             

316
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,617
All right, so, now we're        
gonna make our jala-muffins.    

317
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:53,551
              "Holla"-muffins.  

318
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,019
Holla!                          
                There you go.   

319
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,821
First, we start with our eggs,  
     buttermilk.                

320
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,356
       Just a little bit.       
    Cilantro, pickled jalapeños.

321
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:00,424
    Green onions,               
some cheddar cheese.            

322
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,626
           Thank you.           
                  There you go. 

323
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,695
      Cheddar.                  
  Makes it better.              
                     I'm jiving.

324
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,964
Jack cheese, melted butter --   
  set that aside --             

325
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,631
flour, cornmeal, sugar.         

326
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:08,766
     Baking soda, baking powder.

327
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,568
        Salt,                   
scrape that on in there.        

328
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,037
You don't want the gluten       
to build up too much,           

329
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,171
we want these to where          
 you can open them,             

330
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,773
and the cheesy goodness         

331
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,974
is the only thing               
holding it together, you know?  
         How does it go?        

332
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,309
         Bend the knees         
         when you do it.        

333
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,178
        Just a quick or a heavy?

334
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,446
   I'm not trying               
 to fry the muffins,            

335
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:24,348
     I'm trying                 
to bake the muffins.            

336
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,050
             You work with him, 
                   Hunter.      

337
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,185
                   Oh, so,      
             you're skipping it 

338
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,519
             because it's gonna 
               go muffin top.   

339
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,589
These are gonna go in at 350    
for about 20 minutes.           

340
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:32,990
 Now we're gonna do             
our black bean chili            

341
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,259
starting from the dry bean      

342
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,860
which I've handpicked           
 through and rinsed.            

343
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,061
      You're a very good person.
There you go.                   

344
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,531
    So, the beans come to a boil
        and get nice and tender.

345
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,398
We're gonna do our vegetable    
mixture which consists          

346
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,470
of onions, bell peppers,        
chipotle-garlic mixture, salt.  

347
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,672
I'm gonna go ahead and toast    
 these cumin seeds.             

348
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:50,207
Paprika, basil, oregano.        

349
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,476
                That's mixed    
               into the onion.  

350
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,677
We add our vegetable mixtures   
    to the beans,               

351
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,946
then we add our tomatoes.       

352
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,748
I'm gonna let it sit            
for about 20 minutes.           

353
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,017
           [ Laughs ]           

354
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,018
     Open oven.                 
           That's what you yell?

355
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,421
     Every time.                
Hunter gets to pick the muffin. 

356
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:05,022
         I want that one        
          right there.          

357
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,223
                   And what I --
         No, no, no, no.        

358
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,893
        The chef was at -- what?
              Dad!              

359
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:09,961
             That was delicious.
                    Mmm.        

360
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,362
      Nice, little jalapeño bite
                  in that.      

361
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,763
            Oh, yeah.           
           Little bit of cheese.

362
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,165
               Good job, chef.  

363
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,568
            I'd like to have one
  that's just all crust, though.

364
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,302
           Oh, my God,          
      that is so messed up.     

365
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,304
             I want             
       a different one now      

366
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:24,575
The black bean chili here,      
cilantro pesto, sour cream.     

367
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,245
Evidentially, he's dipping      
   into your food.              

368
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,579
           I'm taking           
       this away from you.      

369
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,649
               Be right back.   
              Hang on a second. 

370
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:35,119
      Here's what I did about it
  is it's good, old-school chili

371
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,121
              with great flavor 
           and not overly spicy.

372
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,590
     And that pesto on it...    
              That's the kicker.

373
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,191
     ...is what it makes it,    
          right there.          

374
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,659
 Little sharpness of that garlic
             with the saltiness 

375
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,928
               of the Romano,   
everybody will enjoy this chili.

376
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,230
 Now the only thing I want to do
               is take a nap.   

377
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:49,534
     Chili is just spot-on.     
   Good flavor with the pesto.  

378
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:51,669
        This gentleman over here
       is a good friend of mine,

379
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,405
      the great Dion, the master
           of all black beanery.

380
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,207
Flavor after flavor,            
     it's money.                

381
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,009
      And with                  
the swirly-dirly crema.         

382
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,210
             "The swirly-dirly."

383
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,079
     You got to                 
 come down for this.            

384
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,681
    Chico is a sweet, little    
  community with great history, 

385
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,482
           and as soon          
      as the fire happened,     

386
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,018
  it just seemed like everybody 
  was on-board to do something. 

387
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,488
WOMAN #3: Chico basically opened
   up as an evacuation center   

388
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,091
   for close to 30,000 people   
          within hours.         

389
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,028
     GUY: We came up here during
         the fires to help cook,

390
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,696
                 and we met     
           so many great people.

391
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:20,165
           That's why we brought
              "Triple D" here.  

392
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:23,301
 GUY: And one of Chico's greats 
     just gave me a hot tip.    

393
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,171
       I was told by the owners'
            daughter, Charlotte,

394
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,705
                I got to try    
         that Korean pork salad.

395
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,707
          -Yeah. Yeah.          
         -She brought me        
        this nice letter,       

396
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,109
         and she told me that is
            the "Mmm Pork Salad"

397
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,512
               so that's what   
             I want to try next.

398
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,981
         It's definitely        
      a crave-worthy dish.      

399
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:41,185
     We're gonna change the name
to "Charlotte's Mmm Pork Salad."

400
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,254
        How's it starting, chef?
With our braising liquid --     

401
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:46,057
throw my garlic in here,        
a lot ginger, jalapeños,        

402
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:49,060
red chili paste, brown sugar,   
     lime juice,                

403
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,929
 rice-wine vinegar,             
       tamari.                  

404
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,330
                Then you got    
            a bone-in pork butt.

405
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,931
     Throw it in                
 our braising liquid            

406
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,534
and bake it at 350 degrees      
   for two hours.               

407
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:59,003
Once it comes out, we're gonna  
hit it with our shredder        

408
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,271
   and then we got              
to make the dressing.           

409
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,339
                   Got it.      

410
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,474
Lime juice, green onion,        
     fish sauce.                

411
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:04,742
                 We're really   
             getting after this.
            Oh, yeah.           

412
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:07,544
Rice-wine vin, sambal,          
 whole lot of sugar.            

413
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,414
        And that's the dressing.
We got shredded cabbage.        

414
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,950
                   Got it.      
Cilantro, basil, mint.          

415
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:14,285
             I like those moves.
The dressing that we made.      

416
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,686
                    Okay.       
         Oh, yeah, look at that.

417
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,424
A nice helping of pork on top,  
bell peppers, peanuts, cilantro.

418
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:20,625
         And last but not least.

419
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:21,759
  Crispy shallots.              

420
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,862
     And here's                 
our Korean pork salad.          

421
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,098
                    Mmm.        

422
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,165
           That's just          
        hands down good.        

423
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,700
                 That's like    
              lights-out good.  

424
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,036
        The dressing is rockin',
      a little kiss of the mint,

425
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,571
                nice crunch,    
              the pork is hot.  

426
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:36,507
          Yeah, it is.          
         I mean, it's spice-hot.

427
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,976
                Mmm-mmm-mmm!    

428
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:39,911
      I did a little food dance,
                 there, huh?    

429
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:40,978
           You really nailed it,
                    man.        

430
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,647
                Come on down    
       to the Upper Crust Bakery

431
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:46,317
      and ask for the "Charlotte
         Mmm Korean Pork Salad."

432
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,852
      It's crunchy, spicy.      

433
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:50,054
This was definitely delivered   
on the Flavortown bus.          

434
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,323
                  Exactly.      
  See, someone knows Flavortown.

435
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,925
           SERVER #2:           
  I'm Not A Reuben ready to go. 

436
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,526
     Upper Crust is amazing.    

437
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,528
    Truly a Chico experience.   

438
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,732
  I don't think many people know
             how great Chico is.

439
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:01,866
We're all connected.            

440
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:02,867
       You should boast about it
             as much as you can.

441
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,134
                    We --       
        Look, we're on the team.

442
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,004
              We got it going.  
               Well done, man.  

443
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,606
         Thank you, man.        
         That's awesome.        
 Thank you.

00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,408
         GUY: Coming up,        
     we're headed to a spot     

445
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,676
      built around a legit      
         Italian oven...        

446
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,679
        You done eating?        
No, I'm not done eating.        

447
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,547
       GUY: ...cooking up       
    everything from pasta...    

448
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:17,915
             Look at            
      those little beauts.

    ...to comfort done right.   

450
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,752
             This is            
      as good as it comes.

452
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,891
     GUY: Today, "Triple D"     
    has been parked in Chico,   

453
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:29,293
   a Northern California city   

454
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,095
     that sat right outside     
          the perimeter         

455
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,198
  of the most damaging wildfire 
        in state history.       

456
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,367
 And as the area builds back up,

457
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,769
  we've come here to celebrate  
      this strong community     

458
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,771
       through their local      
        restaurant scene.       

459
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,374
     To round things out, let me
      tell you about this place.

460
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:44,776
       The dude is from Chicago,

461
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,978
              moves his family  
             out here to Chico, 

462
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,049
and he's all about farm-to-table
           and wood-fired ovens.

463
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,117
               This is Grana.   

464
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,586
           All right.           

465
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,922
       Grana is definitely      
        a star in Chico.        

466
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:00,325
  I think what makes it unique  
         is creativity,         

467
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:01,925
    the locally sourced food.   

468
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,928
    GUY: 'Cause local is key    
       to chef and owner,       

469
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,196
          Jeff King's,          
       culinary attitude.       

470
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,131
         I had always threatened

471
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,666
        if I opened a restaurant
                 in Chico...    

472
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,801
      "Always threatened."      
              ...I'm gonna do it
                 right across   

473
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,403
                 the street     
       from the farmers' market.

474
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,605
           And inside,          
   the centerpiece is an oven   

475
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,475
         he had imported        
     all the way from Italy.    

476
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,477
    WOMAN #4: I'm constantly    
 surprised at how they can cook 

477
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,146
  such a wide variety of dishes 
      in a wood-fired oven.     

478
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,748
               Two pork ragus   
                in the oven.    

479
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,150
           Today I had          
     the braised-pork ragu.     

480
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:30,220
    They made this pasta from   
 scratch, absolutely fantastic. 

481
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,156
       What are we making?      
              We make our pasta.

482
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,492
        Step in, Hunter,        
   and show him how it's done.  

483
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,893
                     All right. 
I'll help out a little bit.     

484
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,561
          Caputo flour.         
           A little bit of salt.

485
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,031
            You know how to make
              the well, right?  

486
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,299
             Oh, not like that. 

487
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,367
          [ Laughter ]          

488
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,770
         So, our eggs, mix this,
   make this come together here.

489
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,205
         All right, so,         
      we'll let this rest.      

490
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,107
   What are we cutting it as?   
                    Tagliatelle.

491
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,843
   This is the machine that...  
That's awesome.                 

492
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:52,910
     ...cuts them right off.    

493
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,378
  I love it.                    
         Bam, bam, bam.         

494
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,712
          Look at those         
         little beauts.         

495
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:56,847
         All right, so,         
   let's talk about it, Chef.   

496
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,449
       What are we making?      
          Braised pork shoulder.

497
00:16:58,451 --> 00:16:59,450
              Okay.             

498
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,519
             Little bit of salt,
             pepper, olive oil. 

499
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,653
   How long are we gonna sear   
          this off for?         

500
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,322
            5, maybe 10 minutes.
Okay.                           

501
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,190
            We're gonna use this
            same sheet pan here,

502
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,559
              take the mirepoix 
   and put it back on this tray,

503
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:09,794
        sweat this a little bit.

504
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,061
      Hot pan.                  

505
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,130
  Porcinis that have been soaked
               and rehydrated.  

506
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,332
              Take a little bit 
                of red wine.    

507
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,200
       Oh, I was gonna see      
     if he was gonna do it.     

508
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,401
          Nicely done.          

509
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,337
        House-made chicken stock
                and tomatoes.   

510
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,471
            Gorgeous.           

511
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:21,806
          This is actually gonna
               rest overnight,  

512
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,341
         and then in the morning
      when there's no live fire,

513
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,476
   we just use the residual heat
 of the oven to finish the pork.

514
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:26,944
     I love it.                 

515
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,746
      The last thing we got     
        to make is the...       
                 ...Salsa verde.

516
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,081
          Salsa verde.          
                     Spinach.   

517
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,882
        Parsley. Capers.        
          Little S & P.         

518
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,618
          Lemon juice, olive oil

519
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,619
          from a local olive oil
              producer up here. 

520
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,488
              And that's that.  

521
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,956
      Okay.                     
           Delicious.           

522
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,226
     After we reheated the pork,
  we'll add the pasta and reheat

523
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,095
              for about another 
          three to five minutes.

524
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:48,466
     And that fresh salsa verde,
           Pecorino di Sardegna.

525
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,704
        Mmm!                    
That was a donkey kick.         

526
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,639
        Wow.                    
This is quite the dish.         

527
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,775
  For a ragu, it's super light. 
And you know what the key is?   

528
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,645
That salsa verde, it's          
highlighting the ingredients.   

529
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,647
I'm getting the wine,           
I'm getting a little porcini.   

530
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,515
    Outstanding.                

531
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:05,649
       You're done eating?      

532
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,052
    -No, I'm not done eating.   
           -Pork ragu.          

533
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,254
   The pork is just excellent.  

534
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,123
    WOMAN #4: The salsa verde   
     on top adds this nice,     

535
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,125
        refreshing sense        
    to the really rich ragu.    

536
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,860
              Squash agrodolce. 

537
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,597
  Our buddy, Dino,              
is from the famous Granzella's, 

538
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,732
a place that I've been going to 
 since I was a kid.             

539
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,134
What makes this place           
     so special?                

540
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:25,136
                 Fresh food,    
               stand out, man.  

541
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:27,071
Ladies, how is the pizza?       

542
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:28,673
      There's nothing wrong     
            about it.           

543
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:31,142
     I like how much detail     
        they put into it.       

544
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:34,078
All right, buddy, local farmer, 
what do you think of this place?

545
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,412
             It's off-the-hook. 
   It's my line.                

546
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,682
              That's your line? 
My line.                        

547
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:39,950
     Whatever season it is,     
there's always something special

548
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,087
  on the menu, and the staples  
  here are executed flawlessly. 

549
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,822
          Chicken leg, table 10.

550
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,890
          A chicken leg         
     is something different.    

551
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,625
        It's better than        
        a chicken breast.       

552
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,628
           Almost like          
      a Thanksgiving meal.      

553
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,896
   What's gonna be              
     the finale?                

554
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:54,098
           Wine-braised chicken,
             super simple dish. 

555
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,900
  Chicken right on top of sliced
          onion and lemon, salt.

556
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,836
 GUY: A little salt and pepper, 
            oregano.            

557
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,571
                 Olive oil,     
    give it a little bit of rub.

558
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,707
       The wood-fired oven      
 is running about 650 right now 

559
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,107
      so you're gonna go in     
       and sear this off.       

560
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,645
    Add the white wine, homemade
chicken stock, wrap it up tight.

561
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,313
                 We'll wait     
         till the fire dies down

562
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,581
             just a little more 

563
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,250
          and then we'll give it
            a nice, slow braise.

564
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,318
                  Next up,      
             some local polenta.

565
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,786
           Whole milk.          
                 And some water.

566
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:18,655
   Once that comes up to a boil,
         add the polenta slowly.

567
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,057
       HUNTER:                  
I don't think I've ever used    
polenta that fine, though.      

568
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,392
    I've not either, Hunter.    

569
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,394
    My polenta's always been    
      a little more coarse.     

570
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,263
              Mmm!              
    White cheddar, delicious.   

571
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:27,131
 It's great.                    
          It's grated.          

572
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:28,266
     Ba-dum-bum.                

573
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:29,600
     I'll be here all week.     

574
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,268
              Salt and pepper,  
              red-wine vinegar. 

575
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,137
  I've cooked a lot of polenta, 
 I've never hit it with an acid.

576
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,406
       I do like the move.      

577
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,542
    How's that?                 
             Dreamy.            

578
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,611
               We'll come back  
        with this chicken, nice,

579
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,213
       little roast in the oven.

580
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,281
           And it's in the bowl.

581
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:44,482
 Oh, yeah.                      
        It's in the bowl.       

582
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,617
             It's --            
        Cinderella story.       

583
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,087
     Some of our braised greens,
      chicken, and this our jus.

584
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,622
      Oh, just pour it all      
        on there please.        

585
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,958
   I know, please.              
    There you go.

587
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,828
              Mmm.              

588
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,763
     If you can make simple     
  chicken taste that dynamite,  

589
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,966
        that's why Grana        
     has such great success.    

590
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:03,901
So little seasoning,            
 yet so much flavor.            

591
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,636
      That skin crisped up      
          really nice.          

592
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,104
      Oh, yeah.                 

593
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:08,639
 Even when you hit with the jus,
     it still stayed crispy.    

594
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,173
        Great ingredients       
           done right.          

595
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:11,309
         That should be         
          the tagline.          

596
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,043
             This is            
      as good as it comes.      

597
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,046
 We have the chicken            
    with polenta.               

598
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:18,115
       Chicken was moist,       
      crisp on the outside.     

599
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,917
   The polenta is very creamy.  

600
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,320
   And then the braised greens  
  just bring the dish together. 

601
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:25,323
   I would come out of my way   
      for Grana every time.     

602
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:26,523
     Watch out for this guy.    

603
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,924
   Unreal.                      
          Outstanding.          

604
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,193
            Nice job.           
                      Thank you.

00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,334
       a great community,       
         awesome people,        

609
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,204
 the incredible first responders
   at Cal Fire and Chico Fire.

      the restaurant scene

        is off-the-hook.

   You got to check out Chico.  

613

     We'll see you next week    
         on "Triple D."
