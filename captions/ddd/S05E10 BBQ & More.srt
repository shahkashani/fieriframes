              AND THE HOT LINKS 
              ARE OUTSTANDING.  

35
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,562
     THE BRISKET'S MY FAVORITE.

            MAKIN' THE DRY RUB. 

51
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:12,131

THEN WE PUT IT INTO             
THE MAGIC MIXER,                
GIVE IT A MIXEY-MIX...          

56
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:25,811
               DID YOU JUST SAY 
               "A MIXEY MIX?"   

57
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:28,813
   IT CAN'T BE GORILLA BARBECUE 
   AND SAY "MIXEY MIX."         

58
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,782

GOT A NICE RUB WRAP.            

64
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:46,665
THE RIBS ARE GREAT!             
          THERE'S A LOT OF MEAT 
                        ON 'EM. 

65
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,567
              TO PULLED PORK... 
IT'S THE BEST PULLED PORK

THE BRISKET IS AWESOME.         

68
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,972
WE'RE GONNA RUB IT,             
SLATHER IT ON,                  

69
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,375
GIVE IT A LITTLE MASSAGE,       
FLIP,                           

70
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:59,644
THEN START SCOOPING MORE IN,    
YOU CAN NEVER HAVE              
TOO MUCH RUB ON A BRISKET,      

71
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,582
THE FLAVORS ARE RENDERING DOWN  
THROUGH THE THICK LAYER OF FAT  
THAT'S ON THE TOP.              

72
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:05,250
BRISKET'S READY TO THROW        
ON THE SMOKER.                  

73
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,052
THIS IS THE BABY?               
                      YES, SIR. 

74
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,654
     OKAY, TURN ON THE EYEBALL  
     LAMPS UP ON THE CEILING... 

75
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,724
'CAUSE SMOKERS ARE              
USUALLY DARK AND YOU CAN'T      
SEE INSIDE OF 'EM.              

76
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,060
YOU HAD THOSE INSTALLED         
JUST FOR THAT?                  
                            YES.

77
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,061
              YOU'RE A GANGSTER.

78
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,329
            PICK AND SET,       
            TOP RACK, 16 HOURS. 

79
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,934
                  SHE'S FIRIN'. 
THERE SHE GOES.                 

80
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,802
NOW, YOU LET THIS REST          
ABOUT 1/2 HOUR?                 

81
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,138
      IT PROBABLY MAKES IT      
      A LITTLE EASIER TO SLICE. 

82
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,740
   LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL THAT IS,  
   LOOK AT THE CRUST ON THAT... 

83
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:31,276
  THE SMOKE PENETRATED THROUGH, 
  GREAT BARBECUE, MAN.

              NICE AND TENDER,  
              THIS IS GREAT!    

85
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,548
WE CAN SERVE IT AS              
A ONE-MEAT COMBO,               
A LA CARTE,                     

86
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,816
OR YOU CAN GET IT               
IN SANDWICHES.                  

87
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,552
    THERE'S A LOT OF BRISKET,   
    IT'S SMOKED AND IT'S VERY   
    TENDER.                     

88
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:44,222
  (Guy)                         
  AND HERE'S ONE YOU DON'T SEE  
  AT MOST BARBECUE JOINTS.

00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:45,556
I'LL GET THE PHILLY CHEESE.     

90
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:48,160
GORILLA'S EVEN USIN' THE BRISKET
FOR A PHILLY CHEESESTEAK.       

91
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:49,428
    I GOTTA BE HONEST WITH YOU, 
    BROTHER,                    

92
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,229
    I THINK PHILLY CHEESESTEAKS 
    NEED TO COME FROM PHILLY.   

93
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:52,363
WELL, LET'S GIVE IT A WHIRL     
AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK.         

94
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,232
            ALL RIGHT,          
            I'LL LET YOU DO IT.

SOUTHWESTERN PHILLY?

AND THE CHEESE MELTS PERFECTLY, 

108
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,867
                HMM, EXPLOSIVE! 

109
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,269
                IT REALLY IS,   
                IT'S DELICIOUS. 

110
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,138
         I MAY HAVE TO GO HOME  
         AND SHAMPOO MY GOATEE. 

111
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:34,672
IT'S GOT A LOT OF FLAVOR,       
IT'S VERY GOOD.                 

112
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,075
        IT'S SO FULL OF         
        JUST EVERYTHING,        
        IT NEEDS A SPOON        

113
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,144
          AND A FORK...         
          A SPORK.              

114
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,680

YOU GET SO MUCH SAUCE           
ON THAT PLATE,                  

115

YOU COULD PROBABLY              
JUST EAT THE PLATE.             

116
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,884
                   AND HE MAKES 
        HIS OWN BARBECUE SAUCE. 
IT'S CAROLINA BASED...          

117
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,885
       I LOVE THE VINEGAR, HMM. 

118
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,620
           REAL NICE FLAVOR,    
           COMPLEMENTS IT WELL. 

119
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:51,956
   IT HAS A LITTLE BITE TO IT   
   AND IT'S VERY, VERY GOOD.    

120
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:54,092
      (Guy)                     
      AND HE'S CRANKING OUT     
      5 GALLONS A DAY,          

121
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,227
AND 1,500 POUNDS OF MEAT A WEEK.

122
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:57,696
             ALL RIGHT GUYS,    
             HERE'S YOUR ORDER. 

123
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:59,698
  BECAUSE FOLKS HAVE DISCOVERED 
  THE ORANGE TRAIN CAR.         

124
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,166
         IT'S A LITTLE          
         OUT OF THE WAY FOR US. 

125
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,567
          BUT GOOD BARBECUE     
          IS WORTH DRIVING FOR. 

126
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,369
WHEN THEY FIRST OPENED,         
THE LINES WERE OUT THE DOOR,    

127
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,371
AND IT DOESN'T SEEM             
TO BE LETTING UP AT ALL.        

128
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,307
YOU MIGHT HAVE A SPOT           
AT THE COUNTER, IF NOT...       

129
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,909
     YOU'RE EATIN' IN YOUR CAR. 
COME IN TO TAKE OUT...          

130
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,312
AND GET A NICE FULL PLATE       
OF FOOD LIKE I LIKE TO EAT      
WHEN I GO OUT.                  

131
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:16,447
THE SIDES ARE REALLY,           
REALLY GOOD.                    

132
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,116
               THE POTATO SALAD 
               IS REAL CREAMY.  

133
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,385
THE BEANS AND RICE,             
THEY'RE REALLY FLAVORFUL.       

134
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:22,787
  YOU GET A MACARONI AND CHEESE 
  THAT'S LIKE NO OTHER.         

135
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,990
    SO YOU'RE GONNA ENGINEER ME

         GET THAT ALL MELTED UP 

137
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,194

  A GOO TO THROW INTO THE POT.  

138
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,596
                            GOO?
GOO.

00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,865
AND WE JUST PUREE ONION,

              MILK, HEAVY CREAM 
                AND SOUR CREAM. 
CRAZY!                          

146

WHISKING IN THE CHEESE,         

147
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:56,087

             SOME FOREARMS

  OTHERWISE IT GETS ALL LUMPY   
  AND TURNS TO A BIG BLACK SPOT 

151
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03,495
   IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOTTOM, 
   AND THAT'S UGLY.

          IT'S JUST GOOD STUFF. 

176
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,822

AT WHAT THEY DO,                
AND THEIR FOOD SHOWS THAT.      

177

         TO SAY, GOOD IS GOOD.  

180
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,896
         THREE SANDWICHES UP... 
THEY PUT THEIR HEART            
INTO IT.                        

181

           UP NEXT...

          TO IT DIFFERENT.      

191
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,252
     THE THING ABOUT PEOPLE     
     AND BARBECUE IS THAT       

192
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,588
     IF THEY LOVE BARBECUE,     
     THEY REALLY LOVE IT.       

193
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,724
   IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CLUB     
   OR A SPECIAL ORGANIZATION.

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,952
     THIS BROWN, CRISPY COATING 
     ON THE OUTSIDE             
     IS CALLED THE BARK.        

234

THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART HERE.  

235
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,489
             LOOK AT THIS,      
             SEE THE COLOR      
             THAT PUT ON THERE?

00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,228
   SO EVERY TIME SOMEONE

              AND I WANT TO TRY 
              JUST A LITTLE BIT 
              OF THE SAUCE.     

242
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:32,770
                  LOOK AT THAT!

00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,644
          THE BARBECUE SAUCE IS 
          NOT TOO HOT,          

246
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:43,381
           NOT TOO VINEGARY,    
           IT GETS ITS WAY      
           ALL AROUND THE PORK. 

247
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:46,117
      THE CRUNCH FROM THE SLAW, 
      A LITTLE BIT OF BARK,     

248
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,419
       I WOULDN'T DO            
       A THING TO IT DIFFERENT. 

249
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,789
      YEP, I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO 

250
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,792

       CARPET SHAMPOOER AGAIN.  

251

         I'M A PULLED PORK NUT, 
         AND THIS IS GREAT.     

252
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,596
THE FLAVOR OF                   
THE PULLED PORK IS GREAT.       

253
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,265
    EVERYTHING THEY HAVE HERE   
    IS JUST REALLY GOOD.        

254
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,801
  WHETHER YOU'RE HAVING         
  THE RIBS OR THE GREAT SAUCES  
  THAT HE HAS HERE,             

255
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,869
    THAT ARE ALL HOMEMADE...

00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,206
        HOLY CHIPOTLE...        

258
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,542
    A LITTLE BIT SPICY          
    AND HAS A SMOKY FLAVOR TOO. 

259
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,877
     (Guy)                      
     AND HE'S DOIN' A TANGY     
     CAROLINA SAUCE.

00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,479
MY FAVORITE.                    

261
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:15,680
               LET'S DO THIS... 
               CIDER VINEGAR,   

262
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,048
              SOME WATER NOW... 

263
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,483
PUT THE MOONSHINE IN...         

264
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,552
NICE AND SIMPLE,                
WHAT YOU SEE                    
IS WHAT YOU GET.                

265
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,089
SALT, BLACK PEPPER,             
SOME SUGAR,                     

266
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,023
AND A LITTLE RED CHILI FLAKE.   

267
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,759
SEE, YOU GOT MY FAVORITE THINGS,
YOU GOT THE VINEGAR,            

268
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:29,894
YOU GOT THE HEAT,               
AND KETCHUP.                    

269
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,763
SO LET THIS SIMMER?             
       BRING IT UP TO A SIMMER, 

270
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,497
    AND THEN WE'LL COOL IT DOWN 
    AND HOLD IT.                

271
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,066
AND THEN WE'LL TASTE IT.        
                     ALL RIGHT. 

272
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:38,569
 MMM, I CAN ALREADY SMELL IT... 

273
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:41,306
       OH GOD,                  
       THAT'S RIDICULOUS.       

274
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:45,243
   IF THEY MADE THAT BOAT       
   HUMAN SIZE, I'D GET IN IT.   

275
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,179
    IT'S GOT A SWEETNESS TO IT, 
    BUT ALSO THE TANGINESS      
    OF THE VINEGAR,             

276
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,114
            THAT JUST MELDS     
            REAL WELL TOGETHER. 

277
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,317
   WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THE SOUTH 
   AND THIS TURNS OUT TO BE     

278
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,385
           THE BEST BARBECUE    
           THAT WE'VE RUN INTO. 

279
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:57,856
          WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING 
                  FROM SCRATCH. 
EVEN A DOZEN HOMEMADE SIDES.

THEY'RE MY FAVORITE.            

282
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,996
BLACK-EYED PEA SALAD,           
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.        
            OH, ABSOLUTELY NOT. 

283
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,065

BLACK-EYED PEAS.                

288
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,341
           SLOWLY POUR THIS IN? 
YES, SIR.

       IS REALLY GOOD.          

291
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,414

       WE'RE GONNA MAKE A BRINE 
                FOR MY CHICKEN. 
OKAY.                           

296
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,493
        TWO GALLONS OF WATER... 

297
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,295
CHICKEN TAKES TO BRINE          
SO WELL,                        
IT'S THE OSMOSIS, YOU KNOW,     

298
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,563
IT'S TRANSFERRING IN SOME       
OF THAT FLAVOR.                 

299
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,499
       KOSHER SALT, SOME SUGAR, 

300
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:42,967
              ONION AND GARLIC, 

301
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,704
             SOME BLACK PEPPER, 
A LITTLE PICKLING SPICE,        

302
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,238
I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT            
THE OLD BAY IDEA,               

303
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,773
BUT I LIKE WHERE YOU'RE         
ROLLIN' WITH THAT.              

304
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,109
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT,    
YOU'RE GONNA LET THIS SIT HERE  

305
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,178
AND SIMMER A LITTLE BIT,        
THEN COOL IT DOWN,              

306
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,513
HIT IT WITH SOME ICE,           
KIND OF DILUTING IT...          

307
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,581
SUBMERGE THE CHICKENS,          
THEY'LL SIT OVERNIGHT.          

308
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:00,785
AND NOW I'M GONNA RUB 'EM       
AND PREPARE 'EM FOR SMOKING.    

309
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:03,921
   SAME DRY RUB FOR THE CHICKEN 
     AND THE PORK AND THE BEEF? 
YEP.                            

310
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,923
         TUCK 'EM UP UNDERNEATH 
         SO THE WING TIPS       
         DON'T BURN OFF.        

311
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,927
        HIT SOME IN THE CAVITY. 
HIT THE BACK.                   

312
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,395
WE'RE GONNA GET THESE DOWN,     
GO FOR SIX HOURS AND THEN...    

313
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:14,399
BIRDS ARE READY.                

314
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,936
   OH, OH...                    
   IT'S LIKE A WATERFALL        
   IN MY MOUTH AS I'M DROOLING. 

315
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:20,672
             LOOK AT THAT...OH! 

316
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,807
         THERE AIN'T NO JOKIN', 
         THAT BIRD IS SMOKIN'.  

317
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:26,477
    THE RUB'S NOT OVERPOWERING, 
    YOU REALLY GET TO ENJOY     
    THE SMOKE,                  

318
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,880
    THE BIRD IS MONSTER-TENDER, 

319
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:30,948
  FANTASTIC BALANCE OF FLAVORS, 

320
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:35,353
               YOU GOT YOUR PhD 
            IN DELICIOUS, DUDE. 
APPRECIATE THAT.                

321
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,488
PERFECT, ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.    

322
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:38,689
               MAKE A NOISE     
               A CHICKEN MAKES. 

323
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:41,091
(chicken noise)                 
                        REALLY? 

324
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:42,226
        BEST BARBECUE I'VE HAD. 

325
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,562
       IT'S JUICY AND IT'S GOT  
       SOME NICE SMOKED FLAVOR. 

326
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,764
CONNECTICUT AND BARBECUE        
DON'T GO HAND IN HAND.          

327
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,233
   IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE,       
   BUT IT'S HERE AND IT'S GOOD. 

328
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,904
ED WILSON MAKES IT GOOD,        
THE LOVE HE PUTS IN,            
EVERYTHING COMES OUT PERFECT.   

329
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:57,108
REMEMBER, BARBECUE'S            
A YEAR-ROUND SPORT.             
             CELEBRATE IT, MAN. 

330
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,576
       THANKS, WHAT A GUY, HUH? 

331
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,580

      NEXT STOP...TEXAS.        
RACK-O-RIBS.                    

332
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,582
   THE RIBS ARE REALLY TASTY.   

333
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,184
    WHERE THIS GUY SAYS         
    THE SECRET'S IN THE WOOD.   

334
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,319
FOR ME GREEN MESQUITE           
HAD THE BEST FLAVOR,            

335
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,955
THE MOST CONSISTENT FLAVOR.     
                   THAT'S GOOD. 

336
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:18,062
  ON "TRIPLE D,"                
  WHEN YOU'RE IN JERSEY,        
  WELL, YOU HEAD INTO A DINER.  

337
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:20,131
     YOU'RE IN NEW ENGLAND,     
     IT'S A CLAM SHACK.         

338
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,867
     WHEN YOU'RE IN TEXAS,      
     AND YOU'RE LOOKIN' FOR     
     A LOCAL FAVORITE,          

339

     IT'S A BARBECUE JOINT,

00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,004
      LIKE GREEN MESQUITE,      
      HERE IN AUSTIN.           

341
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,074
     THE BEST BARBECUE IN TOWN. 
TWO CHOPPED BEEFS               
COMIN' UP.                      

342
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,210
ALL SET FOR NOW?                
                     THANK YOU. 

343
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,611
                   IS IT YUMMY? 

344
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,946
     TASTY... A LITTLE MESSY... 
I MEAN, IT'S AMAZING.           

345
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:37,615
SMOKY FLAVOR.                   
                      THEY USED 
       A GREEN MESQUITE WOOD... 

346
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,950
 (Guy)                          
 WHICH MOST FOLKS WILL TELL YA, 
 WILL SMOKE UP THE JOINT.       

347
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,153
ARE YOU BREATHING               
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS?          
                        BARELY. 

348
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:44,489
          AND CLOG YOUR SMOKER. 
YOU HAVE TO REPLACE FLUES       
EVERY YEAR.                     

349
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,358
             OH, 'CAUSE IT MUST 
           JUST LEAVE SOME SAP. 
IT EATS IT UP.                  

350
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,161
          BUT IT'S ALSO         
          THE ONLY KIND OF WOOD 
          TOM DAVIS WILL USE.   

351
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,832
FOR ME, GREEN MESQUITE          
HAD THE BEST FLAVOR,            
THE MOST CONSISTENT FLAVOR,     

352
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,400
AND AS LONG AS IT WAS           
LESS THAN A YEAR OLD            
AFTER IT WAS CUT,               

353
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,102
IT'S CONSIDERED GREEN.          

354
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:00,772
     SO DOES THAT GIVE IT       
     A LITTLE SNAPPIER,         
     LITTLE PEPPIER BITE TO IT? 

355
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,508
IT'S BAD ON PITS,               
BUT GREAT ON MEAT.              

356
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,309
IT HAS A GOOD,                  
BOLD TASTE TO IT.               

357
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,911
         IT GIVES A REALLY NICE 
         MESQUITE FLAVOR...     

358
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,780
       ON EVERYTHING            
       HE'S CRANKING OUT.       

359
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:10,315
      LOOK AT THAT BAD BOY!     

360
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,183
  FROM BRISKET AND CHOPPED BEEF 
  TO PORK RIBS.                 

361
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,585
      HERE IN BEEF COUNTRY.     

362
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,320
      I PREFER TO DO THINGS     
      I LIKE TO EAT.            

363
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,988
      THE RIBS ARE AWESOME,     
      FALLS RIGHT OFF THE BONE. 

364
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,523
        HOW MANY RACKS          
        ARE YOU DOIN' IN A DAY? 

365
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:22,393
PROBABLY 20 RACKS A DAY.        
                           OKAY.

366
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,595
 THIS IS CONSIDERED A SPARE RIB,
 NOT AS A ST. LOUIS?            

367
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,265
NO, A ST. LOUIS                 
IS A SPECIAL CUT.               

368
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,666
IT'S CALLED A 3 1/2             
AND DOWN.                       

369
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,269
          3 1/2 POUNDS          
          AND DOWN IS THE SIZE, 

370
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:32,803
       THAT'S THE WAY           
       THAT THEY'RE ALL PACKED. 

371
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,405
   THESE DO HAVE THE CHINE BONE 
   STILL ON IT,                 

372
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,808
        THE FAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S 
         BEEN TRIMMED OFF THIS. 
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

373
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,543
ALL RIGHT, SO GIVE ME           
THE RUB DOWN...                 

374
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,078
GET IT, GIVE ME THE RUN DOWN,   
GIVE ME THE RUB DOWN?           

375

     KIND OF THE USUAL SUSPECTS 
                 TO MAKING RUB. 
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

378
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,487
PAPRIKA, CAYENNE,               
WHICH I KNOW YOU LOVE.          

379
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,556

YOU DON'T FOOL AROUND,          

380
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,024
IF YOU GOT IT,                  
USE IT.                         

381
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,291

             GREAT COLOR ON IT, 

382
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,693
      THAT'LL MAKE A NICE BARK. 

383
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,962
        NOW, HOW LONG ARE THESE 
               GONNA GO ON FOR? 
4 1/2 TO 5 HOURS.               

384
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,964
THAT'S A NICE LONG TIME.        

385
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:02,233
TEMPERATURE'S ABOUT 195         
TO 200, RACK-O-RIBS.

         THEY DON'T FALL APART. 
THAT'S RIGHT.

   OOH THE COLOR,               
   THIS IS WITH GREEN MESQUITE. 

389
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,908

I LOVE 'EM.                     

390
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,510
              THIS IS GONNA BE  
              A NEW ONE FOR ME. 

391
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,912
              OKAY, YOU WANT TO 
                 GIVE ME YOURS?

          LOOK AT THAT,         
          THEY'RE JUST DRIPPING 
          RIGHT OUT OF THERE.   

395
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:21,219
            BOY, THEY'RE JUICY. 

396
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,056
         THAT'S GOOD,           
         I LIKE THE SMOKE RING. 

397
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,257
    I LIKE THAT BROWN SUGAR     
    OUT THERE,                  
    THIS IS THE BARBECUE SAUCE? 

398
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:30,194
         NOW, HOW DO YOU DO IT? 

399
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,930
ON TOP OF THE RIBS PLEASE,      
MY MOTHER MIGHT BE WATCHING.    

400
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:37,335
                     HMM...HMM, 
        YOU MAKE THE SAUCE TOO? 
YES.                            

401
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:40,271
 HIS TAKE ON KANSAS CITY STYLE, 
 35 GALLONS A WEEK.             

402
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,540
     WHAT...                    
     WE'RE IN BARBECUE COUNTRY. 

403
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,343
 I THINK BARBECUE SAUCE         
 ON A NAPKIN WOULD BE GOOD TOO. 

404
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:48,412
   WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT         
   IS THE REALLY SUBTLE FLAVOR, 

405
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:51,015
        YOU CAN TASTE THE PORK. 

406
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:53,618
              GREEN MESQUITE,   
              I'VE SEEN IT ALL. 

407
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,086
   THE RIBS ARE REALLY TASTY.   

408
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:58,889
SOME OF THE BEST BARBECUE       
I'VE HAD IN AUSTIN.             

409
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,825
          DO YOU PULL PORK TOO? 
I LOVE PULLED PORK.             

410
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:03,761
    AND YOU'RE NOT ASKED        
    TO LEAVE THE STATE OF TEXAS 
    IF YOU'RE EATIN' PORK?      

411
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,498
    TEXAS IS A BIG-TIME BEEF    
    COUNTRY, SO A LOT OF PLACES 
    DON'T CARRY PORK.           

412
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,301
      BUT REMEMBER,             
      THIS GUY'S DOIN' WHAT     
      HE LIKES TO EAT.          

413
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,103
JAMBALAYA, JAMBALAYA!           

414
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,371
      WITH SMOKED TURKEY,       
      CHICKEN AND SAUSAGE.      

415
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:17,308
THIS IS TEXAS JAMBALAYA.        
                  THAT'S RIGHT. 

416
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,043
AND THIS IS TOM'S KIND OF TACO. 

417
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,712
                         TACOS? 
YEAH, THEY DO IT IN TACOS.      

418
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:23,714
      WE DECIDED, "WHY DON'T WE 
      JUST MIX UP SOME BRISKET, 

419
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:25,583
   "AND THROW SOME LETTUCE      
   AND TOMATO AND CHEESE ON IT, 

420
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:26,984
    "AND WE'LL CALL IT A TACO." 

421
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,520
                THE BUBBA TACOS 
               ARE MY FAVORITE. 
              THE BUBBA, BUBBA? 

422
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:30,922
     THAT'S SMOKED BARBECUE,    
     BUT IT'S COVERED UP        

423
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,990
     WITH LETTUCE AND TOMATO    
     AND SALSA.                 

424
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,459
THE LAST TIME I HAD             
THE PULLED PORK TACOS,          
THEY WERE REALLY GOOD.          

425
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,994
             I THOUGHT THIS WAS 
             A BARBECUE JOINT.  

426
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,664
      IT'S A "WHAT TOM          
      LIKES TO EAT" JOINT.      

427
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,599
      AND THAT MEANS WINGS.     

428
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,667
  THE WINGS ARE NICE AND JUICY. 

429
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:45,336
              OKAY, NOW TELL ME 
              ABOUT WINGS.      

430
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,204
MARGARINE FIRST, OKAY?          

431
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,007
        JUST THROW IT OVER HERE 
               AND LET IT MELT? 
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

432
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,609
    THE MARGARINE OF MELTISH... 

433
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,412
THE BROWN SUGAR NEXT,           
CHILI SAUCE AFTER THAT...       

434
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,547
I'M GONNA JUST STAND BACK HERE. 
THAT'S RIGHT!                   

435
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,950
       'CAUSE THE WAY YOU'RE    
       WHISKIN' AND WHIPPIN'... 

436
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:03,154
    NOW SOME REGULAR HOT SAUCE? 
LOUISIANA HOT SAUCE RIGHT HERE. 

437
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,823
           NOW, WE'RE GONNA PUT 
              THE WING SAUCE... 
ALL OVER THE WINGS.             

438
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:07,558
BUT THEY'RE NOT COOKED.         

439
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,028
     IF YOU DEEP FRY THE WINGS  
     WITH THAT SAUCE ON THEM,   
     IT'S GONNA BURN THE SAUCE. 

440
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,996
THAT'S RIGHT,                   
SO WHAT YOU DO                  
IS YOU SMOKE IT FIRST,          

441
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,598
FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE HOUR      
AT 200 DEGREES.                 

442
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,100
                        REALLY? 

443
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:18,970
   HERE WE GO ON THE PIT,       
   YOU ALMOST GET USED TO THIS. 

444
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:22,840
I WOULD JUST RUN                
AND THROW IT AT IT.             
          I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. 

445
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,775
  NOW THEY'RE OUT OF THE SMOKER,
  NOW THEY GO IN THE FRYER.     

446
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:25,776
      FOR A MINUTE AND A HALF...

447
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,044
THIS IS JUST GONNA BE           
TO CRISP.                       

448
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:28,846
  THERE WE GO,                  
  NICE AND A LITTLE DARK THERE. 

449
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,382
       NOW, I PUT IT IN A BOWL, 
       TAKE MY WING SAUCE       

450
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:35,119
 AND KIND OF POUR IT LIKE THAT, 
 KIND OF SHAKE 'EM AROUND.      

451
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:38,289
YOU SCARE ME WITH THAT          
WINGIN' AND SAUCIN'...          
                THERE THEY ARE! 

452
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,327
  THE WING IS NICE AND TENDER,  
  A LOT OF GREAT MOISTURE TO IT,

453
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,130
                 NOT TOO SPICY. 
NOT DEADLY.                     

454
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:49,467
I'M GLAD THIS IS NOT TOO SMOKY. 
IT HAS A LITTLE BIT,            
BUT NOT MUCH.                   

455
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,335
YOU CAN BARELY TASTE IT.        

456
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,003
     THAT'S A REALLY GOOD WING! 

457
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,139
          THESE ONES DEFINITELY 
          ARE MORE TENDER       
          AND MUCH MORE JUICY.  

458
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:57,541
            IT'S A SWEET SAUCE, 
            NOT TOO SPICY.      

459
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,811
I'M INTERESTED IN TRYING ONE,   
BUT I FIGURE I'D JUST           
GET A BIG...                    

460
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:03,014
MAN, THOSE ARE GREAT!           

461
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,184
THIS IS MY WIFE, LORI.          

462
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,220
PRETTY CRISPY,                  
JUST HOW I LIKE IT.             

463
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:10,220
           IT'S THE BEST, SO... 

464
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:12,356
     I LIKE THE FRIED OKRA.     

465
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,825
I THOUGHT I WAS JUST COMING     
TO JUST A BARBECUE JOINT,       
BUT IT'S NOT.                   

466
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,228
 THEY CAN GET BARBECUE          
 AND I CAN GET WHAT I WANT TOO. 

467
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,029
   (Guy)                        
   'CAUSE HEY, THIS IS TEXAS.   

468
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,297
    I LOVE CHICKEN FRIED STEAK. 

469
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:21,566
      WHEN WE COME BACK...      

470
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:24,602
       I'VE NEVER HAD THE GUEST 
       OF THIS SHOW OUT-EAT ME. 
OH HEAVEN!                      

471
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:33,110
(Guy)                           
AT GREEN MESQUITE BARBECUE,     
IN AUSTIN, TEXAS,

MAKING HIS FAVORITES SINCE '88. 

473
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:41,652
              THEIR BARBECUE IS 
              THE BEST IN TOWN. 

474
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,921
             (Guy)              
   FROM BRISKET AND RIBS...     
     THE RIBS ARE REALLY TASTY. 

475

 TO SCRATCH-MADE JAMBALAYA...

CATFISH PO BOY!                 

477
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:52,196
AND EVEN THIS TEXAS FAVORITE... 
CHICKEN FRIED STEAK.            

478
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,332
                      BIG HERE? 
VERY BIG HERE.                  

479
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,600
START OUT WITH EGGS,            
          AND HOW LONG YOU GUYS 
              BEEN MAKIN' THIS? 

480
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,003
UH, 20 YEARS.                   
                        REALLY? 

481

ALL RIGHT, MILK,                
WHOLE MILK ONLY, PLEASE.        
            OKAY SO THIS IS IT. 

482
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:05,275
EGGS ARE WHISKED,               
SO WE GOT YOUR                  
SELF-RISING FLOUR,

SEASONED PEPPER...              
                  SO IT'S SALT, 
                 SUGAR, PEPPER, 

484
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:11,548

         THAT ARE DRIED.        

485
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,217
IT'S A SWEET, BLACK PEPPER,     
IS WHAT I CALL IT.              

486
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,286
        I LOVE THIS BELL PEPPER 
        THING IN HERE,          
        THAT'S WONDERFUL.       

487
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,288
IT ADDS A LITTLE BIT TO IT...   
RANCH DRY DRESSING MIX,         

488
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:20,958
ONCE YOU GET THAT ALL           
NICE AND MIXED UP...            

489
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,826

              OF SEASONING!

I GO MILK...                    

491
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,431
SO YOU DON'T PUT                
THE FLOUR ON FIRST.             

492
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,233
I COME FROM THE SCHOOL          
IF YOU PUT THE FLOUR            
ON IT FIRST,                    

493
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:32,236
          IT HELPS THE EGG WASH 
            STICK TO THE FLOUR. 
EVERYBODY SAYS THAT.            

494

THOSE CULINARY PROCEDURES       
AND PROCESSES?
