      LUAH STEW FOR ANDREW.     

55
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,879

WE'RE GONNA MAKE LUAH STEW.

00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:31,950
         LUAH LIKE AMUKAMUKA... 

58
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:34,085
NO, LUAH LEAF IS TARO LEAF.     

59
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:36,621
          TARA, LIKE TARO ROOT? 
EXACTLY.                        

60
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,890
RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA TAKE      
THIS BONELESS PORK SHOULDER,    

61
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,892
TRIM OFF THE FAT,               

62
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,961

FOR THE LUAH STEW.              

63
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,896
    SO THE PORK'S ALL CUBED UP, 
     WE'RE GONNA HIT IT WITH... 
KOSHER SALT.                    

64
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:48,367
        AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GO 
 TO THE RONDO AND BROWN IT OFF? 
YEP.                            

65
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,369
         OKAY, NOW WHAT'S NEXT? 

66
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:53,105
NOW WE ADD OUR ONIONS,          
ADD OUR SALT, AND...            

67
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,707
   PULL A LITTLE MOISTURE       
   OUT THERE, SWEAT THESE DOWN. 

68
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,376
   NOW THE ONIONS               
   HAVE DEFINITELY CARAMELIZED. 

69
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,646
YEP, WE'RE GONNA ADD            
A LITTLE BIT OF WATER           
TO DEGLAZE.                     

70
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:02,981
         OKAY, SO NOW THE LEAF. 
YES, NOW THE LEAF.              

71
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:06,050
                  THE LUAH LEAF 
           FROM THE TARO PLANT. 
CORRECT.                        

72
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,853
SOME PEOPLE LIKE IT TO SPINACH, 
I DON'T SAY THAT...             

73
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,456
    SO THIS IS                  
    THE HAWAIIAN COLLARD GREEN. 

74
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,258
NICE.                           

75
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,327
              ARE THESE BITTER? 
NO, NO, DON'T EAT IT.           

76
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,396
BECAUSE WHEN IT'S RAW --        

77
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,664
COLOCASIA ESCULENTA,            
THAT'S THE NAME OF              
THE TARO PLANT,                 

78
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,799
HAS THESE LIKE,                 
CRYSTALS IN IT                  

79
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,336
THAT NEEDS TO BE BROKEN DOWN    
WITH HEAT AND MOISTURE          
AND TIME.                       

80
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,071
SO YOU PICK THAT UP             
AND YOU EAT IT                  

81
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,540
YOUR THROAT'S GONNA GET         
ALL ITCHY AND CLOSE UP          

82
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,942
AND THEN I'M GONNA HAVE         
TO PROVIDE MOUTH TO MOUTH       
AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT.        

83
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,611
 SO NOW WE GO IN WITH THE PORK, 

84
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:35,680
           IT SITS UP ON TOP OF 
           THE ITCH-YOUR-THROAT 
                TARO ROOT LEAF. 
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

85
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,016
THIS IS GONNA COOK DOWN         
AND NOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?    

86
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,818
NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD             
A LITTLE BIT MORE WATER         

87
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,954
AND KIND OF LET IT BRAISE DOWN. 

88
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,889
              THIS IS THE STEW? 
THAT'S IT.                      

89
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,823
       NO CARROTS, NO MIREPOIX. 

90
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,627
K-I-S-S,                        
KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID.          

91
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:51,096
 YOU THINK YOU'LL FIT IN THERE? 
YEAH!                           

92
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,231
A LITTLE BIT OF SHOYU.          

93
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,367
        THE SHOYU IS            
        THE JAPANESE SOY SAUCE, 

94
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,502
         BUT IT'S THE SOY SAUCE 
         THAT YOU USE TYPICALLY 
         IN HAWAIIAN FOOD?      

95
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,638
YES.                            

96
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,706
        ALL RIGHT,              
        HOW LONG DID THIS COOK? 

97
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,709
SLOW AND LOW IS THE WAY TO GO   
SO ABOUT 46 HOURS.              

98
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,377
       DUDE, IT LOOKS LIKE      
       I'M IN THE WINE COUNTRY, 

99
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:07,245
        I'M UP AT SONOMA COUNTY 
        FOR A MUD MASK.         

100
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,913
WHERE ARE YOU?                  
         NOT THAT I'VE EVER HAD 
                  ONE OF THOSE. 

101
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,182
      ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE DONE. 
YEP.

           WE'VE GOT SOME RICE. 
YEP.                            

103
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,588
AND I'VE GOT                    
THE "HELLO KITTY" CHOPSTICKS?   

104
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,790
HUH, THAT'S WHAT IT IS?         

105
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,959
HA-HA, HA-HA-HA.                

106
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:28,399

THAT'S OUTSTANDING.             

108
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,737
THE PORK'S SUPER TENDER.        

109
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,606
IT'S VERY RICH,                 
THERE'S A LOT OF                
MOUTH APPEAL TO IT.             

110
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,675
CREAMINESS OF THE LUAH...       

111
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,944
DUDE, I WOULD DRIVE             
FROM THE OTHER SIDE,            

112
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,279
I WOULD DRIVE FROM HONOLULU     
FOR THIS.                       

113
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:42,948

115

       OF COOKING IT,

     IT'S VERY COMFORT FOOD.    

117
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:52,624

AS MUCH AS YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN.   

119
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,828
MARK KNOWS THAT HAWAII'S        
AN ISOLATED PLACE               

120
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,131
SO YOU GOTTA EAT THE FOODS      
THAT ARE GROWN HERE.            

121
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,568
      (Guy)                     
      LIKE PORK FROM NEARBY     
      SHINSATO FARMS,           

122
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,571
     BEEF FROM KUAHIWI RANCH    
     ON THE BIG ISLAND,

       AND EVEN, GET THIS,      

124
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,976

      GOOCH'S OWN BACKYARD.     

125
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,578
             HOW DO YOU GET IT? 
YOU GO OUT AND YOU SCOOP IT.    

126
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,047
IF IT'S BY THE SHORELINE        
YOU JUST GRAB A NET AND...      

127
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,116
   (Guy)                        
   ALL TO MAKE ANOTHER          
   TRADITIONAL HAWAIIAN DISH.   

128
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,118
      I GOT TWO LIMU SALAD.     

129
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,120
THAT'S THE BOMB RIGHT THERE.    

130
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,789
                    LIMU SALAD. 
LIMU SALAD, YEAH.               

131
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,258
                  IS THIS LIMU? 
THAT'S LIMU, SEAWEED.           

132
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,594
THIS IS INVASIVE                
AND THIS IS CALLED GORILLA.     

133
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,730
IT ENCROACHES                   
ON NATIVE HABITATS...           

134
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,665
                        REALLY? 
AND PUSHES THINGS OUT, YEAH.    

135
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,068
SO YOU DON'T WANT IT TO EAT IT. 
EXACTLY.                        

136
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,004
IT TASTES A LOT BETTER          
AFTER YOU BLANCH IT.            
                           GOOD.

137
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,341
          WE'VE GOT A POT OF    
          ROLLING BOILING WATER 

138
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,543
        AND WE GOT TO MAKE SURE 
        TO SALT IT, DROP IT IN. 

139
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,545
        SO YOU NOTICE           
        IT'S A DARK COLOR       

140
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,681
      AND WHEN WE BLANCH IT OFF 
      FOR A FEW SECONDS         

141
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,949
          IT'S GONNA TURN TO    
          A SLIGHTLY MORE LIKE, 
          GREENER GREEN.        

142
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,018
              LIKE GREEN BEANS. 
YES.                            

143
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:56,421
     WOW, SO IT GOES THAT FAST? 
YEAH, IT GOES THAT FAST,        
IN SECONDS.                     

144
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,890
   SO THIS TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF 
      THE BITTERNESS OUT OF IT? 
CORRECT.                        

145
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,025
             WE GOT IT ALL OUT. 
WE'RE GONNA SHOCK IT.           

146
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,228
                      SHOCK IT. 
THEN WE'LL DRAIN IT             
AND LET IT DRY.                 

147
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,230
    BREAK IT DOWN               
    SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT EASIER 

148
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,499
    SO WE'RE NOT MUNCHING ON IT 
    LIKE A... HORSE.            

149
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,768
(whinnies)                      

150
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,836
THAT'S IT.                      
                           OKAY.

151
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,238
                (Guy whistling) 
OKAY, SO NOW WE MAKE            
OUR VINAIGRETTE.                

152
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:16,241
SO WE'VE GOT                    
OUR HAWAIIAN CHILE PEPPERS.     

153
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,310
AREN'T THEY CUTE?               
        THEY ARE, ARE THEY HOT? 

154
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:20,245
THEY'LL KICK YOU IN YOUR...     
                        REALLY? 

155
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,513
PUT IN OUR HAWAIIAN CHILE PEPPER
AND GARLIC, HAWAIIAN SALT,      

156
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,449
        AND GRIND INTO A PASTE. 

157
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,784
  IS THIS TRADITIONAL HAWAIIAN? 
NO, THIS IS JAPANESE.           

158
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,321
ONCE WE'VE GOT OUR PASTE        
TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF

                SHERRY VINEGAR. 
YES SIR.                        

160
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,859
GET IT OUT OF THE GROOVES.      

161
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,461
WE TAKE OUR LIMU,               
OUR SLICED ONIONS...

166
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:48,072
THIS IS A COMBINATION OF        
THREE SALTS FROM THREE          
DIFFERENT ISLANDS.              

167
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:50,509
      AND THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE?

             AS FUNKY AS IT IS, 
             IT'S REALLY GOOD.  

172
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:07,359
       FRESH, PALATE CLEANSING.

    SALT WATER IN YOUR MOUTH.   

177

00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,613
 IT REMINDS ME OF HOME COOKING. 

192
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:03,481
         LET'S GET BUSY.        

193
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,617
      WHAT CUT DO WE HAVE HERE? 

194
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,485
THIS IS A KNUCKLE,              
IT COMES OFF OF THE SIRLOIN.    

195
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:09,354
 SO A GREAT FLAVOR,

   GET GREAT TEXTURE            
   AND GREAT FLAVOR OUT OF THIS 

197
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:13,558
     BECAUSE OF THE MARBLING    
     AND SO FORTH, LET'S DO IT. 

198
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:15,426
WE'RE GONNA MARINATE IT NOW     

199
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,162
SO WE'RE GONNA ADD              
A LITTLE BIT OF TERIYAKI.       

200
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,097

YES WE DO.                      

201
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,433
ADD A LITTLE BIT OF WATER       
TO THIN IT OUT, MIX IT UP.      

202
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,502
HOW LONGS DOES IT MARINATE FOR? 
FOR FOUR TO SIX HOURS           
TO OVERNIGHT, SIMPLE.           

203
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,037
    THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE, OKAY.

206
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,511

RED MISO.                       

211
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:44,789
      AND THIS IS ALL THE SAUCE 
      THAT'S GONNA GO ON TOP    
      OF THE MEAT?              

212
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,125
             THAT'S RIGHT, YEP.

217
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,471
SO WE LET THIS REDUCE DOWN.     

218
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,207
YEAH, WE FINISH IT UP WITH KUMA,
TOASTED SESAME SEEDS.           

219
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:06,011

RIGHT THERE.                    

222
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,350

THAT'S RIGHT.

     A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR MISO. 

225

A LITTLE BIT.

       SO HERE WE'RE GONNA MAKE 
       OUR WET INGREDIENTS      
       FOR OUR DOUGH.           

299
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,516
          OKAY, WE PUT OUR SALT 
          AND OUR SUGAR         

300
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,651

00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,122
    WE HAVE OUR WATER,          
    WE ADD HALF TO THIS BOWL... 

303
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,924
              HALF TO THE OTHER 
          TO LET THAT DISSOLVE. 
             EXACTLY, WHISK IT. 

304
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,926

                 COMBINE THOSE. 

305
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:44,395

IT'S JUST MY NONA'S RECIPE.     

313
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:02,346
AND YOU DON'T QUESTION NONA,    
JUST GO WITH IT.                
                  THAT'S RIGHT. 

314
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:05,549
           AND NOW WE'LL ADD    
           THE WET INGREDIENTS. 

315
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,618
WE MIXED IT UP,                 
IT HAD A CHANCE TO RISE.        

316
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,553
       THEN WE'LL PUNCH IT DOWN 
       A LITTLE BIT.            

317
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,555
      NOW WE'LL PORTION IT OUT. 

318
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,558
      WE USE ABOUT THREE POUNDS 
      FOR ONE SCHIACCIATA.      

319
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,560
IT SMELLS GREAT,                
THAT FRESH YEAST.               

320
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,495
        SO WE PUT               
        A LITTLE FLOUR IN HERE, 

321
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,497
    PUT A LITTLE SEMOLINA FLOUR 
    INTO OUR PAN, TOO.          

322
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,031
IT KEEPS IT FROM STICKING.      
                           YEAH.

323
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,034
     JUST ONCE THROUGH THE TOP, 

324
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,103
ONCE THROUGH THE BOTTOM.        
                     THAT'S IT. 

325
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,639
LAY IT OUT,                     
PULL IT TO THE CORNERS.         
                     THAT'S IT. 

326
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,574
ARE WE GONNA LET THIS PROOF     
BEFORE WE TOP IT?               

327
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,976
           YEAH, WE LET IT RISE 
                  A LITTLE BIT. 
OKAY, DOUGH'S OUT.              

328
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,911
           SO WE START BUILDING 
           OUR SCHIACCIATA.     

329
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,647
         TAKE THE MOZZARELLA... 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?             

330
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,316
YOU DON'T DO IT ON BOTH SIDES?  
               NO, WHAT YOU DO, 
       WE'RE GONNA CLOSE IT UP. 

331
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:41,585
IT'S A GIANT CALZONE?           
   THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO PUT IT. 

332
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,721
IT'S A PIZZA STRUDEL, BASICALLY.

333
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:45,657
   THIS IS ITALIAN              
   PROSCIUTTO COTTO.            

334
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,591
COOKED PROSCIUTTO.              
      COOKED PROSCIUTTO, RIGHT. 

335
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,794
     EVERY ONE KNOWS THE DRIED, 
     CURED PROSCIUTTO,          

336
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:52,130
      THAT'S THE ONE            
      THAT'S KIND OF LIKE       
      ITS MORE FAMOUS COUSIN.   

337
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,531
IN THE STATES WE CALL THAT HAM. 
                         RIGHT. 

338
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:56,534
     OKAY, THEN AFTER THAT      
     WE PUT THE PEPPERONI DOWN. 

339
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,402
YOU'RE LIKE A BLACKJACK DEALER  
AT THE FLAVOR TOWN CASINO.      

340
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,471
                   YEAH, RIGHT. 

341
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,940
   AND THEN SOME FRIED PEPPERS. 
YOU FRIED 'EM?                  

342
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:05,009
HM-MMM, WE USE A DEEP FRYER.    

343
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,744
IT GIVES A LITTLE TEXTURE       
AND THEN WE ADD...              

344
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,613
MORE CHEESE.                    
             MORE CHEESE, YEAH. 

345
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:11,282
YOU JUST PUT IT TO BED.         
        JUST FOLD IT OVER, YEP. 

346
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,284
     PRESS THE EDGES OVER HERE. 

347
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,686
THIS IS LIKE,                   
STROMBOLI GONE WILD.            
 THEN WE PUT A LITTLE EGG WASH, 

348
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:18,089
 WE THROW A LITTLE MORE         
 SEMOLINA FLOUR ON TOP          
 AND THAT'S IT.                 

349
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,890
 THEN WE GO STRAIGHT            
 TO THE OVEN WITH IT.           

350
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,959
WHAT TEMP?                      
     450, FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES. 

351
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,828
FOR 20 MINUTES?                 
                           YEAH.

352
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,897
OKAY, SO NOW IT'S OUT OF        
THE OVEN, IT'S COOLED DOWN.     
                         RIGHT. 

353
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,366
NOW FOR SERVICE?                
     WE TAKE IT OUT OF THE PAN. 

354
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,902
     WE'RE GONNA CUT IT         
     IN OUR EIGHT STRIPS.       

355
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,640
HOLY HAM AND CHEESE.            

356
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,909
 THEN THOSE STRIPS INDIVIDUALLY 
 GET TOSSED ON THE PANINI GRILL 

357
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,177
     TO GIVE IT THE GRILL MARKS 
     AND WARM EVERYTHING        
     ELSE UP INSIDE.            

358
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,380
I CAN HEAR THE SNAP, CRACKLE... 
YEAH, YOU CAN HEAR THE SIZZLING.

359
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,515
IT'S READY TO COME OFF          
THE PANINI PRESS.               

360
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,518
YOU JUST CUT THAT IN HALF,      
THERE YOU GO.                   

361
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,788
ITALIAN HAM AND CHEESE          
WITH SOME PEPPERS               
AND SOME PEPPERONI.             

362
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,757
                         YEAH.  

363
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:56,794

THAT SEMOLINA FLOUR             
ON THE OUTSIDE                  

364
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:59,330
WHICH GIVES THAT NICE,          
LITTLE, CRUSTY TEXTURE.         

365
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,532
THE PEPPERONI AND THE HAM       
AND THE PEPPERS                 

366
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:03,601
INFUSE THAT FLAVOR              
INTO THE DOUGH.                 

367
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,938
MMM, PROSCIUTTO COTTO           
IS NICE AND TENDER              

368

AND NOT TOO SALTY.              

369
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,008
YOU KNOW, THE FRIED PEPPERS     
COMING IN THERE.

IT'S LIKE A REAL-DEAL           
ITALIAN HAM AND CHEESE.

THE PRODUCTS THEY SALE          

379
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,764

383
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,105

     AS A SURPRISE IN HERNANDO. 

405
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,873
  (Guy)

416
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,100
THE WHOLE THING                 
IS JUST DELICIOUS.              

417
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,769
        WHAT ARE WE GONNA MAKE? 

418
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:21,105
WE'RE MAKING                    
A BANANA NUT BREAD FRENCH TOAST.

419
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,041
        ALL RIGHT,              
        LET'S START THIS BREAD. 

420
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,243
FIRST THING,                    
ADD THE BUTTER INTO THE BOWL.   

421
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,511
AND NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD         
THE SUGAR.                      

422
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,713
        CREAM THE BUTTER        
        AND THE SUGAR.          

423
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,649
NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD THE EGGS.   

424
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,718
SCRAPE THAT DOWN A LITTLE BIT.  

425
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,853
WE'LL GET THAT GOING.           

426
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,989
  THAT POOR LITTLE MIXER'S      
  ABOUT SEEN ITS LAST DAY, HUH? 

427
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:41,059
IT'S GOT A MOTOR ON IT          
AS STRONG AS A CAMARO           
OUT THERE, MAN.                 

428
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,194
SO WE JUST CREAM                
THAT TOGETHER A LITTLE BIT.     

429
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,396
1/2 TEASPOON OF KOSHER SALT.    

430
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,565
THAT'S TWO TEASPOONS OF         
BAKING SODA.                    

431
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,735
FOUR CUPS FLOUR.                

432
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:56,808
NOW WE GET SIX VERY RIPE BANANAS
AND WE MASH 'EM.                

433
00:17:56,943 --> 00:18:00,077
YOU WANT KIND OF                
A CHUNKY MASH.                  

434
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,079
    RIGHT, SO THAT'S THE REASON 
    WE'RE NOT PUTTING 'EM       
    IN THE MIXER                

435
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,081
          BECAUSE IT WOULD JUST 
          CREAM 'EM OUT.        

436
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,017
I LIKE A LITTLE CHUNK IN THERE. 

437
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,085
SO WE'RE GONNA ADD PECANS IN,   
ROASTED AND SALTED, GOT IT?     

438
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,288
THEN WE PUT THE BANANAS IN.     

439
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,890
AND WE KIND OF DO THIS          
A LITTLE BIT SLOWER.            

440
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,892
             JUST ENOUGH        
             TO INCORPORATE IT, 

441
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,495
              NOT CREAM IT OUT, 
         AND YOU'RE GOOD TO GO. 
THAT'S ABOUT IT.                

442
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,697
WE'RE GONNA GET OUR BAKING DISH 
AND WE'RE GONNA SPRAY IT DOWN.  

443
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,799
POUR YOUR MIXTURE IN.           

444
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,171
IT'S GONNA COOK OFF AT 325      
FOR ABOUT 1 HOUR, 15 MINUTES.   

445
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,907
            OKAY, BREAD'S DONE. 

446
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,376
SO HERE WE'LL MAKE OUR EGG WASH 
FOR THE FRENCH TOAST.           

447
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,713
EGGS,                           

448
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,448
WHIP UP THE EGGS,               
ADD A LITTLE WHOLE MILK,        

449
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,451
A LITTLE BIT OF CINNAMON.       

450
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,720
                    YOU WANT ME 
               TO POP THIS OUT? 
YES SIR.                        

451
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,856
        MMM, SMELL THAT.        

452
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:48,726
WE'LL CUT A SLICE,              
A NICE SLICE HERE,              

453
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,395
PUT THAT IN THERE,              
LET IT SIT FOR A SECOND,        

454
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,263
SOAK IT UP,                     

455
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,199
GET SOME WHOLE BUTTER           
IN THE PAN,                     

456
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,602
LET THIS MELT DOWN              
A LITTLE BIT.                   

457
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,803
RIGHT THERE, YOU'RE STARTING TO 
SEE THE FOAM ON THE TOP OF      
THE BUTTER.                     

458
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,939
THEN WE PUT IT DOWN IN THERE.   

459
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,941
LET THAT GO FOR JUST A SECOND.  
                           OKAY.

460
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,277
     OVER HERE, WE'RE GONNA GET 
     OUR BANANA READY FOR       
     THE FOSTERS.               

461
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,679
   DID YOU FLIP THAT YET, CHEF? 
I HAVE NOT.                     

462
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:11,148
I THINK IT'S ABOUT READY.       
THERE YOU GO.                   

463
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,684
                      GORGEOUS. 
AND I'M GONNA THROW IT          
IN THE OVEN                     

464
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,487
THAT WAY THE OUTSIDE EDGE       
WILL FEEL JUST LIKE             
THE BOTTOM WILL.                

465
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,890
GOT ANOTHER SKILLET,            
A LITTLE BUTTER IN THERE.       

466
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,292
WE'VE GOT OUR BANANA.           

467
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,560
                    ALL OF THIS 
               FOR ONE DESSERT. 
ONE DESSERT.                    

468
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:26,496
BANANAS ARE COOKING,            
GONNA ADD SOME BROWN SUGAR,     

469
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,566
LET THAT MELT DOWN A LITTLE BIT 
WITH THE BANANA.                

470
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,568
 MAKING A LITTLE CARAMEL THERE. 

471
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,770
HIT IT WITH A SHOT OF COGNAC.   

472
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:35,773
                     VERY NICE. 

473
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,708
AND THEN RIGHT AT THE END...    
                   HEAVY CREAM. 

474
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,077
HEAVY CREAM JUST TO KIND OF     
BRING IT ALL TOGETHER.          

475
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,114
FRENCH TOAST,                   
PUT IT IN THE BOWL.             

476
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,251
NOW YOU'VE GOT YOUR BANANAS     
WITH THE SAUCE, STACK IT UP.    

477
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,253
PUT A LITTLE ICE CREAM          
ON TOP --                       

478
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,522
IT'S VANILLA BEAN               
AND FRENCH GINGER,              
TWO SCOOPS.                     

479
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,858
WITH FRENCH TOAST               
YOU ALWAYS GOTTA HAVE           
A LITTLE POWDERED SUGAR ON TOP, 

480
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,960
YOU WANT TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF 
EVERYTHING TOGETHER.            

481
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,598
     YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF 
     THE CRUNCHY TEXTURE OF     
     THE FRENCH TOAST,          

482
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
      THEN YOU GET THOSE PECANS 
      INSIDE OF THERE.          

483
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:04,602
 TRUE BANANA FLAVOR,            
 AND IF YOU DIDN'T GET          
 ENOUGH BANANA FLAVOR FROM THAT 

484
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:06,704
     YOU GET THE MOAT-O-BANANA. 

485
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,275
THAT ICE CREAM                  
WITH THE LITTLE HINT OF         
THE GINGER SETS ANOTHER BALANCE.

486
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,344
     IT'S A PACKAGED DEAL, MAN. 

487
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,879
        THAT IS DECADENT.       

488
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,682
          FRENCH TOAST.         

489
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,951
I DO NOT LIKE TO SHARE IT.      

490
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:22,753
     WHAT KILLS ME              
     ABOUT THE WAY YOU DO STUFF 

491
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,888
   IS EVERYTHING HAS TO BE DONE 
   TO LIKE, THE NEXT LEVEL,     

492
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,158
     YOU MAKE THE BANANA BREAD, 
     YOU MAKE THE ICE CREAM.    

493
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,626
         IF I GAVE YOU A CHANCE 
         IN A SMALL JUNGLE      

494
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,561
YOU'D PROBABLY GROW THE BANANAS.

495
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,496
GO STRAIGHT TO GUATEMALA.       
               YEP, ON HIS WAY. 

496
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,832
             NICE JOB, BROTHER, 
                     THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU.                      

497
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,101
SO THAT'S IT                    
FOR THIS FLAVOR TOWN ROAD TRIP. 

498
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,902
      BUT DON'T YOU WORRY,      

499
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:40,705
   THERE'S PLENTY MORE JOINTS   
   ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY.       

500
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,506
        I'LL BE LOOKING         
        FOR YOU NEXT TIME       

501
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,908
      ON "DINERS, DRIVE-INS     
      AND DIVES."               

502
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:47,178
 SO GO AHEAD WITH WHATEVER ELSE 
 YOU WERE DOING.                

503
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,513
    ALL RIGHT, SO NEXT UP       
    WE'RE GONNA MAKE SOME...    

504
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,715
WAIT A MINUTE,                  
YOU CAN'T STAND IN FRONT OF ME. 

505
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:54,118
 I MEAN, I AM GONNA BE INVOLVED 
 IN MY OWN SHOW, THANK YOU.     

506
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:57,121
        WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE?
