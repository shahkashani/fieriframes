00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:13,925
                Mix it up.      
           We'll add the butter.

228
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,661
                   Eggs.        

229
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,929
  Raining chickens.             

230
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,465
               Milk, vanilla.   

231
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:25,069
            And the key is this 
          compressed beet sugar,

232
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,671
               and you cannot   
              find it locally,  

233
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,873
          so when I got started,
           I cashed out my IRA, 

234
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,942
                and I bought    
              10 tons of sugar. 

235
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,346
You got to be related           
to my family somehow.           

236
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,949
    It has a special texture.   
 It has a special melting point.

237
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,417
         That doesn't smell like
               any waffle       

238
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,286
                dough, batter   
            that I've ever made.

239
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,154
          This gets done mixing.

240
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,289
              We portion it...  

241
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,157
       Mm-hmm.                  
                 ...cut it...   

242
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,826
            ...put it           
            in the holding tray,

243
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,562
    It goes in the refrigerator.
        Yes.                    

244
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,565
        And then it goes        
        to the waffle maker.    

245
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,299
        That is awesome.        

246
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,502
          So you have somebody  
        make this thing for you.

247
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:00,238
The one that comes from Belgium,
    really not sturdy enough.   

248
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,239
          This one,             
you can bang it all you want.   

249
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,709
               So the sugar     
          still never dissolved.

250
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,045
        Still just big chunks --
             a lot of sugar.    

251
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,048
We put two balls of dough       
   on the waffle iron.          

252
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:12,584
  And we just close it.         
Gravity will do the work.       

253
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:13,718
 And then 3 minutes,            

254
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:14,986
  you're gonna get              
 a beautiful waffle.            

255
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,858
Just serve in wax paper.        

256
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,259
That's the way we --            

257
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,028
       That's the way you get it
                 in Belgium.    
      Belgium.                  

258
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,865
             That's outstanding.

259
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,933
      I love the little crystals
             that you get.      

260
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,002
 You know, you get a little bit 
 of that crunch inside of there.

261
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,337
           I mean, that's crazy.

262
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,339
        This is the way to get  
      your kid up in the morning

263
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,142
       on Sunday and have him   
    mow the lawn and wax the car

264
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,142
             and shave the dog. 

265
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,477
               Want a waffle?   
                    Yeah!       

266
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:41,078
   Fruit-and-cream              
   Belgian waffle.              

267
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:44,015
Any other waffle you've ever had
  in your life it put to shame. 

268
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:47,218
          This is my cousin Jeff
             and his son T.J.   

269
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,354
         What did you think, TJ?
Whenever you bite into it,      

270
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,156
      it's not                  
 the normal waffle.             

271
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:52,624
   You can just eat 'em plain.  

272
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:53,825
       You don't need any syrup.

273
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,026
     FLECHET: Plain waffle.     

274
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,293
Did you cook at home            
     in Belgium?                

275
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,229
      I never cooked a waffle   
   until I started the business.

276
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,230
   That's awesome.              

277
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,765
              My background     
         is in computer science.

278
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,434
   Computer program and a recipe
         are very similar.      

279
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,569
Yeah, no, they are.             
             The special steps, 
              you follow them.  

280
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,638
     FIERI: And his recipes     
    go way beyond the waffle.   

281
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:08,906
              Carbonnade is up. 

282
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:10,709
    The carbonnade's just got   
  kind of those smoky flavors,  

283
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,777
 just like comfort food, almost.

284
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,379
    All right, so,              
what are we making now?         

285
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,714
              We are gonna make 
                 carbonnade.    

286
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:16,581
 What is carbonnade?            

287
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,249
                 Traditional    
             Belgian beef stew. 

288
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,384
       Hit it.                  
                Beef tallow.    

289
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,652
     FIERI: You got to love     
       some beef tallow --      

290
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,054
  you know, rendered beef fat.  

291
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,522
      Then let's add the onions.

292
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:25,990
                   Garlic.      

293
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,126
                   Bacon.       

294
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:30,128
             We're gonna take it
               off the heat...  

295
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:33,064
So we can sear the meat.        
       ...so we sear the meat --
                  exactly.      

296
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,799
 What type of meat?             

297
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,401
              It's a mix of top 
              and round chuck.  
       Got it.                  

298
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,403
              Salt and pepper.  

299
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:41,172
 We add onion, garlic, and bacon
        back in the pot,        

300
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,541
           stir it all together,
            and add the flour.  

301
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:44,943
       Got it.                  

302
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:47,945
Gonna build a little roux       
   off of the fat.              
                  Exactly.      

303
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,748
        The apple cider vinegar.

304
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,616
                  The beer.     
Which type of beer is this?     

305
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,284
           It's a good dark ale.
        Okay.                   

306
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,353
        And then some Dijon.    

307
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:58,556
         This is what we call   
      in Belgian sirop de Liège.

308
00:10:58,558 --> 00:10:59,491
      Sirop...                  

309
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,159
                ...de Liège.    
    ...de Liège.                

310
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,894
       This is really the secret
             of the dish.       

311
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,763
     They gather all the apples,
            all the pear,       

312
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,564
    put them in a big container,
             reduce it,         

313
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,233
             and we use that    
         as a natural sweetener.

314
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,702
And last but not least,         
  the bouquet garni?            

315
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:11,703
               Bouquet garni.   

316
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,172
So, parsley, bay leaf,          
thyme, and peppercorns.         

317
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,573
                  Exactly.      

318
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:18,243
And then we're gonna let it cook
  for about an hour and a half. 

319
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,377
           We're gonna place    
       some frites on the plate,

320
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,447
           serve the carbonnade.

321
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,781
       Hmm.                     

322
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,584
   And then we add just a little
      bit of pickled onions,    

323
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,720
               and this is      
        our chipotle mayonnaise.

324
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,057
       Mm.                      

325
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,126
     It's tender,               
but not falling apart,          

326
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,595
and there's rich, dark          
beer being used in there,       
so you get that note.           

327
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:40,598
 And are you supposed to dip    
the frites in the mayonnaise,   

328
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,333
or you dip it in this,          
         or...                  

329
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:43,801
             You can alternate. 

330
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,469
 <i> Comme ci, comme ça?</i>           

331
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,538
            <i> Comme ci, comme ça.</i>

332
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,807
 It's not super heavy.          
It's not overpowering.          

333
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,142
     Outrageous.                

334
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,211
              Carbonnade is up. 

335
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,546
              MAN:              
 It's made just like in Belgium.

336
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:58,750
 I lived there for a long time, 
       and they nailed it.      

337
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:02,019
   To find a traditional        
Belgian place like yourself     

338
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,020
   is outrageous.               

339
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,688
  We're hanging out             
    in Cincinnati               

340
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,624
     on Vine Street             
at the Taste of Belgium.        

341
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:07,625
You got to come back.           

342
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,360
 I think we're gonna            
   make pretzels,               

343
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,863
and my recommendation would be, 
     add some beer cheese.      

344
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,904
      FIERI: Welcome back.      

345
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,405
        We're hanging out       
      in Cincinnati, Ohio,      

346
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,773
    at the Taste of Belgium,    

347
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,977
and this man served me waffles  
  like I've never had before.   

348
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,845
        Out of bounds.          
Chef, what are we making next?  

349
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,781
             We're gonna make   
           some Belgian pretzel.

350
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,115
  Okay, get going.              

351
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:34,719
            Yeast, sugar, water.
        Okay.                   

352
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:35,986
    We're gonna give it a whisk,

353
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:39,323
             get it bubbling,   
          and then add the beer.

354
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,192
               Then the flour.  

355
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:43,528
                   Salt.        

356
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,396
               And then we put  
             the dough hook in. 
    Argh, Captain.              

357
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,731
      How long                  
   we let this go?              

358
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,801
      For about 8 to 10 minutes.

359
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,537
         Then we portion it out.

360
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:55,206
                  and then      
            just cut through it.

361
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,207
    Look at this.               

362
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,544
And then we're gonna flatten it,
            roll it.            

363
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,815
   Let me see this              
little, funky knot you do.      
           It's the Belgian way.

364
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:06,217
Everything that I               
don't understand,               
you call a Belgian way.         

365
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,953
    Nobody knows the first thing
           about Belgium, so... 
Yeah, so you just say,          

366
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,222
"Oh, that's how we do it        
      in Belgium."              

367
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:15,426
   All right, so,               
we'll let these proof how long? 
                About two hours.

368
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:18,362
              They get boiled,  

369
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,364
          brushed with egg wash,

370
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:23,901
     and then put in the oven --
         12 minutes at 425.     

371
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:25,103
Now we're going to make...      

372
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,104
                Beer cheese.    

373
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:29,040
            We add cream cheese,
                Swiss cheese,   

374
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:34,112
 smoked Gouda, cinnamon, nutmeg,
   and then some heavy cream.   

375
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,249
        Put some water in there.

376
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:41,052
  We're gonna put this          
in the water in the oven?       

377
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,121
             That's correct,    
        so that it doesn't burn.

378
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,388
      How long                  
is this gonna go in?            

379
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:45,924
            That's gonna go in  
           for about 20 minutes.

381
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,994
             And we're gonna add
             the beer.          

382
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:53,130
  What we use is a              
raspberry-flavored Belgian beer.
                    Okay.       

383
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,801
And it adds a very unique flavor
 to the beer cheese.            
                I can imagine.

  finish blending.              

389
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,014
      Serve that with a pretzel.

390
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,616
     Good idea.                 
             I come up with them
                all the time.

and put some coarse salt on.    

396

      The texture on the pretzel
          is real authentic.

           it just smells great.

399

        The beer cheese is rich,

What are we gonna make?         

451
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,532
           We are going to make 
          our short-rib marinade

452
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,601
        for our short-rib tacos.
Give me the rundown, man.       

453
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,269
         First, we're gonna take
          our roasted tomatoes. 

454
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,138
                 All right.     
Come on, get up there.          

455
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:48,205
       Ah!                      

456
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,274
               Got beef stock,  
               chipotle chili.  

457
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,876
In adobo, very nice.            

458
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:52,876
                Tomato paste.   

459
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,545
                Whole garlic.   

460
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:55,946
                Brown sugar.    

461
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,215
              And kosher salt.  

462
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,086
So, what's the next step?       

463
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,688
             We're gonna braise 
               our short ribs.  

464
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,490
  Okay, so, all we're gonna do  
 is hit it with salt and pepper.

465
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,691
                   Wow.         

466
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,628
           So, the goal here    
      is to just sear each side,

467
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,430
   get great crust              
 all the way around.            

468
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:13,698
          BARRACATO: Absolutely.

469
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:16,367
All right, buddy, next.         

470
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,169
We're gonna add cinnamon sticks,
        a few bay leaves.       

471
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,872
         Let's add the marinade.

472
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,175
 Now, how long are we gonna     
let this braise in the oven?    

473
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,179
     We're gonna cook it at 350 
     for about 4 1/2 to 5 hours.

474
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:29,180
      Take it.                  

475
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,582
    Look at that.               

476
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,117
 Let's make a taco.             
                    Okay.       

477
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,519
             Look at this thing.

478
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,855
           Then we're gonna take
           our braising liquid, 

479
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,525
              a pinch of salt,  
              a pinch of pepper,

480
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,992
               some of our fresh
               tortillas.       

481
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:44,529
        We're gonna take        
        our shredded short ribs.

482
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,935
 And hit with crema             
 and queso fresco.              

483
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,869
           Pickled white onions.

484
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,338
  FIERI: Cilantro.              

485
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,007
  And then we're gonna finish it
    off with slices of radish.  

486
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,143
It's got a lot of street taco   
     going right there.         

487
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,951
The tortilla is very light.     

488
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,021
The short rib, it's tender,     
     not overseasoned.          

489
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,555
  Love the cinnamon             
      in there.                 

490
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,223
  This is a really              
   elevated taco.               

491
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,093
 I mean, the whole thing        
comes together fantastic.       

492
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,227
       Mm.                      

493
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,629
      Two short-rib tacos.      

494
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,898
     They're nice and juicy.    
They've got a nice crunch to it.

495
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,633
              MAN:              
  Finished on a corn tortilla.  

496
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,168
         It doesn't get         
    more authentic than that    

497
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,703
 in the middle of the heartland.

498
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,572
So you guys are making          
 handmade tortillas?            
                 Absolutely.    

499
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:28,839
                We usually do   
                about 2,000.    

500
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,842
     Every day?                 
                 Every day.     

501
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:36,380
       FIERI: But it's not      
just tortillas and tacos here --

502
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,249
  No, they're also turning out  
           the tortas.          

503
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:41,319
         Milanesa torta.        
             WOMAN:             
   I had the chicken milanesa.  

504
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:42,386
   It's my favorite sandwich.   

505
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,654
  It's something with the bread.

506
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,189
   It's a nice, crispy          
   chicken cutlet.              

507
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,192
What are we up to now?          
     Our chicken milanesa torta.

508
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:49,059
       Okay.                    

509
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,661
              Gonna take water  
                to start off.   

510
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:55,799
          Honey, kosher salt,   
       black pepper, bay leaves.

511
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:59,336
       We've got our seven-ounce
         chicken breasts here.  

512
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:02,540
How long is this chicken        
    gonna brine?                
               Minimum 24 hours.

513
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:03,607
   All right, so,               
the chicken's brined.           

514
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,209
  We're gonna pound the breasts.

515
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,411
           Next we're gonna take
               our egg wash,    

516
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,146
   put it into the bread crumbs.

517
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:12,016
  Let the bread crumbs          
adhere to it, and then --       

518
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,818
     Yes, we're gonna let 'em go
        for about two hours.    

519
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,753
And then this is gonna go       
    to the fryer?               
                    Yes.        

520
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,488
   Ready to rock.               

521
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,424
           Fried chicken breast.

522
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,558
           Take our telera roll,

523
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,828
           add black bean spread
           to the bottom of it. 

524
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,229
               Take our fresh   
              tomatillo salsa.  

525
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:26,763
                Put a line      
          right down the center,

526
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,998
          chicken breast on top.

527
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,367
       Dig it.                  
             We're gonna hit it 

528
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,702
       with a little dressed    
  arugula salad with some lemon.

529
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:34,238
      That pile                 
will make you smile.            
                Avocado mayo.   

530
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,574
And now we're gonna go          
 to the panini press.           

531
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:37,708
                 Absolutely.    

532
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:40,444
              Just gonna cut it 
                on the bias.    

533
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,645
               Get our plate.   

534
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,148
          Gonna serve it        
  with a little tomatillo salsa.

535
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:46,284
     Big torta.                 

536
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:52,056
       The flavor               
that's going on in here,        

537
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:54,391
     you're not getting         
a big fried-chicken sandwich.   

538
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:55,459
                   Right.       

539
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:58,663
       You're getting           
a thin, crisp, tender chicken   

540
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,065
using the bean spread --        
         genius.                

541
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,933
       The arugula              
and the tomatillo salsa,        

542
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,201
            I mean,             
it's what ties it all together. 

543
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,937
It's really good, man.          
               Appreciate it.   

544
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,407
    Anything with black bean,   
             I love.            

545
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,275
  It's got that little peppery  
    flavor with the arugula.    

546
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:12,410
          Your chicken milanesa.

547
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,944
  I would give this place a 10. 

548
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:16,213
   FIERI: Maybe that's because  
 Joe and John learned the ropes 

549
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,749
   from a true restaurant vet.  

550
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,284
 That's right, their dad, Nick. 

551
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,685
     You've been in the business
            for how long?       

552
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,287
   Since I was 14.              

553
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:26,023
It's one of the greatest joys   
 a parent can have in life,     

554
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,491
to have your children           
   do what you did              

555
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,560
and be really successful        
         at it.                 

556
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:32,029
  There is a wait all the time, 
but you just have to be patient.

557
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,564
      You just have to know     
     that it's gonna happen.    

558
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,566
      And once it happens,      
        you're in heaven.       

559
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,268
   It's rockstar.               
   Nice job, Chef.              

560
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:43,307
        So, that's it for       
   this trip, but don't worry.  

561
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:46,377
 There's plenty more "Triple D" 
  joints all over the country!  

562
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:48,245
     I'll be looking for you    
            next week           

563
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,047
