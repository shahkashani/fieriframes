  Beautiful.                    

334
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,047
             And we'll slide it 
                in the oven.    

335
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,249
90 seconds. And what kind of    
wood are we using in the oven?  

336
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:52,250
               Pecan hickory.   

337
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,853
     Easy peasy.                

338
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,788
 But gives so svelte.

              Drizzle it over.  

344
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:09,000

    Can't have enough garlic.

on point, with that.

    and the Parmesan cheese.

Okay. You mix these up.

          in the oven.          

395
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,563
       Next up, we have my      
 great-grandma's marinara sauce.

396
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:46,765
        We'll do a little       
           olive oil.           

397
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,232
   One short rib.               

398
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,368
 Once it's seared up, then we're
     gonna just take it out.    

399
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,603
        Why?                    

400
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,704
               That's the way   
       Grandma Lina would do it.

401
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:53,838
          We'll add it          
            back in.            

402
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,239
         Garlic. Onions.        

403
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,307
 Get it cooked down.            

404
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,042
 We're not open yet.

    We're making                
  Grandma's sauce.              

406
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,312
      Hold on.                  

407
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,114
 People are getting             
all antsy dancey out there.     

408
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,450
   Tomato paste, tomato sauce,  
      two cans of water in.     

409
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,853
Wait a second. When did         
the bird come into play?        

410
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,322
            The bird?           
The toucan.                     

411
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,723
  Thank you, folks.             
I'll be here all week.          

412
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,392
 Try the meatballs.             

413
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:17,061
The short rib goes back in.

      the red pepper flake,     

415
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,999
          black pepper,         
        four bay leaves.        

416
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,002
      Bring that to a boil.     
         Let it simmer.         

417
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,603
      And then, we're gonna     
    put the meatballs in it.    

418
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:26,738
Really?                         
            Yes, sir.           

419
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,473
             It cooks for about 
            another eight hours.

420
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,407
  You putting it in             
    a double cup?               

421
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,475
   A little Parm.               

422
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,943
         Top if off with        
          a basil leaf.         

423
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,146
    Look at that.               

424
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:39,217
Mmm. Delicious, and tender,     
     and moist.                 

425
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,418
    Great sauce.                

426
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,287
The little sprinkle of the      
Parmesan right at the end.      

427
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,422
 That fresh basil...            

428
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,224
  hits that sauce,              
  and just blooms.              

429
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:47,558
And that's a good amount        
     of garlic.                 

430
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,160
  I'm telling you,              
Grandma taught you right.       

431
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,761
         Great job, sir.        
  -Thank you. I appreciate it.  

432
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,363
    Watch out for               
      this guy.                 

433
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,031
                Nonna's Sauce   
               and Meatballs.   

434
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,366
            -Thanks.            
           -Thank you.          

435
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:58,169
     Just an authentic taste    
   that I can't get enough of.  

436
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,570
         I usually would        
      have to have a straw      

437
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,773
 to get that sauce out of there,

         about the food.        

441
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,246

              I appreciate it.  

443
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,849
For a dude that's not from      
the restaurant business,        

444
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,184
and with the backing of the mom,
you just can't go wrong.

Nice to meet you, Mom.

  FIERI: Coming up in Portland, 
            Oregon...           

449
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,593
       this is the kind of place
               everybody wants  

450
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:23,661
              to have in their  
                neighborhood.

453
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,867
       ...and casting out       
        a few surprises.

455
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,937
        but I definitely        
       would eat all day -      

456

 I'm here in the southwest area 
      of Portland, Oregon,      

460
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,050
      to check out a place      
         where the chef         

461
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,786
   gave from a long background  
     in the corporate world.    

462
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:51,255
  And finally, one day, he said 
    he was gonna break free.    

463
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,391
    That's right. He's gonna    
   do things on his own terms,  

464
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,658
     do things his own way.     

465

    from his favorite seasons   

466
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,396
    and his favorite regions.   
         Wait a second.         

467
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,997
      I'd be a perfect name     
        for a restaurant.

  This is Seasons and Region's  
         Seafood Grill.

Salmon salad on the fly.        

470
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:10,875
    The seafood is so fresh,    
   and it's always delicious.   

471
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:12,543
  WOMAN: There's a lot of good  
    mom and pops in Portland,   

472
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,478

          one of them.          

473
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,014
   Is just out of this world.

             FIERI:             
      And out of the box --     

475
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,351
   which is how chef and owner  
       Greg Schwab rolls.       

476
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,019
  We take the best              
   of the season,               

477
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,288
  and we use world              
  cuisine recipes.              

478
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,557
So, what that means is that     
we can do whatever we want.     

479
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,226
         If you want to make it,
               you can do it.   

480
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:29,694
               You can do it.

         MAN: He kind of        
         switches it up         

482
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,830
 depending on what's available, 
     which is pretty great.     

483
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:35,632
   But I haven't had a better   
    cioppino in Portland yet.   

484
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,568
    Cioppino with crab cake.    
        Pick up, please.        

485
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,238
    The fish in the cioppino    
     is always super fresh.     

486
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,707
    The sauce is outrageous.    
      It's got great spice.     

487
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,709
         It's got great         
        depth of flavor.        

488
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:45,843
               So what are we   
               going to make?

                    Okay.       
    Okay.                       

491
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,582
  We're gonna make              
our cioppino broth first.       

492

more fish flavor, there.

Clam stock, tomato paste, diced 
tomato, crushed tomato, water.  

500
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,479
      How long is this all gonna
               cook down for?   

501
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,680
     Two hours.                 

502
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:25,682
    I assume that you're able to
         just mix in the seafood

503
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,485
 that you like when you have it,
              when it's fresh.  

504
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,886
Yeah.                           
      What are we running today?

505
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:31,222
We're going to top it with      
a Dungeness crab cake.          

506
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,823
                 A crab cake    
                goes on top.    

507
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,559
   Yes.                         
            That I haven't seen.

     And now...                 

511
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:46,237
              Local Dungeness.  
  Yep.                          

512
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,172
Just a little binder            
 of the breadcrumbs.            

513
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,574
Make that into one big crab cake
for me, and that'll be flamingo.

514
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,643
So, we're gonna give our ring   
just a little spray.            

515
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:55,513
Some panko, some crab,          
and then panko on top.          

516
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,514
                 We're gonna    
                pan-fry this.   

517
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,115
      Actually,                 
we're gonna deep-fry it.        

518
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,116
              Time to build it. 

519
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,185
 A little clarified             
   butter, salmon,              

520
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:05,923
rockfish, salt spring mussels,  
white wine, lemon juice.        

521
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,926
       Some of the cioppino base
               that we built.   

522
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,862
                 Fantastic.     
              Mussels are open. 

523
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,597
A little more salt, pepper,     

524
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,798
  a little parsley.             

525
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,332
            It smells fantastic.

526
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,402
Crab cake, chive on top.        
And that's all she wrote.       

527
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,472
                     ♪♪         

528
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:24,341
             That's really good.
        That broth is fantastic.

529
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,876
             Typically, when you
        have cioppino, you know,

530
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,145
  you'd like to have some bread,
   or something, to dip it into.

531
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,015
       And this crab cake on top
           is perfectly crunchy,

532
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:35,553
     which would be kind of like
 the crusty bread going into it.

533
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,620
          Works incredibly well.

534
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,888
              Thank you, chef,  
              for wrecking it.  

535
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,156
             'Cause this is what
          I'm gonna expect, now,

536
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,826
             is a little salty, 
      crunchy crab right on top.

537
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,160
             Something I didn't 
                 see coming,    

538
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,896
              but I definitely  
            would eat all day --

                Starting now.   

541
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:49,967
       We've got cioppino.      

542
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,302
      MAN: Oh, the cioppino     
            is good.            

543
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,638
          The crab cake         
          is delicious.         

544
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,773
    It's always so flavorful.   
         Can't be beat.         

545
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,508
 Chicken and waffle.            
  Pick up, please.              

546
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,710
     This is a go-to place,     
       because Greg knows       

547
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:00,978
          where to get          
         the best food.         

548
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,714
        Everything's super fresh
            and locally sourced.

549
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,316
        Greg actually has       
          some gardens,         

550
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:06,651
        so you get fresh        
           vegetables.          

551
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:07,852
 I've got 14 acres.             

552
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,253
   We've got four               
    greenhouses.                

553
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,455
                 Seriously?     
        You're an over-achiever.

554
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,589
        What else you got       
         the repertoire?        

555
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,459
 Dungeness crab leg             
and spinach risotto.            

556
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,794
 Risotto coming up.             

557
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:19,930
    The risotto is one of the   
 highlights of this restaurant. 

558
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,866
          It's bright,          
          and colorful,         

559
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:23,800
          combined with         
      the fresh crab meat,      

560
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:26,537
           is just an           
       amazing experience.      

561
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:27,538
         So give me the rundown.
   Okay.                        

562
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,941
       Butter,                  
arborio rice, onion.            

563
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,143
                 Next up...     

564
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:35,146
Fresh thyme, black pepper,      
   fresh rosemary.              

565
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,414
   Chicken stock,               
      saffron.                  

566
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,016
                 White wine     
               in there, too.   

567
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,083
      Oh, yeah.                 

568
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,085
           Was that an "oh yeah"
                 I just got?    

569
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,453
     That was an                
     "oh, yeah."                

570
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,754
      Parmesan                  
     and butter.                

571
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:44,822
                Now, what are   
                  we into.      

572
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:47,424
  We're gonna make              
 our shellfish stock            

573
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,226
for our crab bisque.            

574
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,761
                 I like it.     
A little olive oil.             

575
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:55,966
Carrots, diced onions, celery,  
shrimp shells, crab shells.     

576
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,702
  Add chicken stock             
      to that.                  

577
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:59,236
             Let this cook down 
                  how long?     

578
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,771
   Hour and a half              
    to two hours.               

579
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:02,840
     Strain it.                 
Good to go for our bisque.      

580
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:06,577
To that, we're gonna add        
tomato paste, cayenne pepper,   

581
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:11,916
black pepper guy, white pepper, 
thyme, rosemary, paprika,       

582
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:14,585
a little bit of fish sauce to   
give it a little umami in there.

583
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,853
              Loves his mommy.  

584
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:20,057
We're gonna add a sweet rice    
flour roux, brandy, cream,      

585
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,459
 throw butter at it.            

586
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,260
                   Got it.      
             Let's see it, chef.

587
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,395
A little bit of butter.         

588
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,997
Rose broker, a carrot,          
 caramelized onion,             

589
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,201
 roasted red pepper             
our saffron risotto,            

590
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:32,003
 our spinach puree.             

591
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,537
          Hurry up, before I eat
                all the crab.   

592
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,339
 Butter, crab legs.             

593
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,275
       That's how many crab legs
           come with this order?

594
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:38,743
      That's 10                 
     crab legs.                 

595
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:41,345
    Our risotto,                
Dungeness crab legs.            

596
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,081
 There's our bisque,            
    blanc sauce,                

597
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,018
and a little radish sprout      
     to finish.                 

598
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,151
   Mangia, mangia.              

599
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,753
            I don't know whether
         to eat it or get in it.

600
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,757
                     ♪♪         

601
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,558
        I like the little veggie
         component inside of it,

602
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,027
          of the roasted carrots
     and the caramelized onions.

603
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:01,231
  We've got the spinach into the
  risotto, which is really nice.

604
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,499
                 The bisque     
                is dynamite.    

605
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:06,037
         The buerre blanc really
           complements the crab.

606
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,972
          It's rich and filling,
                 not heavy.     

607
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,640
             I'll have two more 
               orders, please.  

608
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:10,774
  Coming right up.              

609
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,443
     SERVER: Got a Dungeness    
        crab leg risotto.       

610
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:13,978
   This risotto is incredible.  

611
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,513
   the spinach comes it, like,  
 a really nice undertone, there.

612
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,448
    The crab is really fresh,   

613
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,384
       really good variety      
           of flavors.          

614
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,519
   Sole Parmesan.               

615
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,321
 -What do you think of the food?
        -It's delicious.        

616
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,255
     It's one of my favorite    
     restaurants to come to.    

617
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,658
    It's Southwest Portland's   
       little hidden gem.       

618
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,393
       This is the kind of place
         everybody wants to have

619
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,528
          in their neighborhood.

620
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,997
           -Thank you.          
           -Well done.          

621
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,998
      Was that a road trip,     
            or what?            

622
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,334
        But don't worry.        

623
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,802
   There's plenty more joints   
  all over this great country.  

624
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,872
     I'll be looking for you    
    next time on "Triple D."    

625
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,140
              All right, Mayor, 
         to get this straight --

626
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:46,677
      to get a Diners, Drive-Ins
      and Dives Guy Fieri Street

627
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,880
        here in Oklahoma City --
        what's it gonna cost me?

628
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:52,950
     Just our new high-speed    
    first-responders vehicle    

629
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,085
             Sounds good to me. 

630
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,486
                  Engine 12     
                is en route.
