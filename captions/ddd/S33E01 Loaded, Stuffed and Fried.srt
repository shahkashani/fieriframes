 the seared meat out

is that bone marrow.

sandwich called Serres.

00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,710
      Stuffed oysters down.     

353
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,712
  Grilled stuff oysters are one 
   of my favorite things here.  

354
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,515
    The flavor's just unlike    
 anything I've ever had before, 

355
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,317
         it's so unique.        

356
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,451
   FIERI: Okay. So, what's next?

357
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:35,519
We're gonna make oysters.       

358
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,589
  In the stuffing,              
we put shrimp, octopus,         

359
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:38,523
and some blue crab meat.        

360
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:39,724
       That's my kind of oyster.

361
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,926
  We're gonna cook              
some Spanish octopus.           

362
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,728
We're gonna need some mirepoix  
and some fresh garlic.          

363
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,130
Comes all the way from Spain.   

364
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,732
They put them in these          
   steel barrels,               

365
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,134
bond just all, you know --      

366
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:51,202
             So, it's coming in 
               pre-tenderized.  

367
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,338
And we're just gonna cook it    
for about 20 minutes.           

368
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,005
      -And it's good to go.     
 -We're gonna cook some shrimp. 

369
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,942
      -In that same broth.      
   -This is all about flavor.

             -Okay.             
      -Cut this up, though.     

372
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:05,483
Chop our shrimp, onions,        
jalapeños, cilantro.            

373
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,018
          Everything's gonna raw
           when it goes in this?
Yes.                            

374
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,420
 It's not gonna cook            
all the way through so...       

375
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:10,822

             you're bringing in?

380
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:21,365
Come from Ensenada, Mexico.     

381
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,167
      They are                  
from the Kumiai family.         

382
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,569
They're, like, really nice      
  and brightening.              

383
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,838
            -Got it.            
  -And we get some of that mix. 

384
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,839
              How many of those 
             come with an order?

385
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,707

387

00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,664
  -How long's it take to cook?  
       -About four hours.       

472
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,065
 I can put on there             
what type of meat I want?       
                           Yeah.

473
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,334
    I want to see               
what the brisket's all about.   

474
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,803
            Big old, fat brisket
right here, we're gonna trim it,

475
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,605
    and we need a perfect shape.

476
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,607
And where did you learn         
this crazy technique?           

477
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:50,808
           It was a lot of trial
                 and error.     

478
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,410
  -You've been on trial a lot?  
           -[ Laughs ]          

479
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,011
Now salt and pepper city.       

480
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,213
             This is ready to go
         in the smoker 18 hours.

481
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,416
            Between 250 and 275.

482
00:16:58,418 --> 00:16:59,416
Make it happen, captain.        

483
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,685
                 All right.     
            Let's make a potato.

484
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,619
             I'm gonna roll it, 
                soften it up.   

485
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,021
Beat it up is more like it.     

486
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,157
   You know, it's just a garnish
               at this point.   

487
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,291
    Some butter.                

488
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:11,228
           Salt, pepper, cheese,
        sour cream, some chives,

489
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,364
      and some brisket -- that's
  a quarter pound right there --

490
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,768
   some beans, and our jalapeño.

491
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,303
  Anybody ever eat              
  the whole thing?              
                           Yeah.

492

  do you play for?

494
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,243
There's a lot more going on     
       in this                  

495
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,978
than what most people           
     would call                 

496
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,115
     the average                
stuffed baked potato.           

497
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:34,518
Oh, toreado is one of           
my new favorite things.         

498
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,120
  One thing I like              
 on your brisket --             

499
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:39,524
it's not overly smokey,         
  nicely seasoned,              

500
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:41,859
     good bark,                 
beans are delicious.            

501
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,394
The whole thing is a package    
     deal, man,                 

502
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,930
  besides the fact              
that it's not a human size.     

503
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:48,132
It's like four human sizes.     

504
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:50,334
             -Yeah.             
           -Excellent.          

505
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,735
  All right, Jesse,             
   do your thing.               

506
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,872
  When I'm hungry, I definitely 
     get the stuffed potato.    

507
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:57,408
         Great flavors,         
        great zest to it.       

508
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,811
The brisket is just consistently
      moist in the middle.      

509
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,880
          -Incredible.          
   -You've had good barbecue.   

510
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:04,615
             -Yeah.             
        -In a strip mall?       

511
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,551
  This used to be a food truck, 
            actually.           

512
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:07,818
     No, this is                
a strip mall, buddy.            

513
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,153
  You can't tell me             
it was a food truck.            

514
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,155
I can tell, there's no wheels   
      on this.                  

515
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,357
   But before the food truck,   
      Rich was in the Navy,     

516
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,427
         then came Texas        
    where he married Suzanne    

517
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,628
 and fell in love with the cue. 

518
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,263
   I just started playing around
                with a smoker   

519
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,965
               and then I just  
              became obsessed.  

520
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:24,168
    For Rich, it's not a job,   
this is the passion of his life.

521
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,771
  He wanted to build this place 
        to reflect Texas.       

522
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,706
    -What are we doing next?    
   -We can make some sausage.   

523
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,707
     -What kind of sausage?     
         -Texas hot gut.        

524
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,109
           -Hot what?           
              -Gut.             

525
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,779
I've heard Texas red hots,      
never heard of a Texas hot gut. 

526
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,182
   Sausage is very delicious,   
       and it has a nice,       

527
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:39,717
  snapping crunch of the skin.  

528
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,053
        The flavors, man,       
       they're all there.       

529
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,722
 All right, so, we're gonna make
         our mix of spices here.

530
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:46,524
             -Okay.             
-I like to start with the water.

531
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:48,526
That's one of my favorite       
       spices.                  

532
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:49,994
       We're gonna make a paste.

00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,997
              Garlic, turmeric, 
      black pepper, kosher salt.

Here comes the hot gut.

               No. [ Laughs ]   
 Dry milk, and some curing salt.

538
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,675
  Okay, does it say             
  hot gut up there?             

539
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:07,345
         No, it's a Texas thing.
             It's kind of known.

540
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:10,414
No, what does it say?           
It says sausage link.

       Rib trimmings and brisket
  trimmings and just enough fat.

547

   those trimmings

going in the smoker?

little sausage, there.          

569
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:06,803
    That's meaty.               
No filler, all thriller.        

570
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,339
Good amount of heat,            
  not over the top.             

571
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:12,810
And a good snap on that casing.

The green chile cheese rice,    
  that's dangerous.

   stay away from.              
                      Thank you.

00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,221
     The sausage is so good.    

578
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:26,123
 It's that's nice, equal balance
        of not too spicy        

579
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,092
and it does have a little sweet.

580

          And sausage?

about it, we're just gonna      

582
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,096
give it the thumbs up.          

583
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,565
How about double thumbs up?     
It's all about this guy.        

584
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,966
    Quarter pound of brisket.   

585
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,169
    Desert Oak has definitely   
        the best barbecue       

586
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:39,570
        here in El Paso.        

587
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,239
   Just a delectable delight.   

588
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,906
This is the real deal.          

589
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,643
Everything that you're doing    
you're doing really mindfully,  

590
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:47,845
and that is what it takes       
to be a great at barbecue.      

591
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,314
           -Nice job.           
           -Thank you.          

592
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:53,451

like that was the whole show.   

598
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,532
           Mmm. I can do better.

599
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:11,001
    -I've done these before.    
              -Wow.             

600
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,602
It's a whole different show.
