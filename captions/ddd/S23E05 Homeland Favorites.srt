the boiled jalapeños,           

76
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:02,847
 garlic, the onions,            
   salt, avocados.              

77
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,849
       And use                  
the immersion blender.          

78
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,819
Okay, then start pouring        
    the oil slow.               

79
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:11,189

    Yeah, we do.                

116
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,329
         They don't cut the meat
          the same way in Mexico

117
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,397
               that we cut it   
           in the United States.

118
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,665
     Yeah, we do                
a totally different cut.        

119
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,733
 Majority of everything is gonna
              be cut real thin. 

120
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,068
That's correct, yeah.           

121
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,271
           There you go. There's
      your Mexican butchery 101.

122
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:33,605
             That's all I know, 
                 by the way.    

123
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,140
   Torta ranchera.              

124
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:37,142
  MAN: Well, there's obviously  
 some very knowledgeable people 

125
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,744
      who prepare this food     
  because it's done very well.  

126
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,012
  Carnitas tamales.             

127
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,680
    The tamales are awesome.    

128
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,549
       They're very soft,       
     but with a bold flavor.    

129
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,084
           And we're still gonna
                make tamales?   

130
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,353
             When we come back, 
     we're hanging out at Andale

131
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,756
      in Minnesota of all places
  having some bomb Mexican food.

132
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,057
                We'll see you   
              in a little bit.  

133
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:57,796
                     ♪♪         

134
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:04,202
 Welcome back. We're hanging out
   here in Richfield, Minnesota.

135
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,637
                  I got to      
           tell you something --

136
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,873
     I've been to some taquerias
             around the country,

137
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,875
              but my crew from  
  "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives"

138
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:11,610
          said this is the place
           you got to check out.

139
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,277
We'll get off the plane         
   in Minneapolis               

140
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,679
and head straight here          

141
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,348
    because it's                
the taste of home for us.       

142
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,549
         It's just like         
        the tacos we had        

143
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:18,950
        when we were all        
    down in Mexico together.    

144
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:21,753
    The al pastor, off the hook,
           and now we're making?

145
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:22,754
    The carnitas.               

146
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,222
           We're making carnitas
                for tamales,    

147
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:27,159
       and the hood's on because
   this is smoking, this is hot,

148
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,895
        and you got to have this
   cauldron to make this happen.

149
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:32,230
  We're gonna start             
with searing the meat.          

150
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,699
            And what kind of fat
                are we using?   

151
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:34,833
        Lard.                   

152
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,100
              We're using lard. 

153
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,736
                 So, now we     
             seared it all off. 

154
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,238
        Cola.                   

155
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,440
                You got to do   
               a little cola.   

156
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:42,841
            You know why? Color.

157
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,042
      Cinnamon.                 

158
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,243
                  I've made     
             a lot of carnitas. 

159
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,312
  I've never put cinnamon in it.
              I like this one.  

160
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:48,913
      Oranges.                  

161
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,248
      And salt.                 

162
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,784
   We're gonna put              
the pork stomachs in there.     

163
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,786
         Boy, I hope they're not
       out of pork stomach today

164
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,454
            when I go to Andale.
 [ Chuckles ]                   

165
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,658
  We're gonna cover             
 with the pork skin.            

166
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,059
                 More lard?     
       Yeah.                    

167
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,861
              This is awesome.  

168
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,196
              A hot tub of pig. 
     Okay.                      

169
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,733
And we're gonna let it cook     
   for six hours.               

170
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,936
           How often do you make
             this much carnitas?

171
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,136
 We make every day.             

172
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,272
            Every day this much?
Every day this much. Yes.       

173
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,609
The carnitas are ready.         

174
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,678
Now we're gonna pull them       
   and shred them.              

175
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,946
  We got the masa.              

176
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,347
             And what is the red
                in the masa?    

177
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:23,415
Guajillo pepper sauce.          

178
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,150
               The masa's hot.  
             It's almost cooked.

179
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:27,152
           Is that how it's made
    where you're from in Mexico?

180
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:28,286
That's the way we do it.        

181
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:29,620
               You do it hot?   
     Yeah.                      

182
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:31,289
             I'm telling you -- 
  learn something new every day.

183
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,423
                  I had to      
              come to Minnesota 

184
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,225
               to learn about   
           cooking masa halfway?

185
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,095
      Corn husk                 
  soaked in water.              

186
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,697
      The masa.                 

187
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,298
     Some pork.                 

188
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,567
            That's a big tamale,
                    boss.       
It is, yeah.                    

189
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,236
              How many of these 
             do you make a week?

190
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,370
     Like 1,000.                

191
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:46,437
               How many people  
                 work here?     

192
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,973
                Is this like    
             the Keebler elves? 

193
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:48,840
        Yeah.                   

194
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:49,907
                  How long      
           are they gonna steam?

195
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,742
      One hour.                 

196
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,511
                    Okay.       

197
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,846
                Look at that!   

198
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,515
         This isn't my birthday.

199
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:59,116
                 All right,     
    I'll try to eat all of them.

200
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,319
 And do we serve anything on it,
                 or just --     

201
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,921
 No, just like that.            

202
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,723
          That's probably one of
               the most fla--   

203
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,059
if not the most flavorful tamale
               I've ever had.   

204
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,529
        I'm savoring every bite.

205
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:13,064
              Most of the time, 
         the masa has no flavor.

206
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,534
        You're waiting to get to
        the center of the tamale

207
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:16,935
              to get the meat,  
             to get the filling.

208
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,471
Yeah, we get the flavor         
to the masa and also the meat.  

209
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:20,805
               I'm converted.   

210
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:24,643
           If there was a county
     in Flavortown named Tamale,

211
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:27,012
          that would be it, man.
                 That is it.    

212
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,882
             WOMAN:             
 They're moist, very flavorful. 

213
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,617
    They're the best tamales    
       in the Twin Cities.      

214
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,886
        The tamales have        
     very good consistency,     

215
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:35,954
      especially the masa.      

216
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,022
                This is where   
        the "Triple D" crew eats

217
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,758
       when they're not shooting
 "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives."

218
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,092
  This is how often             
    we come here.               

219
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,827
We've all filled out these cards
probably three or four times.   

220
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:43,962
    We have our punch cards.    

221
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,696
      What do you think makes it
                  so great?     

222
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,765
We've been to so many           
restaurants with you            

223
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,635
 that when you find             
the real deal, you recognize it.

224
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,771
   Authentic Mexican food that  
 you don't need a passport for. 

225
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,774
This is a great place, cheap and
 fast, and it's just great food.

226
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,576
      This is just perfect.     

227

 about 10 minutes from downtown.

 Now, in this little place, man,

260
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,658
  I like to call it             
a modern Greek restaurant.      

261
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,594
   It's not heavy,              
its not overly oiled.           

262
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:24,062
    We have some                
traditional recipes,            

263
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,129
but then we're doing            

264
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,598
    a little bit                
of some French influence.       

265
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,933
      You get a plate here      
 that just looks like something 

266
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,134

   Okay, I got the lamb ribs.

           on a plate.          

269

               You do not hear  
                of lamb ribs.   

270
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,341
        So, are these spare ribs
                or back ribs?   

271
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:37,475
 These are shoulder,            
      actually.                 

272
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:38,610
               I like the way   
             it already starts. 

273
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:39,744
               So, we're gonna  
                make a brine?   

274
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,613
     Yes. First,                
we're gonna start with water.   

275
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,549
    Salt, sugar.                

276
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,150
We're doing cinnamon.           
                        Okay.   

277
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,486
      Allspice,                 
then we're gonna do nutmeg,     

278
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,822
  clove, coriander,             

279
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,024
star anise, caraway,            

280
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,059
then we're just gonna           
     stir it up.                

281
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,496
       Gonna brine for 24 hours?

282
00:09:58,498 --> 00:09:59,731
   24 hours, yeah.              

283
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,567
         What are we making now?

284
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,035
     It's a fig                 
   barbecue sauce.              
                       Okay.    

285
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,037
  We're gonna start             
with the wine mixture,          

286
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:09,441
which is Sherry, port,          
and just a straight red wine.   

287
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,176
  We're gonna take              
a house-made ketchup.           

288
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:14,245
      With some                 
 fun, little spices.            

289
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,180
             Take that all day. 

290
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,380
Yeah, it is pretty yummy.       

291
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,450
  And then we have              
    a fig puree,                

292
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,784
      macerated                 
and cooked in port wine.        

293
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,052
    Brown sugar.                

294
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:23,788
  We got cinnamon,              
      allspice,                 

295
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,324
  vanilla extract,              
cayenne pepper, and salt.       

296
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,794
     The name of the restaurant,
                   Axios.       

297
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,595
       Axios.                   
Axios means "worthy."           

298
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,131
  We're making food             
   that's worthy.               

299
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,265
 I feel it's worthy,            

300
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,933
and my customers, hopefully,    
they feel it's worthy.          

301
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,935
And then we're just gonna       
put it on the stove.            

302
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,203
           Let this reduce down.

303
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,739
45 minutes to an hour.          

304
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:43,675
All right, Guy, so these        
have been brining overnight,    

305
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:46,277
and we're basically gonna put   
together our braising liquids.  

306
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,613
   Diced tomatoes,              
    tomato juice,               

307
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:51,816
    dry red wine,               
    some carrots,               

308
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,685
   chopped onions,              
     bay leaves,                

309
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,887
   thyme, garlic,               
    and rosemary.               

310
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,155
          How long is this gonna
                 braise for?    

311
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,424
Three and a half hours          
    at about 375.               

312
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:00,558
                   Got it.      

313
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,227
All right, so we got            
our lamb ribs on the grill.     

314
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:03,695
     We're just                 
 finishing them off.            

315
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:06,831
   Just gonna take              
our fig barbecue sauce.         

316
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,034
Then we're gonna take           
our mashed potatoes.            

317
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,971
             That barbecue sauce
                is gangster.    

318
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,438
A little bit of veg.            

319
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,707
We have onions, leeks,          

320
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,241
     mushrooms,                 
and a little bit of fennel.     

321
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,276
              Digging all that. 

322
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,546
             Oh, that's pretty.

                    Mmm.        

324
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,518
              Where's that been 
                all my life?    

325
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,687
           Roasted garlic, feta,
              mashed potatoes.  

326
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:31,756
              Veggies have got  
                great crunch.   

327
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,127
                    Mmm.

     [ Muffled ] As you can see,
     I'm really not enjoying it.

329
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,332
                 The char --    
               nice and meaty.  

330
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,267
                A little kiss   
      of that cinnamon in there.

331
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,468
              Mmm.              

332
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,804
              Anybody that says 
           they don't like lamb,

333

 well, here's your lamb antidote

336
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:52,743
   The lamb ribs are fabulous.  

337
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,212
        Great char flavor       
         from the grill.        

338
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,081
     The barbecue fig sauce     
      is perfect sweetness      

339
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,950
            to offset           
   the savoriness of the lamb.

Kataifi's actually the name

565
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,302
              leaving the fond  
               on the bottom.   

566
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:32,637
         We're gonna make a roux

567
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:36,573
       with butter, oil, nutmeg,
              chipotle powder,  

568
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,376
            and then we're gonna
           caramelize the sugar.

569
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:40,578
         House salt, and pepper.

570
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,314
That's a good-looking roux.     

571
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,850
               Whisk in flour   
            and then whole milk.

572
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,784
                That's gonna    
               come to a boil   

573
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,387
    and get all thick and bubbly
                 and happy.     

574
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,055
Let's plate this up!            
                     All right. 

575
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:55,059
              Here's our gravy, 
                  chorizo.      

576
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,728
We just throw it right up on -- 
a little on the floor.          

577
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,597
                 [ Laughs ]     
                 All right.     

578
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,832
                   And now      
             cheesy hash browns.

579
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,667
 Cheesy hash browns.            
That's how it comes out.        

580
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,036
                   That is      
          our biscuit and gravy.

581
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,473
  The biscuits are              
  nice and tender.              

582
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:10,675
   Gravy's thick.               

583
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,810
This chorizo -- may be          
that tequila you put in there   

584
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,245
    or something,               
 but it is spot on.             

585
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,614
The cheesy hash browns --       
That's the bite right there.    

586
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:19,417
    Outstanding.                

587
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,621
   Never had really good gravy  
     until I came to Joy's.     

588
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,889
The biscuits and gravy --       
It's always undefeated.         

589
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,224
                 Undefeated.    

590
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,493
         MAN: It's just         
    that great Southern feel.   

591
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:30,627
           It's love.           

592
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:31,895
    Awesome job.                
                    Thank you.  

593
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,997
    Nicely done.

       when they're not shooting
 "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives."
