1
00:00:01,902 --> 00:00:04,003
   Hey, there. I'm Guy Fieri,
     and we're rolling out,

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:06,505
 looking for America's greatest
  diners, drive-ins, and dives.

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,240
          This trip...
Wow!

4
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:11,844
   ...we're serving up a true
    Flavortown flavor fest...

5
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,812
  That's why we do
     "Triple D."

6
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:17,816
...like a farm-to-table treasure
  in Sebastopol, California...

7
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,785
      making bomb bacon...

8
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:21,387
        They are the Smithsonian
                  of swine.

9
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:23,355
...and blowing up the waffles...

10
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,124
               That's a dish.

11
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:28,394
     ...an empanada emporium
   going big in San Antonio...

12
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:30,396
That's a lotta empanada.

13
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:32,231
      ...and a legit taste
          of Chicago...

14
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,832
                This, I hear,
              is the real deal.

15
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,634
 ...deep in the heart of Texas.

16
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:37,369
        Ohh!

17
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,204
           That's all
     right here, right now,

18
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,807
 on "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

19
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:55,454
          So, I'm here
     in Northern California

20
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:57,122
        on the west side
        of Sonoma County

21
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,058
     in a great little town
       known as Sebastopol

22
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,426
    to check out a restaurant

23
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:01,894
       that's owned by two
     of my favorite chefs --

24
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,096
  one you've seen on "Triple G"
        a bunch of times.

25
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:06,999
   And these two are all about
  community and farm-to-table.

26
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:10,536
          This is it --
      Zazu Kitchen + Farm.

27
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:11,870
                Pimento mac!

28
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,539
      It's one of the most
     innovative restaurants

29
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:14,940
    in all of Sonoma County.

30
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,308
  Kimchi tacos.

31
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,644
We have a lot of great
  farm-to-table concepts,

32
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:21,246
   but I don't think anything
  is quite as special as Zazu.

33
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,614
    John, I need
  a butcher board.

34
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,716
And the owners
 are willing to prove it.

35
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,752
My friend Duskie Estes is a chef

36
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:29,388
    who's competed and judged
    on "Guy's Grocery Games."

37
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,522
     And her husband, John,

38
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:33,258
        is the real deal
    and a charcuterie champ.

39
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,827
               But how do you
               describe Zazu?

40
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,296
  Authentically farm-to-table,
    'cause we farm ourselves.

41
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:38,797
     We raise our own goats,
          sheep, pigs,

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,199
        chickens, ducks,
         rabbits, and --

43
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,600
              Can you say that
              five times fast?

44
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:42,668
          -Yeah, I can.
         -Probably not.

45
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,002
I n't think
              she can, either.

46
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,704
  But we have two food styles.

47
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:48,540
He does rustic Northern Italian,
   and I do playful Americana.

48
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,309
            "Playful Americana."

49
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:51,910
 She didn't use the
 word "whimsy." That
would've been worse.

50
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:53,178
               Oh, thank you.
              Thank you, John.

51
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,747
And sometimes
 the rustic and fun collide,

52
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,850
 like in this crazy concoction.

53
00:01:57,852 --> 00:01:59,785
            Black Pig
   bacon-in-the-batter waffle.

54
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:03,322
  Bourbon gelato, bacon toffee,
  bacon baked into the waffles.

55
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:05,257
   Absolutely guilty pleasure.

56
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:06,625
                 What are we
              gonna make today?

57
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,127
-A bacon-in-the-batter waffle...
             -Okay.

58
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:09,995
       ...bourbon gelato,
          bacon toffee.

59
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,997
- It's a half-hour show.

60
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,266
       John, you're gonna start.
         We're gonna make bacon.

61
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:15,467
Brown sugar, kosher salt.

62
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,903
Chili flakes 'cause everything
should have some heat.

63
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:19,805
    Black pepper.
And then the curing salts.

64
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,740
  Rub this pork belly with this.
       How long is it gonna sit?

65
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:23,575
Two weeks, sometimes three,
  and that's really

66
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:26,178
what distinguishes bacon we make
from other people's bacon.

67
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,647
It just sort of concentrates
 all that goodness.

68
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:33,085
Then they will go into a smoker
for 12 hours on applewood chips.

69
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:35,888
This area of Sebastopol is known
      for the Gravenstein apple.

70
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,422
             Is that the reason
           for the apple, or...?

71
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,591
Yeah, so, the fruitwoods
tend to be softer and sweeter

72
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,126
   than something
like hickory or oak,

73
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,461
      which is
a super-smoky smoke.

74
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:43,929
   -It's a super-smoky smoke?
             -Super.

75
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,497
       -Super-smoky smoke.
        -It's whimsical.

76
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,832
               Not hitting it
             with heavy hickory.

77
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,233
Yeah, we're not trying
   to cover up --

78
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:49,468
                 Hitting it
             with heavy hickory.

79
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,569
          Look at that.
          The Triple H?

80
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,037
         -There you go.
         -Bacon toffee.

81
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,973
Sugar, water, butter.
 All of it together.

82
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,341
           -What temp?
              -300.

83
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,576
          -Bacon salt?
              -Yes.

84
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,444
-Can I just have a bowl of that?
         -Yeah, you can.

85
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,513
I mean, you can have that one.
I got more in the back.

86
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,881
    Spread it out
    on this pan.

87
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,716
       Let it cool, break it up.
              This goes on top.

88
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:05,951
                 What's up next?
         Bourbon gelato.

89
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,419
              Do you guys make
           a lot of gelato here?

90
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:08,587
      Yes, a lot of gelato.

91
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:10,656
        -A lot o' gelato?
           -A lot o'.

92
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:12,658
This is, like, the easiest
thing in the universe.

93
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,992
                 If you have
              a gelato machine.

94
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,894
      -From Bologna, yeah.
        -That's baloney.

95
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:19,198
Milk, sugar, vanilla beans.
 Bring it to a boil.

96
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,732
      I'll take
the vanilla beans out,

97
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,768
and then I'll temper it
into the egg mixture.

98
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,437
The yolks just kind of
bump up the fat. Bourbon.

99
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,607
       This goes into the gelato
              machine how long?
12 minutes.

100
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:29,942
     The only thing we have left
       to do is make the waffle.

101
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:31,276
             -Yeah.
         -Are you ready?

102
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,744
           I'm ready.
         Are you ready?

103
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,947
 You don't ask, "Are you ready?"
               if I was ready.

104
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,583
    -I might be ready faster.
        -Make the waffle.

105
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,585
      Buttermilk, egg yolks
       from our chickens.

106
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:40,852
                 Local eggs.
                 Oh, really?

107
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,521
            -Butter.
             -Flour.

108
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:43,855
                  Cornmeal.

109
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,958
    Sugar, salt, baking soda,
       and baking powder.

110
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,759
     And we whip the whites.

111
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,294
         Drys into wets.

112
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:50,495
             Whipped egg whites.

113
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,064
 Let's waffle it up.

114
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,131
         Add the bacon.

115
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,633
      Buttermilk waffle --
           first "B."

116
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,768
             -Okay.
 -Second "B" -- bourbon gelato.

117
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,338
 Third "B" -- bacon fat toffee.
           You ready?

118
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,740
            -Please.
          -Maple syrup.

119
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,579
 The bacon inside of the waffle.
       That's the real surprise.

120
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,949
  Because that salt cuts through
         a lot of the sweetness,

121
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,351
       but so does that bourbon.

122
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:13,652
             That bourbon gives
             a nice little tang,

123
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,988
             nice little acidity
                  in there.

124
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,856
                 The gelato
            is not overly sweet.

125
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:21,994
       It's like a deconstructed
   salted caramel ice-cream cone

126
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:23,228
              with bacon on it.

127
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,499
        This is rustic, playful,
                 Americana.

128
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,101
       Whimsy.
 You forgot whimsy.

129
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,403
     Thank you. I appreciate it.
               It's dynamite.

130
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:34,439
         -Bacon waffle.
         -It's amazing.

131
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,009
You get the sweet and the savory
   and the salty all at once.

132
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:39,611
    Two heroes of
Northern California --

133
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,079
We have firefighter Luz,

134
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,548
and we also have the one
and only Evelyn Cheatham,

135
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,218
the leader of a great program
   called W.O.W.,

136
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,754
  working with kids
 and developing them
through the kitchen.

137
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,022
Luz, what do you think?

138
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,623
            The waffle is great.
               It's delicious.

139
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,225
 How do you describe
  this restaurant?

140
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:54,960
The people who started it...

141
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,762
  Well, I would call them nuts
           because --

142
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,463
  Nobody's arguing.

143
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,000
    They won't serve anything
 that's not number-one quality,

144
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,835
         which is crazy,
    but that's this business.

145
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,404
And of course that includes

146
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:07,139
    one of Duskie and John's
         specialties --

147
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,940
  that killer Black Pig bacon.

148
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,842
The pig is the foundation
   of this place,

149
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,912
     and the Black Pig bacon
 that they make is just amazing.

150
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,081
  How many bellies are you going
        through in a month here?

151
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,350
We probably
 go through 40.

152
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,719
        They are the Smithsonian
                  of swine.

153
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,789
    Dude, that's a good one!
        That's a keeper!

154
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,124
Now, that pig
  may be a cornerstone,

155
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,694
     but this place is built
     on more than just meat.

156
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:30,429
       When we come back,
   we're gonna go vegetarian.

157
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:31,797
                      Good deal?
           Good deal.

158
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,165
   Porcini noodle.

159
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:36,401
   Porcini noodle stroganoff.
  It's really wonderful pasta.

160
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,137
The fresh wild mushrooms
 inside are just so delicious.

161
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,440
  They don't make me miss meat,
      and I'm a carnivore.

162
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:43,075
             Making some pasta.
              See you in a bit.

163
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,082
                Welcome back.

164
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:51,616
          "Triple D" hanging out
          in Northern California

165
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,452
              on the west side
              of Sonoma County

166
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:56,888
   in a town known as Sebastopol
with two of my favorite chefs --

167
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,825
           husband-and-wife team
       owning the famous Zazu --

168
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,693
         Chef Duskie, Chef John.

169
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,862
             They are real-deal
               farm-to-table.

170
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,397
In addition
  to their own farm,

171
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,999
    they're supportive of all
 the other farms in the county.

172
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,835
Which includes local meats...

173
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,436
Black Pig BLT!

174
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,038
        ...and the bounty
         of the county.

175
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,473
 Porcini stroganoff!

176
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:16,208
    Porcini noodle stroganoff

177
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,377
   is by far my favorite dish
          on the menu.

178
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,812
       The mushroom grower
  is from right up the street.

179
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,482
 The arugula is amazingly fresh.

180
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,183
 They make the noodle in-house.

181
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,485
           Let's make the pasta.

182
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:29,521
All right. Flour, semolina,
and then porcini powder.

183
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,123
       So, dried porcinis
       that are ground up.

184
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,257
          -Whole eggs.
          -Knead this.

185
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,925
            And how long are you
            gonna let this rest?

186
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,160
   A half an hour,
     40 minutes?

187
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,662
               Are we going to
        roll this out with a pin

188
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,898
that comes from your grandmother
            from Northern Italy?

189
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,433
     From a tree
that I felled myself?

190
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,201
              Or do we actually
           have a pasta machine?

191
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,669
I have a pasta machine.

192
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,638
               Pasta is done.
          Make it happen, cap'n.

193
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,674
     Hot oil, my mushrooms,
        salt and pepper.

194
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:53,044
       Let them get brown.
  Adding some shallot, Madeira.

195
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:55,480
            Watch-a your hair-a.
         Here comes the Madeira.

196
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,482
       I'm adding my pasta
          to the water.

197
00:06:57,484 --> 00:07:00,252
A little bit of the pasta water.
         Crème fraîche.

198
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,319
        Add in the pasta.

199
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:03,822
            -Got it.
      -Arugula goes on top.

200
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:06,191
      A little goat cheese.
     Extra virgin olive oil.

201
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:08,527
               That's a dish.

202
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,932
    That's as good if not better
        than John's charcuterie.

203
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,001
               The goat cheese
            is the perfect play.

204
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:18,036
                The arugula,
        the pepperiness of that,

205
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,938
        and just that little bit
              of extra crunch.

206
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,206
          The pasta is dynamite.

207
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:25,043
          The mushrooms have got
              a ton of flavor.

208
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,979
  Everything is from 15 minutes
         of right here.

209
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:30,115
       Only thing you have to do
              is forge the fork

210
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,083
             and make the bowl.

211
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,152
       -I'll work on that.
    -That's a rock-star dish.

212
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,787
                Nicely done.

213
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,589
Porcini noodle stroganoff.

214
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:40,659
 They use that local goat cheese
    that's just so delicious,

215
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:43,495
     and the wonderful toss
      of the arugula on top

216
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,864
   just gives it that texture
    that you're yearning for.

217
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,365
The mushrooms -- it gives you

218
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:50,702
that little bit of succulentness
  that goes with pasta so well.

219
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:54,172
     This is Guy and Judy Davis.
          Guy is our wine maker.

220
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,841
          How long have we known
               each other now?

221
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:57,042
    Seven, eight?

222
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,210
      -Seven, eight years?
             -Yeah.

223
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:00,245
              The wine country
              offers so much --

224
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,481
           tons of farm-to-table
            attitude and energy.

225
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,716
              How do you think
    Duskie and John embody that?

226
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,886
Well, every ingredient
 in their dishes is a star,

227
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,422
    and then they take it and
  they make this magic with it.

228
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:12,991
       Good. That's all we need.
  Nothing from you, Guy. Thanks.

229
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,994
           -Bombolini!
  -This place is very special.

230
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,163
    Everything that goes onto
    your plate is heartfelt.

231
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,432
You got to come check out
  Zazu and meet these two.

232
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,634
       It'll be worth your time.
              Adios. Well done.

233
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:23,702
        -Ciao. Thank you.
             -Nice.

234
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,770
             Ciao. Buh-bye now!
               See you later!

235
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,976
Up next, a funky joint
  in San Antonio...

236
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,379
          ...hitting it
       out of the park...

237
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,547
                 Impressive.

238
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,415
          ...with their
      Chicago specialties.

239
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:38,884
          You are the real deal.

240
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,859
 I'm here in San Antonio, Texas,
     right off the Loop 410,

241
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,494
  and I love coming down here.

242
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:51,997
  I mean, the people are great,
       the food's awesome,

243
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,533
      and if you're looking
    for iconic Chicago food,

244
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:55,767
           you got --
         Wait a second.

245
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,336
       Iconic Chicago food
         in San Antonio?

246
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,505
            Oh, yeah.
I hear this guy's the real deal.

247
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,374
   This is Wrigleyville Grill.

248
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,177
Maxwell Street Polish up.

249
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,580
  Wrigleyville knocks the ball
        out of the park.

250
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,749
          -Hot peppers!
     -It's absolutely legit.

251
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,684
   I feel like I'm in Chicago
      every time I come in.

252
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:15,053
That's exactly
  how Demetrios Tingas,

253
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,522
     better known as Jimmy,
            likes it.

254
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,357
  I'm a Chicagoan.
41 years in Chicago.

255
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,692
                   Right.

256
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,761
     And when he moved south
and missed his hometown staples,

257
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,829
              well,
   he just made them himself.

258
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,598
    Italian beef,
  hot and wet, up!

259
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,934
   The beef is tender, juicy.

260
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:33,371
  You order it wet, or dipped,
   as a true Chicagoan would.

261
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,106
                This, I hear,
              is the real deal.

262
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,409
    This is it --
the famous Italian beef.

263
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,810
               So we're gonna
                braise this.

264
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:42,180
These are the drippings
from yesterday's beef.
                      Okay.

265
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,783
We're gonna put the bay leaves,
 granulated garlic.

266
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,284
               Black pepper.
    The oregano.

267
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:49,054
       A little fennel, and last
     but not least, kosher salt.

268
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,522
               Now, what temp,
       and how long in the oven?

269
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:53,158
350 degrees for about
    3 1/2 hours.

270
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,559
                  How long
             will that last you?

271
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,027
  Maybe lunch.
                  One day?

272
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,996
        Yeah.
This one's a big one.

273
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,598
                 I got you.

274
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,866
You got--

275
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,635
                    Whoa!
             So now for the jus.

276
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,337
This is the liquid gold
     right here.

277
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:09,407
All the drippings, beef base,
bay leaves, granulated garlic.

278
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:12,344
               Oregano, basil,
  black pepper, and chili flake.

279
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,145
 Add some more water.
                And how long
             is that gonna cook?

280
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,647
     Overnight.
Take it and strain it.

281
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:18,717
And then take that beef, dip it,
          warm it, and serve it.

282
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,851
      Correct.

283
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,486
We're cutting the ends
    off the bun.
                      Right.

284
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,755
 So when we dunk it,
we get the juice inside there.

285
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,890
 Oh, I gotcha. You didn't ask me
      if I wanted it wet or not.

286
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,492
 In Chicago, you got
   to have it wet.

287
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,094
 If you want it dry,
you're from San Antonio.

288
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,795
                    Ohh!

289
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,263
             And the giardiniera
                is imported?

290
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:33,431
            That's from Chicago.

291
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,966
Pickles -- you got
olives, you got carrots,

292
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,868
you got cauliflower,
you got red chili flake,

293
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,236
got a little onion...

294
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,704
                 That's it.

295
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,514
     Is it okay?

296
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,316
        That's as close as it is
              to the original.

297
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,586
 The key is to get it dipped but
  not have it so submerged that,

298
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:56,321
            when you pick it up,
               it falls apart.

299
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,657
            But this right here,
  when it's just nice and tender

300
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,793
          on the inside and just
a little soggy on the outside...

301
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,094
                    Mmm.

302
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,663
      I can't get it in my mouth
                fast enough.

303
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,564
     Would help if you pushed it
                  with a...

304
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,466
                You sure know
             what you're doing.

305
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,035
        And that's a lot cheaper
             than a plane ticket

306
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,236
             to fly to Chicago.

307
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,637
 You got that right.

308
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,506
                    Mmm.

309
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,307
        Two Italian beef,
          hot and wet.

310
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:19,878
       Sliced thin, scrumptious,
     with all the fixings on it.

311
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,848
 How close to legit Chicago food
                  is this?

312
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,485
I have come to love this
far better than in Chicago.

313
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,788
        Shh! You're gonna get us
                both run out.

314
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,790
      You're never gonna go back
     to Chicago, and nor will I.

315
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,425
        I mean, we're safe here.

316
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:35,060
And with a name
  like Wrigleyville,

317
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:37,495
    you can guess which home
      team is in the house.

318
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:38,997
                    Game day?
     Cubs games.

319
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,432
           This is about as much
               of a clubhouse

320
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,000
               for transplants
                as there is.

321
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:45,136
    Everybody's here watching
   the game, eating his food.

322
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,538
Bacon burger with cheese
     coming up!

323
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,673
   San Antonio's kind of known
         for hamburgers,

324
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,408
       but I'll tell you,
     the place I always come

325
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,776
   for a burger is right here.

326
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,678
 And then this is the only place
        where you can get

327
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,414
 a really good chili cheese fry.

328
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,849
              All right, Chef.
             So what do we got?

329
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,518
We're going ground
beef -- shoulder clod, 80/20.

330
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,686
           That's a lot of clod.

331
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:02,954
 So we're gonna make
     a wet rub.

332
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,389
                Cumin, onion.

333
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,357
   Black pepper.
             Granulated garlic!

334
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,059
      Granula--
How'd you know that?
                 Oh, 'cause...

335
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,594
           just the way you were
             winding up for it.

336
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,162
                Seasoned salt?
That's exactly what it is.

337
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,231
             And Worcestershire?
Worcestershire sauce.

338
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,333
       And this looks like steak
                sauce to me.

339
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:16,935
       It is.

340
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,870
       Love me some steak sauce.
          A little bit of water?

341
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,705
     Of course.
              How long is this
               gonna marinate?

342
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,707
   Two, three hours.
                Two, "tree."

343
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,676
 Then grind it.
                  You grind
             all your own meat?

344
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:26,411
      Yes.
                 Impressive.

345
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,546
           What are we into now?
We're making the chili.

346
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,181
Ground beef, the onion.

347
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,683
                The jalapeño.

348
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,551
   Jalapeños.
                I'm helping.

349
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,754
         Cumin, garlic, paprika.

350
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,555
Chili powder, brown sugar.

351
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,057
              Did you announce
                at the Cubs?

352
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,525
                Brown sugar!

353
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,393
      And salt.
                     Aw!

354
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:45,563
  Crushed tomatoes,
ground tomatoes, pinto beans.

355
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:48,032
You want to puree half of them,
the other half whole.

356
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,168
          Okay. How long is this
          gonna cook down there?

357
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,003
   A couple hours.
                 All right,
              chili's working.

358
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,438
        Time to make the burger.

359
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,073
   And here we go.

360
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,275
          We go from grilling it
    to hitting it on a flat top.

361
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,144
All we wanted was the char marks
    on the grill.

362
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,012
             All right, Jimmy.
  Put the bacon on.

363
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,514
                 Little pigs
               they have here.

364
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,649
Grilled onions, and
then we're going to
put the cheese on there.

365
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:07,152
  Just cover it up.

366
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,787
Here's our hand-cut fries.

367
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,723
             Check one of these
        for scientific purposes.

368
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:14,592
Here's the chili we just made
and the cheese sauce.

369
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,128
Put the lettuce down,
the beef patty, tomato,

370
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,964
pickle, mustard, mayo.

371
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,500
                Look at that.

372
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:23,868
         When you think of chili
                cheese fries,

373
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,637
           that's the definition
                right there.

374
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,140
      A little processed cheese,
               homemade chili.

375
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,316
I totally agree with you.

376
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,884
                    See?
              Here's the deal.

377
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,519
              If a guy's gonna
          scratch-make it all --

378
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:45,423
              season, marinate,
              grind the meat --

379
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:49,027
   all in this great environment
          with Chicago attitude?

380
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:50,328
              My kind of joint.

381
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,763
           Nicely done, brother.

382
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:53,865
          Bacon burger
   and chili cheese fries up!

383
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,734
My good friends Shawn and Haley.
     They just got married.

384
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,336
                  The beef
           is just really juicy,

385
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,805
            and it has the bacon
         and all of the fixings.

386
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:03,675
      It just all comes together
               really nicely.

387
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,009
             Uh-huh.
   Uh-huh.

388
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,644
          You see that?
  That's how you do it, Shawn.

389
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,746
               And these fries
                 are killer.
     The fries are dynamite.

390
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:11,649
          -Oh, my God.
-Chicago dog -- one, two, three.

391
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,218
      I love Wrigleyville.

392
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,686
            It's like
     a home away from home.

393
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,555
I was surprised to find,
  all the way in San Antonio,

394
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:18,990
                that someone
         was doing Chicago food.

395
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,124
                 And I said,
           "If they're doing it,

396
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,392
               they better be
               the real deal."

397
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:25,263
          You are the real deal.
   Thank you.

398
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,765
Coming up, we're staying
  in San Antonio...

399
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:28,867
        Whew!

400
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,568
           ...for some
      Argentinean flavor...

401
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,936
 That's an empanada.

402
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:34,372
  ...savory, spicy, and sweet.

403
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,740
   That's an adult
jelly-filled doughnut.

404
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:40,211
This is from one of my cousins,
who's got a restaurant.
               Hold on, hold on.

405
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,280
  Why, when you got it from him,
      did you give me the Elvis?

406
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:43,781
  Oh, I don't know.
                       No?

407
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,183
It just came naturally.
       That's just what goes on?

408
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:46,718
            We're getting things
              going right now.

409
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,319
              We're warming up!

410
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:53,291
  So, I'm here on the west side
     of San Antonio, Texas,

411
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,126
     and you are gonna love
           this story.

412
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,862
Two immigrants, husband-and-wife
      team, from Argentina,

413
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:00,098
         decided to open
     an empanada restaurant.

414
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,833
  First location, not so great.

415
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:04,469
     People don't understand
   empanadas, and they close.

416
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:06,170
        What do they do?
      They don't back down.

417
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,406
 Nope, they open up a food truck
       serving empanadas,

418
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,774
       and they do great.

419
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,243
 And that leads them to opening
      up a new restaurant.

420
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,445
 Oh, you're gonna love the story
       and love the food.

421
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:17,882
       This is Fat Tummy.

422
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:20,184
               Ham and cheese,
           and humita empanadas.

423
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,587
        These are some of
  the best empanadas I've had.

424
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,522
                A traditional
              with spicy sauce.

425
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:27,091
   They're out of this world.
It's a way of life in Argentina.

426
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,027
But not so much in San Antonio.

427
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,328
    What happened
to the first restaurant?

428
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,996
       They needed to know
      what an empanada was.

429
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:33,164
       They wanted tacos.

430
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,667
So Gustavo Plache
   and Norah Saleh

431
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:38,970
     took their empanadas to
the street and won folks over...

432
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:41,572
                      Mmm.
    ...which opened the door
         to this place.

433
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,007
 Why do you call it
     Fat Tummy?

434
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,842
'Cause the empanadas
  are kind of fat.

435
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,477
          They're full.
          They're huge.

436
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,246
So, we're gonna make
the savory empanada dough?

437
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:49,480
                    Yes.
                   Flour.

438
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:50,949
    Water, okay,
   and some salt.

439
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,517
                      Yes.
        Milk.

440
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,851
                Butter, egg.

441
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,887
 And who taught you
    this recipe?
                 My grandmother.

442
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,689
 To graduate school,
  you have to have

443
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:59,724
  math and history
    and empanada.

444
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:01,125
                    Empanada.
 So we'll mix this.

445
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,093
      How long
 do we let it rest?

446
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:05,063
                 45 minutes,
              and then, "Tch!"

447
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:06,798
Everybody knows what "tch"
       means.

448
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,899
Start to sheet it out.

449
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,637
                 W-w-w-wait.
          That's a big empanada.

450
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,938
        Yeah.
          Not a little empanada.

451
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,640
   No, no, no, no.
        Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

452
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,209
                Fat Tummy.
     Fat Tummy.

453
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,811
    So what's the first empanada
                we're making?

454
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:20,979
         Corn and cheese, but...

455
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,180
  Corn and cheese,
  but we call it...

456
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,781
                   Humita.
       Humita.

457
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:27,018
It's almost like a creamed corn.
          Just awesome.

458
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,686
 This is the sofrito?
                    Yes.

459
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,388
           Oil, onion.

460
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,723
    Green and red
    bell pepper.

461
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:34,726
Sofrito has such a foundation
  in Latin cooking.

462
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,527
           Salt, black pepper...

463
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,731
...garlic.

464
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:40,898
  And oregano?
                  Oregano.

465
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,266
  How long is this
  gonna cook, Chef?

466
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,135
               Seven minutes.
                   Now...

467
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,704
  Corn, the sofrito
   we made, okay.

468
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,539
              Parmesan cheese.
   And mozzarella.

469
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,341
                    Yes, yes.
     That's it?

470
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,244
And as long as we're at it,
why not fire up another filling?

471
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,645
Next we're gonna make
 the spicy chicken?

472
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:55,813
             The spicy chicken.

473
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,615
                Oil, onion...

474
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,486
  A little salt.
         Paprika, garlic, basil.

475
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:03,121
   Basil, okay.
                  Oregano.

476
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:03,988
    Black pepper.

477
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,991
Boiled chicken breasts
  that you chop up.

478
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,359
                    Yeah.
                    Mix.

479
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,428
    Tomato sauce,
 chipotle en adobo.

480
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,830
When you say spicy chicken,
you mean spicy chicken.

481
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,399
All right, so we let
  that cook for...

482
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:15,700
               20, 25 minutes.

483
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,468
And now what is this?
        Spicy chimichurri sauce.

484
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,037
Spicy chimichurri sauce.

485
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,406
When I think about Argentinean
food, I don't think "spicy."

486
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:24,042
             No, but the people
      right here like the spicy.

487
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,476
 so you got to bring
     the spicy.
                      Yes.

488
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,813
        Cilantro, garlic powder,
                 salt, egg.

489
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:30,314
        Egg?
   In chimichurri?

490
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,649
                    You try.
        Okay!

491
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:32,884
               Chile de árbol.

492
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:33,851
   A lot of them.

493
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,353
                    Yes.
        Now?

494
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,091
This is the craziest chimichurri
   I've ever seen.

495
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:41,559
                    Yeah.

496
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,494
        Whew!
      It's hot.

497
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,163
        Wow!
  It's really good.

498
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,231
That's gonna be awesome
 with the empanada.

499
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,033
    Now, this is
  a special press?
                       Yes.

500
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:51,269
  Has your name --
     Fat Tummy.
                  And humita.

501
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,037
You make a different empanada,
you put a different...

502
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,306
                Yes, chicken,
              "P" -- the<i> pollo.</i>

503
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:56,541
 Just a little water
     to seal it.

504
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:58,943
Exactly.

505
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,411
          Okay, one, two, three.

506
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,280
       That's
 a lot of empanada.

507
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,382
                They're stuffed.
Let me see this thing.

508
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,417
So heavy.

509
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,952
 That's an empanada.

510
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:08,986
Now the spicy chicken?

511
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:10,888
             The spicy chicken.
                    Egg.

512
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,423
 Little bit of egg.
How long do they bake?

513
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:16,027
                 Four minutes.
    Four minutes.

514
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:18,729
 There's the<i> pollo,</i>
and I'll try the humita first.

515
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,498
 Look at that cheese
  melting in there.

516
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,001
 Like a commercial.

517
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,236
       Mm-hmm.

518
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:27,205
  Put just a little
of the chimichurri on there.

519
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:28,806
I don't even know why I just put
that chimichurri on there.

520
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,608
I know how hot that is.

521
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:35,580
The dough is really good,
the filling is fantastic,

522
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:37,281
 and the chimichurri
goes with it perfect.

523
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,317
     And this is
 the spicy chicken.
                 Spicy chicken.

524
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,887
Love the little glaze
       on top.

525
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,689
     Fantastic.

526
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,591
  Look at the juice
just running out of this thing.

527
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:47,925
  Not overly spicy.

528
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,193
For anybody that hasn't had
    an empanada,

529
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:51,529
    this is where
 they need to start.

530
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:52,597
It doesn't get any better
     than that.

531
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,365
               I have humita,
               spicy chicken.

532
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:57,101
 The spicy chicken is excellent,
    just hits the right spot.

533
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:59,303
       The humita empanada
       has lots of cheese.

534
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,539
        It's very creamy.
   -Chimichurri's really good.

535
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,840
        It's very herby.

536
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,942
  Beef and potato,
and ham and cheese, ready!

537
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,644
     You're a food blogger here.
    Yes, sir.

538
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,246
           People in San Antonio
               know good food.

539
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:10,982
      Oh, yeah.
We love our eat-local scene,

540
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,850
and these people fit
   right in there.

541
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,785
      They're great people.
       I just enjoy them.

542
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,053
              Chorizo and egg!

543
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,388
How many different
empanadas do you make?

544
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,589
                     10.
 How many are sweet?

545
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,558
          -Three sweet.
      -The guava empanadas.

546
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,627
      The guava and cheese
          is excellent.

547
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,695
It kind of reminds me of,
  like, having fruit

548
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,531
     and cheese for dessert.

549
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:27,899
I've had this empanada
       before.

550
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,367
    I want to see
  how you make it.

551
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,569
A little bit smaller, and the
dough is a little bit sweeter.

552
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,137
                 Exactly.
    Guava paste.

553
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,405
     I got you.
Now the cream cheese?

554
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,207
                   Cream cheese.
And we mash it together.

555
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:40,478
And the guava paste is a little
 sweet, little tang.

556
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,914
What he's gonna do with this
empanada is gonna be dynamite.

557
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,216
 Love these presses.
     <i> Impressed.</i>

558
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:46,918
Little bit of egg wash.
                    Yes.

559
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:49,086
We bake it five minutes?

560
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,322
         No, this -- two minute.
   A little sugar?

561
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,225
    You think so?
                      Yeah.

562
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,496
That's my jam right there --
  the savory-sweet.

563
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,231
  The cream cheese,
    the tanginess

564
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:04,502
and the...flavor profile
 of the guava paste

565
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:05,937
and the tender dough
   on the outside,

566
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:09,207
with a little caramelized sugar
       on top.

567
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,142
That's an adult jelly-filled
      doughnut.

568
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:12,076
This with some coffee?

569
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,578
                      Yeah.
        Huh?

570
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,246
Here's a guava empanada
   for you guys.

571
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:16,647
      It's a perfect amount
          of sweetness.

572
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:21,786
It's something about
  this humble guy.

573
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:24,388
      That's why the taste
          is so great.

574
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,123
 You're the example
of the American story.

575
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,226
Come to this country,
  work really hard,

576
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,594
work with your family.

577
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:30,828
That's why we do "Triple D."

578
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,064
   Great job, man.

579
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,165
    Made me cry.

580
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,536
  Was that a road trip or what?

581
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:39,904
        But don't worry.

582
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,240
   There's plenty more joints
  all over this great country.

583
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,976
     I'll be looking for you
    next time on "Triple D."

584
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:47,612
  And what have I told you guys
 about having people on the show

585
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:48,746
    with better hair than me?

586
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,114
Eh?

587
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:52,416
       I said, "Stop this
       better hair thing."

588
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,884
              Gosh!
I was gonna ask you...

589
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:55,886
      Where's the bleach?
  ...if I could go
to your hairdresser.

590
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,655
Oh, you're killing it, girl.
