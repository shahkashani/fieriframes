00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,617
       I WAS GONNA GET THAT KIND
        OF PLATE PRESENTATION.  

94
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,086
     I DIDN'T EXPECT I WAS GONNA
        BE EATING FISH RIBS.    

95
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:44,289
               OH. THAT'S CRAZY.
              YOU SEE THE BONES?

96
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,890
           A FISH THAT'S RELATED
               TO DINOSAURS,    

97
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,759
        BUT IT TASTES FANTASTIC.

98
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,394
        THAT'S SOMETHING I WOULD
          ORDER AGAIN FOR SURE. 

99
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,229
         THE PRESENTATION ON IT,
             IN MY OPINION,     

100
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,398
            WAS OF ANY FIVE-STAR
                 RESTAURANT.    

101
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,566
     THAT'S UP THERE IN SOME OF 
    THE BEST FISH I'VE EVER HAD.

102
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:58,637
             YOU GOTTA TRY THIS.
            SERIOUSLY IMPRESSED.
THANK YOU.

104
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:02,174

             REALLY TASTY.      

105
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,909

 IT'S JUST PERFECT.             

106

122
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,286
          BUT WITH COCONUT MILK.
SO IN BRAZILIAN FOOD--          
   A LOT OF COCONUT?            

123
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:49,821
               A LOT OF COCONUT.

124
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,824
         START WITH BUTTER,     
    A LITTLE BIT OF BLENDED OIL.

125
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,826
COOK WITH THE OIL, BUT YOU GET  
  THE FLAVOR WITH THE BUTTER.   

126
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,430
         GARLIC, RED ONIONS,

127
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:01,700
            SOME CLAMS, MUSSELS.
    THIS IS                     
GONNA BE GOOD.

                  WHITE WINE    
              AND NOW CLAM JUICE

129
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,105
     WITH ANOTHER POT ON THE TOP
        TILL THE CLAMS OPEN.    

130
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,907
IF THEY DON'T OPEN,             
  DON'T EAT 'EM.                
            SO NOW WE'RE GONNA  
           START MAKING THE RICE

131
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,309
      FOR THE FISHERMAN'S STEW--

132
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:14,646
  COCONUT MILK, RICE, CHIVE OIL,
       A LITTLE BIT OF SALT.    

133
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,381
              SO NOW THE CLAMS--
                THEY ARE OPEN.  

134
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,550
      SO THAT MEANS IT'S READY  
    FOR THE REST OF THE SEAFOOD.

135

              YES. SOME CHORIZO.

137
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,124

             YEAH. COCONUT MILK,

               YOU KNOW ANNATTO?
     I KNOW                     
THE ANNATTO SEED.

145
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,411

EDAMAMES?                       

146
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,080

 ABOUT EDAMAMES?                

147
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,549
   I TRAVELED AROUND THE WORLD--
       WHEN I WAS IN JAPAN.     

148
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,418

OH, DON'T TEASE ME.

 NOW WE MAKE A LITTLE HOLE      
IN THE MIDDLE FOR THE RICE.     

155
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:11,236
               THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

156
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:14,973
           THAT'S OUTTA CONTROL.

158
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:19,110
            THE ONLY PROBLEM    
        IS YOU CAN ONLY GET THIS

159
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:22,113

CILANTRO IN THERE.              

373
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,388
 AND THIS JUST GETS BETTER WITH 
 TIME, WHEN YOU LET THIS SET UP.

        BESIDES THE FACT        

415
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,618
    THAT IT MAKES YOUR MOUTH    
 AND YOUR STOMACH REALLY HAPPY.

    <i> SCRATCH-BAKED BY ANOTHER</i>   
       <i> YOUNG CULINARIAN,</i>       

419
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,897
   <i> 15-YEAR-OLD JESSIE HAYES.</i>   

420
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:43,100
         HE'S A MASTER.         
               ALL RIGHT, JESS, 
              YOU AND ME, BUDDY.

421
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,036
              LEAD ME INTO THIS.
THESE ARE ACTUALLY              
    NECTARINES.                 

422
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:46,703
               NECTARINE SCONES?
YES.                            

423
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,439
WE'RE GOING TO START OFF        
  BY PUTTING THE FLOUR          

424
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,374
IN THE BOWL.                    
             ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR--
                    A.P.?       

425
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:53,177
YES. WE'RE GOING TO ADD         
  SOME BAKING POWDER.           

426
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,846
            THE LEAVENING AGENT.
  YEAH. SOME SALT               
FOR FLAVOR. SUGAR.              

427
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,249
ADD THE BUTTER. WE'RE JUST GONNA
    MIX THIS UP A LITTLE BIT.   

428
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:01,852
      ABOUT THAT SIZE           
IS A GOOD SIZE FOR BUTTER.      
                           OKAY.

429
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:04,388
     WE'RE GOING TO ADD         
THE CREAM NEXT--HEAVY CREAM.    
          NOT SWEETENED, THOUGH.

430
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,990
   NO. AND THEN FINALLY         
WE'RE GONNA ADD THE FRUIT.      

431
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:10,528
      JUST GONNA BE A REAL LIGHT
              FINAL MIX?        
 YEAH, JUST TO GET              
THE CREAM IN THERE              

432
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,131
WITH THE DRY INGREDIENTS.       
                   LOOKING GOOD.

433
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,600
THAT'S IT. NOW WE'RE READY      
    TO FORM OUR DOUGH.          

434
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:17,335
SPRINKLE SOME FLOUR             
   ON THE BENCH.                

435
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:19,871
JUST GONNA TRY AND NOT WORK     
     WITH IT TOO MUCH.          

436
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,273
         WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO?
THE BUTTER WILL MELT,           

437
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,275
AND IT WON'T BAKE               
   VERY WELL.                   

438
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:27,078
I'M GOING TO CUT IT             
     IN HALF.                   
             AND THEN YOU'VE GOT
              YOUR OTHER THREE  

439
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,680
           THAT ARE READY TO GO.
RIGHT. LAY IT OUT               
 ON A SHEET PAN.                

440
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,082
PUT THEM IN THE FREEZER         
  FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.            
                      ALL RIGHT.

441
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:35,753
             WHAT DO WE DO NEXT?
   BUTTER THE TOP. JUST KINDA   
 LIGHTLY SPRINKLE IT WITH SUGAR.

442
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:39,223
 IT'S GONNA GIVE US A NICE,     
BROWN, GOLDEN TEXTURE TO IT.    

443
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,359
AND THEN JUST PUT 'EM           
    IN THE OVEN.                
               WHAT ARE WE GONNA
                 BAKE 'EM AT?   

444
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:45,162
425 FOR ABOUT 20                
 TO 25 MINUTES.                 

445
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,897
          WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE?
I KINDA LIKE THAT ONE.          

446
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,168
           ALL RIGHT. THEN I'M  
        GONNA TRY THIS ONE. MMM.

447
