      TO MEET IN THE SAME SPOT? 

521
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,446
THAT'D BE A GOOD THING.         
              AND THEN GO RIGHT 
             THROUGH THE CENTER.

522
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,481
            AND NOW WE'RE GONNA 
          SPRINKLE THE DRY RUB--

523
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,385
        THE UNIVERSAL DRY RUB...
JUST A LITTLE BIT.              

524
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:49,387
KINDA USE IT LIKE PAPRIKA       
   TO GIVE A LITTLE...          

525
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,856
                 JUST DUST IT   
             AND ADD SOME COLOR.
NICE APPEARANCE, YEAH.          

526
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,991
  NOW THESE GO                  
IN THE BARBECUE.                

527
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,660
      YEP, RIGHT ON THE SMOKER. 

528
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,729
LOOK AT THOSE.                  

529
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,466
THOSE ARE LIKE                  
MONDO POPPER.                   

530
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,536
I'VE HAD SMOKED BRIE.           

531
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,538
I'VE HAD SMOKED MOZZARELLA.     

532
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,807
BUT SMOKED CREAM CHEESE?        

533
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:14,812
THOSE WERE FRESH PEPPERS?       

534
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,747
BROTHER, THAT'S WICKED HOT.     
                          IT IS.

535
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,149
I MEAN, GREAT FLAVOR.           

536
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:19,883
       <i> ...LIKE EVERYTHING</i>      
      <i> RICK'S ROLLIN' OUT.</i>      

537
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,019
      BUT IT'S REALLY GOOD,     
          REALLY GOOD.          

538
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,954
  <i> IT REALLY IS THE REAL DEAL,</i>  

539
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:28,025
       <i> THE RUB, THE SMOKE</i>      
     <i> ALL DONE LOW AND SLOW.</i>    

540
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,428
 AND IT'S THE SAME EVERY TIME-- 
           WONDERFUL.           

541
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,962
           I'VE HAD EVERYTHING. 

542
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:35,966

               I EAT HERE A LOT.

543
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:38,636
   OUT GOES THE OLD THEORY OF   
COOKIN' 'EM COOLS 'EM DOWN, HUH?

544
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:41,438

   ARE HOT. WOW!
