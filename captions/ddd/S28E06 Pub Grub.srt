               perfectly done.  

236
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,673
 Plating that steak.            
Vegetables coming down.         

237
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,142

                      Thank you.

238
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:07,145
 -Beer cheddar soup, fantastic. 
    -Fried bologna coming up.   

239
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:10,214
   -Traditional Buffalo food.   
-At a traditional Buffalo joint.

240
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,950
              Almost the exact  
               same since '77.  

241
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:13,818
     -So when Pat Lalley...     
    -How's everything going?    

242
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,687
     And his brother-in-law     
           Larry Adymy          

243
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:16,888
    took over 4 years ago...    

244
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,690
Got the herb.                   
  ...they stuck with tradition. 

245
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,224
  MAN: We tweaked some things,  
         redid the menu,        

246
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,427
     but the classics of the    
Blackthorn haven't been touched.

247
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,029
        FIERI: Like this        
        local classic...        

248
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:25,630
         -Beef on weck.         
        -...roast beef on       

249
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,499
    a salt and caraway-topped   
        kimmelweck roll.        

250
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:29,167
      This is what Buffalo      
          is known for.         

251
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,434
      The perfect sandwich.     

252
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,970
      FIERI: And head chef      
      Max Leatherbarrow...      

253
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,972
           -Coming up.          
        -Is cranking out        

254
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,306
      around 20,000 a year.     

255
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,841
What are we going to make?      

256
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,044
     We're making our roast beef
  for the beef on weck sandwich.

257
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:40,645
    Beef on weck.               
Well, show me the way we do it. 

258
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,914
        Start with onions       
   in the pan, carrot, celery.  

259
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,649
So we're making a little        
mirepoix, it looks like,        

260
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:45,984
to the bottom of this pan.      
         Basically, yes.        

261
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:48,320
Then we're going to put the beef
    in the pan, Angus round.    

262
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:50,388
Big top round.                  
         Big top round.         

263
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,189
  Next, I do a browning agent.  

264
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,460
Agent Browning?                 
  Agent Browning. Rub that in.  

265
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:56,727
   All right. We put a little   
       Worcestershire on,       

266
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,464
    Montreal steak seasoning,   
         pat that down.         

267
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,733
      And then last we have     
      some fresh rosemary.      

268
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,134
That you grow in your backyard? 

269
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,069
 Yeah, I brought this from home.
So what's going to happen now?  

270
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,203
       This is going to go      
      straight in the oven.     

271
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,605
300 degrees, 3 hours.           

272
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,541
  Are you going for             
an internal temperature?        

273
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:11,676
        Yeah. I'm looking       
      for around maybe 110.     

274
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,344
So you really coming            
  out medium rare.              

275
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,146
           He's ready.          
Wow.                            

276
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,348
       There you have it.       
Look at that bad boy.           

277
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,217
 So you let it rest,            
when you slice into it,         

278
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,685
all the juices don't            
  come flowing out.             

279
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:21,686
            Exactly.            
And this is what                

280
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:22,887
 we're going to make            
  the au jus from?              

281
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,623
      Yeah. I basically put     
       all the vegetables       

282
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,157
  and pan drippings into a pot. 

283
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,360
   We add water, kosher salt,   
    a little browning agent,    

284
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:29,961
 ground black pepper, beef base.

285
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,295
Once the au jus comes to a boil,

286
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,097
          we strain it,         
     and that's your au jus.    

287
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,166
That's it. Then we're slice it. 
   This is our final product.   

288
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,568
Then we're going to put this    
      on weck?                  

289
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,235
  Start with a bun.             
Dip the top in au jus,          

290
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:41,906
caraway seed and kosher salt.   

291
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,175
         I've never seen someone
         do it here in location.

292
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,843
             I've always seen it
          come with it on there.

293
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,111
Why not fresh?                  
                  Why not?      

294
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:50,115
All right. Take our beef, let it
dip right in the au jus.        

295
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,583
Let it warm up for a minute.    
We got the bottom of our bun,   

296
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,518
got our beef on there,          
   top of the bun.              

297
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,654
There you have it.              
     So that's it, beef on weck.

298
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,125
Nice and soaking<i> weck.</i>          

299
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,926
Mm, wow. That is so tender.     

300
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,128
Big flavor, crazy with          
the salt and the caraway.       

301
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,463
That au jus is awesome too.     

302
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:08,733
Mm. I can only probably         
 eat 1,000 of those.            

303
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:11,069
         Nice job, man.         
 -Beef on weck is so delicious. 

304
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,070
    MAN: The meat is perfect.   
          It's tender.          

305
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,672
 There's no grizzle, no nothing.

306
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,874
No schnizzle on the grizzle.    
    No schnizzle on the grizzle.

307
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,209
   That's how they              
 say it around here.            

308
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,411
  -Beef on weck in the window.  
     -I just love the place.    

309
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,746
         You're my chicken wings
             with ranch, right? 

310
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,347
  This is our table, actually.  

311
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,617
 FIERI: And this is where Pat's 
 firehouse brothers like to sit.

312
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,218
            Everyone comes here.
       They know it's good food.

313
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,153
Cops and firemen always know    
the best place to eat.          

314
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,089
        -And what to eat.       
       -Beer cheddar soup.      

315
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:33,024
             A nice little kick 
              to it, very good. 

316
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,627
And it's a more-than-30-year-old
       Blackthorn recipe.       

317
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:36,828
I see cheese and beer.          

318
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,697
We're making some soup.         
              We're making soup.

319
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:41,232
     This is our Irish beer     
    cheddar and potato soup.    

320
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,434
            Start out           
       with butter, onion.      

321
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,036
    Let it stir. We're going    
       to let these sweat.      

322
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,905
And what's going to happen now? 
         We add some Irish beer.

323
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:48,439
All that beer?                  
                  All that beer.

324
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,108
A ton of beer, dude.            

325
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,976
Yeah, I've had a lot of         
cheddar beer soup before,       

326
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:53,511
but I don't think I've          
ever seen that amount.          

327
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,513
      Let this come to a simmer.
Takes about 10, 15 minutes.     

328
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,849
      Going to add our potatoes.
   This might splash, watch out.

329
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,917
Now these are peeled            
   and parboiled?               

330
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,119
                         Yes.   
How much of this soup           

331
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,253
you guys go through a week?     

332
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,522
        About 20 gallons a week.
So potatoes are in.             

333
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:06,524
          We add our seasonings,
                white pepper,   

334
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,860
               Montreal steak...
Montreal seasoning, of course.  

335
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:11,295
    Seasoned salt, chicken base.
Stir that in.                   

336
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,064
        Bring this up to a boil.
It's great so far.              

337
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,331
   All right. Now we're going to
               add the cheese,  

338
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,466
      about a handful at a time.

339
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,802
              Shredded cheddar  
             and Monterey Jack. 

340
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,604
   And just slowly              
whisk that cheese in.           

341
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:20,938
                    Yeah.       

342
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,540
We do it all at once, obviously,
         it's going to clump up.

343
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,943
Clump up, and you'll have       
the bottom of somebody's fondue.

344
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,477
                        Exactly.
  The cheese is in.             

345
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,945
  Now what happens?             

346
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,482
         Heavy cream, and we add
     a little nacho cheese sauce

347
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:31,949
        just for color and to...

348
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,351
Thicken it up a little bit.     
                           Sure.

349
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,420
So let that simmer, and then    
what do we serve it with?       

350
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,887
    Side of saltine crackers.   

351
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,891
          There you go.         
     Hot sauce if you wish.     

352
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:44,028
              Wow. I can smell  
            the beer like crazy.

353
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,164
      Mm, wow. That's big, deep,
            rich flavor. Creamy.

354
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,565
              Just have, like,  
          a perfume of the beer.

355
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,368
  Mm. That is the most beer I've
 ever seen in beer cheddar soup.

356
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,036
We don't mess around            
with beer in Buffalo.           

357
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,304
               No, you don't.   
 What kind of hot sauce is that?

358
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,373
 That's wing sauce.             

359
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,640
                     Mm.        

360
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,576
             With the hot sauce 
          in there, really good.

361
00:12:58,578 --> 00:12:59,711
                  Good job, man.
             Thanks.            

362
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,112
        -Really good job.       
           -Fantastic.          

363
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,247
  -Really creamy and cheddary.  
    -Cheddar soup going out.    

364
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,783
         Any way you can        
       put beer in a soup,      

365
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,984
    I think it tastes yummy.    
      -Irish beer cheddar.      

366
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,053
  You can get anything you want 
    here, and you'd be happy.   

367
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,188
FIERI: All the Buffalo favorites
         you'd expect...        

368
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,391
         -Chicken wings.        
   -Nice and plump and crispy.  

369
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,659
       ...and a few things      
          you wouldn't.         

370
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:17,128
          -Crab cakes.          
     -Done Baltimore-style.     

371
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,729
You don't have to go            
to Maryland. They're right here.

372
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,065
Well, give me the rundown, man. 
I'm a crab cake aficionado.     

373
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,935
    Start by running our veg    
    through a food processor.   

374
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:25,069
   Green and red bell pepper,   

375
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,538
         Spanish onions,        
      celery, let it spin.      

376
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,475
  I mix it together just so it  
 doesn't break down really bad. 

377
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,743
How many clicky, clicky,        
click, click, click?            

378
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,212
   Between 12 and 15, I guess.  

379
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,214
Yes, very nice.                 
     That goes in the bowl.     

380
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,816
    Next, we're going to add    
      our crab meat, eggs.      

381
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,485
Six eggs.                       
      A little bit of dill.     

382
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,886
Whoa.                           
      Take it easy on that.     

383
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:44,289
Gorilla with the dill-a.        

384
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,291
Wow.                            
       Old Bay seasoning,       

385
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,827
 Greek dressing, our lemon-dill 
     mayo that we make here.    

386
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,295
Going to dill-ify it            
   one more time.               

387
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:51,696
              Sure.             
And what was in this?           

388
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,498
          Lemon juice,          
      dill and mayonnaise.      

389
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Oh, sure. It's lemon juice,     
dill and mayonnaise.            

390
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,436
     It's a lemon-dill mayo.    

391
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,771
  How about call it             
  lemon-dill mayo.              

392
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,974
    All right. Oh, good idea.   
  We have some chopped garlic.  

393
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,509
 Whole mess of that.            
  Parmesan cheese.              

394
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,510
          Swiss cheese.         
        Provolone cheese.       

395
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,580
     Mix of shredded cheddar    
       and Monterey Jack.       

396
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:10,248
In the crab cake?               
        In the crab cake.       

397
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,383
         And then 4 cups        
        of bread crumbs.        

398
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,985
Well, the only thing            
we haven't stuck in there       

399
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:16,921
 is the kitchen sink            
    and your hat.               

400
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,455
          That's next.          
    We're going to mix it up.   

401
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,790
      Now we're just going      
       to patty these up.       

402
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,927
        Looking for about       
        5 1/2, 6 ounces.        

403
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,063
   There's one of our patties,  
           flour this,          

404
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,497
        put a nice crust        
         on the outside.        

405
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,600
And no seasoning in the flour?  
  Just straight-up all-purpose. 

406
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:30,401
     Here's our second one,     
         flour this up.         

407
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:31,469
   And how are we               
going to cook these?            

408
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:35,206
        On the flat top.        
          Butter down.          

409
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,741
       Yeah. So a couple minutes
                 each side.     

410
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:39,010
  Yeah. We're basically trying  
  to get a nice crust on them,  

411
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,945
       heat them through.       
          That's a normal order?

412
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:42,413
              Yes.              
 All right. Let's serve them up.

413
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,883
        These get served        
     with rice, vegetables.     

414
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,750
        Hit them with our       
     lemon-dill mayonnaise.     

415
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:47,819
       There you have it.       

416
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:49,354
I want to just try it           
  without the mayo.             

417
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,889
Look in there, you see          
crab right off the bat.         

418
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,156
  It's a good sign.             

419
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,824
  Mm, great flavor.             
Good mixture of crab.           

420
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,359
 I like the crunchy             
  veggies in there.             

421
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,495
 The dill-lemon mayo            
couldn't be any better.         

422
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:00,031
  The thing that is             
the best is that texture.       

423
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,366
 Look at the crunch             
on that right there.            

424
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:02,567
 That's a good cake.            
   Good job, man.               

425
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,501
                   Thanks.      

426
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:04,902
        The Maryland crab       
         cakes, perfect.        

427
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,238
 Crispy on the outside and nice 
    and moist on the inside.    

428
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,973
      The dill sauce really     
      complements it well.      

429
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,375
You had a beer cheddar          
   as well, right?              

430
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,576
Blackthorns is the place to be. 

431
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,444
It's a great neighborhood joint.
                It really is.   

432
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,913

  -Great service, great people. 
         -Beef on weck.         

434
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,582
       I love to see that       
       you guys are here.       

435
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,251
    You're doing it, and you    
   definitely have a presence,  

436
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,853

     care of your community.    

437
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,187
     I think that's awesome.    
       -Thanks for coming.      

438
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,390
    We really appreciate it.    
     -Oh, we've had a blast.    

439
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:27,658
     Up next, after digging

  But this time, I'm trading in 
  seafood for a skater joint...

  What in the wild, wild world  
   of sports is going on here.  

443
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,202
         ...rolling out         
       with a killer pie.       

444
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:39,504

446
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,813
So I'm here in Upper Fells Point
     of Baltimore, Maryland,    

447
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,748
      just a couple blocks      
        from the harbor,        

448
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,951
   where a dude that's a good   
  skateboard and punk rock fan  

449
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,554
     has taken an old-school    
            local bar           

450
00:15:56,556 --> 00:16:00,224
   and turned it into kind of   
   like a Neapolitan pizzeria,  

451
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:03,294
       except he calls it       
    a Balti-politan pizzeria.   

452
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,963
      This is Johnny Rad's.

455
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,037
Little bit more upscale         
as far as the food goes         

456
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,040

465
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,193
Were you in the restaurant      
business before this?           

466
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,730
           Not at all. I started
           making pizza at home.

467
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,799

          our secret ingredient,

486
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,177
       We're going to let it mix
            for about 3 minutes.

487
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,112
All right. So now we're going to
 add our extra virgin olive oil.

    There you go.

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,253

            I don't.            

807
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,403
 No, this wouldn't be bar food. 

808
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:40,871
   FIERI: But they've got that  
         if you want it.        

809
00:30:40,873 --> 00:30:44,207
    Hot wings, buffalo wings,   
   garlic and buttered wings.   

810
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,809
    Ronny just cooks up a storm.

811
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:48,612
  FIERI: That'll be Ron Esser,  
   everyone calls him Moondog,  

812
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:52,148
a former musician who bought the
  Starlite almost 14 years ago. 

813
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,217
         The fellow that sold it
               to me insisted   

814
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:55,686
         that it would always...
That you would keep the name?   

815
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:56,954
                 Absolutely.    

816
00:30:56,956 --> 00:31:00,423
 So he did and amped up the menu
    with real home cooking...   

817
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:01,958
     Tastes like Momma Lombardi.

818
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,493
     ...from Lora Mazeski's     
           grandma...           

819
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:05,028
  I got the recipe              
from my grandmother.            

820
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,230
    ...for homemade pierogies   
       folks at this joint      

821
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:08,432
    just can't get enough of.   

822
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:10,300
 An amazing plate of pierogies. 

823
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:11,835
 They're kind of like dumplings 

824
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:13,436
       in other, you know,      
         nationalities.         

825
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,439
        Polish raviolis.        
        Order of pierogi.       

826
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:16,706
             FIERI:             
   And when it's pierogi time,  

827
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,175
      Lora leaves the floor     
   and heads for the kitchen.   

828
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,577
               How do we start  
              with the pierogi? 

829
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:21,711
You need to make the dough.     

830
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,180
    4 cups flour,               
  1 cup sour cream,             

831
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:27,450
water, two eggs, stir it all up.

832
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,253
         And this is the batter?
Yes.                            

833
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:31,120
Then you need to work it        
  with your hands.              

834
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,890
     So it's just supposed to be
    a sticky blob at the bottom?

835
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,259
Yeah. It's kind of like         
  dough for a pie.              

836
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:37,728
              Oh, I don't know  
            if there's more left

837
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,128
 in the bowl or on your fingers.

838
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,464
  I'm a messy cook.             

839
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:42,799
 Put this aside and let it rest?
Yeah, for 15 to 20 minutes.     

840
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:44,134
              And then we start 
         working on the filling?

841
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:45,535
  Yep, after I wash             
my hands, of course.            

842
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:46,737
          Just go ahead and wipe
              them on my shirt. 

843
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:47,871
              I'm just kidding. 

844
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:49,205
               So we just boil  
              down some taters. 

845
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,007
    Four to five.               

846
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,542
  And I'm going to              
stick them in my mixer.         

847
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:53,943
             American, so we've 
              got it processed. 

848
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,679
It has to be American.          
             Has to be American?

849
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:59,148
Yes. Saute one large onion.     

850
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,551
     And a half a cup of butter?
No, a half a pound.             

851
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:04,221
                   Half a pound?
Yes.                            

852
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:06,223
              So we are almost  
          making the consistency

853
00:32:06,225 --> 00:32:08,158
  of mashed potatoes with cheese

854
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,359
     and a half pound of butter.

855
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:10,560
        Yeah.                   

856
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:12,963
Now we get the dough,           
  and I flatten it.             

857
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:14,831
  Then I just grab              
    some of this.               

858
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,901
  You flap it over,             
make sure that it's sealed.     

859
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:19,169
                  Can I try one?
     Of course.                 

860
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:23,240
      All right. So I get a glob
              of this mixture,  

861
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:25,775
       and I get some more flour
   down, little bit more, right?

862
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,044
        Yeah.                   

863
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:28,512
                Am I looking    
      pretty good at this point?

864
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:30,981
It looks beautiful. It almost   
looks better than mine.         

865
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:34,985
       I'm a pierogi apprentice.
Now we get Moondog.             

866
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:37,187
                Yo, Moondog.    
   Now what happens to them now?

867
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39,389
        We boil them for        
        about 5 minutes.        

868
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:40,524
Now, what gets served with it?  

869
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:41,591
             Butter and onions. 

870
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:43,059
               You got to have  
              a lot of butter.  

871
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,527
            We'll let them cook.

872
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,863
          I think they're ready.
They're enormous.               

873
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:49,399
       These are real pierogies.
               You brown them.  

874
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,334
   They're nice and gushy and...

875
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,469
Gushy as a culinary term.       

876
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,672
     There you go. Look at that.

877
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:58,475
            This is kind of like
      what grandma used to make.

878
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,677
                     ♪♪         

879
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,546
Mm. I'm telling you,            
    that is about               

880
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:03,947
simple goodness right there.    

881
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:06,550
People going to come down       
here looking for these.         

882
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:08,284
Grandma would be happy?         
                            Yes.

883
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,286
  There you got it.             

884
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:10,821
What makes them so good?        

885
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:13,557
            -Butter.            
   -Lots of butter, very good.  

886
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,491
      It's a pretty popular     
        Pittsburgh dish.        

887
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,294
       -Best in the Burgh.      
       -Best in the Burgh?      

888
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:19,029
       That's Pittsburgh?       
     -It's the best pierogi     

889
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,030
    I've ever had, actually.    

890
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:21,431
   FIERI: Just a little piece   

891
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,700
  of a menu that's covered all  
      the bases for years.      

892
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:26,903
He always has a lot of very good
        different kinds of food.

893
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:27,904
            Greek fish sandwich.

894
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:29,706
       Since I was a kid,       
      this place was known      

895
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:30,907
       for having a great       
         fish sandwich.         

896
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:32,375
        And Ron makes it        
          even better.          

897
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,710
         Things don't have to be
          that fancy to be good.

898
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,179
     Oh, they have all kinds    
      of different styles.      

899
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,115
          It's the best         
        food around here.       

900
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:39,249
      Especially the soup.      

901
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:41,117
      Stuffed pepper soup,      
      tastes like homemade.     

902
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,252
      FIERI: Because it is.     

903
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:44,187
       So the ingredients       
       of stuffed peppers,      

904
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,322
but, instead, you chop it all up
    and make soup out of it?    

905
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,592
           Basically. So we like
              to make it fresh. 

906
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:50,994
    Serve it up.                
Who came up with the recipe?    

907
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:53,797
     It originated in 1860 in...

908
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:57,334
               No, I don't know.
Real nice tomato base to it.    

909
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:59,335
On a cold Pittsburgh day,       

910
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,537
 this would be what             
 you want to go for.            

911
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,272
        -Right. Oh, yeah.       
        -It's real tasty.       

912
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:03,806
       One order for you.       

913
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,609
    This is, like, a sit-down   
           restaurant.          

914
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:07,810
   WOMAN: There's a full menu.  
  And if you're in the mood for 

915
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,412
        a burger, wings,        
        they have pasta.        

916
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,081
   FIERI: And if all you want   
          is a salad...         

917
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:13,816
    So you got melted cheese    
        and French fries        

918
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,218
     on top of a cold salad?    

919
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,488
This is the best chicken salad  
you ever had in your whole life.

920
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,423
  And their French              
 fries are so good.             

921
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:23,026
   Hand-cut and double fried,   
    the same scratch cooking    

922
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:25,361
     that's kept the locals     
       piling in forever.       

923
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:26,629
      MAN: See, I was born      
       and raised in town,      

924
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,097
     and so I probably been     
      coming here 50 years.     

925
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,365
  MAN: People keep coming back  

926
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,101
      because it has a home     
           atmosphere.          

927
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:32,635
        Pretty much know        
     everybody that's here.     

928
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,770
      And you know you can      
       count on good food.      

929
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:37,441
        If you're going to cook,
 you might as well do it, right?

930
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:39,042
       -What do you have?       
        -Chicken Diablo.        

931
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:41,378
       It's quality stuff.      
      -Who made the recipe?     

932
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,847
             The devil, I guess.
        I don't know. I made it.

933
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:45,182
  This is the cast              
   of characters?               

934
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:48,785
      Some peppers, some onions.
          Get the chicken going.

935
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:51,054
           I grow these peppers,
            and then I can them.

936
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:52,455
   Yellow peppers.              

937
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:53,790
              Just a little bit 
               of marinara on.  

938
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:54,858
      Sriracha.                 

939
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,193
                 Do you want    
          some of that in yours?

940
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:58,261
Just, yeah, put a little        
taste of it in there.           

941
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,330
               Just cut it up   
      a little bit, the chicken.

942
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:02,999
      Cut it right on the grill.
                Throw it in.    

943
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:04,467
               Throw a little   
               pasta in there.  

944
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:08,004
Mm. Wow, that's a portion, huh? 
      That's good. Look at that.

945
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:11,474
 Now what, a little             
Parmesan cheese on top?         

946
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,676
   Mm. The pepper               
   and the chicken              

947
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:16,146
and the spice really            
 go together great.             

948
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:17,814
    Those peppers               
 are dynamite, man.             

949
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,683
All I want to do is find        
more of those peppers.          

950
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:22,485
    -Spicy, absolutely great.   
            -Alfredo.           

951
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:25,288
There's not too many places that
 you would go even in Pittsburgh

952
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,624
     where you'd find these     
      kind of pasta dishes,     

953
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,627
  and then you also find wings  
    and burgers and bar food.   

954
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,696
           -Thank you.          
    -And grandma's pierogies.   

955
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:34,631
 Homemade pierogies, very good. 

956
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,700
   They're great.               
I'll tell you this, Moondog.    

957
00:35:36,702 --> 00:35:39,970
It's not what I would           
expect to find at a lounge.     

958
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:42,372
What makes it so good?          
          Big guy, big portions.

959
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:44,908
How tall are you?               
                      I'm 6'10".

960
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:48,979
There's not much of this        
right now that I'm enjoying.    

961
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:51,848
   Coming up, a rocking music   
     venue in Kansas City...    

962
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,115
          That's cool.          

963
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,851
     ...hitting a high note     
     with their meatloaf...     

964
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,253
          I like that.          

965
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:58,855
   ...and headlining a hot dog  
     bacon deep-fried trio.     

966
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,156
 I've been all over the country.

967
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,390
       I don't think we've      
        ever seen anybody       

968
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:02,659
 adulterate a dog in this form. 

969
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,633
   So here I am in Kansas City  
ion the Crossroads Art District.

970
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:10,967
 Now, does that sound familiar? 

971
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:13,703
     Well, it should because    
I'm like a block and a half away

972
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,771
    from one of our favorite    
     "Triple D" characters,     

973
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:17,841
       Stretch, you know,       
    and his joint, Grinders.    

974
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,576
       So what is it about      
       this neighborhood?       

975
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:22,712
   I mean, we're talking music  
    venue with homemade food    

976
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:24,047
   like this joint, The Brick.  

977
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:26,048
     ♪ Oh, the night is for     
          the lovers ♪          

978
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,784
 Came for the music,            
stayed for the food.            

979
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:29,652
       Meatloaf sandwich,       
       sweet potato fries.      

980
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:30,654
       Best meatloaf ever.      

981
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:32,188
        The apple butter        
        and Brie for you.       

982
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,725
Brie and apple butter,          
delicious on rye bread.         

983
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:37,127
    I don't even                
consider it bar food.           

984
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:40,263
    She sort of elevates bar    
      food to a new level.      

985
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:42,932
      FIERI: She is former      
      bartender Sheri Parr.     

986
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:45,668
  I cook. I clean.              
  I book the bands.             

987
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,870
      Welcome to The Brick.     
  Sounds like you own the joint.

988
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,739
I own the joint.                
          Oh, you own the joint.

989
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:51,540
          Since '99...          
       -Here we go, folks.      

990
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,343
...when she started cranking out
        bar food her way.       

991
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:54,544
          Meatloaf is coming up.

992
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:55,678
   It's better than bar food.   

993
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,147
Crunchy Thai chicken salad,     
   that is super.               

994
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,016
Pork tenderloin just to die for.

995
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:01,150
       Oklahoma and Thai.       

996
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,486
    Oklahoma dog,               
they deep-fried the hot dog.    

997
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:04,754
It's wonderful.                 
       What are we making first?

998
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:07,223
  The Oklahoma dog.             
We're making the batter.        

999
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,825
It's got flour, sugar...        
                           Okay.

1000
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:11,027
   Baking powder,               
a little salt and one egg.      

1001
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:12,629
              Mix that together.
With some beer.                 

1002
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:14,831
             Want me to drizzle?
Please.                         

1003
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,632
                So what do...   
                Oh, in there.   

1004
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:17,900
 Oh, that's good.               
                         Really?

1005
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,168
               That's a pretty  
             tight batter, huh? 

1006
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,370
                 What are we    
          going to do with this?

1007
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:23,039
We have a quarter-pound         
  all-beef hot dog.             

1008
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,108
Wrap the bacon around them      

1009
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,110
 and then roll it in            
  the beer batter.              

1010
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:29,312
     We're going to deep-fry it?
Yes.                            

1011
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:31,381
      -Oh, that is just...      
     -Toasted sourdough bun.    

1012
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:32,715
   And then I get               
 my toothpicks out.             

1013
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,785
  One, two, three.              
All right. Oklahoma dog.        

1014
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:38,722
               Holy schnikey.   
             This is ridiculous.

1015
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:40,323
Yeah, it is.                    
  Does anything else go on this?

1016
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:41,791
Yeah. We can put some mustard   
and some onions on it.          

1017
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,927
That's how we serve it.         
         That's how we serve it.

1018
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,795
I got to just take a look at it.
              So there you are. 

1019
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,263
 You're walking down the street,
              and someone says, 

1020
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,266
               "Hey, how about  
       4,000 calories in a bun?"

1021
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,535
                     Mm.        

1022
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:55,205
                That's cool.    
 I've been all over the country.

1023
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:56,406
             I don't think we've
              ever seen anybody 

1024
00:37:56,408 --> 00:37:58,475
  adulterate a dog in this form.

1025
00:37:58,477 --> 00:38:00,543
      Super-mega-juicy-hotdog --
              that's one word,  

1026
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:01,878
            wrapped in le bacon,
               that's French,   

1027
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,212
          so you know it's good,

1028
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:06,148
     crunchified in beer batter,
            that's funkalicious.

1029
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,751
           That, you got to try.
              You, bad person.  

1030
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,420
  I need another Oklahoma dog.  

1031
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:11,821
           Absolutely delicious.

1032
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:13,289
             The bacon, I think,
            is what sets it off.

1033
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,824
         It is awesome,         
       definitely filling.      

1034
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,360
It's just really, really good.  
That's a Brick dish.            

1035
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:20,162
 FIERI: Which means handmade... 
Cuban chicken 4 minutes.        

1036
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,698
         ...and classic,        
         but different.         

1037
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,433
   The pubbie with              
 sweet potato fries.            

1038
00:38:23,435 --> 00:38:25,101
    The menu is full of them.   
Order in.                       

1039
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:27,570
     I need another Oklahoma dog
  and another apple butter Brie.

1040
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:29,905
     I knew she could cook,     
   but I didn't know how well.  

1041
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:32,174
      I got a Brick burger,     
  a Cuban and a meatloaf down.  

1042
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:34,444
 It's always got a lot of flair 
      and spice and flavor.     

1043
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:35,778
     Cuban chicken sandwich.    

1044
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,246
You can tell it's all homemade. 

1045
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,582
You guys really have the time   
to do all this kind of stuff?   

1046
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:42,518
We make the time. It's important
   to us that things taste good.

1047
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,521
    -Like this heavy hitter.    
  -Fabulous meatloaf sandwich.  

1048
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,457
        Piece of meatloaf       
       is just wonderful.       

1049
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:49,392
     It's better than mom's.    
      -And scratch-made...      

1050
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:51,528
        -I got meatloaf.        
   -Right down to the ketchup.  

1051
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,063
    Chipotle ketchup, killer.   
           I'm a fan.           

1052
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,465
       We're going to make      
        chipotle ketchup.       

1053
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:56,799
Great.                          
     First, some olive oil.     

1054
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:59,202
      We saute the onions.      
        Salt and pepper.        

1055
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:00,603
So the onions have sweated?     

1056
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:03,406
   We add apple cider vinegar,  
  brown sugar, chipotle pepper, 

1057
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:04,607
     chipotle pepper sauce.     

1058
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,676
 Which is called...             
Five dollar question.           

1059
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:07,811
              Adobo.            
Very nice.                      

1060
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:09,879
          Tomato paste,         
  Worcestershire, Worcester...  

1061
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:10,880
  What is the word?             

1062
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:12,548
           I can cook,          
      but I can't say that.     

1063
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,951
Just say Wor...                 
             Wor...             

1064
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:16,820
...chesh, chesh, chesh, chesh.  
  Wor-che, che, che, che, che.  

1065
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:19,556
  Then we mix this up, and then 
   we add the pureed tomatoes.  

1066
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:21,090
So, no ketchup goes in this.    

1067
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,092
This is all you just            
 doing it your way.             

1068
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,762
Right. We like to do it our way.
Smells great.                   

1069
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:28,364
Let this sit there and simmer.  
  An hour, and hour and a half. 

1070
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,033
     Now that it's simmered,    
   fresh-squeezed lime juice.   

1071
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,234
 Little brightness,             
    little acid.                

1072
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:33,102
Break down the onions.          
  We're good to go.             

1073
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,371
I just want to taste            
   this by itself.              

1074
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,973
  Oh. I like that.              
That's good ketchup.            

1075
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:38,308
      Thank you very much.      

1076
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,642
     And this is                
for the meatloaf sandwich?      

1077
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:41,043
              -Yes.             
    -Okay. What are we onto?    

1078
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,979
      Meatloaf.                 
I make it all in the same pan   

1079
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:44,981
that I'm going to cook it in.   
     Seven eggs.                

1080
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,583
                That's a lot    
             of liquid chicken. 

1081
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:48,050
Homemade marinara, onions.      

1082
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,120
           So this is a gigantic
               dump and stir.   

1083
00:39:50,122 --> 00:39:52,389
           I love the rye bread.
          Haven't seen that one.

1084
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:53,790
Such delicious bread.           

1085
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:55,859
Add a little Worcestershire,    
parsley, little salt.           

1086
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:57,727
                    Some pepper.
We mix all of this up.          

1087
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,863
      I can get my foot in there
             if you need me to. 

1088
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:02,132
 And then 10 pounds             
  of ground chuck.              

1089
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:05,134
 And mix that all up thoroughly,
           form the grande loaf,

1090
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,403
         wrap it in foil, pop it
  in the oven, what temperature?

1091
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,205
425, about 1 1/2 hour.          

1092
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:11,140
              Remove the foil...
 The last 1/2 hour.             

1093
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:12,876
             Let it get all nice
and crusty brown on the outside.

1094
00:40:12,878 --> 00:40:14,343
 Yeah. Okay?                    
                          Yeah. 

1095
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:15,545
  Now that goes on the flat top?

1096
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:17,079
        On the flat top.        
    Will you hand me the oil?   

1097
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:21,150
           All right.           
Hand her thing, takes...        

1098
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,486
I almost did drop it.           
    Put this on the flat top.   

1099
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:25,421
      I let it get kind of      
     crunchy on both sides.     

1100
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,490
Dig it.                         
         Bread toasted.         

1101
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:29,892
Wheatberry bread.               
  Pepper Jack cheese, cover it. 

1102
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:31,894
Get a little water under there, 
  melt the cheese.              

1103
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:34,497
That's what we're talking about.
Our meatloaf, nice and easy.    

1104
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:38,100
There you go.                   
        Chipotle ketchup.       

1105
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,369
           All right.           
      Get that other piece.     

1106
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:41,103
             -Nice.             
            -Cut it.            

1107
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,772
           The Brick's          
       meatloaf sandwich.       

1108
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:46,575
         Was the name Brick just
    because of the size of this?

1109
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:48,844
                     Mm.        
        That's a real good move.

1110
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,313
            The meatloaf has got
            really nice texture.

1111
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:51,714
            The rye bread really
              plays in nicely.  

1112
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:53,049
              Mm. That's crazy. 

1113
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,850
            The chipotle ketchup
     carries the torch for this,

1114
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:57,253
        but the wheatberry bread
   really does give nice crunch,

1115
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:58,654
          a wholesomeness to it.

1116
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:02,057
 Good job, Ms. Chipotle Ketchup.
       That's just how we do it.

1117
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:03,593
Here's your meatloaf            
and sweet potato fries.         

1118
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:05,461
            I dig it.           
   It's a last-meal sandwich,   

1119
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,798
        you know, moist,        
     spicy and crusty bread.    

1120
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,533
  WOMAN: Their meatloaf is some 
   of the best I've ever had.   

1121
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:12,335
The chipotle ketchup,           
I think, is the kicker.         

1122
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:14,871
         I think so too.        
        It's really good.       

1123
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:16,672
                       Carolina.
       We got a Carolina.       

1124
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,808
         Food has always        
         been wonderful.        

1125
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,142
       I love everything.       

1126
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,411
           You come here to eat,
       you're going to be happy.

1127
00:41:21,413 --> 00:41:23,346
       -Turkey Florentine?      
  -And it's not just the food.  

1128
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:25,481
      It's the atmosphere.      

1129
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,816
See your friends play some music

1130
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,484
  and have a meatloaf sandwich, 
     and it's a good night.     

1131
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,886
     Excellent job. It's quaint.
           It's got good energy.

1132
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,755
                You're here,    
         make the food yourself.

1133
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:34,891
  To me, what more              
 could you ask for?             

1134
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:36,692
         It's the bomb.         

1135
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:38,495
   It's the Brick.              

1136
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:40,830
    That's it for this week,    
      but don't you worry.      

1137
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,432
 I'll be looking for more joints
     all over this country.     

1138
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:47,103
    I'll see you next week on   
 "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives." 

1139
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,104
You know this is going Roadhouse

1140
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:51,374
                when you have   
             non-matching forks.

1141
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:52,709
                  Awesome.      

1142
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:55,845
That is the entree fork,        
and that is the entree fork.
