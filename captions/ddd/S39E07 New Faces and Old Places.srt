 <i> Now we're going to mix it up.</i> 

112
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,875
      What the pikliz does,     
   it breaks everything down,   

113
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:41,546
   because there's heat there,  
         but the vinegar        
     kind of makes it light.    

114
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,749
     -You get that, like...     
      -[Marcus] That bite.

  -[Patrick] That little kick.

  I want to two gallons of it.  

118
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:56,028
  It's tangy, it's a little bit 
     sweet, but it's unique     
     to the Haitian cuisine.    

119
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,262

      And what's this one?      

121
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:01,633

      -So tender, you know.     

124
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,572
        First thing we do       
        for the chicken,

   and then we're gonna put it  
          in the gravy.         

130
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:25,724
   Chop onions, green pepper,   
   red pepper, marinara sauce,  

131
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,059

132

      it's ready to plate.      

137
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:42,607
  The poulet en sauce is ready. 

138
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,412
   -You got to try the chicken  
         with the sauce.

142

    It's flavorful, sizzling,   
           well fried,          

143
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,226
      it's a hallmark dish      
   for the Haitian community.   

144
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,762
      The chicken is ready,     
       I need two pikliz.

    refrigerator overnight...   

323
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,272
             -Okay.             
       -...for it to set.       

324
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,674
         -Po' boy time.         
      -All right, so I have     
      my Dutch Crunch bread     

325
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:32,477
   that I've toasted and then   
      I have my vegan mayo,     

326
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,546
       mustard, tomatoes,       
        shredded lettuce.       

327
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,916
           -I like it.          
   -And then I have my seitan.  

328
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,352
     A little bit more mayo,    
  squeeze a little lemon juice. 

329
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,989
   It weighs about 10 pounds.   

330
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:51,896
      I don't know exactly      
    what po' boy I'm having,    

331
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,364
     but there's no question    
        that's a po' boy.       

332
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,033
       [Tamearra] Po' boy       
         with fries up.         

333
00:13:56,302 --> 00:14:00,238
      Everything is always      
           very fresh           
      and vibrant flavors,      

334
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,074
     a lot of variety among     
   the flavors of the dishes.   

335
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:05,376
  And this jambalaya is great.  

336
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,379
       Two jambalayas up.       

337
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,581
    We are going to go ahead    
        and add some oil,       

338
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,483
       because we're gonna      
          saute onions,         

339
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,454
   red and green bell pepper,   
      celery, fresh garlic,     

340
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,456
    black pepper and cayenne,   

341
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,924
            cilantro            
     and there's some love.     

342
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:23,594
  Gonna mix that in really well 
    and add our tomato puree,   

343
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,864
  garlic powder, basmati rice.  

344
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,799
     After it's ready to go,    

345
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,402
   we're just going to top it   
       with our unbattered      
    and unfried gator bites.    

346
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,371
           So this is           
      our Jazzn' Jambalaya.     

347
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:38,742
     It's got a really rich     
 peppery flavor, not too spicy. 

348
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:40,612
        -It's just right.       
        -It's delicious.        

349
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,183
   Just because it's not meat   
 doesn't mean you can't have... 

350
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,618
           real food.           

351
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:49,487
      Since, Guy, you know,     
  has approved it, so to speak, 

352
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,756

        of ghost kitchen,

       and delivery only,       

357
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,970

    a great neighborhood bar,   

375
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,881
  well, you're probably looking 
  for a place that's been there 
          for a while,          

376
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,884
         so here we are

      it's not pretentious,

          to come back.         

385
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:18,709
    I come over once or twice   
   or even three times a week.  

386
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:21,445
    I do come for two things,   
     good food and Moondog.     

387
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,448
      [Guy]<i> AKA Ron Esser.</i>      

388
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:24,648
  Why do they call you Moondog? 

389
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,717
  I actually used to play music 
          for a living          

390
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,519
   and that was my stage name.  

391
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,721
      He has another name,      
           "Lionhead."          

392
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,656
       I could actually do      
        a killer version        
           of the Lion

  and he represents Pittsburgh, 
     friendly and welcoming.    

397
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,101
     So, what are we making?    

398
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,202
         Chicken Diablo.        

399
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,270
      Who made the recipe?      

400
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,739
  The devil, I guess. [laughs]  

401
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,475
        This is the cast        
         of characters?         

402
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:53,678
      Peppers, some onions,     
     get the chicken going,     

403
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,347
      I grow these peppers      
       and then I can 'em.      

404
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,415
      [Guy] Yellow peppers.     

405
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,016
     [Ron] Just a little bit    
          of marinara.          

406
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,352
           -Sriracha.           
        -Do you want some       
        of that in yours?       

407
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,621
     Just add a little taste    
         of it in there.        

408
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,490
  Just cut it up a little bit,  
          throw it in,          

409
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,758
      -throw a little pasta     
            in there.           
              -Wow.             

410
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,260
     -That's a portion, huh?    
          -That's good.         

411
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,694
          Look at that.         

412
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,031
           Now, we add          
    a little parmesan cheese    
             on top.            

413
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,899
              Hmm.              

414
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,902
   The pepper and the chicken   
     and the spice really go    
         together great.        

415
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,905
   When you work in a kitchen,  
     you're like an artist.     

416
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,441
         Well, you know,        
         the chef paints        
         his masterpiece        

417
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,642
  upon the canvas of the plate. 

418
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:25,843
          That's right.         

419
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:29,580
   You know, you can only make  
        the same painting       
         so many times,         

420
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:31,048
    then you have to come up    
        with a new idea.        

421
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:34,919
    With the Diablo, we used    
       a lot of different,      
       fresh ingredients.       

422
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,588
        All I want to do        
 is find more of those peppers. 

423
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,525
  We took it to the next level  
     with our new creation.     

424
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:41,859
  Here's your shrimp cavatappi, 
             enjoy.             

425
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,729
    I have shrimp cavatappi,    
         It's delicious.        

426
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,799
      I would break my keto     
         for this pasta.        

427
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:53,270
     Add a little olive oil,    
          shrimp, salt,         
       some white pepper,       

428
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:57,675
  garlic, shallots, mushrooms,  
    fresh spinach, tomatoes,    
          red peppers,          

429
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,877
    and our feta cream sauce    
       which is basically       

430
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:04,548
     roasted red pepper soup    
  with feta cheese added to it. 

431
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,750
         So, now we add         
         our cavatappi,         

432
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:10,621
       put it in the bowl,      
  now we add our shrimp, basil, 

433
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,358
         and then top it        
   with some parmesan cheese.   

434
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,961
        Shrimp cavatappi.       

435
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,897
  The tomatoes and the shrimp,  
   it's a perfect combination,  

436
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:23,501
      <i> it's not too spicy</i>       
   <i> and the flavor just pops.</i>   

437
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:24,635
  It's creamy, it's delicious,  

438
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:25,837
        just enough spice       
       comfortable level,       

439
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:28,706
  but not enough where you have 
     to drink all your beer.    

440
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,309
   It's a very colorful dish.   

441
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,710
   You're a very colorful guy,  
            Moondog.            

442
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,513
       When Triple-D came       
         the first time,        

443
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,915
    <i> they said we were gonna</i>    
           <i> get busy.</i>           

444
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,383
        <i> They didn't say</i>        
  <i> we were gonna get crushed,</i>   

445
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,651
         but, hey, man,         
        it's a blessing.        

446
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,921
       We saw the pierogis      
         on the episode         
     and decided to stop in.    

447
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:46,657
    I think one of the things   
    that's interesting about    
          is pierogis,          

448
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:47,792
  that you're handmaking those. 

449
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,461
          That might be         
       a Pittsburgh thing,      
          I don't know.         

450
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,663
         So I get a glob        

451
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,765
        of this mixture,        
         now I get some         
        more flour down.        

452
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:58,603
      -Looking pretty good      
         at this point.         
      -It looks beautiful.      

453
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:00,671
         -Is it gonna be        
        a pierogi party?        
             -Yeah.             

454
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,072
     [Guy] Now what happens     
           to 'em now?          

455
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,341
  [Ron] We boil them for about  
          five minutes.         

456
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,343
        Pretty enormous.        

457
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:06,744
 [Ron] These are real pierogis. 

458
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,247
   There you go, look at that.  

459
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,484
    Hmm, I'm tellin' you that   
    is about simple goodness    
          right there.          

460
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:16,420
       We still have them       
       and they're great.       
         They love them.        

461
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,955
    But you better get ready.   

462
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,957
   People gonna come down here  
       looking for these.       

463
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,093
       It's comfort food.       
   That's part of Pittsburgh.   

464
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:26,697
     Pittsburgh style food,     
   I would say is very hearty,  
          very filling.         

465
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,432
     It's just home cooked,     
      it's Pittsburgh food.     

466
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,834
  Here's your meatloaf, Sarah.  

467
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:33,437
   Today, I got the meatloaf,   
     it's always excellent.     

468
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,306
         You start with         
       ground meat, eggs,       

469
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:37,708
  so we get it nice and gushy.  

470
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,577
    Gushy as a culinary term.   

471
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,646
      So, then we add salt      
           and pepper,          

472
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:46,316
       marjoram, mustard,       
      thyme, bread crumbs,      
          some onions,          

473
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:47,652
      and you just mix all      
            this up,            

474
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,321
     we're going to press it    
   in the pan, so we form it,   

475
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,722
      and then we're going      
        to turn it over,        

476
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,391
     put it on a sheet tray,    

477
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,860
       then we add ketchup      
         and bay leaves,        

478
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,596
    we're going to bake this    
    for about an hour at 325,   

479
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,332
       and then cut about       
       three nice pieces,       

480
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,466
      some gravy over top.      

481
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:06,337
       And there, you have      
 our wonderful meatloaf dinner. 

482
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,605
       [woman] It's juicy,      
           it's thick.          

483
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,608
    I don't even want to say    
      it's as good as mom's     

484
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,076
  'cause it's probably better.  

485
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,611
      [man] It tastes like      
     home cooked meatballs.     

486
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,746
           I would say          
    it's a very rich flavor.    

487
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,615
 <i> I have had most of the dishes</i> 
     <i> that they serve here,</i>     

488
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,551
         and this is one        
        of my favorites.        

489
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,419
   [man 2] I have so much food  
         in this place.         

490
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:23,887
        You get the bang        
         for your buck.         

491
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,089
  I'll tell you this, Moondog.  

492
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:26,957
     <i> It's not what I would</i>     
  <i> expect to find at a lounge.</i>  

493
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:29,693
      If you're gonna cook,     
        you might as well       
          do it, right?         

494
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:32,129
      -Go big or go gnome.      
             -Right.            

495
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,766
       Dirty Cajun fries,       
            table 54.           

496
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:38,369
 And that, ladies and gentlemen 
        is what makes up        

497
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:39,569
      the Triple-D nation.      

498
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:41,105
             -Enjoy.            
           -Thank you.          

499
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:44,575
     And I can't wait to see    
        what other places       
        have been up to.        

500
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,643
            -Cheers.            
         -Cheers, guys.         

501
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:46,710
   We'll catch you next time.   

502
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,113
  If I called it my love spice, 

503
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:51,382
     there would be a whole,    
     big problem with that,     

504
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,250
      but when you're cute,     
         and you can go,        

505
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,718
     "I call it love spice."    

506
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,054
     But not if I called it     
           love spice.          

507
00:20:57,123 --> 00:21:00,124
   If I called it love spice,   
      "Oh, he's a weirdo."
