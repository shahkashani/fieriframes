that'll go in the brine         
  for the chicken.              

46
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,373

50
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,780
We'll start with the water,     
apple-cider vinegar.            

51
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,516
    It'll make it               
a little bit sweeter.           

52

 Yeah.                          

53

          the beginning of pain.

55
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,588
   Yeah, exactly.               
    Kosher salt.                

56
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,324
    Just a pinch                
 of red-chili flake.            

57
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,192
              Just a little bit.
 A little bit.                  

58
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,661
Whole garlic cloves,            
 and cayenne pepper.            

59
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:12,197
               Very diabolical. 
Bring it to a boil.             

60
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,732
             Then you'll go with
          the immersion blender?

61
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,335
   Yeah. Strain it              
and it'll be ready to go.       

62
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:17,603
          I'm just gonna stir it

63
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:20,539
           and see if it'll take
         my polish off my watch.

64
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,408
      It might.                 
It's like a slow heat.

67
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:29,414
So this'll be the brine         
  for the chicken.              

68
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,815
Start with whole milk,          

69
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,485
  some buttermilk,              
and this is the house hot.      

70
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,153
              Chicken goes down 
      in the brine for how long?

71
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,356
 24 hours.                      
                And we'll make  
                the dry dredge. 

72
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,958

  ...onion powder

76

    Mix that up.                

77
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,236
         You'll go straight from
       the brine into the flour.

78
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,171
        Yep.                    

79
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:54,306

 Yes.

   Back-back-back.

 350.                           

84
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,848

to, like, crisp...              
                          Okay.

  of fusion places,             

214
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:30,215

 of both the Latin and the Asian

217
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,621

   But it took a winding road   

219
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,891
      to get to this point      
        for Chef Amy Le.        

220
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,292
      I grew up                 
in the restaurant business.     

221
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,693
      Mom owned                 
Chinese restaurants,            

222
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,095
 went to school here            
to become a journalist,         

223
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,430
      did that                  
    for a while.                

224
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:47,365
   That's what most people do --
              journalism, food. 

225
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,367
And then, I was doing           
an Asian sandwich truck,        

226
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:50,434

227

           Okay, you met a buddy
               that had a...?   

228
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,905
    He was doing                
 some Latin cooking.            

229
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,707

232
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,713
     she's taking that idea     
      and running with it.      

233
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,314
    I didn't want               
  to just have taco             

234
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,583
and throw some kimchi           
    on it, right?               

235
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,317
                         Right. 
  I really wanted               
to have these flavors           

236
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,653

really marry each other.        

237
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,988
I wanted to make it authentic   
 and real and true.             

238
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,124

we got our Asian paella.

00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,526
          The rice has          
    a lot of Spanish flavor,    

240
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:16,995
 and then they have Asian spices

241
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,130
  that add a lot of complexity  
          to the dish.

    the flavors beautifully.    
                So what are we  
              gonna make first?

00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,136
 We're making the marinade      
   for the pork.                
                  Let's see it.

     a recipe is authentic,     

250

  when it's just like a handful 
   of this, something of that.  

251
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,483
             A tub and a lotta. 

252
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,952

288
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:48,753
