00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:44,816
                    Mmm.        

116
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,920
   Good texture in your pork -- 
  not overcooked, not dried out.

117
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,291
         Espresso-barbecue sauce
              is what makes it. 

118
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,694
     The richness of the coffee 
 gives it a little smoky flavor.

119
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,963
                     Nice job.  
   Thank you.                   

120
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:03,034
     It's got a taste that's    
     just different than        
     what you're expecting.     

121
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,103
 Can taste that hint of coffee. 

122
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,639
   It's a two-napkin sandwich.  

123
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:13,111
   I would have never expected  
    to have this kind of food   

124
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,046
   in a small town like Cable.  

125
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,115
        People come here        
   for a different experience.  

126
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,716
    You can come here and eat   

127

     flavorful-tasting food.    

128
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:24,122
     So, here's the deal. We're 
hanging out in Cable, Wisconsin,

130
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,193
             When we come back, 
               one more dish.   

131
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:31,129
    Some thing off the breakfast
         menu. What do you say? 

132
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:33,365
Sure. Let's do it.              
               See you in a bit.

133

00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,845
                 You told me    
     that breakfast is big here.

137
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,114
              So we're tell me  
          what we're gonna make.

138
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:52,384
  We're gonna make              
crème brûlée French toast.      

139
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,553

        What are we making here?
              What's this part? 

142
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,728
     This is our                
 caramelized pears.             

143
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,598
We start with a little butter.  
Then we add our slice pears.    

144
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,869
Here we're gonna make           
 our caramel sauce.             

145
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,070
  Evaporated milk.              
          Evaporated milk? Okay.

146
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:16,942
White sugar, brown sugar,       
  dark corn syrup.              

147
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:20,211
 So, we let that get            
a little gooey and caramel-y.   

148
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,480
  We let our pears              
  keep going here.              

149
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:26,417
And then we're gonna hit it     
with a little creme de cacao.   

150
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,353
                        Great.  
We let this reduce down.        

151
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,622
These get a little caramel-y    
  and brown and --              

152
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,023

157
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,839
                 So a little    
              hazelnut liqueur? 

158
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,975
   And cinnamon.                
   Whisk that up.               

159
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,644
Then we're gonna make

 crushed pecans and             
crushed toasted hazelnuts.

166
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,862

our caramelized pears           

167

 would think I'm having dessert.

174
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,424
    The nuts on it are the key, 
 and the way you ground them up,

175

    'cause you really allow them
        to work with the batter

              the whole thing.  

179
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,501
    You just do all these things

   The clam dish is delicious.  

225
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,261
  It has a lovely, light sauce  
   with just a touch of wine.   

226
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,131
      What are                  
we gonna make first, chef?      

227
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,933
              Vongole positano  
              with the clams.   

228
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,602
         First, we're gonna make
               the tagliolini.  

229
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,071
And this is an extruder. So,    
it's gonna make out the pasta.  

230
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:10,608
 So, some semolina.             
You throw the egg in?           

231
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,143
                    Yep.        

232
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,745
             Cut it right here. 

233
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:16,347
Okay, so now we're gonna spread 
  it out even more.             

234
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,483
                         Yes.   
   And then cut it              
 for the tagliolini.            

235
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,885
               That's correct.  
  Got it.                       

236
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:24,355
Okay, we got the pasta ready.   
 All right, next up?            

237
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:28,293
         Extra virgin olive oil,
                some garlic.    

238
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,094
           These are baby clams.

239
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,663
You got to love Baltimore       
  and the seafood.              

240
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,831
              We'll add a little
                  chili pepper. 
    A little                    
red chilli flake.               

241
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,099
             Herbs de provence. 

242
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,634
A little white wine.            
                     White wine.

243
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,236
      Cover them till they open.
               A little salt.   

244
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:42,240
May be some fireworks.          

245
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,175
    And next up?                

246
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:49,047
  Some of our heirloom tomatoes.
      Now we have some spinach. 

247
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,248
Now we drop the pasta?          
                            Yes.

248
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,417
             Couple of minutes. 

249
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,389
So, we finish the pasta         
  just a little bit             

250
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:00,991
right there in the pan?         
                       Exactly. 

251
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,261
Then the clams go in            
       on top.                  

252
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,802
   Mmm. Delicious.              

253
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:13,604
There's a lot of flavor,        
 simple ingredients.            

254
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,540
Boy, I love the spinach         
 included in there.             

255
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,274
      The clams                 
 aren't overcooked.             

256
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,943
I think out of everything,      

257
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:22,480
the tomatoes are what add       
the diversity to the dish.      
        They're very important. 

258
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,417
Coming from Naples, you're      
gonna do a dish like this,      

259
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,752
 you better deliver,            
and you sure delivered, man.    

260
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:30,188
  That is awesome.              
     Fantastic.                 

261
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,226
    Just has the right amount   
     of herbs in the sauce.     

262
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,762
     Gino is very particular    
        about making sure       

263
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:40,298
 that he gets whatever is fresh 
            that day.           

264
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,099
            You guys            
       are from this area?      
Yes.                            

265
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:45,035
  Lots of Italian joints -- How 
  any of these kinds of places  

266
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,172
        you can sit here        
    and watch everybody cook?   

267
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:48,439
  Not a whole lot.              

268
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,974
                 Everything     
             just comes together

269
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,710
              in an atmosphere  
              that's buzzing.   

270
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,579
    TROIA: Ravioli ai funghi.   

271
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:57,748
   Ravioli with a cream sauce,  
         wild mushrooms,        

272
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,117
    and sprinkles of truffles   
             on top.            

273
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:02,720
Now we're gonna make            
the filling for the ravioli.    
                            Yes.

274
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,123
           Our first ingredient 
        is the cooked mushrooms.

275
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,058
       Cremini                  
 and the shiitakes?             

276
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,259
                        Yes.    
   All right.                   

277
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,929
                Goat cheese.    
                The ricotta.    

278
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,732
            Parmigiano reggiano.
All right.                      

279
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,469
          Gonna put it together.
                  Pulse it.     

280
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:18,937
 Not too much?                  
                     No, no.    

281
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:20,638
 You want to have               
   some texture.                
                      Exactly.  

282
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:27,011
                 Beautiful.     
        Now I'm gonna fill them.
Great.                          

283
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,214
                    Okay.       
  Okay.                         

284
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,551
 I'm gonna put a little egg wash
    so that they seal together. 

285
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:36,154
 All by hand, baby.             
Get all the air out.            

286
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:38,623
        Get some of the air out.

287
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,626
   I'm going to cook the ravioli
              in boiling water. 
Got it.                         

288
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:42,693
 All right, next up?            

289
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,562
               A little butter. 
    Okay.                       

290
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,931
             Caramelized onions.

291
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,700
            Next, half-and-half.
Half-and-half? Okay.            

292
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,837
               A little Marsala.
Nothing loves mushrooms         
 more than Marsala.             

293
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,840
So, we get the pasta till it's  
about 3/4 of the way done,      

294
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,042
   then finish it               
   in the sauce?                
                         Yes.   

295
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,511
  And then we shave some truffle
                on top of it.   

296
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,179
  I have a massive              
 truffle addiction.             

297
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,316
If you have truffles and        
don't know what to do           
with them, send them to me.     

298
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,124
  I'm gonna put a little truffle
               on top of them.  

299
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,194
     It's okay.                 
 Have a heavy hand.             

300
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:17,362
               Buon appetito.   

301
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:23,468
     It's rich.                 
     It's light.                

302
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,236
    It's earthy.                

303
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,672
 That's outrageous.             

304
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:30,608
I mean, you hand-make           
    everything --               

305
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,477
 pasta, the filling.            

306
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,812
 Delicious dish.                
                      Thank you.

307
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,047
     Outrageous.                

308
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,217
      It just almost melts      
         in your mouth.         

309

     MAN: When you taste it,    

310
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,289
      the mushrooms and the     
  natural flavors come through.

           So, break it down.   

312
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,693
  I never had anything so good  
           in my life.          

313
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,631
 It's so delicious. It's really 
     tender, very flavorful.    

314
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,768
A place like this, good food -- 
What more could you ask for?    

315
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,103
         It's the bomb.

they had in their town.         

320
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,185

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,380
      I'm in the Whiteaker      
 neighborhood of Eugene, Oregon.

330
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,781
 Now, why am I here to check out

331
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,516
       this masterful meat      
         in the middle?         

332
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:48,052
    I mean, what's at "steak"   
 for this new "Triple D" joint? 

333
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,054
 Well, from what a lot of people
            tell me,            

334
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,457
 this is the coolest thing going
       since sliced bread.      

335
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,992
  This is The Sandwich League.  

336
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,930
       Man, it's awesome.       

337
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,998
Got a Pork-A-Licious            
  and Sloppy Fries.             

338
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,734
 Probably some of the best food 
   I've ever put in my mouth.   

339
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,803
Dawn does it all in the kitchen.

340
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:10,875
FIERI: That's chef Dawn Sellars,
who cashed in her 401(k) in 2012

341
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:12,343
   to build her own food truck  

342
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:15,346
            inspired            
  by her favorite superheroes.  

343
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,548
            So, Sandwich League 
         after "Justice League"?
 Yes.                           

344
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,284
You can do so many things       
  with sandwiches.              

345
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,420
You can make anything           
  into a sandwich.              

346
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,888
 Got a Shroominator.            

347
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,756
       She never sends out      
   anything less than perfect.  

348
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,426
        MAN: Local meats,       
   really good ingredients --   

349
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,493
 You can't get anything better. 

350
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,429
 Got a Pork on Pork.            

351
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,964
 Perfect barbecue-pork sandwich.

352
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,298
              MAN:              
     And then it has bacon.     

353
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,867
   You add bacon to anything,   
   it's gonna make it better.   

354
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,104
  We're gonna make              
a Pork on Pork sandwich.        

355
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,840
                   Pork on Pork?
   We're gonna get              
our pork butt ready.            

356
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:46,777
We're gonna start with          
a little bit of salt, cumin.    

357
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,713
            Yeah, you use cumin 
        like you're from Mexico.
Smell it!                       

358
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,450
 And with the pork,             
I use coriander, also.          

359
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,185
Paprika, chili powder,          

360
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:56,520
good-old garlic powder --       
 'cause I love it --            

361
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,855
apple-cider vinegar.            

362
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,424
             Throw this in here?
   Yep.                         

363
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:03,328
Get that all nestled in there   
     real nice.                 

364
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,862
          That's one whole butt.

365
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,064
       It is.                   
  I like big butts.             

366
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,932
               And I cannot lie.
[ Laughs ]                      

367
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,935
                    In the oven.
350, about 3½ hours.            

368
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:13,938
  We pull the pork              
 after it comes out,            

369
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,340
  and we separate               
  all the fat out.              

370
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,810
And then we're gonna toast      
      your bun,                 

371
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,479
 and we're gonna get            
some of that delicious pork     

372
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,681
 right on the grill.            

373
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,282
     Some bacon.                

374
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:30,755
You start with the pork,        
and then we do more pork.       

375
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:33,490
     There you go. Look at that.
             Look at the magic. 

376
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,225
      And then                  
we're gonna sauce it up.        

377
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,561
We've got our barbecue sauce,   

378
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:39,663
   and we've got                
 our cheese sauce.              
                      I like it.

379
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,499
We put french fries             
on our sandwiches --            

380
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,101
three, sometimes four, depending
on the size of the fries.       

381
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,769
             It just depends on 
               if you're wild.  

382
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,038
     Nice amount                
  of cilantro slaw,             

383
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,309
     topped off                 
with crispy fried onions.       

384
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:54,278
  There you go --               
   Pork on Pork.

               Thanks, camera.

387
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:08,725
           Pork's really tender.

388
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,729
   I love the slaw 'cause I like
           the freshness of it. 

389
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,865
             You definitely have
               a lot of pork.   

390
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,733
             And it's definitely
                 very rich.     

391
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,270
               It's a monster   
               of a sandwich.   

392
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:22,940
            Quality ingredients,
            a lot of creativity.

393
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:25,209
    You are full of ideas, girl.
          I will give you that. 

394
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,778
                      Nice job. 
  Thank you.                    

395
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:31,883
        It's super-good,        
        really flavorful.       

396
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,484
                   It's gestalt.
           It's what?           

397
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,486
           The whole is greater 
      than the sum of the parts.

398
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:36,687
      I'm gonna start using     
              that.             

399
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,158
        Maybe to describe       
        the 'hood I'm in.       

400
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,493
     Whiteaker neighborhood     
        is really spunky.       

401
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:46,297
 Primarily a lot of artists and 
 freethinkers live around here. 

402
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:47,765
      My partner and I own      
        the tattoo shop.        

403
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,001
      So we eat here daily,     
       as much as we can.       

404
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,104
                Meaty Cheesy.   

405
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:55,839
     I definitely go with Meaty 
     Cheesy Goodness every time.

406
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,509
 MAN: Sometimes, grilled cheese 
       just isn't enough.       

407
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:01,646
   So you got to have           
   a little extra ooey, gooey,  
   and meaty in there.          

408
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:05,849
     So, what are we gonna make?
  We're gonna make              
a Meaty Cheesy Goodness.        

409
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,317
          Meaty Cheesy Goodness.

410
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,986
  We're gonna start             
with a barbecue sauce.          

411
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:12,657
This is mini sweet peppers,     
  serrano peppers,              

412
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:17,395
 some onion, garlic,            
black pepper, garlic powder.    

413
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:18,930
             Granulated garlic? 
                   Got it.      

414
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:24,268
Cumin, chili powder,            
paprika, salt -- not a lot --   

415
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,005
   Worcestershire,              
apple-cider vinegar,            

416
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:31,408
    brown sugar,                
    and cloves.                 
                        Wow.    

417
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,943
          That's an interesting,
                little twist.   

418
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,812
 We do tomato paste.            

419
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:37,481
    And where do all the recipes
                 come from?     

420
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,816
 It's where I keep              
 all my good stuff.             

421
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:39,884
        Cola.                   

422
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,085
We're gonna let it go           

423
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:44,021
for about 45 minutes            
     to an hour.                

424
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:46,224
      We've got                 
a beautiful chuck roast.        

425
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:49,760
I do a dry rub first, and       
then we do some "Worcestshire." 

426
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,762
             Worcester-[mumbles]
Worcester-sure-shar-shire.      

427
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:55,299
And then the oatmeal stout.     
     All right.                 

428
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,434
         In the oven. What temp?

429
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,371
350 for about 3½ hours.         

430
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:04,342
   We let it cool,              
and then we pull the roast.     

431
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,845
Take the Texas toast,           

432
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,582
      and I use                 
 Swiss and Muenster.            

433
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:12,917
                 As in Herman.  
    Yes.                        

434
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,587
And then we've got our          
caramelized onions and garlic,  

435
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:19,190
and then we're gonna            
put a little bit of             
our beef on the grill,          

436
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:21,925
And we'll just let those heat up
 just a little bit.             

437
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:27,598
So, we put the grilled onions   
on, put our roasted beef on,    

438
