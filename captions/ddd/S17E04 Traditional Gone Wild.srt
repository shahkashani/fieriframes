  with hard cider caramel sauce.

    All right, we're gonna start
    by making the cider caramel.

130
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,350
             This is hard cider.

00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,487

             light brown sugar. 

133
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,822
         You got to add         
         some fat to it.        

134
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,758
             Add some butter...

           and some heavy cream.

136

it's bobbin' for pig heads!     

229
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,663
There's a lucky winner.         

230
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,599
              So, there it is.  

231
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,334
    There we go.                

232
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,272
So, every little bit            
from the tongue to the snout.   

233
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,874
                 Jowl here.     
  We have some cheek meat there.

234
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,610
 That's my favorite.            

235
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,145
        To start with, the ears,
         since they're crunchy, 

236
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,614
               we slice those   
                really thin.    

237
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,482
               The jowl meat,   
           just sort of hunk up.

238
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,517
     That thick?                
               Oh, yeah, yeah.  

239
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,686
            It's real luscious. 
      It'll melt on your tongue.

240
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,821
     It's tongue                
will melt on your tongue.

242
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,958
              And then we have  
             the reduced juice. 

243
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,360
Oh, when that chills up,        
  that is just a --             

244
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,363
                   Jell-O.      
Yeah, that's pig Jell-O.        

245
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,965
        Little shake, make sure 
 you don't have any air pockets.
    There you go.               

246
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,834
    So, we'll go                
into the fridge with that.      

247
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,369
24 hours -- Let it set up.

   Only if Summers              
 was here to see it.            

249
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,378
            We cut it into logs,

250
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,516
             and then we just do
                some slices.    

251
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:12,984
                   We have      
           fresh corn tortillas.

                 Headcheese     
             goes right on top. 

253
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,522
         A little fresh avocado,
                queso fresco.

               Fresh cilantro.

                A lime wedge.

 <i> I'm</i> out of breath.

Can I put a little bit          
of the salsa right on it?       

262
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,040
               I recommend it.  

263
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,214
        Whoo!                   

264
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,750
I think just got a bit          
of a little earlobe             
or something like that.

     ...is raising the roof

   on the French-dip standard.  

288

pushing the boundaries.

home turf -- the wine country --

      my kind of cooking --     

293
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,856

      This is St. Francis.

     French onion burger up.

     Vegetable flatbread up.

      Consistent good food.     

299
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:12,470
     It has, like, its own      
     unique little twists       
     and quirks and flavors.    

300
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,806
FIERI: Just like the chef behind
   it all -- Aaron Chamberlin.  

301
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,075
       I grew up as a Boy Scout.

302
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,743
              I always cooked   
              on an open fire.  

303
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:22,079
  So, when he opened this joint 
             in '09,            

304
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,549
        he saw no reason        
    to do anything different.   

305
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,150
              I wanted to have  
         a big wood-burning oven

306
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,352
  so I could have my little fire
        going in my restaurant.

             FIERI:             
   Including this top seller.   

310
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,025
           Pig dip up.          

311
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,896
Just like a French dip,         
   but pork style.              

312
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:41,499
First thing we're gonna make    
is our brine for our pork.      

313
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,901
   Water goes in.               

314
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:45,035
So, bringing that up.           

315
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,439
Second thing, star anise.       
                Very strong.    

316
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:48,706
    Fennel seed.                

317
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,441
      Bay leaf.                 

318
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,443
Toasted coriander seed.         
       Of course you toasted it.

319
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,378
    Ancho chili.                

320
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,180
     We go on to                
the fresh ingredients.          

321
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:59,117
 We got thyme there             
 and fresh rosemary.            

322
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,385
    Kosher salt.                

323
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,320
 You got the sugar.             
        Boom.                   

324
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:06,658
Bring this up to boil,          
and we let it sit and marinate. 

325
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,394
 We have our brine,             
 just off the stove.            

326
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,730
      We strained all the spices
        and herbs out of there. 

327
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,464
       I have some ice that I...

328
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,200
  Oh, that's nice!              
        ...slightly cooled down.

329
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,668
             It's a good brine. 

330
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,204
 Mm! That star anise            
  is what really --             
               Comes through.   

331
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,338
                    Yeah.       
        Mmm!                    

332
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,876
           And we stick our pork
               right in there.  

333
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,878
Overnight -- 12 hours.          
                 Overnight.     

334
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,981
          We put salt and pepper
                  on it...      

335
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:32,951
                and roast it    
              in the wood oven. 

336
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,685
      What temp                 
 does the oven run?             

337
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,721
             The oven right now 
             is at 616 degrees. 

338
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,959
             Our roast is ready,

339
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,727
        and you can see how nice
           and beautiful it is. 

340
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,564
      I just come right in here.

341
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,166
Oh. That rack of ribs.          

342
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,834
    Yeah, you can smell that guy
                right there.    

343
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,103
   Are you talking              
about<i> this</i> guy, or...           

344
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,772
             Well, no, the pork.
    Okay.                       

345
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,507
           So, we have the chine
                right there,    

346
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:56,974
             and then what we do

347
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,910
          is we just slice nice,
           little, thin pieces. 

348
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,180
        Layer our sandwich here.

349
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:05,784
     Put applewood smoked bacon,
      Gruyère cheese like that. 

350
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,252
Back in the oven?               
               Back in the oven.

351
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,453
               Let that melt.   

352
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,787
            We're gonna assemble
                the sandwich.   

353
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,190
        Fennel-onion marmalade, 
        a generous amount of it.

354
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,058
                Dijon mustard   
           for a little picante.

355
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,795
               Melted cheese.   

356
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,597
               Just slide this  
                right off...    

357
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,999
   Oh, gosh.                    
                ...onto that.   

358
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,168
 We add prosciutto -- That's one
         thing we don't cook -- 

359
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,404
              and the top bun.  

360
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,672
       O-M-G.                   

361
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,874
              Cut this in half. 

362
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:32,076
              We have our nice, 
          beautiful pork au jus.
      Pig jus.                  

363
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,611
           Put that right there.

364
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,882
       Hello, Flavortown?       
 Yeah, my pig meter's going off.

365
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:43,221
Smoky, crunchy, creamy.         

366
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:45,490
I haven't even dipped           
   this thing yet.              

367
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,959
Now we're gonna take            
this bad boy for a test drive.  

368
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,365
     That's it!                 
We've hit the destination!      

369
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,432
     We're here!                

370
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,368
  That's got to be              
 within the top five            

371
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,169
best pork sandwiches            
   I've ever had,               

372
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,239
   combining that               
  with the top five             

373
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,174
 best dip sandwiches            
   I've ever had.               

374
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,044
 Outstanding.                   
                 Thank you.     

375
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,582
          WOMAN: It's delicious.
            Nice, salty flavor. 

376
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,784
                  The sauce     
               is really good.  

377
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:14,919
           The bread is crunchy,
               but not soggy.   

378
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,587
All the perfect things          
  about a sandwich.             

379
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,655
        Ohh.                    

380
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:18,990
One of the best dips            
   I've ever had.               

381
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,462
      This place definitely     
   stands out within Phoenix.   

382
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,197
       They're famous here      
         for their oven.        

383
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,332
             FIERI:             
     Which is cranking 24/7.    

384
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,668
    Well, at dinner, we actually
      cook half chickens in it, 

385
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,003
             green chilli stew. 

386
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,470
              We do flatbreads. 

387
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,072
       And at the end of dinner,
               bakers come in,  

388
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,407
          they make their bread.

389
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,675
        And when morning        
        rolls around...         

390
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:40,010
            We make our pancake 
         right in the wood oven.

391
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,480
        The iron skillet        
      olive oil pancake...      

392
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,014
          It's amazing.         

393
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,417
    First we're gonna start with
    the basic pancake batter -- 

394
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,419
            all-purpose flour...

395
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,755
               baking powder,   
            baking soda, salt...

396
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,089
                    sugar.      
  FIERI: Okay.                  

397
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,024
          Mix all the dry there.

398
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,359
                   So, for      
            the wet ingredients,

399
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,962
           I have my buttermilk,
                    eggs.       

400
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,764
    [ Whistles ]                
Good amount of buttermilk.      

401
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:03,301
           Then we put it right 
      in the middle of the well.

402
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:04,769
                 Thank you.     

403
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:09,106
    Next ingredient, we actually
    add extra virgin olive oil. 

404
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,909
            Pancake batter done.

405
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,711
     Next thing we're gonna make
         is the caramel apples. 

406
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:16,714
             Smokin' hot pan out
                of the oven.    

407
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,882
        We're gonna add butter. 
    It's gonna go quick, though.

408
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,318
     Yes, it is.                

409
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,853
     Apples.                    
                   Apples in.   

410
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,122
                   Sugar.       

411
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,057
  A little bit of vanilla paste.
           Come on, little guy. 

412
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,192
  Vanilla paste --              
Do you make this vanilla paste? 

413
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:29,427
            We don't. We buy it.

414
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:33,498
             It's the new rage, 
             and it's awesome.  

415
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,001
        Well, I'm gonna go ahead
          and make the pancake. 

416
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,137
           A lot of extra virgin
                 olive oil.     

417
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,538
You got to put a little crust   
      on this.                  

418
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,540
              We want to, like, 
               shallow fry it   

419
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,208
               so it gets nice  
              and golden brown. 

420
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,477
            So, this is actually
             a dangerous one... 

421
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,347
                'Cause as we -- 
It's bubbling over, sir.        
      Captain.                  

422
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,150
               It's all right.  
               It's all good.   
Your Honor, Your Honor.         

423
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,951
                     In.        

424
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,620
       Really?                  
And that's how it works?        
             You're gonna see it
             start puffing up,  

425
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,756
       and then the fire's gonna
       golden it -- We turn it. 

426
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:03,061
     Starting to pull up, while 
 our apples are sizzle-sizzling.

427
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,632
This guy's like a ninja.        

428
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,966
                   This is      
        an iron skillet pancake.

429
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,235
              One of the things 
  with the iron skillet pancake,

430
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,303
           is we want it to have
           a little char on it. 

431
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,240
          We don't want it to be
                 real blond.    

432
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,912
                  Apples are    
                 getting ready. 
     A little                   
apple napalm, huh?              

433
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:23,180
               Nice and crunchy.
       That's nuts.             

434
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,916
                Here we have    
           the carameled apples.

435
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,717
                  Put these     
             right over the top.

436
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,320
                A little bit    
               of maple syrup.  

437
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,522
                   Whipped      
               crème fraîche.   

438
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,190
          Extra virgin olive oil
                   on top.      

439
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,659
  Cooking pancakes              
  when I was a kid              

440
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,461
      was done                  
in a cast-iron skillet.         

441
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:37,729
    We'd pack up                
for the mountains on horses.    

442
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,130
    My dad always               
   used to sell me              

443
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:40,998
  on the idea that              
when it had a little char,      

444
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,200
it's 'cause it was rustic       
and it was campfire cooking.    
                      Yeah.     

445
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,336
                 There you go.  
 Look at that.                  

446
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,539
        Wow.                    

447
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,142
The apples are tender.          
 The cake is moist.             

448
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,276
It's got a little bit           
    of that char,               

449
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,078
  which adds to it              
so it's not so sweet.           

450
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,817
 Wow! That's pushing            
   the boundaries.              

451
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,085
  It's outrageous.              

452
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,887
        Iron skillet pancake up.

453
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,822
             WOMAN:             
 It was an emotional experience 
   for me when I first had it.  

454
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,691
   It brought tears to my eyes  
         it was so good.        

455
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,425
I don't know if I can do        
   one more dish.               

456
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,294
    You guys in?                

457
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,296
  They're in.                   
    You in?                     
                    I'm in.     

458
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:14,365
 Don't go anywhere.             
We're hanging out at St. Francis

459
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,367
in Phoenix, Arizona,            
  with Chef Aaron.              

460
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,769
Dude's off the hook.            
  See you in a bit.             

461
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:24,409
 FIERI: "Triple D" is camped out
         at St. Francis         

462
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:26,877
      in Phoenix, Arizona,      
   where Chef Aaron Chamberlin  

463
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,413
is combining handcrafted food...

464
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,148
                 CHAMBERLIN:    
     Green chili soup coming up.

465
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,750
     ...with a fiery inferno    
   for some dynamite results.   

466
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,686
                 Wood-fired     
               baked eggs up.   

467
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:38,890
    Here, even the meatballs    
    get kissed by the flames.   

468
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,091
   So, what are we              
   on to, brother?              

469
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,026
              Moroccan-inspired 
                 meatballs.     

470
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:44,028
                 We have our    
              house-made bread. 
     Okay.                      

471
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,563
                We take water   
          and we soak the bread.

472
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,764
                  Ground beef.  
     Okay.                      

473
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,033
               Ground fresh,    
               made in-house.   

474
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,301
You grind in-house?             
                    We do.      

475
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,236
          Our fresh ground pork.

476
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,371
            Garlic and shallots,
                sweated down.   
  Sweated down.                 

477
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,707
               Ground ginger,   
                  cumin...      

478
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,643
                chili powder,   
               smoked paprika.  

479
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,378
                      Salt.     
   Some salt.                   

480
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,512
                  Cilantro.     

481
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:02,847
                    Parsley.    
    Got it.                     

482
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,982
                A little bit    
              of fresh pepper.  

483
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,784
               Eggs right in.   

484
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,586
That's our binder, and then     
we'll squeeze the breadcrumbs.  

485
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:13,991
Great looking bread, man.       

486
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,860
                    Okay.       
             You know the drill.

487
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,261
            We don't want to mix
                  too much.     

488
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,864
   I don't mind seeing a little 
  chunk of bread here and there.

489
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,766
              A little rustic.  
           Then we take a scoop.

490
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:25,770
                Scoop it out.   

491
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:31,008
              In the walk-in,   
              we let it chill.  

492
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,111
                  Sear them     
              on the stovetop.  

493
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,483
All right, so, the meatballs    
    are done now.               

494
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:40,684
            Now we're gonna make
                 our sauce.     

495
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,353
This is what really takes it    
  to the Moroccan.              

496
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:45,156
    It does. We have right here 
    our house-made tomato sauce.

497
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,058
So, the first thing we add to it
               is our harissa.  

498
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:50,761
          More smoked paprika...

499
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:51,828
             ground cinnamon... 

500
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,898
               and our cumin,   
             toasted and ground.

501
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,967
                  Cilantro.     
                   We mix.      

502
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:03,840
  That's Moroccan.              

503
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,677
       Okay, so, I'm gonna ladle
          these over right now. 

504
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,982
They're gonna just kind of      
soak up that sauce and heat up. 

505
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,850
                 There you go.  
    Love it.                    

506
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,854
              We're plating up  
         the Moroccan meatballs,

507
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,856
               so we have this  
               Israel couscous  

508
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,390
            we put in the bottom
                 of the pan.    

509
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,593
                 Then we get    
               our meatballs.   

510
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,595
                 Two, three.    

511
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:27,064
               Meatball sauce.  

512
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,133
      Nice!                     
                  Right there.  

513
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:31,602
              And then we have  
              a cheese blend,   

514
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:34,071
   mixture of a couple different
     mozzarellas and a cheddar, 

515
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,106
              and in the oven.  

516
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,143
We're basically just heating up,
    making golden bubbly brown. 

517
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,745
                So, it takes    
            about seven minutes.

518
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,481
  "We're making                 
golden bubbly brown."           
                         Yep.   

519
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,752
     And then we garnish it with
     a little bit of lime juice 

520
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,821
             right over the top 
                of the meat.    

521
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,756
           A little extra virgin
                 olive oil.     

522
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,426
               Shine them up.   
               Some cilantro.   

523
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:59,430
        And then a little slice 
  of our toasted homemade bread.

524
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:00,264
        Wow.                    

525
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,903
  There's no doubt              
  that's Moroccan.              
                       Yeah.    

526
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,105
You get that harissa            
right off the bat.              
                     That spice.

527
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,243
 The meatball itself            
    is very rich.               

528
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,912
Good amount of bread.           
 Good texture to it.            

529
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,180
     Not heavy.                 

530
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:17,848
      It's got                  
 the right balance.             

531
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,750
   Great job.                   
                  Thank you.    
                  Thank you.    

532
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,185
                Meatballs up.   

533
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,521
       It's just amazing.       

534
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,857
    This is like a vacation,    
    and it's just down          
    the street from us.         

535
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,259
   You don't play               
   anything safe.               

536
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,129
     Everything                 
 is touchdown bombs.            

537
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,397
      I've had                  
an incredible visit.            
                     Thank you. 

538
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,966
   You got to come              
meet this cat. Amazing.         

539
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,670
  So, that's it for this trip,  
        but don't worry.        

540
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,271
       There's plenty more      
        "Triple D" joints       

541
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,473
      all over the country.     

542
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,207
         I'll be looking        
        for you next week       

543
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,677
               on               
 "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives."

544
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,944
        When did you have       

545
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,747
    a peanut butter and jelly   
     sandwich last, Summers?    

546
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,682
Uh...several years ago.         

547
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:53,684
I can't think of the last time  
     I had one.                 
          What, the one         
      Betsy Ross made you?      

548
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,286
    [ Laughing ]                
That's exactly right.           

549
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,754
    We went down                
before we made the flag.        

550
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,522
           [ Laughs ]
