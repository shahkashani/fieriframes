   OF A SWEETNESS TO IT.        

306
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,586

 THAT'S WHY I LIKED IT SO MUCH, 

307
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:02,987
BECAUSE IT WAS SWEET.           

308

340

   WE'VE LEARNED ON TRIPLE "D"  

341
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,133
 IS THERE'S NO SIMPLE DEFINITION
       OF WHAT A DINER IS.      

342
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:25,069
   I MEAN, IT COULD BE DEFINED  
   BY REGION, FACILITY, THEME

378
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,612
   AND WE GOT SOME BLACK PEPPER,
        GRANULATED GARLIC.      

379
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,614
    THIS IS WHAT'S GONNA MAKE IT
            OFF THE HOOK.       
REALLY?                         

380
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:45,616
            YEAH, SOME CINNAMON.
CINNAMON?! THAT SILLY LINE--    
       OFF THE HOOK.            

381
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,151
               CHOPPED ONIONS...
OKAY.                           

382
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,153
                   AND CILANTRO.
        OKAY,                   
THAT'S THE OTHER ONE--          

383
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,155
CINNAMON AND CILANTRO.          
          CINNAMON AND CILANTRO.

384
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:53,157
               RUB IT ALL DOWN, 
               TOSS 'EM AROUND, 

385
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:55,159
          MAKE SURE THEY GET    
       SOME OF THAT GOOD FLAVOR.

386
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:57,161
I CAN SMELL THE CINNAMON        
   RIGHT OFF THE BAT.           

387
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,163
     IT'S ALMOST                
LIKE A DRY RUB, OKAY.           
                IT'S ALMOST     
           LIKE A DRY RUB, YEAH.

388
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,232
  SO WE WRAP THESE UP,          
THROW 'EM IN THE WALK-IN.       

389
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,234
 HOW LONG WILL WE               
LET THESE MARINATE?             
                      OVERNIGHT.

390
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,037
LET'S GET THAT PORK STEAK GOING.
         LOOK AT THAT.          
            AND THIS IS GONNA GO
                ON THE GRILL.   

391
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,505
     IT'S BASICALLY A PORK CHOP 
            ON STEROIDS.        

392
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,642
IT'S CALLED A BLADE STEAK,      
  CUT FROM THE SHOULDER.        

393
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,644
KICKER--CINNAMON,               

394
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,778
AND I CAN SMELL THE CINNAMON    
         RIGHT NOW.             

395
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,780
     I'M GONNA PUT A LITTLE OIL 
              ON HERE,          

396
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,782
         GIVE IT A LITTLE COLOR 
            WHEN WE FLIP IT.    

397
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:21,052
                  BAD BOY'S     
            ABOUT READY TO FLIP.
A LITTLE BIT OF JUICE           
FLOATING AT THE TOP.            

398
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,320
   LOOK AT THAT.                
THAT LOOKS AWESOME.             

399
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:26,190
THAT LOOKS LIKE A MANHOLE COVER 
        IN FLAVOR TOWN.         
           AND WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

400
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,459
            THIS THING'S READY. 
           YOU CAN PLATE IT UP. 

401
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,461
                   AND WE'LL GET
                   OUR POTATOES.
A LITTLE HOME FRIES.            
   LOOK AT THAT.                

402
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,463
   LOOK AT ALL THAT JUICE       
THAT JUST SITS RIGHT ON THERE   

403
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:33,998
            FROM THAT MARINADE. 

404
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,800
         CILANTRO AND CINNAMON. 

405
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:37,802
             MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE
              GETTING USED TO,  

406
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,804
     LIKE ANOTHER COUPLE BITES,

00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:41,806
   BUT I THINK YOU GOT SOMETHING
            HERE, DUDE.         

408
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,808

        THESE FLAVORS--MMM--    

409
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:45,342
                 COMPLEMENT IT. 

410
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,344
           IT ALMOST HAS        
  A MIDDLE EASTERN FLAVOR TO IT,

411
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,880
           THAT KIND OF A KICK. 

412
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:50,548
      MY MOUTH WANTS APPLESAUCE 

413
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,885
              AS SOON AS IT     
         GETS THE CINNAMON KICK.
BUT HAVE SOME HOME FRIES        
        INSTEAD.                

414
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,887
       YOU GOTTA COME TRY THIS. 

415
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,955
     YOU'RE NEVER GONNA FIND IT 
           ANYWHERE ELSE,       

416
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,957
                 BUT I THINK    
            YOU'RE GONNA DIG IT.

  THAT DOESN'T STAND            
FOR STEAK ON A SHINGLE.         
         NO, STUFF ON A SHINGLE.

426
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:21,045
   IT'S SERVED MILITARY-STYLE   
          ON THE TRAY.

THAT'S AWESOME, DUDE.

   THE SERVICE MAKE THEIR S.O.S.

435
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,864
        A LITTLE DIFFERENT,     
   BUT THIS IS LIKE TRADITIONAL,

436
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,999
 THE WAY THE MARINE CORPS MAKES 
 IT, BECAUSE WE USE GROUND BEEF.

437
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,068
   WE'RE GONNA COME OVER HERE,  
AND WE'RE GONNA START OUR GRAVY.

   HOW TO COOK?                 

446
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,555
                 I LEARNED A LOT
                  FROM MY DAD,  

447
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,557
     AND THEN A LOT I PICKED UP 
             ON MY OWN.         

448
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,559
             NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD
              A LITTLE 2% MILK.

             SOME BLACK PEPPER. 

453
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,169

   TO DO NOW?                   
                 WE'RE GONNA DO 
                OUR KOREAN BEEF.

497
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,503
ALSO KNOWN AS BULGOGI.          
                           SURE.

00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,639
      OH, MY MOUTH'S            
ALREADY STARTING TO WATER.      
                  WE'VE GOT     
            SOME SLICED RIB EYE.

499
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,642
SUPER THINLY SLICED.            
       IT COMES EXACTLY THAT WAY
            WHEN WE GET IT.     

500
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,978
WHOSE RECIPE IS THIS?           
           ONE OF MY WAITRESSES,
                   SUSIE.       

501
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:10,180
                 ACTUALLY,      
            HER MOTHER'S RECIPE.
SO YOU'RE SEPARATING IT.        

502
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:12,182
      ONE OF THE KEYS HERE      
 IS WHEN YOU MAKE THIS MARINADE 

503
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,184
      IS THAT IT GETS           
ON BOTH LAYERS OF THE MEAT      

504
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,320
AND NOT JUST                    
ON ONE SIDE.                    
                 I'M GONNA ADD  
                SOME SESAME OIL,

505
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:17,855
                  COOKING SAKE. 

506
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,857
              OKAY, THEN WE GOT 
             OUR CHOPPED GARLIC.
NOW WHAT'S NEXT?                

507
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,792
             UH, THE ASIAN PEAR.
THAT'S A PEAR.                  

508
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:23,594
WHOO.                           
                  PEEL THE PEAR.

509
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,529
WE'RE AT PAUL'S, AND PHIL'S     
   GONNA PEEL THE PEAR.         

510
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,598
     SO YOU TAKE                
SOME OF THE SKIN OFF.           
           WE'RE GONNA GRATE IT.

511
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,667
   IT REALLY                    
MINCES IT DOWN.                 
                 IT REALLY DOES.

512
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,669
    YOU GOT HALF                
THAT ASIAN PEAR DONE.           

513
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:34,338
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF SWEETNESS
      BEING ADDED INTO IT.      
                  MINCED GARLIC,

514
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,674
    BLACK PEPPER, MINCED ONIONS 

515
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:38,208
                      AND SUGAR.
(whistles)                      

516
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,210
          IT'S GONNA GIVE IT    
       A LITTLE BIT MORE SWEET. 

517
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,213
        BROWN SOY SAUCE,        
AND WE'RE GONNA MIX THIS ALL UP.

518
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,215
NOW HOW LONG WILL YOU           
 LET THAT MARINADE?             
                      OVERNIGHT.

519
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,217
SO COVER IT UP, LEAVE IT        
IN THE WALK-IN 24 HOURS,        

520
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,285
   AND THEN, UH,                
WE'RE GOOD TO COOK?             
                   GOOD TO COOK.

521
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,287
                  A LITTLE BIT  
                 OF COOKING OIL.

522
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,356
WE'RE GONNA PUT IT IN A SKILLET,
  AND WE'RE GONNA BROWN IT UP.  
AND THAT'S ALL                  
  SHE WROTE.                    

523
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,626
           THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE.
           WE'RE GONNA SERVE IT 

524
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,628
             WITH TRADITIONAL   
           JAPANESE STICKY RICE

        SO IT'S NOT GROUND BEEF,
                REMEMBER.       

527
