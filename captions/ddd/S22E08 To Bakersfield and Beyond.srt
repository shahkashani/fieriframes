116
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,112
     FIERI: This work over here 
 with the pastries and all that.

117
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,847
                That's the --   
      That's the specialty work.

118
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,316
That's my baby.                 
         And where did you learn
              to make pastries? 

119
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,651
My mom was a great baker,       

120
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,853
and as a little girl,           
I learned how to bake.          

121
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,055
     FIERI: From baked goods    
       to hearty entrées,       

122
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,857
       there's something        
       for everyone here.       

123
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,859
Braised beef on pasta.          

124
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,461
        Braised beef over pasta?
Yes.                            

125
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,463
It's something that you         
will eat in a Greek home.       

126
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,465
 I've never seen it             
  on a Greek menu.              
                          Okay. 

127
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,466
We're gonna start out           
    with tri-tip.               

128
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,935
I'm going to season this.       

129
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:30,935
                  With...?      

130
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,204
     Our secret.                

131
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,873
               So, we can say   
        kind of a seasoned salt.

132
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:38,610
 With some oregano,             
   onion powder...              
                      I like it.

133
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,945
 Put some olive oil             
     in my pot.                 

134
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,413
    Diced onions.               

135
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,082
Gonna put the meat in there.    

136
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,884
Fresh diced tomatoes.           

137
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,152
                Tomato sauce.   

138
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,221
  And I'm gonna use             
this little gadget I have.      

139
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:50,755
        This is where things are
         gonna get interesting. 

140
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:55,160
Put my cinnamon stick           
   and my cloves.               

141
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,962
                I like this.    

142
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,630
Kitchen Bouquet for color.      

143
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,299
Water to cover this up.         

144
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,036
This is gonna go at a low       
simmer for about two hours.     

145
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,638
             The pasta's ready. 

146
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,907
This is a Greek-style pasta.    

147
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,308
         It looks like bucatini.

148
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,910
          It's got the nice hole
           in the middle of it. 

149
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,179
Now we're gonna add             
some butter to this.            

150
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,380
  This is Mizithra.             

151
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,983
                  Mizithra.     
               Greek Parmesan.  
  Exactly.                      

152
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,050
           Is it sheep's cheese?

153
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,252
        Yes.                    

154
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:22,186
   We like to give              
    big portions.               

155
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:25,190
                 Holy moly.     

156
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,259
  And there you go.             

157
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:30,595
                    Mmm.        

158
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:31,930
    The beef is nice and tender.

159
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,532
       Tri-tip is a great piece 
       of meat to use in this --

160
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:35,200
                 lot of fat,    
          lot of flavor in that.

161
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,936
               The tomatoes --  
        You definitely get that.

162
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,404
              But what makes it 
          a little bit different

163
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,606
    is that little added kick --
            cinnamon and clove. 

164
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,008
          The pasta's fantastic.

165
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,945
             It's a great dish, 
              very comforting,  

166
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,947
         made with a lot of love
             and a lot of care. 

167
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:51,216
                 Excellent.     

168
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,151
               It's fabulous.   
            The meat is perfect.

169
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:57,222
   Savory flavors.              
The seasoning was excellent.    

170
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,423
            MAN: One of the best
                restaurants,    

171
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,690
         period, in Bakersfield.

172
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,092
     Period?                    
                   Period.      

173
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,029
If this is what Greece is about,
    I want to go.               

174
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,363
               You treat this   
              like your house.  

175
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,031
   I do.                        
             It really feels it.

176
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,867
  I treat my guests             
   like my family.              

177
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,369
                  Aww, huh?     

178
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:13,971
    You're gonna love this girl.
        Come down and try this. 

179
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:17,308
    Coming up, we're sticking   
      around Bakersfield...     
Outstanding.                    

180
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,843
...for an old-school landmark...

181
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,379
It feels like I'm in an old     
Basque restaurant because I am. 

182
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,715
     ...firing up a full-on     
         cultural feast.        

183
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,384
      So, I can eat as much     
       of that as I want?       
                       Oh, yeah.

184
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,792
      [ Train horn blows ]      

185
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,126
  Now, you know on "Triple D,"  

186
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,862
  I love finding the old-school 
             joints,            

187
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:40,131
     and, boy, do I have one    
  for you -- a joint from 1901. 

188
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:43,001
 So, here I am on the east side 
   of Bakersfield, California,  

189
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,936
            right by            
 the Southern Pacific Railroad. 

190
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,472
     Now, from 1901 to 1935,    

191
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,006
      this place was a lot      
      of different joints.      

192
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:52,343
    But since 1935, everybody   
in Bakersfield knows this place.

193
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,413
   This is the Pyrenees Café.   

194
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:01,019
Pyrenees is a landmark.         

195
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,687
    The food here is incredible.

196
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,089
 Good flavors made from scratch 
        right from home.        

197
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,826
      FIERI: And right from     
      the Basque tradition.     

198
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,494
          Osso buco up.         

199
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,297
 FIERI: This old-world menu has 
 been a long-time staple here,  

200
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:15,967
 so when Julie and Ron Crawford 
       took over in 2014,       

201
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,236
       they weren't about       
          to change it.         

202
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,904
       Basque food -- Is it hard
               to explain that  

203
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:20,972
       to people in Bakersfield?

204
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,440
    No. Everybody               
in Bakersfield gets it.         

205
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,975
It's hard to explain            
to the rest of the world.       

206
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,179
    MAN: Traditionally, it is   
     ethnic food that comes     

207
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:31,316
     from the Basque region     
    between France and Spain.   

208
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:34,252
      And French-born chef      
        Gilbert Hernandez       

209
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,654
      knows a thing or two      
    about the Basque people.    

210
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:37,855
               It was the best  
               sheep herders.   

211
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,123
The best sheep herders.         
                       Oh, yeah.

212
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,859
People would ask the Basque     
to come to the United States    

213
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:42,994
   to raise sheep.              

214
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,930
These are poor people...        
                   Yes, exactly.

215
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,197
...living in the hills.         

216
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,666
          Yes. With nothing they
           used to make a meal. 

217
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,467
So, they have to become         
      creative.                 

218
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,604
And they use every part         
   of the animal.               
                            Yes.

219
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:54,339
   MAN: You can get everything  
     from the pickled tongue    

220
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,809
to soup or whatever the specials
        are for the day.        

221
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,277
Fried chicken ready.            

222
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,012
     They're the best at it.    
 It's really kind of a mainstay.

223
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,414
              MAN: And it's not 
          Southern fried chicken

224
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,683
               by any stretch   
             of the imagination.

225
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:07,285
    And I think the garlic just 
   makes it something different.

226
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,955
So, what are we                 
gonna make today, Chef?         
           Fried garlic chicken.

227
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,756
We're gonna fry the garlic      
or we're gonna fry the chicken? 

228
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:12,891
               We're gonna fry  
                the chicken.    

229
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,092
Okay, let's go do it.           
                      All right.

230
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,760
  Little chickens.              
                        Yes.    

231
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,361
You see he just takes           
the knife right through,        

232
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,497
     no question                
of where the joint is.          

233
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,233
That was a no-looky.            
                    [ Chuckles ]

234
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:22,767
Now you're showing off.         

235
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:23,902
          Now we're gonna season
                the chicken.    

236
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:26,504
             Salt, black pepper,

237
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,907
               garlic powder,   
               chicken base.    

238
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,642
           And then we're gonna 
          put some fresh garlic.

239
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,711
        Okay.                   

240
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:34,845
   Lot of garlic.               

241
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,981
  Bit of olive oil?             

242
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,148
                    Yes.        
               You're welcome.  

243
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,850
    There we go.                
                        Perfect.

244
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,585
Now, how long are we gonna      
let this marinate, Chef?        

245
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:41,520
             At least two hours.

246
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,721
 At least two hours?            
                            Yes.

247
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:47,592
         Then after, we're gonna
           put some buttermilk. 

248
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,661
               And then after,  
        we dredge it in flour --

249
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,330
             seasoning flour -- 
          black pepper and salt.

250
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,798
     That's it?                 
                      That's it.

251
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,999
 But we're not going            
    to the fryer.               

252
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,401
We're going to this?            
                            Yes.

253
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,069
This is the Basque way          
    of doing it,                

254
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:01,339
  because nobody in             
the Pyrenees Mountains had --   
                        Exactly.

255
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,307
        Okay.                   
                   No, no.      

256
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,613
       I like how he just takes 
   his time, just nice and easy.

257
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:09,747
     And how long do we cook it?

258
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,616
   15, 20 minutes.              

259
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:12,951
      FIERI: And what comes     
        with this, Chef?        

260
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:16,154
 This comes with the green beans
              and french fries. 

261
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,889
             Here's the chicken.

262
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,057
     Very nice.                 

263
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,828
What's in the garlic sauce?     

264
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,497
     Fresh garlic with olive oil

265
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:28,032
              and a little bit  
          of butter and parsley.

266
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,435
              And here is your  
          Basque garlic chicken.

267
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,509
The garlic on the outside       
   is very strong,              

268
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:40,178
but the garlic and the flavor   
inside in the chicken           

269
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,580
is what is really nice.         

270
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:44,849
It's tender, it's juicy,        
   lots of flavor.              

271
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,452
The crust on the chicken        
      is great.                 

272
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,720
 I have restaurants             
called Johnny Garlic's.         
                         Uh-huh.

273
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:50,888
I have one in Bakersfield,      

274
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,658
but if I was gonna ever         
make fried garlic chicken,      

275
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,726
that would be the example.      

276
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:56,928
    Outstanding.                

277
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,732
               The garlic just  
             hits you right away

278
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,335
    as soon as you bite into it.

279
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:06,270
Probably don't want to have your
  first date after you eat it,  

280
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,673
    but it's very, very good.   

281
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,076
  The best chicken              
that you'll ever have.

     in humble beginnings...

  Basque food is peasant food.  

284
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:18,549
   Cuts of meat nobody wanted,  
 and you had to figure out a way

285
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,219
       to make those meats      
     flavorful and tasteful.    

286
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,654
How close is this to            
    traditional,

288
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,358
       Probably a little better 
       than what we had at home.

Let me ask you this.            

293

 I want to try that.            

297
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:43,107
         You get a Basque soup, 
         beans, a tongue, salad.

298

something called the what?

319
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,019
    Oxtail stew is a classic.

     MAN: Because it's such     
      a tough cut of meat,      

321
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:32,490
       it has to be cooked      
  for hours in its own juices,

   and it comes out fantastic.

  Okay, let's start             
  with oxtail stew.             

324
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,296
 Now, is that really            
     from an ox,                

325
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,630
or is it just from beef?

00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,633
                 From beef.

just in its...tail form         

328
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:46,704
     in a while.                

329
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,306
What are we gonna marinate      
      this in?                  

330
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,308

     And brandy.                

332
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,844
I thought the brandy            
     was for us.                

333
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,914
So, we're gonna cook this       
    on the stove.               
                            Yes.

334
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:56,981

335
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,383
            At least 25 minutes.

340
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,795
           and then we're gonna 
       add a little bit of sage.

    A<i> little</i> bit?               
        Ooh!                    

342
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,331
             Italian seasoning. 

343
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,799
              Hot chili pepper. 

344
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,467
                 The garlic.    

345
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,535
                  Oregano.      

346
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:18,536
                    Salt.       

347
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:19,938
                  Paprika.

Again?                          

349
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,207
                The first one   
                was a powder.   

350
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,942
            This one is crushed.

351
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,878
                   Cumin.       
Tomato paste.                   

352
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,878
                    Yes.        

353
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,547
              And black pepper. 

354
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,216
                 Beef broth.    

355
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:32,283
Beef broth that you made?       

356
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,818
                    Yes.        

357
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,487
         Now we are ready to add
                the potatoes,   

358
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,288
            celery, and carrots.

359
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,423
   And then, when               
that's cooked, we serve it.     

360
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,490
                  Exactly.      

361

  FIERI: Which means it's time  

362
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,493
      for the owner, Julie,     

363
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,428
        to help guide me        
     through this mega meal.    

364
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,962
            Okay. So,           
    the oxtail stew is done.    

365
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:45,897
                            Yes.

366
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,899
           You come in          
      and have the Set-up,      

367
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,634
      this is what you get.     

368
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:50,768
    What's the first course?    

369
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,770
The beans and the salsa         

370
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,338
and the Basque vegetable soup.  

371
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,576
      So, I can eat as much     
       of that as I want?       
                       Oh, yeah.

372
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,445
       And now you help yourself
                to the salad    

373
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,513
             and pickled tongue 
             and cottage cheese.

374
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,583
   Cottage cheese, cucumbers,   
         pickled tongue.        

375
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,652
  Not a huge, huge tongue fan.  

376
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,354
         When in Rome...        

377
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,191
           That's some          
       really good tongue.      

378
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:14,259
    You make the tongue, too?   

379
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:15,193
               Oh, yes, I do.   

380
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:16,394
     There's such a variety.    

381

  All the senses are hitting -- 

382
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,531
      warm food, cold food,     
           spicy food.          

383
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,533
       I'm done with this.      

384
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,135
       They take it away.       
        And now I get...        

385
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,603
                French fries,   
                 spaghetti.     

386
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:26,804
         I've had a lot         
         of Basque food.        

387
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,474
 I don't know that I've ever had
        spaghetti in it.        

388
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,276
      I can't eat any more.

390
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,951
     Okay, and now we've got    
     your oxtail stew here.

              Mmm.              
    It is tender. It's meaty.   

394
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,563
        Forget about it.

396
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,167
           All right.

               tender, tasty.   

400
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,642
    For a family to come here   
      and eat like this --      

401
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,644
   I mean, look at the spread.  
          Tons of food.         

402
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,913
         It's just a place that 
        I'm drawn to constantly.

403

this would be a place           

404
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,650
 that I would visit             
at least once a week.           

405
