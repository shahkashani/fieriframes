to have this whole thing.       

8
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,079

56
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,510
So, the first one we're         
working with is ropa vieja.     

57
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,645
     So, this is                
one of my favorites.            

58
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:54,846
                So, you know

              the flank steak.  

61
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,385
    That's a lot                
 of Worcestershire.             

62
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:01,653
               Oh, you got to   
                 infuse it.     

63
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,923
               Red wine, salt,  
       peppercorn, some oregano.

64
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:05,990
    There you go.               

65
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,727
             Garlic, bay leaves,
                 and onions.    

66
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,928

67

          Bring it up to a boil.

68
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,265
        About three hours, we'll
        start checking the meat.

69
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:16,135
      Then we shred the meat up.
Okay.                           

70
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:18,136
             -May I?            
          -Definitely.          

71
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,137

Can I have some of this?        

73
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,407

I'm gonna eat it all right now. 

74
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,676

            citrus cabbage slaw.

76
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:28,480
   Start off with green cabbage,
               purple cabbage,  

77
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,683
              red bell peppers, 
        jalapeños, green onions.

        -Pickling juice.        
        -Pickling juice?        

79
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,888
      It has vinegar, sugar, and
      a little beet juice in it.

80
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,890
        Huh.                    

81
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,090
       -And a little salt.      
       -Or a lot of salt.       

82
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,692
          And some black pepper.

83
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,028
               We let this sit  
           about 20, 30 minutes.

84

      the rest.                 

85
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,363
        Start off with some oil.
Okay.                           

86
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,500
      Red onions, yellow onions,
             green bell pepper, 

87
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,502

                from earlier.   

89
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,640
   All that flavor              
that's inside of it.            

90
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:58,443
 Tomato sauce, red wine vinegar,
              red wine, ginger. 

91
00:02:58,445 --> 00:02:59,378
  A lot of ginger.              

92
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,912
             And Worcestershire.

93
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,247
Watch your sister sauce.        

94
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,382
   Then the meat.               

95
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:04,716
              Give this a stir. 

96
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,385

              for another hour. 

97

 So, the final step?            

98
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,322

       green peas, green olives.

99
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,124

brininess of the olive.         

100
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:13,258

00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,768
   Excellent dish.              
Well done, my friend.           

118
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,169
I have a ropa vieja.            

119
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,837
       The meat is juicy.       

120
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,641
        The coconut rice        
    complements it perfectly.   

121
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,576
         The coleslaw is        
       totally delicious.       

122
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,179
Real deal.                      
       It's very similar to what
           I had down in Panama.

123
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:10,182
 FIERI: And so is the dish that 
   gives this place its name.   

124
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:11,516
            Langoustine ceviche.

125
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,118
                This place is   
              called Ceviche's. 

126
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,321
     The ceviche better be good,
and it's the best I've ever had.

127
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:19,791
      It's always fresh --      
  local fish and local seafood. 

128
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,793
        HUNTER: My dad taught me
            how to make ceviche,

129
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,928
              and throughout my 
              military career,  

130
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,530
                  just made     
              a lot of ceviche. 

131
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:28,199
             FIERI:             
   And from there, he's added   
  plenty to his bag of tricks.  

132
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,668
                  WAITRESS:     
           I have your sancocho.

133
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,804
 Like this Central American take
   on old-school chicken soup.  

134
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,741
       We're gonna do the Panama
      national dish of sancocho.

135
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,075
What does "sancocho" mean?      

136
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,142
               "Chicken soup."  

137
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,145
              -Duh.             
           -[ Laughs ]          

138
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,680
                 First, some    
             garlic-infused oil.

139
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:44,416
                We'll add in    
           the chicken, oregano,

140
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,616
        and our house seasoning.

141
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,287
             Salt, black pepper,
             and garlic powder. 

142
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,822
          Next step, we got some
        sweet potatoes, carrots,

143
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,291
              green plantains.  

144
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:53,825
There's somebody freaking       
out at home right now,          

145
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,160
  going, "Bananas?"             

146
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:58,429
             Corn, green onions,
              yucca, culantro.  

147
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,366
             Culantro is like a 
             kicked-up cilantro.

148
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:02,567
              We add cilantro.  

149
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,102
     And a bunch                
  of chicken stock.             

150
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,170
Looks like someone took the     
blender to the garden.          

151
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,373
              So, I let it sit  
            for an hour, then...
