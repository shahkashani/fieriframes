1
00:00:00,935 --> 00:00:02,467
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:05,337
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

3
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:06,472
          This trip...          

4
00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:07,406
This place is gonna be bouncing.

5
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:09,340
  ...we're hitting the grill... 

6
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:10,475
   Out of bounds.               

7
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:11,877
...with some worldwide flavor...

8
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,278
              Wow.              

9
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,280
  ...in Los Angeles California. 

10
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:16,348
 There's other magic            
      in here.                  

11
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,150
    The buddy burger joint...   

12
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:21,553
 This is kind of like The Rebels
           of Fairfax.          

13
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,288
     ...going Mediterranean     
         on the lamb...         

14
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,290
   Look at the juice.           
That burger's rock star.        

15
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:27,692
...and fiery on the pulled pork.

16
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:30,228
It's up in the top 10.          

17
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:31,497
  And in Tacoma, Washington...  

18
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,031
  This is gonna be              
     good stuff.                

19
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,633
  ...the Belfast-inspired spot  

20
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,102
          with a taste          
     for the Middle East...     

21
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,904
     All righty.                
                    All righty. 

22
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:40,572
  ...going way beyond bar food. 

23
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:41,773
         We're gonna kabob it up
               right now.       

24
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:44,243
      From a homegrown take     
          on kabobs...          

25
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:45,643
                  Right on.     
   Right on.                    

26
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,246
   ...to a local spin...        

27
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,446
 That's outrageous.             

28
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,249
      ...on big-time beets.     

29
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,918
   Off the chain.               

30
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,586
      Honestly.                 

31
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:56,588
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

32
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:58,390
         on "Triple D."         

35
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,406
   When I was living down here  
     in southern California,    

36
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,409
  I used to cruise up and down  
  Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles 

37
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:18,743
         to go to work.         

38
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,212
   It was always an area known  
      for delis, bakeries,      

39
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:21,814
       the farmers market,      

40
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:24,016
   and now I guess you can say  
  it's known for burger joints. 

41
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:26,852
 Well, that's since<i> this</i> place  
 opened up -- The Golden State. 

42
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,956
     It's an amazing place.     

43
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,126
    People come from all over   
     the city to come here.     

44
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:38,097
  Burger medium with fries up!  

45
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:40,699
 This is<i> the</i> best burger I have 
   ever had in my entire life.  

46
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:44,970
             FIERI:             
 Pretty high praise for a couple
     of restaurant rookies.     

47
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:47,038
         Neither of you         
    had culinary experience?    

48
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,106
         Nothing that would say,

49
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:49,974
       "Hey, you should go open 
            a restaurant."      

50
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,645
        So, lifelong pals       
 Jason Bernstein and James Starr

51
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:56,982
   ditched the corporate world  
       to open this joint       

52
00:01:57,051 --> 00:02:00,185
        and found success       
    with one simple formula.    

53
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:03,922
We're just trying to, like,     
   do very clever things        

54
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,725
with very good quality          
     ingredients.               

55
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:09,460
       Like grass-fed beef      
       in their spicy dog,      

56
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:11,930
       locally made gelato      
      in their beer floats,     

57
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,265
      and fresh ground lamb     
        for their burger        

58
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,668
 coming from the farmers market 
       right down Fairfax.      

59
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,336
              MAN:              
  It's got a great lamb taste,  

60
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,871
  sort of a Mediterranean feel  
            going on.           

61
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:21,406
             MAN #2:            
    That kind of stands alone   

62
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,876
   just because they've chosen  
    to use a different meat,    

63
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,410
which brings a different flavor,

64
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,612
     and all the ingredients    
           are fresh.           

65
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:27,946
      All right,                
what are we making now?         

66
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,681
             We're gonna season 
               the ground lamb  

67
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,949
     for our lamb burger patty. 

68
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,285
Hit it.                         
                 All right.     

69
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:36,655
   We're gonna start with some  
   fresh chopped mint, parsley. 

70
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,890
         Our house spice blend. 

71
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,692
                It's made up    
              of garlic powder, 

72
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:44,096
           onion powder,        
   and a little bit of oregano. 

73
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:45,831
 There's other magic            
      in here.                  

74
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,500
But probably not legal          
    in most states.             

75
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,701
                Might not be.   

76
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,904
          [ Laughter ]          

77
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:55,440
                 Some cumin     
              and some oregano. 

78
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,978
 You're taking this,            
    mixing it up.               

79
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,380
    You gonna let               
these flavors marry?            

80
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,517
         Yeah, we'll let it rest
           for 20, 30 minutes.  

81
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,785
                Not too long.   

82
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,254
      Next up?                  

83
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,588
   We're gonna make the yogurt  
 dill sauce for our lamb burger.

84
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:11,990
Like a tzatziki of sorts?       

85
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,326
     It is a tzatziki, yeah.    
 It's like a variation on that. 

86
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:17,863
       Start with some yogurt...

87
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,464
                   dill...      

88
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,333
       some mint, some cucumber.

89
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,869
  English cucumber?             

90
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,404
             Persian cucumbers. 

91
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,672
           We're in L.A., man.  
           We got to represent. 

92
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,407
                Lemon juice.    

93
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:30,609
    I didn't know               
  you were Persian.             

94
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,010
                  I'm not.      

95
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,946
But I do have some close friends
        who are Persian.        

96
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,813
   Shout out to Sham Shabahain. 
            All right.          

97
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,683
Did you just shout out          
      on my show?               

98
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,818
                   Yeah.        
           Please don't hurt me.

99
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,553
           A little bit of salt,

100
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:42,954
                black pepper,   

101
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,057
            and again,          
   our magical house seasoning. 

102
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:49,027
       I want some more yogurt. 

103
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,830
       Does that need more salt?

104
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,465
Ooh, that's good tang           
   on that yogurt.              

105
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,699
      A little                  
 lemon juice helps.             

106
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,903
     Good to go?                

107
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,971
               Yeah, I think    
           we're good to go now.

108
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,839
 We're gonna make some hand-cut 
  roasted sweet potato wedges.  

109
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,708
           Chop this bad boy up.

110
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,644
   We're gonna bake them first, 

111
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:06,778
           and then we're gonna 
              deep-dry them.    

112
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,247
 Put a little crunch            
   on the outside.              

113
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,115
          Exactly Sort of like  
          that Thanksgiving ham 

114
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,849
                 but crossed    
             with a french fry. 

115
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,385
                  Dude.         

116
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,320
       You look like            
you're gonna hurt yourself.     

117
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,190
               Some olive oil.  

118
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,458
              Salt and pepper.  

119
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,861
  Toss, toss, toss.             
On to the sheet tray.           

120
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,996
        Now we're gonna go      
   right in the oven with these.

121
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,131
     What temp?                 

122
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,533
       350 for about 45 minutes.

237
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,696
       that we're gonna use     
   for the pulled pork sandwich.

238
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,297
              Word.             
 And we're starting off with...?

239
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,233
             Dijon mustard, sir.

240
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,767
         Ketchup is for wusses. 

241
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,304
           Some Worcestershire. 
Worc-ch-ch-ch-ch-estershire.    

242
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,373
Apple cider vinegar.            

243
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,908
And this is                     
cayenne pepper.                 

244
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:05,643
That's gonna be strong.         

245
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,680
         Yeah, it's really hot. 
          It is pretty strong.  

246
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,118
   [ Whistles ]                 
            Yeah, it's intense. 

247
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,854
 But when it's on the sandwich, 
      it works really well.     

248
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,522
      Wow.                      

249
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:20,358
               Take our tongs.  

250
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,663
      Ooh.                      

251
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,398
So, all the braising liquid     
   comes with it?               
                      Yes, sir. 

252
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,534
   Couple of those broken-down  
   onions and carrots, as well. 

253
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,269
                 All right.     

254
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:34,271
           Pickled jalapeños    
       and some pickled onions. 

255
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:36,541
                And then        
         we're gonna top it off 

256
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,710
     with our hot mustard sauce 
        that we made earlier.   

257
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,287
The pork is super moist.        

258
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:53,758
  It's got a little Latino side 
  to it, almost like carnitas.  

259
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,894
 Really where you start to rock 
  the house is those jalapeños. 

260
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:57,963
      Hey.                      

261
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,433
   I've had a lot of            
pulled pork sandwiches.         

262
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,968
I know it's hard to tell.       

263
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:04,902
                [ Chuckles ]    

264
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,504
  It's outrageous.              
I'm not kidding you.            

265
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:07,705
 This is righteous.             

266
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,440
       I'm so glad you like it. 

267
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,442
     Well done.                 

268
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:11,776
              Everything good?  
Excellent.                      

269
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,044
                  Awesome.      
             Thank you so much. 

270
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,179
You could sell just that.       

271
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:18,182
       The meat is, like,       
       fall-off-the-bone.       

272
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,851
  I just can't stop eating it.  

273
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,986
   It's one of the best things  
       that they do here.       

274
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,322
      It is one of the best     
    pork sandwiches I've had.   

275
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,391
             I mean,            
     it's up in the top 10.     

276
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,259
       It's awesome, guys.      

277
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,994
       It's a great vibe,       
       it's a great joint.      

278
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,662
    Get ready to get in line.   

279
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,398
           This place           
      is gonna be bouncing.     

280
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,270
           Up next...           
Crazy.                          

281
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,272
...we're headed                 
to Tacoma, Washington...        

282
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:42,606
  This is gonna be              
     good stuff.                

283
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:43,942
     ...for an Irish pub...     

284
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,309
                 Beef kabob.    

285
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,411
          ...with some          
      Middle Eastern grub.      

286
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,514
   Off the chain.               
      Honestly.                 

287
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,126
 I'm here in Tacoma, Washington.

288
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:02,793
    Now, you know when you go   
         to a new town,         

289
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,130
you're always looking for, like,
    that road to Flavortown,    

290
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:06,597
 you know, that area that's got 

291
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,533
       all the killer bars      
        and restaurants?        

292
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,068
  Well, I'm told this is it --  

293
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,603
       6th Avenue right by      
 the University of Puget Sound. 

294
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,472
      And I hear the joint      
     you got to check out --    

295
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,408
       they're serving up       
  the killer drinks and food -- 

296
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:17,709
  is this joint, The Crown Bar. 

297
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,083
  You're gonna get a good meal  
      every time you come.      

298
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:28,686
     It's my go-to place --     
   casual, neighborhood place.  

299
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:30,088
             FIERI:             
      A little like a place     

300
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,624
 Chef Charlie McManus remembers 
         from back home.        

301
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:33,892
              So, The Crown Bar 
                 in Belfast     

302
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,494
    is supposed to be the most  
    beautiful bar in the world. 

303
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,028
               It's been there  
               for 140 years.   

304
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:40,231
        A wee bit longer        
       than<i> this</i> Crown Bar      

305
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:43,234
   that Charlie and his wife,   
   Jacqueline, opened in '07.   

306
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,303
                 We thought     
               that this place  

307
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:48,306
           could be a good ode  
           to my Belfast roots, 

308
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,642
             and so we called it
                   The...       

309
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:53,244
          ...Crown Bar.         

310
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,912
  Love Jacqueline and Charlie,  

311
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:57,248
         and their food         
      is always delicious.      

312
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:58,183
 How do you describe            
      the food?                 

313
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,184
        Eclectic, ethnic.       

314
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,922
Upscale bar/tavern food.        

315
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,323
        MAN: Currywurst.        

316
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,993
The mushroom quesadillas        
   are off the chain.           

317
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,262
      Honestly.                 

318
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:14,598
         Full of flavor,        
     really crunchy falafel.    

319
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:17,368
             Cheers.            
Cheers.                 Cheers. 

320
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,204
             And the beef kabob.

321
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:22,072
 This beef kabob tastes so good.

322
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:24,209
    Spicy beef with couscous.   

323
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,945
        MAN: And it's got       
  a lemon cilantro sauce on it, 

324
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,280
         cucumber raita,        
    and a nice grilled pita.    

325
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:34,953
We are making couscous that will
     go with our beef kabob.    

326
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,222
      Couscous.                 

327
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,490
       Big in the Mediterranean.

328
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,025
 That's just a bunch            
  of little pasta.              

329
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:44,495
           Equal parts hot water
               and couscous.    

330
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:47,332
          Whisk the couscous in 
          so it doesn't clump.  

331
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,901
         And then curry powder. 

332
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:52,102
   A little madras              
    curry powder.               

333
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,506
  We let this sit for about 10  
  minutes to absorb the liquid. 

334
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,041
           Take some olive oil, 

335
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,977
           rub it with our hands

336
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:02,514
     so that every little clump 
           is broken down.      

337
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,116
   Then we put it into the oven 
          for 20 minutes.       

338
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,317
         [ Timer dings ]        

339
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,118
     It's come out of the oven. 

340
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,188
           Sprinkle a little bit
              more oil on it.   

341
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:13,724
           And then just work it
              one more time.    

342
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,194
  And the idea is to make this  
        light and fluffy.       

343
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:18,196
             Fluffy and velvety.

344
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:20,598
 And this is the way they do it 
           in Morocco.          

345
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,300
  This is gonna be              
     good stuff.                

346
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,670
                Next we make    
              the raita sauce.  

347
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,138
      Enraita?                  
                         Raita. 

348
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,873
     All righty.                

349
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,342
                Take the skin   
             off this cucumber. 

350
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,144
English cucumber, fantastic     
  with the little seeds.        

351
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,414
       I'm actually gonna take  
       the little bits of seeds 

352
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,548
         that are in there out. 

353
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:40,685
     So, I'm gonna slice these. 

354
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,288
           And then we're gonna 
               chop them up.    

355
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,557
                 All right.     
                    So...       

356
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,893
     then I'm gonna let it drain
       for about five minutes.  

357
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:51,896
           So now we're using   
         Greek yogurt for this. 

358
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:52,963
                There we go.    

359
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,966
             Little mint, cumin.

360
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,701
             Stir that together 
                a little bit.   

361
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,504
           The drained cucumber 
                 goes in.       

362
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,975
           Little bit of salt,  
         freshly ground pepper. 

363
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,376
           And there we have it.

364
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,845
     Now, this will improve     
  with flavor as time goes on.  

365
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,981
   It will. Three or four hours,
      it's gonna be perfect.    

366
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,985
 All right. We're going to make 
    our Moroccan beef kebab.    

367
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,920
      Okay.                     

368
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:19,857
       We've got grass-fed beef,
              ground up.        

369
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,793
80%/20%.                        
      Yeah, it's about 80%/20%. 

370
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,728
         Bread crumbs,          
         ground ginger,         

371
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,865
     cumin, cayenne, parsley... 

372
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,201
           cilantro, red onion. 

373
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,404
             And then we have   
           non-fat milk powder. 

374
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,540
       And what it does is hold 
          that beef together.   

375
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:36,875
     I'm gonna mix this by hand.

376
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,475
                Salt, pepper.   

377
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,545
         There's so much flavor 
                in this.        

378
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,679
         We're gonna kabob it up
               right now.       

379
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:45,683
       About a 2 3/4-ounce ball.

380
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,419
     Then we're gonna make them 
         into little bricks.    

381
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,620
                There we go.    

382
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,489
           And they are gonna go
               on the grill.    

383
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,224
We're not gonna put them        
       on kabobs?               

384
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,692
   They're gonna get the handle 
            at the end.         

385
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,961
            And about seven     
       or eight minutes to cook.

386
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,930
  Very nice.                    
                 All right?     

387
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:04,568
            We've got couscous, 
            got the raita,      

388
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:08,172
        and I'm gonna skewer up 
        my kabobs.              

389
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,379
     Here we have               
     the charmoula vinaigrette, 

390
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:16,914
           Little bits of pita. 

391
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,649
         Little bit of cilantro 
         on top.                

392
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,318
               And there it is. 

393
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,920
That's all she wrote.           

394
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,358
That's not over-spiced,         
     by any means.              

395
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,794
And the couscous, dude.         

396
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:32,330
 Something that simple          
done that right -- mm.          

397
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,531
   This is light and fluffy as  
  anybody would love to get it. 

398
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,401
         Tell me                
about this sauce on top.        

399
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:37,802
         It's a charmoula sauce.

400
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,471
     It's the all-purpose sauce 
             of Morocco.        

401
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:43,207
         They use it to marinate
            lamb, fish, beef.   

402
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,876
       So it has cumin, cayenne,
               paprika,         

403
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:48,145
               lemon, parsley,  
                and cilantro.   

404
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:51,415
       I love                   
all these components.           

405
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,818
This is really nice.            

406
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,286
   Out of bounds.               

407
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,222
    It's amazing. It's juicy.   
      It's full of flavors.     

408
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,691
  Little bit of curry flavor -- 
          just awesome.         

409
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:04,695
  The crust is really flavorful 
and gives it a really nice kick.

410
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:06,197
     Really a terrific dish.    

411
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:13,771
             FIERI:             
  And while they're serving up  
 flavors from around the world, 

412
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,440
          Charlie knows         
   there's no place like home.  

413
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,908
       I love this place.       

414
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,911
             FIERI:             
      When we come back...      

415
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,178
Beet salad -- the bomb.         

416
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,246
                  The bomb.     

417
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,314
The bomb bomb.                  
                 The bomb bomb. 

418
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,357
             FIERI:             
  I'm hanging at The Crown Bar  
     in Tacoma, Washington,     

419
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,893
   where chef Charlie McManus   
     has connected the dots     

420
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,961
      between local farmers     
          and his menu.         

421
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,764
               Fried chicken.   

422
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,565
        The food is fresh       
         and it's local,        

423
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,700
      and we're supporting      
         local farmers.         

424
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,368
               Beet salad up.   

425
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:47,971
  I don't typically love beets, 
      but I love this salad     

426
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,708
    because the way they make   
   the beets, they roast them,  

427
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,244
  but they're still very tender 
           and juicy.           

428
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,113
                   WOMAN:       
             Roasted beet salad.

429
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:57,181
 I'm actually the guy that grew 
      the beets over there.     

430
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,449
You're the beet farmer?         

431
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,450
      Get out!                  
                   Yeah.        

432
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,385
                   How awesome. 

433
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,119
         And what kind of beets 
         do you grow?           

434
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,454
          We do mostly          
         golden and red.        

435
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,923
     FIERI: Front and center    
      on this savory salad.     

436
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,124
 Beet salad, and it's wonderful.

437
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,792
             WOMAN:             
 It's great with the goat cheese

438
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,261
   and the fresh local greens.  

439
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,197
 It's refreshing and delicious. 
            Love it.            

440
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,266
 All right, so we're gonna make 
      a roasted beet salad.     

441
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:20,671
   We have golden and red beets 
       from a local farmer.     

442
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,740
     We're gonna size the beets,
          cut the ends off,     

443
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,075
         get them ready         
         for roasting.          

444
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,409
                There we go.    

445
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,077
             We have to do them 
                 separately     

446
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:29,680
because the red ones would bleed
        in to the golden.       

447
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:30,748
              We just set them  
                in the foil,    

448
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,683
           little bit of oil -- 
                olive oil.      

449
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:33,851
       Get them nice and tight. 

450
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,359
          Tighten up the ends,  
         make it a nice packet. 

451
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:42,960
       Into the oven with them. 

452
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:45,596
350, come out, cool down.       

453
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:51,168
   All right, so now we're gonna
      rub the skins off them.   

454
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,903
                   There we go. 
Beautiful beets.                

455
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:55,372
               Yeah, they are.  
               Trim the ends.   

456
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,774
             We're gonna make   
           a citrus vinaigrette.

457
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:58,242
                Dijon, honey.   

458
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,643
      Darling.                  

459
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,779
                  This is       
           from our own garden. 

460
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,115
     This is this year's model. 

461
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:05,249
   That's awesome!              

462
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,784
                  It's got      
             that buttery thing,

463
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,185
               a little nutty   
                 at the end.    

464
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:11,789
           Then into that,      
     we whisk champagne vinegar.

465
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,123
       Really?                  
   Your own bees?               

466
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,726
            Yeah. Doing it      
       for three or four years. 

467
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:17,595
    How many bees               
    do you have?                

468
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,862
             We had three hives.

469
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:21,599
   Two of them we lost, but one 
     of them that's operating.  

470
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,067
     We have 12,000 bees in it. 

471
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,002
     What happened              
to the other two hives?         

472
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:27,538
   Just the conditions for bees 
         are really tough.      

473
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:29,206
                  Sometimes     
             they don't make it.

474
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,475
       Really?                  
                           Yeah.

475
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,675
        Because of the climate, 

476
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,544
         because of pesticides, 
         things like that.      

477
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,882
      Lime juice, orange juice, 
      lemon juice.              

478
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,752
      And then the zest         
      of those citrus in there. 

479
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:44,689
                    Zest it up. 
                    Zest is in! 

480
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:48,292
 Now we're gonna whisk some oil 
    in there, some olive oil.   

481
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,894
                There we go.    

482
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,763
             Pinch of salt,     
         pinch of black pepper. 

483
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,232
              That's the citrus 
                vinaigrette.    

484
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,366
     Mm.                        

485
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:56,767
   Dig it.                      
                   Right on.    

486
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:57,902
                Okay, right on. 

487
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,638
                 Next step,     
              finish the salad. 

488
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:04,374
                Red beets...    
               into the bowl.   

489
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,577
                Golden beets.   

490
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:11,916
         Citrus vinaigrette     
     to balance that sweetness. 

491
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:13,718
       Just work them in there. 

492
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,920
   And then we have some greens.
       They're gonna go in.     

493
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:16,988
             Nice bit of greens.

494
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,458
     Just a very light dressing.

495
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,061
 And the beet salad in this kind
  of a funky bar atmosphere --  

496
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,863
this is a big seller?           

497
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,064
             It's a big seller. 

498
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,933
                  We got        
           a local college here.

499
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,669
       The students come in.    
   There's a lot of vegetarians.

500
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,804
 And people like a robust salad 
           like this.           

501
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,273
             There's the beets. 

502
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,942
  And then we finish it with a  
little bit of fresh goat cheese.

503
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,477
             And there it is -- 
             roasted beet salad.

504
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:40,578
     All right.                 

505
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:45,015
   Oh, those are good.          
The beets are fantastic.        

506
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:46,751
        I mean,                 
they're just so fresh,          

507
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,819
  and you just get              
 such great flavor.             

508
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:52,289
  Really still some             
 firm texture to it.            

509
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:55,159
The dressing is very mild on it,
         not too heavy.         

510
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:58,229
Little bit of the tanginess     
    of the goat cheese.         

511
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:59,163
 That's outrageous.             

512
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,831
      The fact                  
that you're making it           

513
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,967
 all here in this little kitchen
          in this bar,          

514
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,168
this is beyond bar food.        

515
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,569
   Nice job.                    
                    Thank you.  

516
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:06,770
                And you make    
                your own honey. 

517
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,773
           I've never seen that 
           on "Triple D."       

518
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:11,976
        Beet salad -- the bomb. 

519
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,311
                  The bomb.     

520
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:14,645
The bomb bomb.                  
                 The bomb bomb. 

521
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,179
       WOMAN:                   
   Nice and sweet.              

522
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,914
        You just can't beat it. 
 Yeah, you --                   

523
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:20,784
 FIERI: To the locally          
 grown beets, the vinaigrette,  

524
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:22,653
 with the honey that comes      
 from your house --             

525
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,187
 I mean,                        
 that's a pretty big            

526
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,990
 farm-to-table attitude,        
 my friend.                     

527
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,458
 In a little bar joint          
 like this?                     

528
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,458
                  Exactly.      
Crazy.                          

529
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:29,727
Thanks for having me.           

530
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,828
I love it.                      

531
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:37,401
          So, that's it         
       for this road trip.      

532
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:38,736
        But don't worry.        

533
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,138
    We got plenty more joints   
 to find all over this country. 

534
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:42,873
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

535
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:45,543
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

536
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:48,412
            We're all           
     in the trust tree here.    

537
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:53,417
  Fred Meyer guy, beet farmer,  
    vegetarians, face-ripper.   

538
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,486
   I haven't talked to you two  
     crazies over there yet.    

539
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:59,123
  This is like "Twilight Zone"  
        "Triple D" style.
