THE ONLY WAY TO DO              
 FRESH-CUT FRIES.               
              YOU CAN'T EAT     
         BARBEQUE WITHOUT BEANS.

116

THAT'S IT.                      

117
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,963
              AND A LITTLE BIT  
            OF THE BACON FLAVOR.
BACON FLAVOR.                   

118
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,632
  SOME GROUND ONIONS. WE'RE NOT 
 EVEN GONNA CALL THOSE CHOPPED. 

119

FLAVOR, THAT'S ALL.             

120
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,104
SO THE BACON'S                  
  NOT CRISPY,                   

121
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,373
BUT WE STARTED TO RENDER

                            YES.

122
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:11,510
 NOW WE WANT THAT FAT TO BE

I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS.     
      THAT WAS GOOD.            

138
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,682
 NOT TOO SALTY. I GRABBED       
A LITTLE BIT OF THE PEPPER.     

139
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:54,152
 I COULD CHUG
