1
00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:03,402
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:06,205
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

3
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:07,005
          This trip...          

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,073
        Hey.                    

5
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,741
  ...it's a Thanksgiving feast. 

6
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,076
             Tastes like holiday
             right off the bat. 

7
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:13,678
    Where the bird is flying    
        front and center.       

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,216
That's like someone shot off all
 the fireworks at the same time.

9
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:18,884
        Of course, we got       
        the fully loaded        

10
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:20,019
      traditional dinner...     

11
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:22,220
 Get the hand cart.             
I'm ready to get to my car.     

12
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,022
          ...alongside          
      some real ringers...      

13
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,957
            Shut the front door.

14
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,826
      ...like turkey pizza      
          in Detroit...         

15
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:28,693
                Look at that!   

16
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,562
        ...a turkey-twin        
        in Albuquerque...       

17
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:32,764
    People like to have a turkey
             to look that good. 

18
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,433
  ...turkey tots in Milwaukee.  

19
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:36,235
This is crunch-a-tastical.      

20
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:39,304
        And in Syracuse,        
    one funkalicious waffle.    

21
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:42,507
                That is just,   
         in so many ways, weird.

22
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,708
     Whether it's smoked...     

23
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,444
              Teach me the rub, 
                oh, wise one.   

24
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:47,112
        ...sandwiched...        
  Rocks the house.              

25
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:48,380
        ...or stuffed...        

26
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,182
                 Holy moly.     

27
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:53,051
    ...get ready to gobble up   
       this holiday hero.       

28
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,521
          Dude, that has changed
    Thanksgiving for me forever.

29
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:59,257
     That's all right here,     
    right now, on "Triple D."   

30
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,294
                     ♪♪         

31
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,734
     When I think of Boston,    

32
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,069
    I think of the Tea Party.   

33
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,871
 I think of the Sox, of course, 

34
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,673
         and now a place        
    called Mike's City Diner.   

35
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:17,075
          Now, it's not         
       because the owner's      

36
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,077
       an immigrant living      
       the American dream       

37
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,079
 or because President Clinton's 
           eaten here.          

38
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,547
     It's because of the way    

39
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,683
      they're cranking out      
  an American favorite: turkey. 

40
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:26,885
             Here you go, folks.

41
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,087
 All right, Jay.                
         Thank you, Jay.        

42
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:29,154
       Turkey's fantastic.      

43
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,255
    The food is just amazing.   

44
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,757
     Did you see this plate?    

45
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,492
       That, it should be       
      almost semi-illegal.      

46
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,160
        WOMAN: I remember       
 the first time I came in here. 

47
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:37,295
     I said, "Is that real,     
       or is that a prop?"      

48
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,897
 FIERI: Oh, it's real all right.

49
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,632
 One of four home cooked turkeys

50
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:43,836
        they're doing up        
 and serving up every day here. 

51
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:45,303
    The all-American meal...    

52
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,237
  Nice to meet you.             

53
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,439
          ...from a guy         
        who's telling you       

54
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,840
           he's living          
     the all-American dream.    

55
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:51,176
  How old were you              
when you came to the states?    

56
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:52,911
                     8.         
                8 years old.    

57
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:53,979
    8 years old.                

58
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,247
And you came from...            

59
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:56,715
                  Lebanon.      

60
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,785
 Jay Hajj fell into the food biz
  as a dishwasher in his teens  

61
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,587
     then worked his way up.    
                 It's excellent.

62
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:04,990
  He bought this place 12 years 
  ago, left the original name,  

63
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,059
      but got right to work     
       on his own menu...       

64
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:08,260
                 Can I have     
              some more fries?  

65
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:10,529
      ...filled with fresh,     
    homemade local favorites.   

66
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:11,996
     We got some                
good turkey dinner today.       

67
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,533
    When he tried his hand at   
 turkey, it was an instant hit. 

68
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,001
             It kind of happened
                by accident,    

69
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:18,603
      when I had no place to put
 the turkeys but on the steamer,

70
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,004
          on top of the steamer.

71
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:23,074
             And because it was 
  an open kitchen, just it grew.

72
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,609
     It just got out of control.

73
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:25,810
    I was like, "Oh, my God.    

74
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,946
      He's got real turkeys     
     up there on the bone."     

75
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,549
     FIERI: And on the plate    
    and in huge sandwiches --   

76
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:34,486
 turkey salad, turkey meat loaf,
       turkey everything.       

77
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,221
   All made fresh every day...  

78
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,356
             HAJJ: Here you go. 
               Grab them now.   

79
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:38,357
          ...Jay's way.         

80
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:39,490
         So,                    
someone made that for you?      

81
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,159
                    Yeah.       

82
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,361
      That's...                 
Dude, that's snazzy.            

83
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,496
Where'd you get the idea?       

84
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,030
       I mean,                  
I've done the beer-can chicken. 

85
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,833
             Years ago, I found 
    the stand for the chicken --

86
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,234
                  exactly,      
           the beer-can chicken.

87
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:52,504
    And I realized that it cooks
     the chicken a little better

88
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,839
            because it's cooking
    from the inside and outside.

89
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,708
                You twist the...
I like this little maneuver.    

90
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,643
       ...wings around the back.

91
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:58,977
   Put your wings               
  behind your back.             

92
00:02:58,979 --> 00:02:59,912
                There we go.    

93
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:01,512
    And we're not               
 gonna season this?             

94
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,315
                  No seasoning. 
No seasoning on the skin?       

95
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:04,849
                   Unless       
       you want to eat the skin,

96
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:10,455
    I found that it doesn't give
  any extra flavors to the meat.

97
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,123
             But if you say so, 
          I will agree with you.

98
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,592
     [ Laughs ]                 

99
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:16,261
     No need -- Jay's gonna     
 be all over the seasoning thing

100
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:17,329
    with his homemade gravy.    

101
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:18,930
                 All right,     
      now, this is onion powder,

102
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,598
       garlic, and white pepper.

103
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,934
          That is for the stock.

104
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:23,268
 A little bay leaf?             

105
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,069
                    Yep.        

106
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,937
Turkish or Californian?         

107
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,806
             That's Californian.
   Californian.                 

108
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,207
       So we're just gonna      
     make a standard rouge?     

109
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,676
    There we go.                

110
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,277
                Come to papa.   

111
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:35,413
You whisk that so you don't make
         yourself any dumplings.

112
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,648
    That's right.               

113
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,954
              Oh, that's good.  

114
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,623
     That's got real big flavor.

115
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,158
     The stuffing will, too.    

116
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,293
              Celery, carrots.  
             Just dump them in. 

117
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,361
 Dump them right in.            

118
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:50,762
               You don't have   
      to sauté them or anything?

119
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,365
   No. No. No, no.              
That's for fancy places.        

120
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,899
                    White onion?
   White onion.                 

121
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,434
   Spanish onion.               
        Yep.                    

122
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,570
            I didn't talk to it.
  How'd you know it was Spanish?

123
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,572
   Now the turkey.              

124
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,708
    Little chunks               
between the stuffing.           

125
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,110
            White pepper, cumin,
               seasoned salt,   

126
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,045
      and the poultry seasoning.

127
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:08,980
                     Whisk.     
   Whisk a little bit.          

128
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,517
And now we let it simmer        
for about 5, 10 minutes.        

129
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,186
                We don't want   
      to break the veggies down.

130
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:15,053
    That's right.               

131
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,654
Put it right in here.           
                         Wow.   

132
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,591
      And now,                  
I'm gonna smash-a-matic.        

133
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,994
        Now we got to bake this.
     It's not done. There we go.

134
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:24,529
 And there are potatoes to mash 
     and squash to whip up.     

135
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:27,065
      Whipping it where the whip
      keeps it a little stringy.

136
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,867
                 You want it    
              a little stringy. 

137
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,269
Everything you do has got       
a little magic behind it.       

138
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,471
      But the real magic...     

139
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:33,538
                 Here we go.    

140
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,574
           ...is when           
     it's all on one plate.     

141
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,746
         Wow. The turkey        
     is super-money-tender.     

142
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:43,615
   The gravy, which is money.   

143
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:47,352
  Stuffing, you can still taste 
 the texture of the vegetables, 

144
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:50,289
        but it's creamy.        

145
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,556
       That's really good.      

146
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,425
         Have you eaten         
     the Thanksgiving-a-thon    

147
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:54,359
       here before, or...?      

148
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,228
Thanksgiving in July.           

149
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,464
             Yeah, Thanksgiving 
       in September or February.

150
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,499
                    About       
           any time you want it.

151
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,766
 Well, that's one of            
  the cool things.              

152
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,501
   You can get it               
 any time you want.             

153
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,704
 And if Thanksgiving on a plate 
       isn't your thing...      

154
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,772
    Those are our               
pilgrim sandwiches, you guys.   

155
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,240
               MAN: That's my   
            Thanksgiving dinner.

156
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,709
    That's right.               
 It is Thanksgiving.            

157
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,310
      Thank you very much.      
  All in a roll.                

158
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,379
              We're gonna make  
             a pilgrim sandwich.

159
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,714
Okay, so cranberries,           

160
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:16,915
             Put stuffing in it.

161
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,583
That's a nice giddy-up.         

162
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:21,520
    Usually, it's all white meat
 unless the customer asks for...

163
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,122
So you pretty much make and do  
and give whatever they want.    

164
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,257
                 They want.     

165
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,258
   Holy enchilada!              
How much you gonna give them?   

166
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,194
You should call that sandwich   
  "The Goodnight."              

167
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,529
  How many of these             
   you sell a day?              

168
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:31,863
          About 45, I would say.

169
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:34,399
    45 a day?                   
                   45, 50. Yeah.

170
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:37,935
No wonder you go through        
700,000 turkeys a year.         

171
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,872
Now, do you eat this with --    
Is there, like, a contraption?  

172
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,273
                    Well,       
       when there's gravy in it,

173
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,943
             it's best to eat it
          with a fork and knife.

174
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:49,013
I got the gravy, the stuffing.  

175
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,615
   That's awesome.              
                        Thanks. 

176
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,550
That stands up there,           
the best turkey sandwiches      

177
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,152
   I've ever had.               

178
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,620
                    Wow.        

179
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,756
   FIERI: Did you hear a piggy  
   noise when you bit into it?  

180
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:58,623
            [ Oinks ]           

181
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,558
       Say "Eat them up!"       

182
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,626
 GIRL: Eat them up.             

183
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,762
I like it all mixed up,         
just like Thanksgiving.         

184
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:04,762
      Put it all together.      

185
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,031
          MAN: Is this for real?

186
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,832
    Well, let me get another guy
             to help me eat it. 

187
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,034
 It's like that with everything 
       on the menu here --      

188
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,236
          huge portions         
     of real deal cooking...    

189
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,505
  Eggs Benedict...              
               Yes.             

190
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:15,039
...with a huge chunk            
       of ham.                  

191
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,641
  ...that has folks lining up.  

192
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:17,975
FIERI: Do you eat it all?       

193
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:21,313
             I make a good dent.

194
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:22,914
        Yeah.                   
There's no gut down there.      

195
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,250
          Dynamic Duo,          
   and I get eggs and sausage.  

196
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,718
           FIERI: This is called
              the Dynamic Duo?  

197
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,786
             Uh-huh.            

198
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,454
They usually order them         
before I sit down, so...        

199
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,389
          Oh, you're that loyal?
  Yeah.                         

200
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,524
              Gretchen. Amanda. 

201
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:33,792
        FIERI: For Jay...       

202
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,260
    And how's your breakfast    
          this morning?         

203
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,729
 FIERI: ...It's all about owning
 a place people want to come to.

204
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,130
                    HAJJ:       
         I'm very proud of that.

205
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,732
      ...and locals want to     
      keep coming back to.      

206
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,533
 Everything's good?             
                   Very good.   

207
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:46,004
     And a big part of that     
 is basic American home-cooking.

208
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:50,274
 Like those four turkeys a day, 
 Thanksgiving anytime you want. 

209
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,544
               Really, I mean,  
              that's a serving. 

210
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:53,345
 Get another plate.             

211
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:54,413
See, this is what I love.       

212
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:55,747
This is the best thing          
     about this.                

213
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,549
    Dude, you are               
 the American dream.            

214
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:58,817
                    I am.       

215
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,353
          I feel sometime, like,
    it's like winning a lottery.

216
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,621
       It is!                   

217
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:05,824
 Get the hand cart.             
I'm ready to get to my car.     

218
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,292
     In Sarasota, Florida...    

219
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,093
      Learn me.                 

220
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:08,894
       ...it's a chicken.       

221
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:09,694
                    Rawr!       

222
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:10,628
         ...it's a duck.        

223
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,429
                    Whoa!       

224
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,230
            It's a...           

225
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,098
                 Turducken.     

226
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,433
          ...Turducken.         

227
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,568
This is kind of like culinary   
Disneyland for a dude like me.  

228
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,847
      When you're thinking      
          about turkey,         

229
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,782
  you're probably not thinking  
      of a joint like this.     

230
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,517
      The Alpine Steakhouse     
      in Sarasota, Florida      

231
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,320
   is more of a like a sirloin  
   and sausage kind of place.   

232
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,656
      But wait till you see     
 what they're doing with turkey.

233
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,724
    It's gonna blow you away.   

234
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,526
           I love it.           
     All different flavors.     

235
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:42,727
          You can't get         
        anything better.        

236
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,130
     It's like Thanksgiving,    
       just, all the time.      

237
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,464
             No. Seriously, man.

238
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,201
            They take a chicken,
        they shove it in a duck,

239
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:50,869
         and they shove the duck
             inside the turkey. 

240
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,670
       And then they put a bunch
    of stuffing and stuff on it.

241
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,405
It's absolutely fabulous.       

242
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,807
             FIERI:             
    It's called a turducken.    

243
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,543
   Just one of the hand-made,   
      homemade specialties      

244
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,812
    transplanted New Yorker,    
          Mark Rebhan,          

245
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,081
       and his son, Matt,       
       are cranking out...      

246
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,149
Need some fries down.           

247
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,951
      ...at the restaurant      
        and butcher shop        

248
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:08,686
   first opened by Mark's dad   
          32 years ago.         

249
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:12,023
My dad basically came to Florida
                 to retire.     

250
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,225
            And that didn't last
                  too long.     

251
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:14,960
  Yeah, looks like              
he really did a good job of it. 

252
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,895
                And went back   
               into business.   

253
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:19,698
         And I came down in '75,
               and here I am.   

254
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,233
       About 12 years ago,      

255
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:24,035
    Mark says he heard about    
  something called a turducken. 

256
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,770
Your dad comes home one day     
      and says,                 

257
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:29,574
"Guess what? You're gonna       
start boning chickens,          

258
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,376
 ducks and turkeys,             
making all the stuffing,        

259
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,911
and shoving it together,        
and then sewing it up           

260
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:33,979
  like a football."             

261
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,146
   What'd you say?              

262
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,714
              Well, basically,  
       he put one on the counter

263
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:37,982
               and he started   
             doing one himself. 

264
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,184
             And we just did it 
                side-by-side.   

265
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,452
    Did you guys                
  learn it together?            
                         Yeah.  

266
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,654
    Let me learn.               
      Learn me.                 

267
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,255
        Well, basically, I mean,

268
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,058
             you have a chicken,
           a duck, and a turkey.

269
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,660
         So what I'm gonna do...
    Show me.                    

270
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:49,861
                Is I'm gonna    
              take this chicken 

271
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,062
                 and cut it     
            right down the back.

272
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,464
                 I call this    
           the scissor cut here.

273
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,265
               You want to get  
         your knife tip in here.

274
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,134
         This is the oyster meat
               of the chicken.  

275
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,202
                 Best part.     

276
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,536
 All right. Now, the duck.      
                    Same way.   

277
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,005
   I like this.                 
                   All right.   

278
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:02,873
This is kind of like culinary   
Disneyland for a dude like me.  

279
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,409
                   All right.   
  Big turkey.                   

280
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,746
         If I'm down far enough,
   this is gonna pull right out.

281
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,016
         Oh.                    

282
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:12,484
                 Stock pot.     

283
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,020
That was money, dude.           
                         Yeah.  

284
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,155
Okay. Can I try this one?       

285
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,691
              Sure. Absolutely. 
                Be my guest.    

286
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,426
                I feel a good   
       finger cutting coming in.

287
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:24,162
   And you're just gonna kind of
         go down, pull the meat.

288
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,431
    There it is.                

289
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,700
    Good job.                   
                     Rawr!      

290
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,435
We're gonna take the duck       
  and the chicken,              

291
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,771
and I'm gonna hit it            
with a little Cajun seasoning.  

292
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:35,172
Throw the duck down.            

293
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,107
Same with the chicken.          

294
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,508
             The chicken goes on
                 a little --    

295
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,844
                   This is      
             the super-hot side.

296
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:40,778
             A little less hot. 

297
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,913
    Right. Right.               

298
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,247
Now what I'm gonna do           
 is put some of them            

299
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,583
blackening seasonings           
      on there.                 

300
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,119
              Whoa!             

301
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,921
I like how you let me           
jump in on this part.           

302
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,123
             Hey. You can cough.

303
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,459
      FIERI: Now, to start      
 piecing this bad boy together. 

304
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,794
          Virgin olive oil here.

305
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:57,062
          Get it into the seams,

306
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,264
      the pockets where you took
            the thigh bones out.

307
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,665
             A little blackening
                on this guy.    

308
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,067
          Then take some of this
        cornbread stuffing here.

309
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,069
     Now you're gonna go to your
          spinach stuffing here,

310
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,005
            and you're gonna put
         some andouille sausage.

311
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,673
FIERI: And you guys make        
the andouille sausage, also?    

312
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:09,808
              Here on premises. 

313
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,409
                    Some        
       roasted red bell peppers.

314
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:12,944
Ah, that looks good.            

315
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,813
 Now you're gonna take your duck
             inside this turkey.

316
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,548
Let me ask you this, boss.      

317
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,817
Why isn't the chicken down?     
    He's bigger.                

318
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:23,622
              Well, turducken.  

319
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,489
             That's the turkey, 
              then the duck...  

320
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,825
Give me the knife.              
            ...then the chicken.

321
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,359
              You're not doing  
                as much now.    

322
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,694
You're just kind of hiding      
  it in there now.              

323
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,363
           Yeah. Now we're gonna
             go to the chicken. 

324
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:32,764
   I bet you have               
  a lot of friends              

325
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,298
  come Thanksgiving             
 and Christmas time.            

326
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,167
      You're just gonna take it,

327
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:39,638
    and you're gonna bring it up
          and turn it like this.

328
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,507
    Sometimes, it's best to have
      a friend help you hold it.

329
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,609
     Let me see                 
if I can find somebody.         

330
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,580
    When is your                
spring clothing line coming out?

331
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:50,782
'Cause you're really            
  doing a MAC job.              

332
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,917
Dude, you make that look        
      so easy.                  

333
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,386
That might be one of            
  the best-looking              

334
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,589
 uncooked food items            
    I've ever...                

335
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:58,790
I mean, it's just beautiful.    

336
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,725
    And you just want to kind of
             set it up in here. 

337
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:04,729
    Now, how long               
does super bird take?           

338
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,331
            This super bird here
             is gonna take about

339
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,401
               12 to 13 hours   
               at 200 degrees.  

340
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:10,668
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.         
      How many?                 

341
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,004
               12 to 13 hours.  

342
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,139
        Okay.                   
  So that goes in.              

343
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,073
           Slide it on in there.

344
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,543
  So you just close             
  that oven and...              

345
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,746
                [ Whistles ]    

346
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,216
                  It's hot.     

347

00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,286
 There's a good part            
    right there.                

577
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,155
        It has huge crust on it,

578
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:53,691
 but then it's just pillowy soft
               on the inside.   

579
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,430
             I get a little bit 
     of that rosemary on that --

580
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:00,631
               On that bread.   

581
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,433
          It tastes like holiday
             right off the bat. 

582
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,435
              MAN:              
   It looks good on your table  

583
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,170
        with your flowers       
    or whatever you're doing.   

584
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:08,572
             MAN #2:            
   It's a great place to come   

585
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,441
  and feel like you're welcome  
          all the time.         

586
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:11,442
    There you go.               

587
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:13,377
               Pratt, amazing.  
Thank you, my friend.           

588
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,979
                 I love it.     

589
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:19,383
             FIERI:             
  Up next, on this full hour -- 
     ultimate turkey fest...    

590
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,184
That's good bird, man.          

591
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:21,652
       ...in New Orleans.       

592
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,520
This is like food Mardi Gras    
   right here.                  
                   There you go.

593
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,656
 Thanksgiving, Big Easy-style...

594
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:28,659
I'm not kidding you.            
That is ridiculously fantastic. 

595
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:29,727
 ...all the way down to dessert.

596
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,229
  How do you think              
I should get after it?          

597
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:43,841
  So, I'm here in New Orleans,  
    on Elysian Fields Avenue,   

598
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:46,576
  right between I-10 and I-610. 

599
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,912
     Now, when I'm thinking     
   of great food in this area,  

600
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,047
    and there's a lot of it,    

601
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,115
       I got to be honest.      

602
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,050
     I'm not thinking about     
          Thanksgiving.         

603
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:56,853
Well, that's until I heard about
 Sammy's Food Service and Deli. 

604
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,255
               Turkey dinner,   
             working coming up. 

605
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,925
      It's just a wonderful     
  New Orleans local restaurant. 

606
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,059
               Turkey dinner.   

607
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,728
      FIERI: Doing a killer     
    New Orleans Thanksgiving.   

608
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,729
              Mmm.              

609
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:07,197
Thanksgiving is a big time      
   in New Orleans.              

610
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,200
           Coming up.           
    And it's a huge tradition   

611
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:11,002
      for self-taught chef,     
        Sammy Schlegel...       

612
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:12,803
When you cook everything        
     homemade...                

613
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:15,005
  ...at a joint that used to be 
   his uncle's butcher shop...  

614
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,140
Turkey dinner for here.         

615
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:18,608
   ...till Sammy and his wife,  
        Gina, took over.        

616
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,277
     Turkey and oyster dressing.

617
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,413
    Butcher chop                
turns into a sandwich shop.     

618
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:24,281
Now turns into making           
some Thanksgivings...           

619
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,016
        Wonderful turkey        
       and cranberry. Mmm.      

620
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,285
  FIERI: Done the Big Easy way. 

621
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,552
Dressing with oysters.          

622
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:29,987
This is New Orleans.            
We always have oysters.         

623
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,088
           That's the way it is.

624
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,223
     Okay, well,                
give me the rub down.           

625
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:34,425
             Get our beds set up
       for our turkey to lie on.

626
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:37,295
               Celery, garlic,  
        coarsely chopped onions.

627
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,163
These are also gonna            
create a lot of great flavor    

628
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:40,030
for our gravy later.            

629
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:40,897
                   Absolutely.  
     Okay.                      

630
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:41,698
                Paint him up.   

631
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,767
     A little garlic butter oil.

632
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,101
              And that's gonna  
          give him a nice sheen,

633
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:46,303
              make this poultry 
         seasoning stick to him.

634
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,772
      Try not to miss any spots.

635
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:49,373
I think you might have          
    missed there.               

636
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,641
  There you go. Good job.       
               Now we're good.  

637
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,709
    Did you make                
 the chicken stock?             

638
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:52,777
         From the chicken backs.

639
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:53,777
It's a sandwich shop.           

640
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:54,978
              Put it in there.  

641
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,714
So that's gonna make some       
great gravy on the bottom.      

642
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:57,581
   Stuffing time.               

643
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,582
         Half a pound of butter.

644
00:21:58,584 --> 00:21:59,717
              We're gonna make  
              a bechamel sauce. 

645
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:01,452
      Bechamel?                 
    For stuffing?               

646
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:03,120
                   Some flour.  
Build a little rue.             

647
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:04,255
   Throw a little               
   milk in there.               

648
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:05,723
             Get a nice, little,
             creamy paste here. 

649
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:08,459
              Sauté some celery 
           and red bell peppers,

650
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:10,194
      onions, green bell pepper.

651
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:11,329
         I'm gonna need a spoon.

652
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,331
    Well, listen,               
I just showed up with car keys. 

653
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,666
            Ah, I'm telling you.

654
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,268
       How you like them apples?

655
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,737
  Please don't ask              
    for a mixer.                

656
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:20,671
             Put our butter in. 

657
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,272
  Sweat the veggies             
    a little bit.               

658
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,874
Butter's kind of helping        
  them mellow out.              

659
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,610
      Take our oysters, put them
in this little chopping machina.

660
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:27,811
                Break them up   
                a little bit.   

661
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,547
That's not something            
 you see every day.             

662
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:31,949
         Releases up the flavor.
 Huge.                          

663
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,951
   Add some of this garlic here,
                 the thyme.     

664
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:35,419
    What was that word?         
                       Thyme.   

665
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:36,754
        Thyme.                  
                      Thyme.    

666
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:39,289
Red pepper flakes, black pepper,
             some Cajun season, 

667
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,557
       bay leaves, chicken base.

668
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,826
    Smells great.               

669
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,694
Look at the amount of oysters   
to the amount of bread.         

670
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,163
 This guy is crazy.             

671
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:47,164
                    Hey.        

672
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,365
        Hey.                    

673
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,766
You have the french bread       
     brought in.                

674
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:50,834
                    Yep.        

675
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:51,702
That's good, even stale.        

676
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:52,903
               All right, Guy.  

677
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,505
         I know this is the part
        you've been waiting for.

678
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:56,306
              Put the bechamel  
                in here now.    

679
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,642
You're building the gravy       
right into the stuffing.        

680
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:00,511
    Here we go with the oysters.
                All that in.    

681
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:03,113
I want that over some pasta.    
Forget putting it in stuffing.  

682
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:04,982
              Grated Parmesan,  
           touch of lemon juice,

683
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:06,050
             flat-leaf parsley. 

684
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,585
  Can I just start              
dipping the bread in it,        

685
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:08,919
  forget the whole              
 Thanksgiving thing?            

686
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,588
              Sure. Absolutely. 

687
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:13,790
Is that your five bucks         
on the floor over there?        

688
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,059
          Oh, man. My lucky day.
                Look at this.   

689
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,394
So worth five bucks.            

690
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,130
This has just got to be a dip   
with some bread and some...     

691
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,532
              That's a thought. 
                  Exactly.      

692
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:22,933
 Oh, and the oysters            
     are fresh?                 

693
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:23,934
             Oysters are fresh. 

694
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:26,470
           And we have five eggs
                beaten here.    

695
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:28,405
   Oh. Wait, wait,              
  wait, wait, wait.             

696
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,140
Before you put the eggs         
     in it, man.                

697
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,608
    Now, I'm gonna fold this in.

698
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,411
I'm not kidding you.            
That is ridiculously fantastic. 

699
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,213
Gonna bake a little bit?        
         We're pre-cooking this.

700
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:37,347
         We let those eggs cook.

701
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,748
  Out of the oven,              
   into that bird.              

702
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,684
             Stuffing the bird. 
              Tuck his legs in. 

703
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:41,818
        Give him a little truss.

704
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,487
         Birds gonna go in, 350.

705
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:44,622
  Hour and a half?              
                      Correct.  

706
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:46,156
                Now it's time   
             to make our gravy. 

707
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,758
'Cause you already fortified it 
with some chicken stock.        

708
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,428
     Turn this boat motor loose.

709
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,296
     Add a little texture to it.
                 Here we go.    

710
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:55,432
           Go ahead and cut this
        breast lobe off of here.

711
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,567
I don't really think it's fair  
that I should have all that.    

712
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,103
             Feel free to share.

713
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,438
   This seasoning               
on the outside of this,         

714
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,707
along with that garlic butter   
    rub you did,                

715
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:04,909
that's good bird, man.          

716
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:06,176
         Put it on a plate here.

717
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,511
Did you make the cranberry?     

718
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,446
     Yeah, this is what you been
         waiting for right here.

719
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,314
Right out of the bird.          

720
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:13,316
            And a little topping
                of the gravy.   

721
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:14,184
        Mmm.                    

722
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,520
Dude, that's super-tasty.       
        Wow.                    

723
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,856
     The turkey                 
is ridiculously tender.         

724
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:20,457
    The stuffing                
has great texture to it.        

725
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,792
I mean, it's big flavor.        

726
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,794
You can really taste            
the oysters, a boatload of them.

727
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:27,330
And the gravy is right on point,
up at ridiculous level.         

728
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,332
This is like food Mardi Gras    
   right here.                  
                   There you go.

729
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,802
    WOMAN: The turkey dinner,   
        it's really good.       

730
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,270
   The dressing is delicious.   

731
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:35,473
     You taste the oysters.     
                       Oh, yeah.

732
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:36,806
                   Perfect      
             Thanksgiving meal. 

733
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,609
           And that's how you do
            a Thanksgiving right

734
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:39,409
               in New Orleans.  

735
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:40,945
That's how you do it.           
        Mmm.                    

736
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:42,412
 SAMMY: Pick up.                
     FIERI: And for dessert...  

737
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,348
FIERI: Pumpkin bread pudding?   
    GINA: Pumpkin bread pudding.

738
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,550
 Especially around Thanksgiving,
             you got to have it.

739
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:48,818
You know when it starts off     
     with this,                 

740
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,686
   makes me happy.              

741
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:50,687
   A mess of eggs.              

742
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,489
                Mess of eggs.   
               Whipping cream.  

743
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,957
    Get in there                
  and get you some.             
                         Yeah.  

744
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:57,761
  Brown sugar, some white sugar,
        roasted, pureed pumpkin.

745
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:59,896
           And then we have some
               pumpkin spice.   

746
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:00,697
     Necessary.                 

747
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,166
                Some vanilla.   
   Vanilla.                     

748
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,034
                Vanilla beans.  
  The scrapings                 
 of the vanilla beans.          

749
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:04,902
                    Yes.        

750
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:06,303
      Puree everything together.

751
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:09,106
A big pumpkin omelet            
    right there.                

752
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:11,575
                 All right.     
          Now some French bread.

753
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:13,577
So, you take the french bread   
  that's left over,             

754
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:15,279
grind it up, crust and all.     

755
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:17,314
            And we're just gonna
             pour that right in.

756
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:19,783
Wow. You guys get serious       
     about this.                

757
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,252
             This will sit for, 
              maybe, 20 minutes 

758
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,321
               just to absorb   
               all the liquid.  

759
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:25,589
 Into the big chunks            
      of bread.                 

760
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:27,123
What are these little           
   tasty morsels?               

761
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,593
                    Those       
            are candied walnuts.

762
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:31,462
        Just to add a little bit
              of flavor to it.  

763
00:25:31,464 --> 00:25:33,063
 There's some nice,             
little texture in there.        

764
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:36,066
         And then I'm gonna need
           that pan right there.

765
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:37,468
    There you go.               

766
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,135
[ Whistles ] Down right         
down to the number, huh?        

767
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:40,137
                    Yeah.       

768
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:41,739
     We're gonna bake it at 300.

769
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:42,940
  Down for an hour.             

770
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:44,541
 So you bring a lot             
of that moisture out.           

771
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,809
   Just sits there              
 and compacts down.             

772
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:47,010
    That's crazy.               

773
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,079
     But I like                 
these little candied walnuts    

774
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:50,614
that I just picked out of there.

775
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:51,749
         Would you like a slice?

776
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:53,017
 Is that cooled down            
    a little bit?               

777
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:54,685
Them candied walnuts            
taste like pumpkin pie.         

778
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:56,687
I'm not a big bread pudding fan.
I got to be honest with you.    

779
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:57,554
                   You aren't?  
        No.                     

780
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,822
 It's the egg ratio.            

781
00:25:58,824 --> 00:25:59,890
 Just not necessary.            

782
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,225
Should be able to put           
something else in it.           

783
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:02,292
    Chicken stock               
   would be good.               

784
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:03,494
                  Oh, okay.     

785
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:05,028
           Well, we're gonna see
              if you like this. 

786
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,497
    I'm a fan of                
 this bread company.            

787
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:08,966
So I got to believe that with   
the bread being chewy and all...

788
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:10,233
             Oh, it's wonderful.

789
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,669
                 Rum sauce.     
  Cream, sugar, rum, cornstarch.

790
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:13,771
         Ah.                    

791
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:15,839
  How do you think              
I should get after it?          

792
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:17,107
Attack it from the left?        

793
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,175
    I'm gonna go                
right in the center.            

794
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:21,311
    Look at that.               
Smells like pumpkin pie.        

795
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:24,048
[ Chuckles ] I'm gonna be       
eating these words for a while. 

796
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,849
    That is some                
tasty bread pudding.            

797
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:28,785
It's got a good crunch.         
It's not pumpkin madness.       

798
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,055
 The rum sauce isn't            
super over-the-top sweet.       

799
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:33,524
Could be the holidays           
      or what.                  

800
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:34,858
  There's something             
  about that combo              

801
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,860
because I just ate four more    
bites than I expected I would.  

802
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:37,994
 That's really good.            

803
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,530
    Nice job.                   
                   Thank you.

 I'm here in Detroit, Michigan, 

830
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:38,155
     right across the street    
    from the Eastern Market,    

831
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,490
   to check out a pizza joint   

832
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:41,358
         where the owner        
       got his inspiration

       inspiration from it      

835
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,497
     that he named the joint    
            after it.           

836

846
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:06,049
       who chucked his own      
  medical career out the window 

847
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:09,353
             in 2008            
  to open his own pizza joint.

the dough aficionado?           

849
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:13,390
           Well, it was actually
                  Supino's,     

850
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:14,792
the name of my father's hometown
                  in Italy.     

851
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,526
          And I went back there,
         had some amazing pizza.

852
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,995
You were the tallest person     
   in the village.              

853
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:19,462
               By a long shot.  

854
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,398
  I was inspired by their pizza.
       I thought it was amazing.

855
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,932
               Over the years,  
  I developed a crust of my own.

856
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,801
   In my little KitchenAid mixer
              on my countertop. 

857
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,402
  I used to mix a batch of dough
              almost every day  

858
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,071
 for about seven years straight,
           just trying to get it

859
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,006
           what I really wanted.

860
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:30,674
    You ate pizza               
seven years in a row?           

861
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:32,543
        My friends and relatives
     benefited from it, as well.

862
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:33,743
     All right.                 
So let's make some dough.       

863
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,145
              We're gonna start 
          by putting the dry mix

864
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,013
                    into        
       the 60-quart Hobart here.

865
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:37,214
 What kind of flour             
    are we using?               

866
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,082
        We're using bread flour.
              Nice elasticity.  

867
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,617
      So, now,                  
you're not a double-zero guy?   

868
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,418
      I'm not a double zero guy.
         This is not Neapolitan.

869
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,887
               It's more like   
   an East-Coast-American style.

870
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,622
         It borrows a little bit
   from the Italian styles, too.

871
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:46,823
           A little bit of yeast
               to go in this.   

872
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,025
  Dry active yeast.             

873
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:49,693
             Now I'm gonna make 
      my wet mix -- water, salt.

874
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:51,161
And the oil's gonna go in       
the water here, too?            

875
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:52,229
                  Yes, sir.     

876
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,497
            And we're just gonna
                  add this.     

877
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:54,898
And when will you use it?       
                      Tomorrow. 

878
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,767
   So you at least              
give it a 24-hour rest?         

879
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:58,301
Really develop some of          
 that yeast flavor.             

880
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,237
But we'll use some of the dough 
that you made yesterday.        

881
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,372
                 Absolutely.    

882
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:04,707
      FIERI: Twice a week,      
  Dave hits the Eastern Market  

883
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,844
        across the street       
  for the freshest ingredients. 

884
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:08,311
             Thanks a lot, guys.

885

887
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:14,951

       one of his buddies.      

888
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,920
           It's a smoked turkey.
                 Delicious.     

889
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,590
      Dave and the City Wing guy
           collaborated on this.

890
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:20,924
     Here's the City Wing Thing.

891
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,259
 Now, are you really            
 a City Wings dude,

893

          It's my spot.         

894
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,529
Oh, that's your spot?           
  You're the dude?              

895
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:27,397

  Nice!                         

896
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:30,067
Nice, brine-smoked              
 turkey legs.                   
                      Yes, sir. 

897
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:31,802
           We're gonna make some
             braised turkey legs

898
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:33,069
         for the City Wing Thing
                   pizza.       

899
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:33,870
Oh. See it every day.           

900
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,138
                    Yeah.       

901
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,739
              I'm not a big fan 
     of chicken breast on pizza.

902
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,008
           And I've been looking
          for a poultry product.

903
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,610
    Throw the smoked turkey legs
                  in here.      

904
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:40,811
                 We got some    
           quartered red onions,

905
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:41,945
          Frank's Red Hot Sauce.

906
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,680
Oh, so we are going after       
a real chicken wing flavor.     

907
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:44,815
         A little bit of a tang.
                   Sugar.       

908
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:46,149
               Now we're gonna  
          cover this with water.

909
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,551
         I've got garlic cloves,
         really more for flavor.

910
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:48,819
So, how long we gonna           
   let it go for?               

911
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:50,353
              This is gonna go  
          for about 2 1/2 hours.

912
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:51,955
  They're the bomb.             

913
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,223
    That's tasty.               

914
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:55,859
The turkey leg and the thigh,   
they have such rich flavor.     

915
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:57,227
                Yeah. We want   
         a little texture there.

916
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:58,228
                We don't want   
             to turn it to mush.

917
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,696
Yeah, you don't want            
 to turn into mush.

                    you just... 

1130
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:49,972
Nice roasted flavor,            
  not super spicy,              

1131
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,308

And this chili apple chutney's  
gonna go on the turkey?

         A little bit of sugar. 

1136
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:02,318
So, about a cup and a half      
     of chilies.                

1137
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,653
     Let it all                 
   just cook down.              

1138

   And then you'll start getting

    let it soak into the turkey,

         Got the Muenster cheese
                   going.       

1148
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,140
  As in Herman?                 
                       As in.   

1149
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:26,676
      So, we got the green-chili
               chutney going.   

1150
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:29,879
                 Here we go.    

1151
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:31,213
Is that a serious portion       
      or what?                  

1152
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:32,349
       That's a serious portion.

1153
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:33,617
            We do about 8 ounces
                per sandwich.   

1154
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:36,152
         Heirloom tomatoes fresh
         from one of the gardens

1155
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:38,020
             here in the valley,
                  avocado.      

1156
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,090
               There you go --  
             your very own T&A. 

1157
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,227
That's what she gave me,        
        okay?                   

1158
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:45,361
             That's a sandwich. 

1159
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:47,464
 No, that's a dinner            
      for six.                  

1160
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,373
        What do you think, yeah?

1161
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,775
The sweet and the heat          

1162
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,243
with the roasted turkey         
 and the mustard --             

1163
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:02,512
    I don't know                
where you came up with the idea.

1164
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:03,713
   It's delicious,              

1165
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,448
 and the little burn            
of the chili in the back...     

1166
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,783
             It's just the love.

1167
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,184
   It is the love.              

1168
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:10,453
             Carley,            
 you have a T&A sandwich ready. 

1169
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,055
       The turkey's moist.      

1170
00:38:12,057 --> 00:38:13,723
      The bread is awesome.     

1171
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,592
  It has all the chilies in it, 
      which is really good.     

1172
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:17,594
   It's enough for two people.  
        That's for sure.        

1173
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:19,128
             FIERI:             
  Marie just wants to feed you, 

1174
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,065
       a skill she's taken      
way beyond this tiny restaurant.

1175
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:23,866
 What are you doing             
for all these hours?            

1176
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,134
       I mean,                  
there are seven tables.         

1177
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,469
           Well, because we feed
              charter schools.  

1178
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,271
       So I feed a thousand kids
    before 10:00 in the morning.

1179
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:30,940
  A thousand?!                  
                   A thousand.  

1180
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:33,008
      I'm here for my community.
        I'm here for New Mexico.

1181
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,345
    I'm here to feed the future,
   and we do it all from scratch

1182
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:38,548
      just the way my mom and my
 grandma taught me how to do it.

1183
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,683
  You're gonna get good quality 
      every time you come.      

1184
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,885
     Every time I come here,    
   I get something different.   

1185
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:43,753
       I love this place.       

1186
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:45,020
You're priceless, girl.         

1187
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:46,556
I'm gonna tell you something.   
You really are priceless.       

1188
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:48,424
You -- You give a lot           
     to people,                 

1189
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,894
  and it comes out              
    in your food.               

1190
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:52,428
  You're the bomb.              

1191
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,463
                 Thank you.     

1192
00:38:56,902 --> 00:38:58,902
           Something's          
     a little strange here.     

1193
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:00,503
    Joint looks like a diner.   

1194
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,439
 But it's in Glendale, Arizona. 

1195
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:04,774
  Oh, yeah, and they're serving 
    southern style barbecue.    

1196
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:06,242
     You know, low-and-slow.    

1197
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:10,646
   But they tell me the guy's   
 a competitive barbecue champion

1198
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:13,315
  who's won some of the biggest 
  competitions in the country.  

1199
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,385
                 Let's see,     
            I've got 300 awards.

1200
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:18,121
What's the most prestigious     
  event you won in?             

1201
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:19,589
        Oh, always Jack Daniels.

1202
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:21,191
   And it's those same recipes  

1203
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:23,259
     that he's cranking out     
  for the neighborhood crowd... 

1204
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:24,927
          Got the pork and slaw.
        ...every day.           

1205
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:25,928
 MAN: The ribs are really good. 

1206
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,397
          Great flavor,         
    and they're very tender.    

1207
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:29,733
   The beef brisket. It tastes  
  really good, and it's moist.  

1208
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:31,000
I love the pulled pork.         

1209
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:32,468
            The best.           

1210
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:36,072
 FIERI: All done low-and-slow in
 Roger's mesquite-fired smoker. 

1211
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:37,206
                   This is      
      the heart of the business.

1212
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,476
    He learned how to do this   
       almost 30 years ago      

1213
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:41,611
  at a joint called Thee Pitts. 

1214
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:43,279
We got the whole farm on here,  
      or what?                  

1215
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:44,814
         What he opened         
       a place of his own,      

1216
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:47,083
 he called it Thee Pitts Again. 

1217
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:48,151
  I love the ribs.              

1218
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:49,486
I like the chicken wings.       

1219
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:50,753
I like the onion rings.         

1220
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,154
        Sir, let's make it easy.

1221
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:53,823
        Anything you don't like?

1222
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:54,824
         No.                    

1223
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:57,360
      And beyond the smoke,     
        there's the rub.        

1224
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:59,228
              Teach me the rub, 
                oh, wise one.   

1225
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,164
WAGNER: Season salt,            
  Spanish paprika.              

1226
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:04,834
It's got a little different     
taste than regular paprika.     

1227
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:06,836
I toss in a little sugar.       
               A little sugar.  

1228
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:09,905
A little granulated garlic,     
just a little bit of cumin.     

1229
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,574
And also a pinch of salt.       

1230
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:12,976
               A little onion.  

1231
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:14,510
   A little onion.              

1232
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:15,979
    Some paprika.               
    The parsley.                

1233
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:17,113
                The parsley.    
   Parsley.                     

1234
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:18,648
         Because if your paprika
           is looking like that,

1235
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,717
      that's why I'm not winning
              big competitions. 

1236
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,452
             I've been thinking 
    it's parsley the whole time.

1237
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:24,921
And then we have my ingredient  
  here that I add.              

1238
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,189
              You've got about  
                half of one,    

1239
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:27,657
                and then half   
           of your secret, so...

1240
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:28,858
        Yeah.                   
Now you're calculating it.      

1241
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,293
                  Who gets      
           to make the rub here?

1242
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:31,127
        I do.                   

1243
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,328
                  Only you?     
      Yeah.                     

1244
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,863
             You're the only one
             that makes the rub?

1245
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:35,198
  I'm the only one              
 that makes the rub             

1246
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,333
    And that goes on everything?
  Everything.                   

1247
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:39,335
   I've used this               
  in competitions.              

1248
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:41,204
And I've won chicken.           
   I've won ribs.               

1249
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:43,272
 I've won shoulders.            

1250
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,340
It's very versatile.            

1251
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:46,209
 He's even smoking whole turkeys
            with it.            

1252
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:48,478
I've never had barbecued turkey.
        This is a first.        

1253
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,879
       So how do you serve this?

1254
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:51,413
 We pull it.                    
                All pulled bird?

1255
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:53,216
  All pulled.                   
       Give me the rundown here.

1256
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:55,151
  This is margarine             
 to give it a glaze.            

1257
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:58,821
It also let's the seasoning     
    adhere to it.               

1258
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,156
Give it the old rub.            

1259
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:02,758
              Take this beauty  
      and just lay her right in.

1260
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,561
FIERI: Now, how long            
is that gonna run for?          

1261
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:08,431
       Usually, a bird this size
       will take about 14 hours.

1262
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,300
    Look at that.               

1263
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:11,901
                    Mmm.        

1264
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:12,902
                    Mmm.        

1265
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:15,170
                  Aw, man.      
       It sure is tender turkey.

1266
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,774
      Oh, yeah.                 

1267
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:18,908
         Were you talking to me?

1268
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,776
      Really, really good,      
          moist turkey.         

1269
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:21,977
          Very tender.          

1270
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,515
        FIERI: And great        
  with Roger's homemade sauce.  

1271
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:26,983
               Sauce is money.  

1272
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:30,519
I start off with brown sugar,   
Worcestershire sauce,           

1273
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:31,787
 put in the mustard.            

1274
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,856
       I've never seen that much
          mustard go in a sauce.

1275
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,124
   Oh, yeah.                    
                Want me to help?

1276
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:36,792
        Yeah.                   
  That'd be great.              

1277
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,461
Heinz ketchup is what I use.    

1278
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:40,463
             So, no cooking it. 

1279
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:41,264
   No cooking it.               

1280
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:41,998
             No messing with it?

1281
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,332
 No messing with it.            

1282
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,534
             That's good sauce. 

1283
00:41:44,536 --> 00:41:46,936
       And folks here say       
    it's great on everything.   

1284
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:49,272
    Tangy, but not too much.    

1285
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:52,809
  He just, somehow or another,  
  just has the magic about him. 

1286
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:56,812
    I think he just eats it,    
    sleeps it, and dreams it.   

1287
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,147
                 Well done.     

1288
00:41:58,149 --> 00:41:59,682
      Now I know why you've been
        in so many competitions,

1289
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,018
            why you won so many.

1290
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,286
                 Real deal.     

1291
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,888
          So, that's it         
       for this road trip.      

1292
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,222
        But don't worry.        

1293
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:10,293
    We got plenty more joints   
 to find all over this country. 

1294
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:11,895
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

1295
00:42:11,897 --> 00:42:15,631
               on               
 "Diners, Drive-ins and Dives." 

1296
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,433
 You're gonna start             
hearing some funny sounds.      

1297
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:18,901
          [ Wheezing ]          

1298
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,770
              What is going on  
                 right now?     

1299
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:21,571
'Cause it's still urgling.      

1300
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:22,438
          "Urgling" is the term?

1301
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,306
                It's urgling?   

1302
00:42:23,308 --> 00:42:24,307
I clearly should just write,    

1303
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:25,775
like, a new dictionary          
for this restaurant.            

1304
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:27,777
               You should have  
         the funking dictionary.
