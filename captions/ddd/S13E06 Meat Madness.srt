I'VE MADE A LOT OF CUBAN FOOD,  
          MY FRIEND.            

250
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:51,069
   I HAVE NEVER                 
PUT KETCHUP IN IT.              
        NEVER PUT KETCHUP IN IT.

251
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,603
          LOT OF PEOPLE,        
 WHAT THEY DO IS THEY ADD SUGAR.

252
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,738
         WE DON'T ADD ANY SUGAR.

253
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,674
           THIS IS WHAT GIVES IT
            THE NICE SWEETNESS. 

254
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,943
  HEY, NEXT TIME, HOW ABOUT     
WE JUST CUT THE WHOLE LID OFF?  

255
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:00,411
        MY UNCLE DOESN'T WANT IT
           THAT WAY. (laughs)   

256
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,679

             LITTLE BY LITTLE.  

258

GONNA COOK LIKE THIS?           

259
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,751

00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,553
    FOR ABOUT A GOOD 20 MINUTES.

261
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:09,955

00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,683
             WOW--WITH THE SKIN.
                LET'S SEE IT.   

561
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:41,619
WHOLE COCONUT MILK              
 AND SOME WATER.                

562
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,554
SALT, CURRY POWDER...           
                      (whistles)

563
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:46,624
 GARLIC, WHITE PEPPER,          
CORIANDER, CHILI POWDER,        

564
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,493
   GROUND GINGER,               
AND SOME LIME JUICE.            

565
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,761
   AND WE JUST                  
MASSAGE IT ALL IN.              

566
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,763
OH, YEAH.                       
                   IT'S LIKE    
              A THERAPY SESSION.

567
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,699
                   GREAT.       
            NOW FILL THE HOPPER.

568
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:57,301
    WE'VE SEEN THIS ENOUGH TIMES
           ON TRIPLE "D."       

569
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,503
        IT DOESN'T EVER GET OLD,

570
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:01,105
         ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GET
        THE SUPER THUNDER PRESS.

571
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,639
            GETTING ONE OF THOSE
                FOR MY HOUSE.   

572
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,774
         AND WHAT KIND OF CASING
            ARE WE GONNA USE?   

573
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,577
HOG CASING. SLIDE THAT ON.      
                     HERE WE GO.

574
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,779
   AND THEN WE START            
THE PROCESS OF STUFFING.        

575
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,581
               PARTY TIME. WHOA.

576
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,117
AND WE'RE DONE.                 

577
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,453
       THAT IS ABOUT THE FASTEST
           I'VE EVER SEEN IT.   

578
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:16,654
WE'LL JUST START                
 MAKING LINKS.                  

579
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,388
           AND THEN WE TAKE IT  
        TO THE KITCHEN AND COOK?

580
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,323
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

581
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,925
         LET'S MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

582
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,794
         HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE  
      TO COOK A SAUSAGE ON HERE?

583
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,062
SIX TO EIGHT MINUTES.           

584
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:27,598
      COOK IT OFF BOTH SIDES.   
   TRY NOT TO PIERCE THE CASING.

585
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,932
               THAT'S THE THING.

586
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:29,866
     WHEN YOU'RE COOKING SAUSAGE
           ON THE BARBECUE,     

587
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,002
      DON'T HIT IT WITH A KNIFE.

588
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,936
            EVERY TIME YOU HEAR 
          THAT JUICE COMING OUT,

589
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,671
               THAT'S FLAVOR    
           LEAVING THE BUILDING.

590
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,806
              WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
                 HIT IT WITH?   

591
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,942
SESAME OIL. THROW SOME          
ASIAN VEGGIES IN THERE.         

592
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:40,611
 BIT OF HOISIN.                 
STIR THAT AROUND.               

593
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,681
    YOU HAD THE BUN MADE TO FIT 
   THE CURVATURE OF THE SAUSAGE?

594
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,749
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

595
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:46,083
                    THAT'S COOL.

596
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,752
THE OTHER WAY.                  
 THERE WE GO.                   

597
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,586
               YOU JUST PUT     
         A LITTLE TOAST ON THAT.

598
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:50,687
THERE'S OUR LITTLE              
   BOUNCE TEST.                 

599
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,756
           YOU KNOW THE CASING'S
              NICE AND TIGHT.   

600
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:54,091
        THAT'S RIGHT.           
WE BABY THE SAUSAGE IN THERE.   

601
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:55,159
GET OUR VEGGIES IN THERE,       

602
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,760
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA            
  DRESS IT A BIT.               

603
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,897
MORE HOISIN, BIT OF HOT SAUCE,  
   OUR FAMOUS HOUSE SAUCE.      

604
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:04,569
IT'S A SPECIAL MAYO             
SOUR CREAM MIXTURE.             

605
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:06,704
              LOOK AT THAT. MMM.

606
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,573
              YOU GET THAT CURRY
              RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

607
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,308
          DEFINITELY WORKS WELL 
         WITH THE ACCOMPANIMENT,

608
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,643
       WITH THE HOT SAUCE,      
 LITTLE SWEETNESS IN THE HOISIN.

609
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:15,046
     I LIKE THE VEGGIE COMPONENT
               INTO IT.         

610
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,713
           MMM. NICE LITTLE SNAP
              TO THE SAUSAGE.   

611
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,649
    IT'S REALLY GOOD SAUSAGE.   
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, MAN.

612
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,317
THANKS.                         
                            MMM.

613
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,187
                             ♪♪ 

614
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:25,856
         THERE YOU GO.          
   WAY TO GET RIGHT AFTER IT.   

615
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,992
(woman) I THINK FALCONETTI'S    
   IS DEFINITELY UNIQUE.        

616
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:30,595
        WHAT KIND OF BAR DOESN'T
        SELL THEIR OWN SAUSAGES?

617
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:32,663
 EXA--I MEAN, YOU'RE MISSING IT 

618
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:33,798
     IF YOU'RE NOT SELLING      
       YOUR OWN SAUSAGES.       
               YEAH, EXACTLY.   
            SOMETHING'S MISSING.

619
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,599
      I LIKE YOUR BUSINESS PLAN.
             THANKS, GUYS.      

620
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:36,600
     ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.      
                       NICE JOB.

621
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:37,668
THANK YOU.                      

622
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,870
   (song ends, crowd cheers)    

623
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:41,872
  SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP,   
        BUT DON'T WORRY!        

624
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,875

     DRIVE-INS AND DIVES."      

627
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,015
      YOU EVER THINK ABOUT BEING
       A COUNTRY-WESTERN SINGER?

628
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:54,551
THOUGHT ABOUT IT. HAVEN'T HAD   
ENOUGH BAD STUFF HAPPEN TO ME.  

629
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,287
                        (laughs)

630
00:20:56,289 --> 00:21:00,157
(laughs)
