              into a menu item? 

226
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,169
          It's a pizza.         

227
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,905
             Okay. There we go. 

228
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,573
             We went up and down
              like eight times  

229
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,375
               in the elevator  
             to get the answer. 

230
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,110
                 But pizza's    
       the main foundation here?

231
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,646
That's what we started it       
with, and then we've expanded.  

232
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,848
  WOMAN: It's funny to me that  
   they call it a pizza joint,  

233
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,117
     because there's so much    
      more than pizza here.     

234
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,185
      And a Tailored Tony.      

235
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,989
  The Tailored Tony, it's like  
  a home-cooked spaghetti sauce 

236
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,857
 with some crusty focaccia bread

237
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,660
    that's, like, soft in the   
 middle, crunchy on the outside.

238
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,195
So what are we making?          

239
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,997
   Today, we're making our dough
      for our homemade focaccia.

240
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,231
   All right, so,               
break it down for me.           

241
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,667
          We just add our water,
           flour, organic sugar,

242
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,002
                simple yeast,   
         extra virgin olive oil.

243
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,672
And this is gonna mix           
up for, what -- 10 minutes?     
                           Yep. 

244
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,874
And it proofs for a day?        

245
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,675
So, you get all that great      
   yeasty flavor.               

246
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,810
So, we hit a drizzle            
of olive oil on there.          

247
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,412
     Give us a really nice crust
               on the bottom.   

248
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:36,414
Little bit of marjoram.         
    Oregano, too.               

249
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,284
Onion granules, and a           
salt-and-pepper blend.          

250
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:41,552
So, then, we got to press out   
the dough to fit the ka-pan.    

251
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,421
     You add extra syllables in.

252
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:44,890
        I like it. You're making
             your own language. 

253
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,024
   Oh, we make up               
 our own stuff here.            

254
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,158
   You ever heard               
  of a wheel knife?             

255
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,359
         -A wheel knife?        
             -Yeah.             

256
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,295
 -It's got to be a pizza cutter.
        -Yeah. Good job.        

257
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:51,696
Extra virgin olive oil.         

258
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,565
               We're gonna do   
      the same thing on the top.
Just a repeat.                  

259
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,166
                Are we gonna    
            let this proof again

260
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,301
           with all of the herbs
      and the giddy-up on there?

261
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,836
Yeah, it doubles in size,       
    so we wrap it               

262
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,972
with the wrap master            
and get it nice and...          

263
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,774
           With the wrap master?

264
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,576
Yeah, it's not one busting      
 flows or anything.             

265
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:05,844
      It's just                 
 the plastic puller.            

266
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:08,846
             Ah hah! His point. 
               That was good.   

267
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,181
          What temp are we gonna
         cook it at in the oven?

268
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,983
  Pizza oven, 525.              
                     Next up?   

269
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,052
For the whole house, we do      
a marinara in all the stuff --  

270
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,520
    our spaghetti               
and everything like that.       

271
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:16,988
  But we make this              
for our meat sauce, too.        

272
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,590
   So, we're gonna              
  ground some beef.             

273
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,525
          Onions, basil, garlic.

274
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,460
Minced garlic, yeah.            
House-milled pepper.            

275
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,195
       Get it                   
nice and blended up.            

276
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,530
    And add it to               
  ground tomatoes.              

277
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,799
  Balsamic vinegar,             
  red wine vinegar,             

278
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,134
and extra virgin olive oil.     

279
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,403
   Now it's ready               
for our cooked meat.            
                        Okay.   

280
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,138
After the focaccia's            
     cooled off,                

281
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,540
 we put it facedown             
in the oven to toast.           

282
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,142
Our house meat sauce            
 that we've made up.            

283
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,476
         Are we both having one,
                 or is that     

284
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:39,744
              the normal amount 
              you put on there? 

285
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,746
   -That's the normal amount.   
       -That's ridiculous.      

286
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,347
 A little provolone.            

287
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,151
Red bell peppers, roasted,      
put it on some paper.           
               Back in the oven.

288
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,620
Until it's nice and toasted     
and melted and looking good.    

289
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:50,422
A little fresh basil            
 when it comes out.             

290
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,023
  It's ready to go.             

291
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:56,694
         So, it's an open-faced,
             mature sloppy joe. 
Essentially, yeah.              

292
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,029
             And a little Caesar
              here on the side? 

293
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:00,431
   House dressing,              
 homemade croutons.             

294
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,299
         I love Caesar dressing.

295
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:03,635
       It's a good-looking bite.

296
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:06,304
                     ♪♪         

297
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:09,907
  Really nice, light focaccia --
   not too heavy, not too dense.

298
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,376
                   I like       
            the salty provolone.

299
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,847
               But the kicker   
           on the whole thing --

300
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,782
                those roasted   
               red bells, man.  

301
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,885
           That's really singing
   through, that nice sweetness.

302
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,322
     Just a simple tomato sauce,
            using really good --

303
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,391
 I mean, if you're gonna make it
     that simple, you got to use

304
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,393
     really dynamite ingredients
             that shine through.
Yeah.                           

305
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,594
           -Excellent.          
      -Thank you very much.     

306
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,731
Tailored Tony with Caesar salad.

307
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:35,266
    The homemade focaccia is    
        really delicious.       

308
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:40,471
 The sauce has a really, really 
    full-body tomato flavor.    

309
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,606
     -Explosion in my mouth.    
        -Pretty gangster.       

310
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,142
     MAN: That Alfredo drop     
       with the chicken...      

311
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,978
  It's like it's made from your 
 own kitchen -- fresh, organic. 

312
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,146
           Everything's organic?

313
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,548
As we go, we've been evolving   
it and picking up more.         

314
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,016
We're the first ones            
bringing in the flour           

315
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,085
and the ground tomatoes and     
the paste that was organic.     

316
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,087
  I had to buy them             
 pallets at a time.             
                        Really? 

317
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,289
 STEVE: We got a spaghetti, add 
     meatballs on that one.     

318
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,757
   WOMAN: Everything is great.  
         Everything is.         

319
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,427

    feel bad after the meal.    

320
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,961
   You know, you actually feel  
          a lot better.         

321
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,630
    So, I'm gonna eat this, take
      a small nap, I'll be back.

00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:06,831

      digging into a hearty     
 calzone that screams "comfort."

    the soaseta.                

443
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,242
      -What does that mean?     
     -It means "Southwest."     

444
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,778
     Okay. And what kind of food
do you find down in the soaseta?

445
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,846
 Venezuelan, Cuban,             
     Colombian.                 

446
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,715
           Okay, so, is it weird
             that I'm taking you

447
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,583
        to a gourmet donut shop?

448
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,786
Not at all, brother.            
They're blowing up in Miami.    

449
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:22,720
                 Fantastic.     

450
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,121

451
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,058
           I hear it is. This is
    Mojo Donuts & Fried Chicken.

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,812
          hand-rolled, hand-cut.

460
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:48,947
               It's even fried  
            with the chopsticks,

461
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,614
              the way they were

  make sandwiches out of them.

00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,620
           Here's your

00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,621
   There's chicken in a donut.

 chicken and donut.             

467
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,428
     Best thing we could go with
 is our chicken brulee sandwich.

468
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,763
     All right,                 
so, how do we get started?      

469
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:06,698
               With our dough.

               Water. This is   
               our donut mix.   

471
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,701
               Next, we add in  
             some instant yeast.

472
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,837
          As soon as it starts  
          running, I'm gonna add
          the rest of the water.

473
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,238

    mixing time?                

474
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,373
               6 to 7 minutes.

477

 donuts, by the way.

00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,381

00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,515

480
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,584
    We're getting               
the center-cut donut.

482
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,720
             These will go next 
              into a proof box, 

483
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:30,788
            and they'll rise up.

487
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,927
              The oil actually  
               gets absorbed,   

488
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,529
               and even after   
               we pull it out,  

489
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:41,065
      it's still cooking because
   the oil is absorbed in there.

00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,533
Now, chicken tenders.

492
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,605

           pepper, salt, garlic.

493
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,139

  12-hour marinade,             

494
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,675

to be battering these in?       

495
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,479
      Our dry breading, and then
         we put it into our wet.

496
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:57,148

00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:00,752
All right, let's fry these up   
and build this brulee donut.    

499
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:04,021
            Okay. Wet the shell,
                 nice sugar.    

500
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,623

501
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,758
               Then, we start   
         caramelizing the shell.

502
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,027
That's culinary napalm

503
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,763

504
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,298
                  We put in     
               the tenderloin.  

505
