    A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY.    

314
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,341
       YOU KNOW, I WORKED       
     IN SOME BUTCHER SHOPS.     

315
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,342
          WHEN I WAS 12         
     GROWING UP IN FERNDALE,    

316
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,344
   I WORKED AT FERNDALE MEATS   
        MAKING THE JERKY.       

317
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,146
 WHEN I MOVED HERE TO LAS VEGAS 
        TO GO TO COLLEGE,       

318
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,681
  I WORKED AT SCHULMAN'S MEATS. 

319
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,884
   SO WHEN I FIND OUT THERE'S   
   A 70-YEAR-OLD BUTCHER SHOP   

320
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,686
 UP HERE IN NORTHWEST LAS VEGAS 
          THAT'S MAKING         

321
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,955
THEIR OWN SAUCE, THEIR OWN RUBS,
        THEIR OWN JERKY,        

322
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,557
       THEIR OWN SAUSAGE,       
       THEIR OWN BARBECUE,      

323
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,292
     AND THEY'RE SERVING IT     
     IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD,     

324
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,693
   I JUST GOTTA CHECK IT OUT.   

325
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,796
    THIS IS JOHN MULL'S MEATS   
      AND ROAD KILL GRILL.      

326
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:40,631
     YOU WANT SOME BRISKET?     
YES, SIR.                       

327
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,501
     THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC.     
ENJOY THAT NOW.                 

328
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,236
CHUCK MAKES                     
THE BEST BARBECUE IN TOWN.      

329
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:48,172
<i>THAT'D BE CHUCK FROMMER,</i>        
<i>JOHN MULL'S GRANDSON.</i>           

330
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:51,042
       SO YOUR GRANDFATHER OPENS
        THIS PLACE IN THE '40s. 

331
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,244
     THERE'S NO ELECTRICITY HERE
           IN THE STICKS.       

332
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,712
         I MEAN, THIS HAD TO BE 
             <i> STICK</i> STICKS.     

333
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:57,648
STICK STICKS.                   
                  WHY OUT HERE? 

334
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,051
IT WAS CHEAP.                   
          THEN YOUR DAD HAD IT, 
        THEN YOUR UNCLE HAD IT, 

335
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,453
             AND THEN YOU GOT IT
                   IN '81.      

336
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,387
   IT STARTED OUT IN BUTCHERING,
       AND IT TURNED INTO...    

337
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:05,256
EVERYTHING.                     

338
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,125
    WOULD YOU LIKE SOME RIBS?   
     HOW ABOUT SOME CHICKEN?    

339
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:08,659
        A LITTLE BRISKET?       

340
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:09,928
                  I NEED TO GET 
                 THE HOT LINKS. 

341
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,329
      LINKS ARE REALLY HOT.     
      YOU GOTTA BE CAREFUL.     

342
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,731
    A HOT LINK? NOW YOU KNOW    
     THESE ARE WORLD-FAMOUS.    

343
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,934
    TELL ME ABOUT               
THAT HOT LINK, BROTHER.         
     THAT HOT LINK IS THE BEST. 

344
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,803
          NOW IN LOUISIANA      
     AND TEXAS AND THOSE PARTS, 

345
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,938
              PEOPLE UNDERSTAND 
             WHAT A HOT LINK IS.

346
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,408
          IT'S A SPICY SAUSAGE, 
          BUT NOT OVERLY SPICY. 

347
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,143
       AND I THINK THAT THE REST
         OF THE COUNTRY NEEDS   

348
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,477
   TO KIND OF GET IN WITH THAT, 

349
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,079
       BECAUSE IT'S A FANTASTIC 
       SAUSAGE, WOULD YOU AGREE?

350
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,614
OH, YEAH, MOST DEFINITELY.      
                SO YOU'RE GONNA 
                 CUT THIS DOWN, 

351
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,215
        YOU'RE GONNA PROCESS IT,
        AND CASE IT?            

352
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,483
YES, SIR.                       
                      ALL HERE? 

353
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:33,551
MM-HMM.                         

354
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,688
                      ♪♪♪       

355
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,556
       AND WHAT ARE WE CUTTIN'? 
THIS IS THE SHOULDER CLOD.      

356
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,958
        THIS IS THE INSIDE PART 
                OF THE...       
SHOULDER.                       

357
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,693
               LOOK AT HOW SHARP
                 THE KNIFE IS.  

358
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,228
     I LIKE YOUR HOOK, CAPTAIN. 

359
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,097
THIS IS A "COME HERE" HOOK.     
         (laughs)               

360
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,465
         I'M JEALOUS. YOU GET TO
              COME OUT HERE     

361
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:50,101
           AND JUST CUT MEAT UP 
              AND PLAY BUTCHER. 

362
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,237
    YEAH, THAT'D BE             
KINDA COOL, WOULDN'T IT?        
                     (chuckles) 

363
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,772
       (chuckling) IF IT WASN'T 
                YOUR JOB.       

364
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:56,541
HAVE ONE--                      
          (both laugh)          

365
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,111
                  THERE YOU GO. 

366
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,714
WE'RE GONNA GRIND THE MEAT      
    FOR THE HOT LINKS.          

367
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:04,248
           NO NECKTIES ALLOWED. 

368
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:07,385
         AND YOU WONDER WHERE   
       PLAY-DOH GOT THEIR IDEA. 

369
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,654
RED SPAGHETTI.                  

370
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,523
         OKAY, WE'RE GONNA MAKE 
               THE EMULSION.    

371
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,392
      THE EMULSION WILL GIVE US 

372
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,661
           A BETTER PENETRATION 
                TO THE MEAT.    
            (clicks)            

373
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,062
           (whirring)           

374
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,530
 WHAT, ARE WE MAKING SNOW CONES?

375
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,332
                       EXACTLY. 

376
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,267
THIS SHOULD BE COOL.            

377
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,802
          GONNA ADD MEAT TO IT. 
WHY ARE WE ADDING               

378
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,471
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF MEAT       
  IN THERE, JUST AS A--         

379
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,206
JUST SOMETHING FOR IT           
    TO BIND TO...               

380
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,674
                       EXACTLY. 
TILL IT BECOMES A MEDIUM?       

381
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,809
LIKE A MEAT SLUSHIE.            
                       EXACTLY. 

382
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,946
HMM. LET ME GET MY STRAW OUT.   
            OKAY.               
                       (laughs) 

383
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:35,947
           THIS IS MILK POWDER. 

384
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,082
         ANY TIME YOU BREAK DOWN
                THE MEAT,       

385
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:39,483
         YOU ACTUALLY TAKE AWAY 
                PROTEIN,        

386
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:41,219
         SO YOU ADD MORE PROTEIN
               BACK TO IT.      

387
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:42,887
                        SALT.   

388
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,622
           WE GOT BLACK PEPPER. 
               SODIUM NITRITE.  

389
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,357
YEP, YOU GOTTA HAVE             
THE PINK IN THERE.              

390
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:47,959
  IT'S A PRESERVATIVE           
AND IT KEEPS THE COLOR.         

391
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,428
             CORIANDER. GARLIC. 
                  CARAWAY.      

392
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,629
HICKORY.                        
                  SMOKE POWDER. 

393
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:52,964
SHOULD BUY THAT COMPANY.        

394
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,333
              NUTMEG, PAPRIKA,  
             AND CAYENNE PEPPER.

395
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,635
  (whistles) IT DOES HAVE       
A HOT CHARACTERISTIC TO IT,     

396
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,703
  BUT IT'S NOT HOT LIKE YOU'RE  
     BURNING YOUR MOUTH OFF.    

397
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:03,040
            EXACTLY. NOW WE'RE  
           GONNA ADD SOME WATER.

398
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,575
EVERYBODY IN THE POOL.          

399
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:07,745
IT'S A MEAT SLURPEE SNOW CONE.  
            (whirring)          

400
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,781
         LOOKS TASTY, DON'T IT? 

401
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:13,384
YOU WANT ME TO GO GET           
     THE CONES?                 
                       (laughs) 

402
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,185
                WE'RE GONNA MIX 
             THE HOT LINKS NOW. 

403
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:16,654
NOW THE SLUSHIE GOES IN.        

404
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,756
           (whirring)           

405
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:24,262
             (Guy) OKAY. SO NOW 
             WE'VE GOT OUR MIX. 

406
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:25,863
         EVERYTHING'S COMBINED. 

407
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:28,733
     LOOK AT THAT SAUSAGE-MAKING
              MONSTER.          

408
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,668
   NO, I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU. 
(laughs)                        

409
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,170
                    LET'S ROLL. 

410
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,739
THIS IS A HYDRAULIC STUFFER.    

411
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:36,607
         PISTON'S GONNA COME UP 
             FROM THE BOTTOM?   
EXACTLY.                        

412
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,275
THIS IS THE CASING.             

413
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,011
  WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY PUT THAT 
ON THE STUFFING HORN RIGHT HERE.

414
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,880
               TIE THE END OFF. 
        (whirring)              

415
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,015
      HERE WE GO. AND YOU GONNA 
     RUN IT WITH A THUMB GAUGE? 

416
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,350
YES, SIR.                       

417
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,151
                       WOW!     

418
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:48,486
          THAT IS JUST YAHTZEE! 

419
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,820
 (button clicks, whirring stops)

420
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,755

529
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,180
            ARE THEY EVER GONNA 
           GET SMOKE? THAT'S IT?

530
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,315
JUST FROM THE CHARCOAL,         
      THAT'S IT.                

531
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,582
           WHAT KIND OF RIBS    
       ARE WE USING, BY THE WAY?

532
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:39,650
          BABY BACK, ST. LOUIS? 

533
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:40,851
ST. LOUIS STYLE.                
                           OKAY.

534
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,120
     IT'S MEATIER.              
IT'S GOT BETTER FLAVOR.         

535
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,387
           BETTER FLAVOR. OKAY. 
EXACTLY.                        

536
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,922
FIRST WE'RE GONNA LIFT          
THE SKIRT,                      

537
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,857
SQUARE IT UP A LITTLE BIT.      

538
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,727
   WATCHING YOU WORK THAT KNIFE 
    IS LIKE WATCHING A SURGEON. 

539
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,196
     IT'S ALL IN THE KNIFE.     
 THESE ARE RIB TIPS RIGHT HERE. 

540
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:54,064
     AND THEN THIS              
WE'LL USE FOR SAUSAGE.          

541
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,466
           YOU'RE STILL KEEPING 
             THE BUTCHER MIND   

542
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,068
               ABOUT EVERYTHING 
               THAT YOU DO HERE.

543
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:58,536
    IT'S "WASTE NOT, WANT NOT." 

544
00:18:58,671 --> 00:18:59,870
EXACTLY.                        

545
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:01,472
           HOW LONG'S THIS GONNA
                TUMBLE FOR?     

546
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,274
FOR ABOUT 16 HOURS.             
                         WHAT?! 

547
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,076
            SERIOUSLY, HOW LONG 
          WILL YOU TUMBLE THIS? 
16--16 HOURS.                   

548
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,411
        DIG IT. OKAY, LET'S GO. 

549
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,415
          IF THIS GOES MISSING, 
          DON'T LOOK IN MY CAR. 

550
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,750
(laughs)                        
                           OKAY?

551
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,284
           SO NOW WE'RE GONNA   
         PUT SOME VACUUM ON IT. 

552
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,553
       WHAT KINDA PUMP IS THAT? 
           (whirring)           

553
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:16,821
A SELF PUMP.                    

554
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,689
 WE'RE NOT FILLING AN INNER TUBE
        UP AT THE RIVER.        

555
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:19,824
            (hisses)            

556
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,426
THESE WILL SAVE YOU             
  A LOT OF TIME.                

557
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,962
           IT'S NOT ONLY TO GET 
            THE MARINADE IN IT, 

558
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,630
     BUT IT'S ALSO A TENDERIZING
              PROCESS,          

559
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,633
       LIKE A MASSAGING PROCESS 
          THAT GOES ON IT...    

560
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,501
CORRECT.                        
               WITHOUT BREAKING 
                 THE MEAT DOWN. 

561
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,969
             DID I PAY ATTENTION
               IN MEAT CLASS?   

562
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:33,104
YOU DID GOOD, MAN.              
YOU DID REAL GOOD.              
                THANK YOU MUCH. 

563
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,571
            (hisses)            

564
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,907
    <i> AFTER A 16-HOUR TUMBLE,</i>    

565
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:40,311
 <i> THEY'RE BOILED IN THE MARINADE</i>
       <i> AND HIT THE GRILL.</i>      

566
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,379
           A LITTLE NINJA DUST. 
I LIKE A THIN RACK.             

567
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,782
THAT'S MY RACK RIGHT BACK       
 IN THERE. THERE YOU GO.        

568
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:48,252
SO THAT'S OUR RIB,              
BOILED 45 MINUTES.              

569
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,721
AND THIS IS DRY SEASONING       
  WITH NO SAUCE ON IT.          

570
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:51,789
                      NO SAUCE. 

571
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,393
(mouth full) BY NO MEANS        
DOES THIS LACK IN FLAVOR.       

572
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:57,861
IT'S NOT PULLING OFF.           
     IT'S GOT--                 

573
00:19:57,931 --> 00:19:59,797
IT'S GOT NICE TEXTURE,          
   NICE CHEW TO IT.             

574
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,065
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS        
     I LIKE TO SEE.             

575
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,868
   DIFFERENT TEXTURE            
THAN WHEN IT'S SMOKED.          

576
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,138
  JUICY, TENDER, GREAT FLAVOR.  
      AND THERE'S NO SAUCE.     

577
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:08,806
BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS,       
          DUDE.                 

578
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,674
IT'S A REAL-DEAL RIB.           
YOU'RE REAL-DEAL, MAN.          

579
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,577
     HEY, I APPRECIATE IT, MAN. 
I AIN'T JOKING AROUND.          

580
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:15,880
   RIBS ARE PERFECTLY COOKED.   

581
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,216
          IT'S JUICY.           
        JUST DELICIOUS.         

582
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,617
       THE WAY HE PREPARES THEM,
       THEY COME OUT GREAT.     

583
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,086
 YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BITE IT.

584
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,821
        YOU CAN JUST PULL IT    
        RIGHT OFF THE BONE.     

585
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,490
     SO HE MAKES ONE OF THE BEST
     BARBECUE IN TOWN.          

586
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,225
     WHEN I DROVE UP,           
I REALLY LOOKED AND I SAID,     

587
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,027
"OH, MY GOSH," I MEAN,          
   "I GOT A GUY HERE            

588
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:32,229
  WITH A COUPLE SMOKERS         
MAKING SOME BEEF JERKY."        

589
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:35,099
  AND IT'S--DUDE, YOU ARE DOING 
     COMPETITION-LEVEL MEAT.    

590
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,368
   THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE TO HEAR. 
REALLY GOOD.                    

591
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,240
SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS ROAD TRIP,
BUT DON'T WORRY.                

592
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,443
WE GOT PLENTY MORE JOINTS       
TO FIND ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY.  

593
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,244
     I'LL BE LOOKING FOR YOU    
            NEXT TIME           

594
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,248
               ON               
 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

595
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:51,983
           (spraying)           

596
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:53,184
               (Diane laughing) 
           WAIT--               

597
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,388
                       AAH!     

598
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,623
           (laughter)
