     We should check it out.

       and tasted it all.

    This is ridiculous, dude.   

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,549

          the beginning         

8
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,751

         Extra virgin olive oil.

00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,468
Because our pitchfork           
   is in the shop,              

111
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,470
  we're gonna whip              
 the eggs with this.            

112
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:26,672
 Each time he mixes             
     it around,                 

113
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:28,273
    a little bit                
more flour catches in.

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,810
        We're gonna work our way
           down to, like, 2 1/2.

116
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,144
        Wow.                    
    Look at this.               

117
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,479
There should be music           
 to this right now.             

118
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:37,282
This should be a video.         

119
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:39,417
                There you go.   

120
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,420
Wow. You don't skimp            
   on the filling.              

121
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:42,353
                    Nope.       

122
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,355
   I just want you              
    to see this.                

123
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:44,623
  That right there              
     is plenty,                 

124
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:48,426
but that is how much he puts    
in a ravioli here. Crazy.       

125
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,628
                Right on top.   

126
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,496
        Press down until the two
           pastas seal together.

127
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:52,764
             And then you're off
                   to go.       

128
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,032
We're gonna make the            
lobster ravioli sauce now.      

129
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,033
                 Fantastic.     

130
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,301
Shallots, lobster meat.         

131
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,168
                 Seriously?     
Yep.                            

132
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,170
        Salt.                   
       Pepper.                  

133
00:03:58,172 --> 00:03:59,638
   Next, we'll add              
     our brandy.                

134
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,772
                    Whoa!       
          Is that what happened?

135
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,106
Yeah. That's what happened.     
              That's what it is?

136
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,174
        Yes.                    
 That's what it is.             

137
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,110
   Just drop them               
   right in there.              

138
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,244
        Mmm.                    

139
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,180
  There is nothing              
I would change on that.         

140
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:11,116
 I've been to Italy.            
I've had great pasta.           

141
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,450
 I got to tell you,             
  you're following              

142
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,253
 all the principles             
      but one.                  

143
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,988
                    What's that?
Ridiculous portion.             

144
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,255
                    Oh, portion.
Let me show you.                

145
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,058
       Normal.                  
                    Normal, yes.

146
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,126
        Tony.                   

147
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:23,395
  I'm not kidding.              
Easily 2 pounds of food.        

148
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:24,996
        Dude,                   
I'm beyond impressed.           

149
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,732
                 Thank you.     

150
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,133
      Order up!                 

151
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,200
          Look at that.         

152
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,735
   What is that? For a family?  

153
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,270
   No, that's just              
  a single portion.             

154
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,573
                  That's a what?
Single portion.                 

155
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,007
 That's one serving.            

156
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,576
  Yeah. We give you a handcart  
     to get you to your car.    

157
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,478
        What do you got?        

158
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,280
Homemade cheese raviolis.       

159
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,682
           That's a big ravioli.
What?                           

160
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,752
That's how my grandmother       
used to make them in Italy.     

161
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:47,819
      It's like a Frisbee.      

162
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,421
Yeah.                           
         Made to order.         

163
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,156
Yes.                            
        What's in here?         

164
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:54,158
   Ricotta cheese,              
grated Romano cheese,           

165
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,028
salt, pepper, parsley           
in the ricotta filling.         

166
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,430
         Fresh-made pasta.      
Yes, sir.                       

167
00:04:58,432 --> 00:04:59,831
              Mmm.              

168
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,499
               Mmm.             

169
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,969
     San Marzano                
    tomato sauce.               

170
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:07,239
  Garlic, San Marzano tomatoes, 
              salt,             

171
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:12,044
  pepper, water, Italian basil, 
 gives it a great, sweet flavor.

172
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:14,346
        Let it cook down        
         for 10 minutes.        

173
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,583
          Let the sauce         
  and the raviolis incorporate, 

174
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,452
          a little bit          
     of Pecorino Romano now.    

175
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:22,387
     You get three of these     
          for an order.         

176
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,323
    Homemade cheese raviolis!   

177
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:27,325
                     ♪♪         

178
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,527
              Fresh is the key  
                right there.    

179
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,861
     Yeah.                      
                    Oh, my gosh.

180
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:30,996
        That right there,       
          my brother...         

181
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,064
                           Dude.
          ...delicious.         

182
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,399
     Thank you.                 

183
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:37,268
 Simple, straight to the point, 
       great ingredients.       

184
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,603
       You outdo yourself       
           every time.          

185
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,471
     Thank you.                 

186
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,939
               Cheese ravioli.  

187
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,743
 It's a light sauce. It doesn't 
  overpower the cheese ravioli. 

188
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,345
    The ricotta is so creamy.   

189
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:47,812
  It just melts in your mouth.  

190
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,949
 The red sauce is what makes it,
     and they're so filling.    

191
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,018
          He makes them         
       the size of plates,      

192
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,320
        so you need help        
      walking out of here.      

193
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,491
         It's dangerous.        
  You sit down at that table... 

194
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:00,692
                Are you good?   

195
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,027
          ...you think          
  you order one simple thing... 

196
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,495
                Chicken Parm.   

197
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,630
  ...and by the time the dishes 
 come out, you're on the floor. 

198
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,499
     All right.                 
       Enjoy.                   

199
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:08,967
                 All right.     
       What else you got for me?

200
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:09,834
          Coming up...          

201
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:10,969
               Fire in the hole!
There we go.                    

202
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,571
        ...the hits just        
         keep coming...         

203
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,505
                   This is      
       a steak-house-level chop.

204
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,573
         ...and coming.         

205
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,442
            I can't eat anymore.
All right.                      

206
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:20,512
         I'm full unless you got
             one more surprise. 

207
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,249
            Dig this.           

208
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:27,119
 I'm back in Boston with Hunter 
 checking in on an Italian spot 

209
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:31,122
I hit back in 2010, and you know
      when I go Italian...      

210
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,458
    It's got to be handmade.    
    It's got to be homemade.    

211
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,193
  It's got to be the real deal. 

212
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,262
        And big Tony over       
     at Rino's place, well,     

213
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,263
    he checked all the boxes.   

214
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,532
          Mmm. Mmm. Ah.         

215
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,133
 That's ridiculous.             

216
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,269
You are the real deal.          

217
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,404
    If you haven't been here,   
       you're missing out.      

218
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,406
    I showed you 9 years ago.   

219
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:48,607
        Got to get here.        

220
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:51,943
       Since Guy came in,       
   people come from all over.   

221
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,613
 I'm sorry that the world found 
  out about our favorite place, 

222
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,881
      but you can't keep it     
       a secret too long.       

223
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,885
   FIERI: But the real secret   
    is knowing what to order.   

224
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,086
                 All right.     
       What else you got for me?

225
