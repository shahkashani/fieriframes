...going into Sam Sokol's brand.

46
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:38,163
Turn of the century...          
 Wow, we're going that far back.

47
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,965
The Charles River, which was    
the main water supply,          

48
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,601
   got so polluted              
that the water was undrinkable. 

49
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,903
So they started putting beer    
   in their dough.              

50
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:45,838
I mean, it gives the crust      

51
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,439
     almost like                
a bagel-y soft inside,          

52
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,574
  and then you get              
a nice crispy outside.          

53
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:50,976
             And there's nothing
              wrong with that.  

54
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:52,110
         Let's see how it works.

55
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,578
This is special flour.          

56
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,647
The wheat is actually milled    
  from the middle,              

57
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,784
so it gives you a real nice     
high protein and low ash.       

58
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:03,054
Salt, olive oil, little yeast,  
water, Dirty Water IPA.         

59
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,723
We're going to mix this up      
for two to four minutes on low, 

60
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,592
and then another six            
  to eight on high.             

61
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,328
Then we let it rest.            
   Portion it out.              

62
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,395
                  12-ounce?     

63
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:11,864
  I usually do 20s.             
                        Oh, hey.

64
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:13,332
You want to do the big boys?    
You want to do the little guy?

               to do, baller.

Want to do the babies           
    or big boys?                

67
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:16,868
             Let's see how good 
              he is on his 20.  

68
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,104
    Oh!                         
                  17.15.        

69
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:23,741
    Oh, oh, whoa.               
   20.25. Not bad.              

70
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,878
       Let them proof overnight.
      What are we going to make?

71
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,679
We try to do some crafty,       
     fun stuff.                 

72
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,414
    Eight minutes               
 on the Dirty Taco.             

73
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,483
 WOMAN: If you're going to marry
        tacos and pizza,        

74
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,685
     then this is certainly     
            the best.           

75
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,088

   chips, and then sour cream.  

76
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,155

       a lot of different       

77
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,625
 texture combinations going on. 

78
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:41,827
             Are taco pizzas big
                 in Boston?     

79
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,829
   No, that's a --              
That's a creation we created.   

80
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,096
                 All right,     
             let's get into it. 

81
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,834
We have our red sauce, oil,     
onions, garlic, oregano,        

82
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,835
    pepper, salt,               
a little bit of fennel.         

83
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,970
              Red chili flake.  

84
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,572

                      All right.

86

 for about 20 to 25.            

87
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,312

             for the Dirty Taco?

88
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,046
Meat. Let's make the meat.      

89
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,183
Olive oil, chopped onions,      
    ground beef.                

90
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,383

  That's it.                    

91
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,120
And you got your paprika.       
              Granulated garlic.

92
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:10,321
Pepper, salt, enchilada sauce.  

93
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,257
Give it that nice taco smoke.   

94
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,793
 Cook this down, but let it cool
             in its own juices, 

95
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,528
  and you'll get all that flavor
            on top of the pizza?

96
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,729
     You got it.

98
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,733

00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,275
And you're not just doing       
   pizza in there?              

229
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:00,011
      No. We do some mussels and
   bread pudding and some steak.

230
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,212
Fresh-bake your bread?          

231
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,947
                  Yes, sir.     
       Butchering whole animals.

232
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,349
I have a full-blown butcher shop
          about five doors down.

233
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,886
Really?                         
   Yeah. We bring whole hogs in.

234
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,422
Right.                          
              We got the belly  
 that's going to make our bacon.

235

     FIERI: Which goes into     
       a classic sandwich       

236
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:14,559
  with a not-so-classic style.  

237
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,294
        Josh's twist on the BLT.

238
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,763
  It's a whole burger of bacon, 

239
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,432
which certainly I've never heard
  of anywhere except for here.  

240
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,769
 The mayo and the freshly baked 
  bread -- It's just delicious. 

241
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:25,904
What are we going to make?      
                          Bacon.

242
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:27,104
   All right, man.              
 Let's get into it.             

243
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,440
                    Brown sugar.
Fresh-ground black pepper.      

244
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,175
         Pink salt, kosher salt.

247
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,712
 So no 9, 10, or 11?            

248
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,314

                7 to 10 days.   

251
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,253
What are you smoking it with?   
                      Applewood.

252
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,323
        Four to six hours at 116
   till it gets a nice mahogany.

253
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,791
             I grind it and make
              a 9-ounce patty.  

254
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,993
You give them 9 ounces          
of bacon on this thing?         

255
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,329
         Well, and the lean meat
         that binds it together.

256
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,598
 This, I got to see.            
Beautiful bacon, dude.          

257
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,733
   Put that on the grill, right?

258
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,734
  Yeah. No kidding.             
Can I just have this on a stick?

259
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,469
All that effort to make         
  this great bacon,             

260
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,604
 and now we're going            
   to grind it up.              

261
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:00,672
                    Yeah.       

262
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:01,940
And then make the patty,        
   and we're done?              

263
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,742
  Pretty much. And then I season
        it was some kosher salt,

264
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:06,411
              and white pepper. 
   Cook it in a wood-fired oven.

265
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,479
You make the bread, also?       
             Yeah. Potato bread.

266
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,348
         It's like half potatoes
               and half flour.  

267
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,816
               Boiled russets.  

268
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,084
       This is                  
more potato than bread.         

269
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,485
I've never seen potato          
bread at this level.            

270
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,354
        We go in with our water.

271
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:19,024
Fresh yeast -- super-critical.  
   Some olive oil.              

272
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,758
        A.P. flour. Bread flour.

273
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,228
                    Salt.       
    Mix it for about 12 minutes.

274
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,297
  Let it proof for about an hour
        till it doubles in size.

275
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,364
   Portion it out.

                Roll them out   
          into the kaiser shape.

277
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,101
             Let them proof and 
   approximately double in size.

278

    Come get it.                

342
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:56,214
  It's pork marinated in chili, 
      and it's slow-cooked.     

343
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,549
      It tastes wonderful.      

344
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,616
      What are                  
we going to make next?          

345
00:11:58,618 --> 00:11:59,950
             We're going to make
              our pizza dough.  

346
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:02,420
                   Water.       
       Fresh yeast. Local honey.

347
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,155
Olive oil.                      
        High-gluten pizza flour.

348
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,157
 Okay.                          
           Iodized salt. Mix it.

349
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,360
                 12 minutes.    
           Proof it for an hour.

350
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,029
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.   
  What are we into?             

351
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,363
              Fresh mozzarella. 

352
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,365

Fresh-made mozzarella.          

353
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,699
  House-made dough.             

354
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,169
    Butchered pig               
bacon, sausage making...

00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,572
              Mozzarella curds,

356
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,373
   boiling salted water over it.

357
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,641
 You're going to put            
 your hand in there?            

358
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,910
               Yeah. Good times.
We're stretching this out.      

359
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,545
You're slowly letting this      
   come together.               

360
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,580
     Sticking your hands in that
      hot water makes you sweat.

361
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,182
"You can do it, Rocky."         
                      Thank you.

362
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,251

Drop it in the ice water.       
What do we have left?           

365
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,789
               Carne adovada.   

366
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,123
So, we got pork shoulder.       

367
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,458
             Yeah, let it sear. 

368
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,193
 Okay.                          
            Season it with salt.

369
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,195

Boy, you can pick that up       
     real quick.                

373
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,403
     House-made red chili sauce.
And what do we have in that?    

374
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,538
              Pat's red chili,

Tomatoes are ridiculous.

00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,484
      It's just addicting.      

453
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,153
    Was this once               
the manager's office?           

454
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,087
         This is the dough room.
"Dough" ya know?                

455
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,890
                So, we've got   
           our live active yeast

456
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,692
                that we added   
             to our apple juice.

457
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:02,960
            Reno water. Reno has
      very high mineral content.

458
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,562
      More minerals to munch on.

459

        High-gluten, high-yeast,

461
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,701
               high-ash flour.  
             Low-protein flour. 

462
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,169
We still have to add salt       
      to this.                  

463
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,372
How long is this going to run?  
  For about eight minutes or so.

464
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,107
   Okay.                        
             Proof for 24 hours.

465
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,643
                Ball them up.   
     Proof for another 24 hours.

466

         of pizza are we making?

467
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,379
We're going to be making        
  the T-Pane pizza,             

468
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,581
which is named after            
my partner Trevor Leppek.       

469
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,983
     So, they called him T-Pain.
         How'd it get to T-Pane?

470
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,852
Pane -- bread. Italian.         

471
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:28,786
           It's your little more
                   for it.      

472
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,054

473
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:32,190
So, we're going to do           
 our sausage slurry.            

474
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:33,524
           So you're making your
           own sausage, as well?

475
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,527
Absolutely. We slice it,        
dice it, roast it, toast it.    

476
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:37,795
               That should be   
                on a T-shirt.

 star anise powder.             

480
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,804
                   Really?      
   Yep.                         

481
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,807
Red pepper flake, salt,         
a little bit of water.          

482
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,809
 Give another pulse.            
       Basil.                   

483
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,278
        And this is going to get
           worked into the meat.

484
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,346
And we cook this for 20,        
     25 minutes.

509
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,069

                 Good ranch.    
        Tell me about the wings.

562
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,786
They are a parbaked wing.

00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:49,920
                         Great. 
Then we fry them up.            

564
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,389
We usually let them sit         
  for a little bit,             

565
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:52,990

    a double fry.               

566
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,524
 So, we're going in

00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,260

a little more sauce,            

568
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,395
  and then get just             
 really nice coated.            

569
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:01,465
  Parmesan cheese,              
garlic, some green onions.      

570
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,267
       And the house-made ranch.

             There's a silkiness

575
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:17,347

579
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:24,421
                a little bit

     and I'm going to fry it up,

581

      that's kind of like riding

586

    It's a nice sticky sauce,   

587
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,369
       so the fresh garlic      
          sticks to it.         

588
