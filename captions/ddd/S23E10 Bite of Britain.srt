83
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,049

pretty much everything we do.   

84
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,185
             -Okay.

             let this cook down?

92
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,999
  Uh, just simmers              
for about 15 minutes.           

93
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,200
                    Next,       
         what are we gonna make?

94
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,669
 So now we're gonna             
make our house pickles.         

95
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,203
They're like a sweet,

96
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,005
     -Cucumbers and peppers.    
         -A few onions.         

97
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,007
  So they've salted             
 for about 4 hours.             

98
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,209
             -Right.            
    -We've got white vinegar,   

99
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,811
  sugar, plenty of,             

100
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,414
 some turmeric, ground clove... 
         -There we are.         

101
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,149
  ...celery seeds,              
 red peppercorns...             

102
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,552
          -I like this.         
  -...and yellow mustard seed.  

103
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,087
 Basically, we just             
bring this to a boil.           

104
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:45,156
Now we're gonna pour the        
pickling mix over the cucumbers.

105
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,825
      And then,                 
in the fridge 48 hours.         

106
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,394
This is our pork shoulder.      

107
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,164
We want nice, big clumps        
  and hunks of it.              

108
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,432
             Nice bark on that. 
                     Mm.        

109
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,368
               Not oversmoked,  
                super tender.   

110
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,102
So we take a little bit         
  of apple juice...             

111
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,705
               Some sweetness   
           doesn't hurt anybody.

112
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,839
    And you're gonna throw sauce
              on it right now.  

113
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,910
We tend to pre-sauce.           

114
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,579
Some house slaw down,           
the house pickles...            

115
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,714
   And then fries.              

116
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:10,415
   And that's it.               

117
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,054
           That is good barbecue

118
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:18,656
   like you find at any barbecue
            joint in the States.

119
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,592
         That's a big meal, man.

120
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,528
   Pickles are great, the fries,
            the bun, the layout.

121
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,796
       Making your own sauces...

122
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,297
              That's dynamite.  
               Excellent job.   

123
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,267
     Thank you.                 

124

                    MAN:        
             Pulled pork plate. 

125
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,269
   It's very juicy and tender.  

126
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,205
  MAN #2: I think the pickles,  
        they cut through        

127
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:34,505
      the kind of smokiness     
          of the meat.          

128
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,875
          -Wings plate.         
  -What kind of barbecue is it? 

129
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,477
  Texas, Carolina,              
    Kansas City?                

130
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,346
          What is this?         
  -We don't really go regional. 

131
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,414
     It's the stuff we like.    

132
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,616
-You're the greatest hits album.
            -Exactly.           

133
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,084
    MAN #3: Uh, when you walk   
        into Grillstock,        

134
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,953
      I think it does feel      
    like a really traditional   

135
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,556
      U.S. barbecue joint.      

136
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:52,958
              What else you got 
               up your sleeve?  

137
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,692
   Uh, we're gonna              
make a Lockjaw Burger.          

138
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,761
         It's everything        
  you'd want in one big burger. 

139
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,564
It's got pulled pork,           
couple of burger patties,       

140
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,833
brisket, burnt ends.            

141
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,368
          -Burnt ends?          
      -And some burnt ends.     

142
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,170
              What do you know  
              about burnt ends? 

143
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,571
               Don't tell me.   
             When we come back, 

144
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,540
    we're gonna make burnt ends.
             This, I got to see.

145
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,779
                     ♪♪         

146
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,181
  Here's the deal. We're hanging
        out at a barbecue joint,

147
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,451
          Grillstock Smokehouse,
               in East London.  

148
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,386
      I will tell you something,
            when these dudes say

149
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,454
             that they're doing 
             real-deal barbecue,

150
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,589
          I had to check it out.

151
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,657
               The pulled pork  
                 was insane.    

152
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,794
       But now you are going out
           on a limb, my friend,

153
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,129
                 to tell me     
             you do burnt ends. 

154
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,798
    -We do burnt ends, yeah.    
          -Burnt ends.          

155
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,932
      -One Lockjaw Burger.      
         -It's massive.         

156
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,935
        Two beef patties,       
           burnt ends,          

157
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,070
    brisket -- It's amazing.    

158
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,740
             All right. Show me 
       how you get down with it.

159
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:42,874
    FINCH: Salt.                

160
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,009
  You're gonna like             
this one -- oregano.            

161
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,812
             Oh, that's an herb 
                from Oregon.    

162
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:48,480
   Must be, yeah.               

163
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:52,083
Garlic powder, some celery salt 
  and black pepper.             

164
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,151
                    Okay.       

165
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:55,220
                Mix that up.    
              Hit this on here. 

166
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,222
 It's a USDA brisket            
  we're using now.              

167
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,757
                 So this is     
              imported brisket. 

168
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,958
    You grow them               
    bigger there.               

169
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,362
And we want the bigger,         
fattier, juicier brisket.       

170
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:05,096
              So, we're fatter  
           in the United States?

171
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,898
Your cows are fatter            
in the United States.           

172
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,100
             Way to -- way to --
           way to undo that one.

173
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,435
       And how long are we going
               in the smoker?   

174
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,237
So this is gonna go 12 hours.   

175
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,672
         -225, as well?         
              -Yep.             

176
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,775
             Beautiful brisket. 

177
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,244
  We're gonna slice             
    some of this,               

178
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,513
and we're gonna make some       
burnt ends out of this.         

179
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,248
              I just got a call 
              from the office,  

180
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,116
      and they said they need me
             to try this, stat. 

181
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,251
        I don't usually do that,
                   but...       

182
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,253
        They're just calling me.
                    Yeah.       

183
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,988
             It's gonna be fine.
                That's good.    

184
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,658
Sprinkle of the house rub,      
  squirt the sauce.             

185
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,059
      And then,                 
 back in the smoker,            

186
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,529
     225, again,                
for about another hour.         

187
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,530
   So we're gonna               
make our Lockjaw Burger.        

188
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,866
                  Do it up.     

189
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:43,534
A couple of burger patties,     

190
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:47,004
       cheese,                  
layer on some pickles.          

191
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,207
Next up, pulled pork.           

192
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,009
   Now we're gonna              
go the first burger patty       

193
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:54,279
with the melted cheese, some    
of the brisket we just cooked.  

194
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:57,014
Now, the second patty...        

195
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,817
        You sound so dainty when
     you say "the second patty."

196
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,552
          And I'm gonna kill you
              with this thing,  

197
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,021
          like, a pound of meat.

198
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,157
   And then, these              
are the brisket burnt ends.     

199
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:07,959
  And this is like              
our Thousand Island sauce,      

200
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,728
   then the lid...              

201
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,833
There we go, our Lockjaw Burger.
     Good luck.                 

202
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,038
     That's a "Triple D" burger.

203
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,706
         It's fantastic brisket.

204
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,773
              It's burnt ends.  

205
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,175
             It's double patty. 

206
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,643
                 Let me get     
             at this burnt end, 

207
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,445
              'cause that's how 
         all this ridiculousness

208
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,581
              had even started. 

209
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,250
 Almost like crunchy, candy beef
       around the outside of it.

210
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,985
              -Mm.              
          -Pulls apart.         

211
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:37,856
       Nice job, brother.       
           -Thank you.          

212
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,257
                 Good stuff.

                    MAN:        
       A Lockjaw Burger for you.

214
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,927
       The burger's great.      
   It's really, really juicy.   

215
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,396
        The sauce really,       
      really cuts through.      

216
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:45,463
            Man food.           

217
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,731
           -Man food.           
              -Yes.             

218
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,399
     MAN #2: Right amount of    
     sweetness, right amount    

219
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,601
   of, you know, meaty flavor.  

220
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,403
             Can I just see this
               for one second?  

221
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:53,805
          Can you just do the --
        do the royal wave for me

222
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,474
                a little bit    
        with that barbecue hand?

223
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,744
   If it wasn't for the rain,   
       for the red buses,       

224
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:03,748
      I'd definitely think      
 I was in the States right now. 

225
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,817
               I'm really glad  
            I found this because

226
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,086
       it's a great introduction
             for all the people 

227
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:11,223
    that live here to understand
      what real barbecue's like.

228
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:13,158
                  You have      
              license to grill. 

229
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,426
    I mean, you're doing it.    
        -Thank you, mate.       

230
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,295
              License to grill. 

231
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:20,698
        Run with that one, baby.

232
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,167
 FIERI: Coming up, we're headed 
     west across the city...    

233
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,836
All day long, brother.          

234
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,571
  ...to a cool, modern joint... 

235
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:27,839
 It is off the hook.            

236
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,174
         ...transforming        
     an old British staple.     

237
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,877
 That's an adventure            
 in fish and chips.             

238
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,252
 So I'm in here in Camden Town, 
             London,            

239
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,455
        about 15 minutes        
     from Buckingham Palace,    

240
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:45,056
      to check out a joint      
      you'd totally expect.     

241
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:46,458
    Exactly, fish and chips.    

242
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,059
      But not just any fish     
        and chips joint.        

243
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,462
         No, these dudes        
  are all about sustainability  

244
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:51,730
      and line-caught fish.     

245
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,130
         Matter of fact,        
    they say they like to use   

246
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,600
the underrated swimming starlets
           of the sea.          

247
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,168
          This is Hook.         

248
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,273
                  Order up.     
                  Sea bass.     

249
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:03,208
         They get fresh,        
 sustainable fish in every day, 

250
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,410
   so that means that the menu  
  will change every single day. 

251
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:06,678
               WOMAN: For you.  

252
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,546
       Cannot compare this      
    to normal fish and chips.   

253
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,415
    MAN: To do what the guys    
         are doing here         

254
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,150
           is kind of           
  like reinvent it completely.  

255
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:16,154
   FIERI: The guys reimagining  
 this British classic since 2014

256
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:19,491
   are co-owners Barry Wallace  
      and Simon Whiteside,      

257
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:22,560
            both fish           
out of water coming from Dublin.

258
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,828
       FIERI:                   
You're from Ireland.            

259
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,363
And you come to London,         

260
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,431
and you take their fish         
     and chips,                 

261
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,100
and then, you're gonna          
  spin it up a bit.             

262
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,235
Do you just stand out here      

263
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,437
and fight the majority          
of the mornings, or...          

264
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,239
    It's a little risky, though.
            It's a little risky.

265
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,508
              You have die-hard 
traditionalists that are saying,

266
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,709
                "No. It's not   
               fish and chips.  

267
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,577
                  It's not      
              fish and chips."  

268
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,580
                 It's like,     
          "It's fish and chips."

269
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,915
                   Classic      
           and minty mushy peas.

270
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,985
           I'm having           
 the classic panko-crusted cod. 

271
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,588
  A superb, fresh fish inside.  

272
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,323
   I haven't tasted mushy peas  
   with -- with a minty flavor  

273
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,726
          to it before.         

274
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,327
        Now we're into the minty
                 mushy peas.    

275
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,663
Minty mushy peas. Does everybody
make them with mint,            
                          No.   

276
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,365
or is this just you guys        
 being weird again?             

277
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:03,001
   -It's us being weird again.  
             -Okay.             

278
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,402
            Gonna go mint first,

279
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,604
       salt, double cream.      
             -Okay.             

280
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,940
                I do all this   
          on a really high heat.

281
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,074
        Okay.                   

282
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,275
        We're just gonna bash it
              in a little bit.  

283
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,810
     You can see                
it already getting hot.         

284
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,412
  So now we're gonna strain it? 
             -Yeah.             

285
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:17,015
   I just kind of pop it through
         there, through a sieve.

286
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,216
        Okay.                   

287
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,218
           Then, we're gonna pop
             this straight back 

288
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,686
             in here, like this.

289
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:25,090
     And then, we're gonna throw
             in our petit pois. 

290
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,491
    You call them               
     petit pois?                

291
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,493
                 Petit pois,    
             yeah, little peas. 

292
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,762
Oh, they're beautiful.          

293
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:32,563
         Mm.                    

294
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,099
          I love peas.          
          -Yeah, yeah.          

295
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:35,900
            So fresh.           
        -This cooks down.       

296
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:39,303
    We blitz it.                

297
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,438
Mushy peas are done.            

298
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,240
    What do we do after this?   
             -Okay.             

299
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,307
      So this is our lovely cod.

300
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,576
               Just gonna cut   
                one off here.   

301
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:46,978
         So we're just gonna pop
      this into our plain flour,

302
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,246
         little eggwash.        
             -Okay.             

303
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,981
                  And then,     
  we're gonna hit it with panko.

304
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,383
That's all she wrote.           

305
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:52,584
    -And this is ready to go.   
             -Okay.             

306
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:53,851
          Put it into our fryer.

307
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,120
     -How long will that go?    
      -About three minutes.     

308
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,391
    -And how about the chips?   
   -Gonna drop the chips now.   

309
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:01,459
        So now, we're just gonna
         take our panko cod out,

310
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:04,796
        season it with our house
                seaweed salt.   

311
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,264
        Okay.                   

312
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,767
     Now we're gonna season them
          with our seaweed salt.

313
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,270
         Into our box...        
             -Okay.             

314
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,873
              Go tartar, fish.  

315
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,207
            And we're just gonna
                do our peas.    

316
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,942
   And typically,               
when you have fish and chips,   

317
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,477
   you're supposed              
 to have mushy peas?            

318
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,446
               Traditionally,   
   it comes with fish and chips.

319
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,484
         -That's light.         
       -Yeah. Absolutely.       

320
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,953
   It's not oily.               
   It's not heavy.              

321
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:31,689
The choice of the panko         
gives you that great crunch     

322
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,157
         that you want.         
            -Mm-hmm.            

323
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,227
   But it's thin.               

324
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,294
              Wow.              
             -Yeah.             

325
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,630
  And the chips...              
    Good texture.               

326
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:40,965
I love the seaweed salt.        

327
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:43,001
   All right, now,              
  minty mushy peas.             

328
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:49,574
There's texture, little bit     
of mint, little bit of salt.    

329
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:50,975
     The balance is awesome.    
              -Mm.              

330
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,177
 I got to tell you,             
     well done.                 

331
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:55,013
   And mushy peas               
all day long, brother.          

332
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,848
     MAN: The actual texture    
       of the fish inside,      

333
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,583
      it sort of just melts     
         in your mouth.         

334
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,520
   Mushy peas are really good,  
     creamy, buttery, sweet.    

335
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:03,788
   WOMAN: Chips are excellent.  

336
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,790
        It's almost like        
      Mom's roast potatoes,     

337
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,258
 but with a bit more of a kick. 

338
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,427
All right. So, what makes great 
   fish and chips?              

339
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,998
      Really, really fresh fish.
 So we only use small fisheries.

340
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,868
           Whatever gets landed,
         we use within 24 hours.

341
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,336
      We let the fishermen      
   decide what's on the menu,   

342
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:22,006
            all these           
  underrated swimming starlets. 

343
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,542
Who says "underrated            
 swimming starlets"?            

344
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,010
           Underrated           
       swimming starlets.       

345
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:30,148
We want to diversify the species
       in fish and chips.       

346
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,415
          Guinness and squid ink
                  on pass.      

347
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,151
             This is            
   Guinness ink tempura hake.   

348
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,821
    Looks almost like a rock,   
         but it's fish.         

349
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,089
  Beautiful, beautiful texture. 

350
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,024
   It's really, really tasty.   

351
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,292
                This is hake.   

352
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,495
That is an ugly fish.           

353
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:46,231
       I think                  
I was attacked by him.          

354
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,165
 We break this down.            

355
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,499
             -Yeah.             
        -What's up next?        

356
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,835
                 Our oyster     
              and sorrel sauce. 

357
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:53,304
 We're gonna shuck our oysters. 
             -Okay.             

358
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,573
                A little bit    
         of lemon juice, wasabi.

359
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,509
Now we're introducing           
 wasabi into things.            

360
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,844
                 Yeah. Then,    
      just a little bit of salt.

361
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,781
              Then we're gonna  
          add some vegetable oil

362
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,049
       very, very slowly.       
             -Okay.             

363
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:08,720
           Gonna take the stalks
               off our sorrel.  

364
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:11,222
      Want to have small flecks,
                not too big.    

365
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,727
    That's crazy.               

366
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,394
Dude, I've never had            
    that before.                
               Have you not, no?

367
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:18,529
It's got the creaminess.        

368
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,998
It's got the viscosity.         
      And then,                 

369
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,867
you get that really nice        
underlying tone of the oyster.  

370
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,537
               We're gonna do   
              our, uh, tempura. 

371
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:26,671
        We have Guinness.       
             -Okay.             

372
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,673
             It's like the water
                 of Ireland.    

373
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:29,808
        Yeah.                   

374
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,744
So we're gonna add our squid ink
                  and salt.     

375
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,679
    And then, we're gonna hit it
         with our tempura flour.

376
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,213
        Okay.                   

377
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:39,083
                 Whisk this     
           to bring it together.

378
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,418
       Okay, so here's the hake.

379
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,687
            So then, we're gonna
               into our flour.  

380
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:46,023
    And then, we're gonna hit it
           with our ink tempura.

381
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,792
    And then, we're gonna fry it
         at 170 degrees Celsius.

382
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,094
        Okay.                   

383
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,096
           Now we're gonna place
     the oyster-and-sorrel sauce

384
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,232
              and then the fish 
               over the chips.  

385
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,333
    [ Whistles ]                

386
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,306
  You get Guinness              
 right off the bat.             

387
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:03,274
    The batter's                
   nice and light.              

388
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,179
 Where the adventure            
    really begins               

389
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,315
   is when you get              
  into this aioli.              

390
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:11,916
    The richness                
  of the oyster...              

391
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,517
    I mean, dude.               

392
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,253
Really, what I will call this   
is a mature fish and chips.     

393
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,321
         Spot on, dude.         
             -Yeah.             

394
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,057
   Really. I mean,              
 that's an adventure            

395
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,524
 in fish and chips.             

396
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,727
      The fish is very soft     
           and smooth.          

397
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,595
   The, uh, wasabi gives a bit  
       of a kick, as well.      

398
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,597
    I'm not a fan of oysters,   
    but this actually works,    

399
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,199
    the sorrel mixed into it.   

400
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,201
           It's tasty.          

401
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,470
                  So Ahmed      
               and Jengus own

             the oldest-running 
 fish-and-chips joint in London.

403
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:37,141
                 It's called    
           Rock and Sole Plaice.

404
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,543
       What do you think?       
           -It's great          

405
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,277
 to see young blood             
     coming in,                 

406
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,279
 bringing new ideas             
    to something.               

407
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,282
And they're making a mark       
   for themselves.              

408
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:47,952
    Hook means that you come    
  here once and you're hooked.  

409
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,154
When I came here to, uh,        
     to London,                 

410
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:53,224
the idea was to find a variety  
 of fish and chips.             

411
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:57,561
I think this is really          
a fantastic representation.     

412
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,364
                Off the hook.   

413
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:00,498
 It is off the hook.            

414
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,701
  It's outstanding.

 FIERI: Up next, we're cruising

416
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,572
                   Voilà.       

417
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,974
      ...to a place cooking     
  real-deal regional recipes... 

418
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,643
It's swimsuit season,           
and I'm eating shepherd's pie.  

419
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,313
     ...a little differently    
       than mum made them.      

420
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,648
Oh, you had to go to this level,
     didn't you?                

421
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,352
                     ♪♪         

422
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,791
  So I'm here in the Smithfield 
     Market area of London.     

423
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,127
 And that building right there, 

424
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,929
  folks have been buying their  
  meat for the last 900 years.  

425
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,599
 So you can imagine, this is not
   where a lot of tourists go.  

426
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,133
     You know, this is where    
      the locals hang out.      

427
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,735
   So, what would you expect?   

428
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,070
     You'd expect a locals'     
  restaurant, serving up what?  

429
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,606
    Traditional British fare.   

430
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,142
   But this joint is doing it   
      with a little twist.      

431
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,344
   This is Bird of Smithfield.  

432

     Ox cheek in the window.    

433
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,552
 It's about doing simple things 
      really, really well.      

434
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,355
         I've got fish and chips

435
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,023
 The food is just so well done. 

436
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:01,292
          It's way more         
 than just classic English food.

437
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,593
   It always lifts my spirits.  

438
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,295
Just a perfect vibe in the Bird.

      flocking since 2013,      

440
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:11,835
   when veteran chef Alan Bird  
   put his name on the joint.   

441
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,371
  Bird is the word.             

442
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:16,174
   I just wanted to do something
 with an accent on British food,

443
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,176
           just because that was
        what I've grown up with.

444
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,377
                 And that's

 There's no other shepherd's pie

00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,786
   FIERI: So, what              
are we making today?            

450
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:29,920
               Shepherd's pie.  

451
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,590
        We've got two salt marsh
               lamb shoulders.  

452
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,058
    Salt marsh...               
  Is that an area?              

453
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,526
                    Lamb.       
          Yeah, next to the sea.

454
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:36,527
Pretty distinct flavor?         

455
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:37,594
             -Yeah.             
             -Okay.             

456
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:38,863
    We're gonna add a bit of oil

457
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,331
       to help stick the aromats
              and spices to it. 

458
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,467
             And then, we've got
          some chopped rosemary,

459
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,136
        chopped garlic, as well,

460
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:48,673
    and chopped thyme, and then,
               some sea salt.   

461
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,142
               Just make sure   
            it gets well-coated.

462
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,877
             Place those inside 
            a vacuum-packed bag.

463
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,345
    I love this.                

464
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,082
    And now, the lamb shoulder's
      ready to be vacuum packed.

465
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,817
             And all that flavor
       is sealed inside the bag.

466
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,018
         -Stays inside.         
             -Yeah.             

467
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,020
    Look at that.               

468
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,421
I'm getting one of those.       

469
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:06,156
   So now, we're gonna cook that
          in a combi-steam over.

470
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,692
How long these gonna go?        
      12 hours?                 

471
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,560
                    Yeah.       
                165 degrees.    

472
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:12,563
         What we've got are some
        ground, or minced, lamb.

473
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,499
What's the difference           
between ground and minced?      

474
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:15,566
        You guys call it ground.

475
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:16,901
       We call it minced.       
          -Just minced.         

476
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,903
 You guys have a way            
of making it sound much sexier. 

477
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:23,040
       We're gonna drain it off,
place the pan back on the stove.

478
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,508
               And we're gonna  
              add the mirepoix. 

479
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,310
             -Okay.             
        -Chopped garlic,        

480
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:29,914
              chopped rosemary, 
               chopped thyme.   

481
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,248
        Okay.                   
  So we drop it in.             

482
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,185
               The brown meat   
             back into the pan. 

483
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,053
We're gonna put the tomato paste
                  in first.     

484
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,254
     Got to cook                
that out a little bit.          

485
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,790
                 Yeah. Then,    
   in with our chopped tomatoes.

486
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,727
    There we go.                
     Next up...                 

487
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,262
            Next up, we're gonna
      add some lamb stock to it,

488
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:49,066
          Worchestershire sauce,
               tomato ketchup.  

489
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,335
We have some shredded lamb      
going in this, as well?         

490
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:55,206
                 Yes, we do.    
            So let's go into it.

491
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:59,009
                There you go,   
             steamed shoulders. 

492
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,845
                   You got      
           the lovely pink meat.

493
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,349
      Mm. Nice.                 
 Little herb to it.             

494
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:06,617
Garlic's not overpowering.      

495
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:07,818
 So those are gonna             
    get shredded.               

496
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,086
      Then dropped into the pan.
                    Yeah.       

497
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,755
I mean, this is shepherd's pie  
     gone wild.                 

498
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,423
     The braise is finished now.

499
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,625
         Just place it in there.

500
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,293
       We got                   
warm mashed potatoes.           

501
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,829
            Put the mash on top.

502
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:19,630
[ British accent ]              
Oh, we're gonna get all         
pretty with it, aren't we?      

503
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:20,864
             -Yeah.             
 -[ Normal voice ] Look at that.

504
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,967
Oh, you had to go this level,   
     didn't you?                

505
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,168
                   Voilà.       

506
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,169
   That's going in the oven...  
             -Okay.             

507
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,938
               ...20 minutes.   

508
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:32,576
        This is jus that we make
             with the lamb stock

509
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:35,646
            to pour over the top
to add a little bit of moisture.

510
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,381
         Mm.                    

511
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,252
      That's --                 

512
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,289
  The shredded meat             
really adds a lot more depth.   

513
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,393
         Mm.                    

514
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,562
 Pour that on there.            
That's just what I needed.      

515
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,601
   That's perfect.              

516
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:58,869
  Without question,             

517
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,738
one of the best shepherd's pies 
   I've ever had.               

518
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,007
    I'm sure you've tasted a few
                in your time.   

519
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,876
   You can't tell.              
  I know you can't.             

520
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,479
It's swimsuit season,           
and I'm eating shepherd's pie.  

521
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,081
   I'll come back,              
 just for that dish.            

522
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,351
 Outstanding, Chef.             
    Outstanding.                

523
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,818
     WOMAN: Shepherd's pie.     

524
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,421
        The unctuousness        
     of the slow-cooked lamb    

525
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:18,422
        is just stunning.       

526
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:19,757
  The gravy's amazing, as well. 

527
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,025
    I think that's the thing    
      that really makes it.     

528
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,162
Give me the greatest hits.      
I know bangers and mash.        

529
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,363
I know fish and chips.          

530
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:28,365
What are some of the other      
essential British food          

531
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,567
that I should be aware of?      

532
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,836
               You got to try   
           our braised ox cheek.

533
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,370
    WOMAN #2: The ox cheek is   
  something that I could order  

534
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,505
     every time I come here.    

535
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,540
        It is so amazing.       

536
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,275
        I really love it.       

537
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,045
        Wow.                    

538
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,581
Who's Guy's little piggy?       

539
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,449
      Nice bark up on top.      
              -Yep.             

540
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:46,517
     Delicious.                 
         Oh.                    

541
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,386
         Just everything        
       about it is lovely.      

542
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:50,521
              You've got to try 
         our rhubarb cheesecake.

543
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,190
  WOMAN #2: This is way better  
          than anything         

544
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,658
            my mother           
    could ever put together.    

545
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,093
    Oh, my gosh.                

546
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:59,129
  And then, you've got goat curd
             in that cheesecake.

547
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:03,000
Mix that with the sour that     
you're pulling off the rhubarb. 

548
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:06,804
It is far more complex and fun  
than regular cheesecake.        

549
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,005
Very nicely done, Chef.         

550
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,407
  MAN: Well, we're very lucky,  
           in Britain,          

551
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,541
  to have our own heritage and  
 our own pride in our own food. 

552
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,677
 And this is the perfect example
     of all of those things     

553
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,812
        coming together.        

554
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:15,947
     You're not                 
 on the beaten path.            

555
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:18,683
People want to find a place     
 like this and say,             

556
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,418
       "I went                  
to this little place            

557
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,554
   where this guy               
makes traditional Brit food,    

558
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,756
and it's affordable."           

559
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,358
            So anyone could come
                and eat here.   

560
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,826
That's the best attitude        
    in the world.

  the great "Triple D" joints,

  Making the jump over the pond 
      was totally worth it.     

567
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,240
      But don't you worry.

              today, a wedding.
