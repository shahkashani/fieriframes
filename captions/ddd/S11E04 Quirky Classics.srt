THE POT STICKER NOW?

114
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:37,142
OKAY, ROCK IT OUT, BROTHER.     
           ALL RIGHT, THROW     
       OUR FLOUR IN, CORNSTARCH.

115
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:40,279
BEAUTIFUL COMBO.                
        AND SALT. LET THIS GO,  
       JUST ADD WATER AS NEEDED.

116
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:43,281
JUST STARTING TO PULL AWAY      
FROM THE BOWL A LITTLE BIT.     

117
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,350
      HOLD THE SIDE OF THE BOWL.
           WRAP UP MY DOUGH.    
OKAY.                           

118
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:47,419
OKAY. LET IT REST...            
                     30 MINUTES.

119
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:50,489
       OUR NEXT STEP IS GONNA BE
             OUR CHICKEN.       
   AND THIS IS GONNA BE         
FOR OUR FILLING, I TAKE IT?     

120
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,491
     WHOLE BREAST,              
AND THEN CUT 'EM DOWN.          
                            YES.

121
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:55,226
    WHAT I'M ACTUALLY GONNA DO--
     I'M GONNA GRIND THIS FIRST.
POP THIS A FEW TIMES.           

122
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,228
   YEAH. I GO AHEAD AND JUST ADD
     MY CILANTRO, GREEN ONION.  

123
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:58,764
GARLIC.                         
                         GINGER.

124
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:00,698
MESS OF IT.                     
       LIME JUICE AND SOY SAUCE.

125
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,134
      SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND JUST 
     LET THAT BUZZ FOR A SECOND.

126
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,103
YOU WANT TO HAVE                
  SOME TEXTURE.                 
                  RIGHT, YOU DO.

127
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,105
ALL RIGHT.                      
                SO THAT COMES IN
                AT THE VERY END.

128
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,773
    CORN--THAT'S                
AN INTERESTING MOVE.            

129
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,775
SO THIS ALL COMES TOGETHER,     
YOU LET THE FLAVORS MARRY,      

130
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,178
AND WHAT'S OUR NEXT STEP?       
     THROW DOWN SOME FLOUR.     
 WE HAVE TO ROLL OUT OUR DOUGH. 

131
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:15,180
  THEY MAKE AN AWESOME          
PASTA ROLLING ATTACHMENT        

132
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:17,182
FOR THE KitchenAid.             
           I'D LOVE TO SEE THAT.

133
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:20,252
YES, I BET YOU WOULD.           
              GO AHEAD AND KNEAD
                   THIS OUT.    

134
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:22,186
YOU'RE GOING THIN, RIGHT?       
                  AS THIN AS WE 
                CAN POSSIBLY GO.

135
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,723
SO THIN, IT ONLY HAS            
      ONE SIDE.                 
                          RIGHT.

136
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,858
         OKAY, NOW JUST CUT OUT 
         MY CIRCLES. THAT IS IT.

137
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,260
KEEP 'EM FLOURED SO THEY        
  DON'T STICK TOGETHER.         

138
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,730
            WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD
               AND FILL THESE.  
NOW WHAT'S THE METHOD HERE?     

139
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,765
             I PINCH THE CENTER,
               PINCH THE ENDS,  

140
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,068
                 SO THEY DON'T  
              RUN OUT THE SIDES.
BUT THAT DOUGH'S                
  MOIST ENOUGH                  

141
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,136
THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO ADD      
     ANYTHING INTO IT.          
                             NO.

142
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:41,139
THAT'S HOT, DUDE.               
        PUT SOME CORNSTARCH DOWN
          SO THEY DON'T STICK.  

143
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,141
KEEP LOADING THEM UP            
   ON THAT PLATE.               
                        EXACTLY.

144
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,143
NEXT STEP--                     
             THE DIPPING SAUCE  
           FOR THE POT STICKERS.

145
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,345
YES. SOY SAUCE, WATER,          
     RICE VINEGAR.              
                     WHITE WINE.

146
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,481
AND THEN SUGAR. WHISK,          
  BRING IT TO A BOIL,           

147
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,150
TURN IT DOWN, LET IT SIMMER     
   FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES.        
                  AND THAT'S ALL
                    SHE WROTE.  

148
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:54,152
   A LITTLE BIT                 
OF CANOLA OIL DOWN,             

149
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,355
THROW DOWN OUR POT STICKERS.    
            I LOVE POT STICKERS.

150
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,756
YEAH, I DO, TOO.                
          I THINK IF I CAME BACK
             IN ANOTHER LIFE,   

151
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,758
              MY MIDDLE NAME    
           MIGHT BE POT STICKER.
WE'LL LET THE BOTTOMS           

152
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,761
    GET A LITTLE CRISPY,        
AND THEN WE'LL JUST GO AHEAD    

153
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,763
AND HIT IT WITH WATER           
  AND COVER IT UP.              

154
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,765
   FROM START TO FINISH,        
THEY TAKE ABOUT 10 MINUTES.     
                      (whistles)

155
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,867
WE GO AHEAD AND TAKE            
   THE COVER OFF.               
             THOSE LOOK AWESOME.

156
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,836
BRING THESE OVER HERE.          
                 SUPER NINJA    
            MOLTEN POT STICKERS.

157
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,104
              THERE WE GO,      
        AND SESAME SEEDS ON TOP.
AND THIS IS OUR                 
DIPPING SAUCE?

   THE SAUCE ROCKS.             

161

162

 THAT I ENJOY THE MOST          

163

              A LITTLE RED WINE.

286
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:19,210
STIR THESE INGREDIENTS TOGETHER,

292
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,558
        AND WE MOVE ON TO SAUTé.

293
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,027
WE'RE GONNA LET THAT            
      SEAR UP.                  
                  RENDER DOWN   
               SOME OF THAT FAT.

          AND THE FLOUR ATTRACTS
               THE EGG WASH.    

434
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,409
NOW WE'RE GONNA PUT THEM        
   IN THE BREADCRUMBS.

00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,026
           SO JUST A NICE LITTLE
               TENDERIZING.     

469
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:52,096

00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:55,566
ALL--THE--WAY--ALL--DAY--LONG...
      (speaking gibberish)      

471
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:58,502
OKAY, LET'S DO A LITTLE FLOUR,  
    A LITTLE BLACK PEPPER.      

472
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,305

ITALIAN DRESSING, SALT.         

474
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:06,377
    YOU KNOW, IN NEW ORLEANS,   
 YOU NEVER LEAVE ANYTHING ALONE.

475
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:08,446

         THAT YOU MAKE IN-HOUSE.

482
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,930

       WITH THOSE ONIONS,       

483
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,932

484
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,201
I AIN'T AFRAID OF GARLIC.       
                       DON'T BE.
