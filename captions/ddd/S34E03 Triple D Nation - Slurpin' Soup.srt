00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,801
   You know people are asking   
   me all the time, hey, Guy,   

2
00:00:02,837 --> 00:00:04,469
   that one joint you checked   
      out in that one city,     

3
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:06,538
   when you were doing Triple   
      D, how're they doing?     

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,539
     You know, I don't know.    

5
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:08,340
     We should check it out.

       [car engine reving]      

7
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:13,345
   GUY FIERI: Over the years,   
  I've seen and tasted it all.  

8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,213
    This is ridiculous dude.    

9
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:17,549
       But it turns out it      
     was only the beginning,    

10
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,218
     because Triple D joints    
      have been blowing up      

11
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,086
      and we're going back      
     to see what's cooking.

13
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,289
       Like on this trip.       

14
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:27,359
      It's a melting pot of     
    savory, spicy, and soupy.   

15
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:28,160
          I'm shaking.

00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,828
  I can't get it on the spoon.  

17
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,629
       GUY FIERI: A pizza       
       place in Santa Fe.       

18
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:32,697
           That rocks.          

19
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,099
       GUY FIERI: With New      
      Mexican ingredients.      

20
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:35,967
    I got to have more pizza    
    with green chilies on it.   

21
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:37,236
       GUY FIERI: In just       
        about everything.       

22
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,772
 That's what I'm talking about. 

23

        Spicy shrimp up.        

24
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:42,641
          GUY FIERI: My         
     Hawaiian doppelganger.     

25

       GUY FIERI: Cooking       
      up outrageous oxtail.

28
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:48,780
GUY FIERI: In a surprising spot.

      [bowling pins rattle]     

30
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,784
    And in Baltimore, a place   
   serving the state seafood.   

31
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,787
 Look at the size of that lump. 

32
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:58,523
      In soups, sandwiches,     
           and shells.          

33

35
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:03,394
       GUY FIERI: Familiar

36

 and more off the hook flavors. 

37
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:06,932
    This is Triple D nation.    

38
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,408
       So back in 2014, we      
     were here in Honolulu,     

39
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:17,976
  not too far from the airport. 

40
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:20,212
     And we went to a funky     
    joint in a bowling alley.   

41
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:21,412
     You remember the place?    

42
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:22,614
             Mm-mm.             

43
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,215
    GUY FIERI: Oh, yeah, the    
  chef had hair just like mine. 

44
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,150
        And the ox tails.       

45
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,351
            O- M- G.            

46
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:27,686
      GUY FIERI: It's time      
      for a little revisit.     

47
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:31,823
        This is the Alley       
    Restaurant at Aiea Bowl.    

48
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,825
     [bowling pins clacking]    

49
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:35,560
     Tasty chicken plate up.    

50
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,830
  Feels like we're eating fine  
 dining out of a bowling alley. 

51
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,032
      After Triple D aired,     
     and you wait to get in,    

52
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,634
       but it's worth it.       

53
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,304
  Hats off to Glenn for taking  
    over the Alley Restaurant   

54
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,039
  and really making it his own. 

55
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,373
         GUY FIERI: He's        
       talking about Chef       

56
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,643
   Glenn Uyeda, who's my bleep  
  brother from another mother.  

57
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,045
        How long you been       
    doing your hair that way?   

58
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,246
       20 something years.      

59
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,713
           Seriously?           

60
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,982
  Well, you you have more claim 
  to fame on it than I do then. 

61
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:58,717
         Miss you, man.         

62
00:01:58,819 --> 00:01:59,651
          Yeah, me too.         

63
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:00,719
        Hair looks good.

           Good, yeah?          

65
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:02,721
 A brother from another mother. 

66
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:04,189
            [laughs]            

67
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,457
   He always says that to me.   

68
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,125
  From Triple D, I sent people. 

69
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,460
  And then, I sent my friends.  

70
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:09,328
      Have they said hello?     

71
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,129
              Yes.              

72
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:11,062
            How many?           

73
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,931
            Hundreds.           

74
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,466
       GUY FIERI: I really      
        sent people that        

75
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,667
  are waiting for their flight. 

76
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:18,136
    And I'm like, seriously,    
         bounce out, go         

77
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:19,338
 over there, and get the oxtail.

78
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,739
   I've heard from everybody.   

79
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,941
      The oxtails here are      
     the best on the island.    

80
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,275
   What makes them so awesome?  

81
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,611
       My mother's recipe.      

82
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,145
     My mom has a beautiful     
         sauce with it.         

83
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,613
           All right.           
          Let's hit it.         

84
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:29,748
         We're going to         
       just add the meat.       

85
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:30,882
  We'll start with cold water.  

86
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:32,151
       When it comes up to      
       a boil, it's done.       

87
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,619
      GUY FIERI: Then we'll     
       drain it, rinse it,      

88
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,086
      and then that's when      
      we start the process.     

89
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,221
         That's when we         
       start the process.       

90
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,622
             Got it.            

91
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,224
 GLENN UYEDA: First, we're going
   to put in some dried dates,  

92
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,027
     dried orange peel, star    
       anise, raw peanuts.      

93
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,228
        Lot of work, man.       

94
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:44,630
       GLENN UYEDA: Dried       
    shitake, chicken and beef   

95
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,565
 stock, and as soon as it boils,
   we're going to turn it down  

96
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,633
  to a simmer for three hours.  

97
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,969
      The sauce is the best     
      thing about the dish.     

98
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,304
           Seriously?           

99
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,105
         Daikon radish.         

100
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,906
         Daikon radish.         

101
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:54,839
      Making radish juice.      

102
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:55,908
   We're making radish juice.   

103
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,442
    GLENN UYEDA: We're going    
    to add the bulk in here.    

104
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:58,243
           Soy sauce.           

105
00:02:58,312 --> 00:02:59,177
  GUY FIERI: I love soy sauce.  

106
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:01,512
  Lemon juice, fresh squeezed.  

107
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,248
        Sesame seed oil,        
        a key ingredient.       

108
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,415
        Red chili pepper.       

109
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,518
     To top it off, a little    
      toasted sesame seed.      

110
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:09,054
    Then we mixed it all up.    

111
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,322
       GUY FIERI: And this      
      is the sauce that we      

112
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:11,256
  did dip this whole thing in.  

113
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,724
           This is it.          

114
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,327
 We're going to finish the soup 
 with little Tennessee whiskey. 

115
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,396
           Here we go.          

116
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,730
        We're going to be       
        adding some baby        

117
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,766
 bok choy and the green onions. 

118
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:29,875
  O- M- G. This is crazy good.  

119
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,811
    What I can't get over is    
     the flavor in the broth    

120
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,347
and then you get that mom sauce.

121
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,147
          I'm shaking.          

122
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,416
  I can't get it in the spoon.  

123
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:39,484
        It's-- it's hot.        

124
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,685
 I want to shove it in my face. 

125
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,887
   I want to get in the bowl.   

126
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:45,624
     Guy came back the next     
     day to eat oxtail soup.    

127
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,292
       That's how much he       
       really enjoyed it.       

128
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,761
 You can just get away from me. 

129
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,430
              Argh.             

130
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,431
            [snarls]            

131
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:53,565
  How's the oxtail soup going?  

132
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,700
      Oxtail soup has gone      
       out of this world.       

133
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,369
       Every day is around      
        200 portions now.       

134
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:58,436
             Really?            

135
00:03:58,505 --> 00:03:59,237
              Yes.              

136
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:00,372
            I dig it.           

137
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:01,306
     What did you bring me?     

138
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:02,307
   GLENN UYEDA: Tasty chicken.  

139
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,375
      Tasty chicken is our      
       number one seller.       

140
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,912
This sauce is what makes it all.

141
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,514
   So we're going to start it   
    with soy sauce and sugar.   

142
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,116
       Next ingredient is       
      garlic, red chilies.      

143
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,118
   We add a little heat to it.  

144
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:14,586
       Spicy salty, sweet.      

145
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,189
       This is our chicken      
       breading, and it's       

146
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:19,391
 corn starch and flour mixture. 

147
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,725
       And we're going to       
      put it on our chicken     

148
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:24,529
    and that's going to make    
     it fry nice and crispy.    

149
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:25,930
      Now that our chicken      
         it's finished,         

150
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,799
       we are going to dip      
        it in our sauce.        

151
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,067
 And it needs to be dipped hot. 

152
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:32,070
    If it's dipped cold, the    
    sauce won't stick to it.    

153
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,605
         Garnish it with        
      little green onions.      

154
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,006
        Tasty chicken up.       

155
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,474
         GUY FIERI: This        
     chicken is ridiculous.     

156
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,142
         This is killer.        

157
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,477
        There could be a        
     whole restaurant based     

158
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:41,146
   right off of tasty chicken.  

159
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,148
    It's like chicken crack.    

160
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,351
  Tasty chicken is definitely,  
  I suppose, like take on like  

161
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,086
   Hawaii-style fried chicken.  

162
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,155
      The crispiness of the     
     fried chicken and sort     

163
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,691
      of the sweet, savory      
         soy sauce dip.         

164
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,760
    It comes with like a soy,   
  garlic, a little bit of chili 

165
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:56,695
             flake.             

166
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,963
        It's like a sweet       
       and savory in one.       

167
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,431
        GUY FIERI: How's        
       the bowling alley?       

168
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,766
           Super good.          

169
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:02,967
  Did we get out all the alleys 
   and just make restaurant--   

170
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,168
              Yeah.             
      We we are this year.      

171
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,504
    And we're going to expand   
      the restaurant over.      

172
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,172
    GUY FIERI: Are you going    
     to still have bowling?     

173
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,373
        GLENN UYEDA: Yes.       
     - But just not as many?    

174
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:09,307
          Not as many.          

175
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,375
          More seating.         

176
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:11,643
       We have a two hour       
     waiting list on Friday,    

177
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,445
      Saturday, and Sunday.     

178
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:14,245
            Hold on.            

179
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:15,380
            [laughs]            

180
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,649
     You're telling me that     
     the funky little cafe--    

181
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,783
        GLENN UYEDA: Yes.       

182
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,186
    That service the bowling    
       alley has a waiting      

183
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,054
  list as a proper restaurant?  

184
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:23,988
        GLENN UYEDA: Yes.       

185
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:25,390
          Brother, man.         

186
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,859
    You go above and beyond.    

187
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,928
      Let's go to the hair.     

188
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:30,862
     What else you bring me?    

189
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,397
      This is spicy shrimp.     

190
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,132
 This is a popular dish as well.

191
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,333
        So what goes on?        

192
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:36,467
          GLENN UYEDA:          
      Butterfly the shrimp      

193
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,536
  so it cooks a little faster.  

194
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,137
    We're going to be adding    
     the sambal sauce to it.    

195
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,939
        That has a lot of       
      ingredients, onions,      

196
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,608
     a lot of garlic, fresh     
       ginger, soy sauce.       

197
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:47,746
   This is a sweet soy called   
 Kecap sweet soy, oyster sauce. 

198
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:48,613
         This is sambal.        

199
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,649
          It has spicy,         
      chili, garlic in it.      

200
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:55,820
  Finish it with green onions.  

201
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,889
        Spicy shrimp up.        

202
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:58,824
             Mm-mm.             

203
00:05:58,826 --> 00:05:59,825
    This is a fantastic dish.   

204
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,159
         That was great.        

205
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,361
    It's a little tang to it.   

206
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:03,628
      Just a little creamy.     

207
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,429
            Love it.            

208
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,497
       It's not too spicy.      

209
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:06,365
     A little bit of sweet.     

210
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,833
   Have like an oyster flavor.  

211
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,367
       Cleaned up my plate      
      pretty well, so it's      

212
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,636
    kind of a good indication   
       of how good it is.       

213
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,571
      If the bowling alleys     
       around the country       

214
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,574
        had this type of        
        food, there would       

215
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,908
  be a lot more people bowling. 

216
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,109
       Good job, brother.       
          - Thank you.          

217
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:18,977
           Keep it up.          

218
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,312
I did the hair first by the way.

219
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:21,379
            Just FYI.           

220
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:22,180
            This guy.           

221
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:22,914
            This guy.           

222
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,517
          Not him, me.          

223
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,518
          I'm serious.          

224
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,319
       There are plenty of      
     alleys on the mainland     

225
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,188
  that could use those oxtails. 

226
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,389
         Call me buddy.         

227
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:32,657
   GUY FIERI: Now, coming up.   

228
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:36,127
   I could get a Food Network   
  on the moon with this thing.  

229
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,329
        A seafood spot in       
        Baltimore making        

230
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,132
  room for more family recipes. 

231
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,533
      That's how big it is?     

232
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:42,401
   GUY FIERI: And more family.  

233
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:43,201
           Hey, girls.          

234
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,236
     He's single by the way.    

235
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,843
       Sometimes I like to      
       go outside the box,      

236
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,179
     and sometimes I want to    
     hit up a place serving     

237
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,781
 up what the city is known for. 

238
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,717
      So in Baltimore, it's     
       all about the crab.      

239
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,319
   And this 45-year-old family  
     run restaurant I found     

240
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,587
       did not disappoint.      

241
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:05,857
   Since I was there in 2014,   
    the joint's gotten bigger   

242
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,059
     and so has the family.     

243
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:11,129
 This is Jimmy's Famous Seafood.

244
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,598
       Seafood paella up.       

245
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:14,533
           Great food.          

246
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,801
        Great atmosphere.       

247
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,535
        You couldn't ask        
      for anything better.      

248
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:18,736
       Half and half soup.      

249
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,405
         It's always so         
      fresh, so innovative.     

250
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:21,672
  It's always going to be good. 

251
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,342
      I saw the episode of      
   Triple D and I was so proud  

252
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:25,877
  of everyone here at Jimmy's.  

253
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,078
   They're like family to us.   

254
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,548
         GUY FIERI: And         
      family to each other.     

255
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:32,884
    The joint was founded by    
    Jimmy Minadakis in 1974.    

256
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,087
 After he passed away, his sons,
  Tony and John, and their mom  

257
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,089
    Oola, kept things going.    

258
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,090
        You're the chef?        

259
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,158
              Yes.              

260
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,426
       You're the manager,      
       front of the house?      

261
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,761
      And you're the boss?      
           - Backbone.          

262
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:43,628
     I know who the boss is.    

263
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:44,829
              Mhm.              

264
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,431
      When Triple D called,     
    I tohught it was surreal.   

265
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Never think it's going to happen
 to you, because you're watching

266
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,101
         that show two,         
       three times a week,      

267
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,303
        and now they want       
        you to be on it.        

268
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:55,439
    I can get Food Network on   
    the moon with this thing.   

269
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:57,242
    I'm not a doctor, but let   
     me take a look at that.    

270
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,977
        Come here, Rock.        

271
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,178
        You can take him.       

272
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,714
        Tony was the one        
   sweating bullets over here.  

273
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,983
  I'm going to go out on a limb 
 and say crab cake ingredients. 

274
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:06,784
              Yeah.             

275
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,320
   Now, whose recipe is this?   

276
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:09,521
        It's my father's.       

277
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,990
   We're gonna about 30 eggs,   
    give them a little whisk.   

278
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,791
      Next up, mayonnaise.      

279
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:14,926
         Whisk that up.         

280
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,728
    Our worcestershire sauce.   

281
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,063
         Worcestershire.        

282
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,864
               OK.              

283
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,598
          Black pepper.         

284
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,533
   Rock salt. House seasoning.  

285
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:23,602
          Dry mustard.          

286
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:24,402
          Wet mustard.          

287
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:25,604
          OK, next up?          

288
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:26,938
    Now we're ready to start    
     making the crab cakes.     

289
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:27,805
       So what goes first?      

290
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:28,807
          Little sauce.         

291
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,409
      Chopped breadcrumbs.      

292
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:32,744
            Parsley.            

293
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,079
           Crab meat.           

294
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:37,616
        This is 95% crab,       
     5% binding ingredient.     

295
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:38,750
       That's outrageous.       

296
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:39,817
         Now we're going        
        to make the crab        

297
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,218
  cakes into 8 ounce portions.  

298
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:42,487
      That's how big it is?     

299
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,689
        What is it, like,       
         crab meat loaf?        

300
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,090
          Pretty much.          

301
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,159
 Put our house seasoning on top,
   and a little bit of butter.  

302
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,160
  How are we going to cook it?  

303
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:52,630
 350 degrees, about 15 minutes. 

304
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,398
      Here's our crab cake.     

305
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,170
       That's ridiculous.       

306
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,706
 Look at the size of that lump. 

307
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:04,308
      It doesn't need to be     
      dipped into anything.     

308
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,512
 I come to Maryland, I want the 
 bomb crab cakes, you delivered.

309
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:08,513
          Thanks, bro.          

310
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:09,915
     The broiled crab cake.     

311
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,717
     Any time somebody is in    
  town, they're all coming in,  

312
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,053
         I saw Guy Fieri        
       eat at this place.       

313
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,721
     You gotta go there and     
       get the crab cakes.      

314
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,324
    Before the show, I'd say    
   we probably did about 1,000  

315
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,324
   pounds of crab meat a week.  

316
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,193
       Now we're probably       
       doing double that.       

317
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,595
     GUY FIERI: And it's not    
     just a one hit wonder.     

318
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,999
  That crab cake recipe is also 
  found in other menu options,  

319
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,667
      like Jimmy's oysters.     

320
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,268
        One of our better       
       sellers, for sure.       

321
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:34,005
 It was my dad's version of the 
 oyster Rockefeller, basically. 

322
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,940
     So to make our creamed     
        spinach, we start       

323
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,475
  by sweating down some onions. 

324
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:40,412
  We add the spinach, sautee it 
  a little bit, deglaze the pan 

325
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,813
       with some amaretto.      

326
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,549
   Then we add our cream, our   
    cheese, and a little bit    

327
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,685
   of slurry to thicken it up.  

328
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,286
       To make our Jimmy's      
        oysters, we start       

329
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,088
        with our freshly        
        shucked oysters,        

330
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,889
   topped with little old bay.  

331
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,158
        Creamed spinach.        

332
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,559
          Crab mixture.         

333
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:55,627
     A little more old bay.     

334
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:56,828
       Put it in the oven.      

335
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,563
    After those cook a little   
    bit, we put a little bit    

336
00:09:58,565 --> 00:09:59,831
  of our imperial glaze on it.  

337
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,699
     It's basically our take    
       on the hollandaise.      

338
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:04,702
     Egg yolks, mayonnaise,     
      mustard, lemon juice,     

339
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,437
     and our crab seasoning.    

340
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:08,372
     Put it back in the oven    
      for a couple minutes,     

341
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,374
      and then we plate it.     

342
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:10,175
             Lemon.             

343
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:11,376
            Parsley.            

344
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,643
       Jimmy's oysters up.      

345
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,646
  They're absolutely fantastic. 

346
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,316
 These are more decadent because
  of the crab imperial on top.  

347
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,251
        MAN: The oysters        
        are unbelievable.       

348
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,921
    It's the cheese, it's the   
    crab, it's the seasoning,   

349
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,456
        and it's also one       
         of those dishes        

350
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,592
 that when you see walk by your 
  table, and you point and say, 

351
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,661
    I want some of those sent   
     to my table right now.     

352
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:31,462
      What do you want to--     

353
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:32,597
         Oh, [mumbling].        

354
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,065
  - We have different options.  
        - What was that?        

355
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,266
       You're speaking in       
        tongues just now?       

356
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,534
  - We have different options-- 
          - [mumbling]          

357
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:43,074
    GUY FIERI: But coming up,   
  there's no need to translate. 

358
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,009
          Gonna get in.         

359
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,478
        Because the food        
       speaks for itself.       

360
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,478
     Chef, how does it rate?    

361
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:48,346
            1 to 10?            

362
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:49,147
               10.              

363
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:50,382
   Be 11 if was 11 on a dial.   

364
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,086
      GUY FIERI: It's been      
        about five years        

365
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,155
      since I first popped      
       into Jimmy's Famous      

366
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,490
      Seafood, a Baltimore      
     institution that Jimmy     

367
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:02,761
    Minadakis opened in 1974.   

368
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:07,899
   40 years ago, your husband   
Jimmy and the family lived here.

369
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:11,969
We're in the upstairs of Jimmy's
 Famous, and downstairs was a-- 

370
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,973
         It was a bar, a        
     lounge that he started.    

371
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,308
      We expanded, we built     
        the dining room.        

372
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,710
       GUY FIERI: And when      
         he passed away,        

373
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,846
      his sons kept growing     
       their dad's dream.       

374
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,848
  Two bars, two banquet halls.  

375
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,517
   Now we got the food trucks.  

376
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,585
   You know, sky's the limit.   

377
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:30,388
  GUY FIERI: And a far cry from 
  the low hanging, head banging 

378
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,589
     setup they had before.     

379
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:32,924
        Could you please        
       stand up straight?       

380
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:33,725
    You're driving me crazy.    
            - Sorry.            

381
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:36,061
        I'm gonna-- yeah.       

382
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,862
       You're the tallest       
    guy in the shortest hood    

383
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,731
  that they have in Baltimore.  

384
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,466
   When we first filmed Triple  
    D, we had a special guest   

385
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,135
      and we could barely,      
         all three, fit         

386
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,470
 behind the line at that point. 

387
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,940
 This is my executive chef from 
 Johnny Garlic's in California, 

388
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,341
       Chef Jeff Poetzel.       

389
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,876
  Now, Jeff is from this area.  

390
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,211
     I had to get in on it.     

391
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,079
    OK, give us the rundown.    

392
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,880
    Soft shell crab sandwich.   

393
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:56,648
            [whistle]           

394
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,350
     It's like meat dancing.    

395
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,551
 We gotta do a little cleaning? 

396
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,287
              Yep.              

397
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:03,621
   - And that's all she wrote.  
          - That's it.          

398
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,622
      What's the next step?     

399
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:06,624
          Just a simple         
       dredge and pan fry.      

400
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,426
    Two minutes on each side.   

401
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,962
   Nice, crispy, golden brown.  

402
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,164
  Put the crab right on there.  

403
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,500
    Little Chesepeake mustard   
     to finish it off again.    

404
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:16,701
          Gonna get in.         

405
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:17,502
           Here we go.          

406
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:18,636
           All right.           

407
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:19,436
               Mm.              

408
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:22,107
              Wow.              

409
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,310
      The crab is so fresh,     
     the batter is so light.    

410
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:26,644
     Jeff, how does it rate?    
            1 to 10?            

411
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,579
               10.              

412
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:31,315
        Be an 11 if there       
        was 11 on a dial.       

413
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:32,917
       GUY FIERI: They're       
     also cranking up a mash    

414
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,452
  up of a couple local legends. 

415
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:37,055
   We're basically taking the   
   two iconic Maryland soups--  

416
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,390
     Maryland crab soup and     
       cream of crab soup,      

417
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,326
and we combine it into one dish.

418
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:44,462
    Well, Maryland crab soup    
   is a tomato based version.   

419
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,797
     We start our mirepoix,     
         sweat it down,         

420
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,133
  get our seasonings in there.  

421
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,868
    Old bay, worcestershire,    
     crushed tomato, tomato     

422
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,205
 paste, chicken base, crab base.

423
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,340
    And then a little water.    

424
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:56,875
     Let it reduce a little     
       bit, and then we're      

425
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:59,076
     going to add our mixed     
    veggies, fresh potatoes,    

426
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,144
       and our crab meat.       

427
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,346
       Now we're going to       
     make our cream of crab,    

428
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:02,880
   similar to a clam chowder.   

429
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,417
     Take cream, crab base,     
    old bay, and sherry wine.   

430
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,886
  Heat it up, then we're going  
   to take a blended mirepoix.  

431
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,622
 We sweat it down with old bay, 
  sherry, a little bit of crab  

432
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,624
      base, and then we're      
    going to incorporate that   

433
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,359
 into that cream based mixture. 

434
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:16,694
      We're going to finish     
        it with our roux,       

435
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,362
        and of course our       
      crab meat at the end,     

436
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,298
          to keep those         
       lumps nice and big.      

437
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:23,568
  Take our Maryland crab first, 
 top it with our cream of crab, 

438
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,304
 and then we finish it off with 
   a crab stencil of old bay.   

439
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,771
       Half and half soup.      

440
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:31,475
  You get a Maryland crab soup  
  taste, topped off with, like, 

441
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:34,245
  a milkiness, sweet sensation. 

442
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,580
          Unbelievable.         

443
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,315
       I like them equally      
     separate, but together     

444
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,184
    it's just, like, so good.   

445
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,653
           Delicious.           

446
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:42,854
     How proud is your dad?     

447
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,189
     I hope he's very proud.    

448
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,389
           Very proud.          

449
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,659
      Every parent's dream      
      is to have their kids     

450
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:48,993
       have a better life       
         than they did,         

451
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,962
 and because of my dad sacrifice
     and, obviously, because    

452
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,398
    of this show, we're that.   

453
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:54,799
        Hey, girls, he's        
       single, by the way.      

454
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:57,401
      He's the heir to the      
       empire of the, uh--      

455
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,537
         Jimmy's Famous         
       Seafood crab cake.       

456
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,739
    So after Triple D aired,    
     literally that summer,     

457
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:02,673
         I met my wife.         

458
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,409
Got a two-year-old daughter now.

459
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,076
         Triple D helped        
       me find love, too.       

460
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,680
     At the premiere party,     
        I met my fiance.        

461
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,281
      A lot of family love,     
    a lot of family respect.    

462
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,883
       You guys are doing       
        a phenomenal job.       

463
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:12,683
            Congrats.           

464
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:15,219
           Thank you.           

465
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,955
    And those guys are still    
 working right beside their mom,

466
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:21,825
     keeping Jimmy's legacy     
       and recipes going.       

467
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,027
         Now coming up--        

468
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:23,961
      My mom's named Penny.     

469
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,697
    A pizza slinging sister--   

470
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,031
      My mom's named Penny.     

471
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,500
    GUY FIERI: Spicing things   
   up with a Santa Fe staple.   

472
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:30,268
      Green chili makes it.     

473
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:36,374
 GUY FIERI: Now, back in 2009 I 
 hit up this joint in New Mexico

474
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:39,310
   where the chef was spinning  
    pies with some real deal    

475
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,646
        Santa Fe flavor.        

476
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,916
   These days she's turned out  
  more seating, a bigger menu,  

477
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,652
      and is wheeling that      
      dough all over town.      

478
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:50,388
    This is back road pizza.    

479
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,790
       Chili beef for Leo.      

480
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:56,460
   Back Roads has become sort   
 of an institution in Santa Fe. 

481
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,861
        Here's the local.       

482
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,398
  I do come here to Back Roads  
   fairly often because if you  

483
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,733
 don't, you miss something new. 

484
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:05,003
    GUY FIERI: That's because   
  Chef Piper Kapin made a name  

485
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,871
       for herself pulling      
       all kinds of piping      

486
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,140
    hot pies out of the oven.   

487
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,674
        Now, I'm going to       
       tell you right now       

488
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,210
     that I think that we're    
       dealing with, like,      

489
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,477
    a real pizza maniac, OK?    

490
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,278
     And I'll tell you how.     

491
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,146
            See that?           

492
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,280
That's pizza maniac right there.

493
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,081
              Huh?              

494
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:18,349
      Reaching in the deck.     

495
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,350
    Getting in the way back.    

496
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:20,618
     Catching it on the arm.    

497
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,620
        Why do you think        
       I wear wristbands?       

498
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:26,957
  And back in '09, come to find 
    out she's a sister from--   

499
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:28,493
        the same mother?        

500
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,627
      My mom's named Penny.     

501
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,162
      My mom's named Penny.     

502
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,698
    We talked back and forth    
  about our moms a little bit,  

503
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,701
    and then decided that we    
  should get them on the phone. 

504
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,170
       Race to the Penny.       

505
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:40,571
          PENNY: Hello?         

506
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,774
  Oh, she got her Penny first.  

507
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:43,975
           Hey, Penny.          

508
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,843
     This is Guy Fieri from     
 "Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives."

509
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,178
          How are you?          

510
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,046
        PENNY: I'm fine.        

511
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:49,513
     My mom's name is penny.    

512
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,049
           [laughter]           

513
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,451
        I was very happy        
         to be included.        

514
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,518
          You should be         
       very proud of her.       

515
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:55,319
        PENNY: Thank you.       

516
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:56,720
     And we are very proud.     

517
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:57,788
      I'm just a proud mom.     

518
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:58,856
         What can I say?        

519
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:01,859
     And my mom still talks     
      about it to this day.     

520
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:04,195
           [laughter]           

521
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,596
       GUY FIERI: But it's      
        Piper's pies that       

522
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,131
 are the real talk of the town. 

523
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:10,201
  One of the best things about  
   the pizza here at Back Road  

524
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,736
          is the crust.         

525
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,604
  Start with water, dry yeast.  

526
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:14,471
     Extra virgin olive oil?    

527
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:15,273
              Yes.              

528
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:16,207
      - Now, on the flour--     
             - Yes?             

529
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,274
         - High gluten.         
         - High gluten.         

530
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,075
              Salt.             

531
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,477
   And a little bit of sugar.   

532
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,212
      Now, this is going to     
     run for 15, 20 minutes.    

533
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:26,217
    This looks like a pillow    
  fight with one aluminum bat.  

534
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,352
         Cover it up for        
        about 15 minutes.       

535
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,153
              Wow.              

536
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,222
  Look at how that proofed up.  

537
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,623
  Get me a picture next to it.  

538
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,292
    About 13 ounces of dough.   

539
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,226
        Now, look at this       
        little technique        

540
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,427
       you have that it's       
        spinning for you.       

541
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,628
              Mhm.              

542
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,829
      How are you-- are you     
     applying more pressure     

543
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:40,164
    on the right side than--    
             - Yes.             

544
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,032
       A little bit more.       

545
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,166
          Goes around.          

546
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,434
        Do you see that?        

547
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:44,235
         First cornmeal.        

548
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,503
    This goes right on here.    

549
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:46,303
           Olive oil.           

550
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:47,305
   Just to brown it up nicely.  

551
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,106
              Yep.              

552
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,173
      Little sesame seeds.      

553
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:50,041
         On every pizza?        

554
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,042
              Yep.              

555
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,710
       I don't think I've       
        seen that before.       

556
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,311
       Let's make the one       
     with the green chilies.    

557
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:55,312
         - The Mexican?         
             - Yeah.            

558
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,113
           All right.           

559
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:56,914
             Sauce.             

560
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:57,848
       Mozzarella cheese.       

561
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,049
           Red onions.          
       - Nice sprinkling.       

562
00:16:59,085 --> 00:16:59,850
              Yep.              

563
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:01,051
          Green chili.          
          There we go.          

564
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,320
          - That's it.          
          - Pepperoni.          

565
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,121
         Oh, pepperoni.         

566
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:03,921
               OK.              

567
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:04,855
  So we pop that bad boy down.  

568
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:05,656
           You're up?           

569
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:06,457
              Yeah.             

570
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,525
            [whistle]           

571
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,226
             It is.             

572
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,131
             So hot.            
  - I'm going to go over here.  

573
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:13,931
              Yeah.             

574
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,733
         [music playing]        

575
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,202
               Mm.              

576
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,403
         You know what?         

577
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:22,607
     I gotta have more pizza    
    with green chilies on it.   

578
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,808
           That rocks.          

579
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:29,146
      And I'm in luck with      
    this new regional recipe.   

580
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,615
    That's called the local.    

581
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:34,552
 We use that pizza to spotlight 
 local ingredients in Santa Fe. 

582
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:36,687
        Our pizza sauce.        

583
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,289
     New Mexico green chili.    

584
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,691
New Mexico roasted red potatoes.

585
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:44,162
     Homemade sausage, which    
    is local New Mexico pork.   

586
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,963
      Cheddar cheese curds.     

587
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,865
        They have a great       
       flavor and texture.      

588
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,168
   They're a little different   
   than typical pizza cheese.   

589
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,503
        Now it's ready to       
         go in the oven.        

590
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:53,904
  For about 7 and 1/2 minutes.  

591
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,206
          535 degrees.          

592
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:01,112
       The local for Kim.       

593
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,446
       It's cheese curds.       

594
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,048
      I love cheese curds.      

595
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,183
       They're way better       
      than regular cheese.      

596
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:09,386
Never had potatoes on pizza, but
 this was really, really unique.

597
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,123
    The green chili on there    
    just has a bit of a kick.   

598
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,458
           Delicious.           

599
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,594
  GUY FIERI: People in Santa Fe 
 don't get too much green chili?

600
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,663
      I mean, they're not,      
    like, green chili'd out?    

601
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,197
       I don't know anyone      
    that's green chili'd out.   

602
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,398
            - Really?           
         - You crave it.        

603
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,600
        Like, when you're       
       gone from Santa Fe,      

604
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:25,336
     you want green chili as    
      soon as you get back.     

605
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:29,207
    It's really a cornerstone   
     of New Mexican cuisine.    

606
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,674
       GUY FIERI: So much       
      so that it's not even     

607
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,544
   covering the crust anymore.  

608
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,880
     We're making our green     
       chili chicken soup.      

609
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,748
     We're going to start by    
     seasoning the chicken.     

610
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:42,619
  Salt, black pepper, oregano,  
      basil, minced garlic.     

611
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,222
        We roast this in        
        our pizza ovens.        

612
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:47,958
   12 minutes at 535 degrees.   

613
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,228
         We are going to        
       assemble our soup.       

614
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:53,230
   Start by melting butter and  
    sautee-ing yellow onions.   

615
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,031
           Add flour.           

616
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,032
      Get the roux started.     

617
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:56,367
         Chicken broth.         

618
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,168
           Mushrooms.           

619
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:57,969
          Green chili.          

620
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,170
        Roasted chicken.        

621
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,370
  We're gonna give that a stir. 

622
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:03,307
         Add the second         
       half of the broth.       

623
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:04,175
             Nutmeg.            

624
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,175
             Cream.             

625
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,110
         We're going to         
       serve this with two      

626
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,045
  pieces of warm French bread.  

627
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,581
 Green chili soup for table 23. 

628
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,250
    Green chili chicken soup.   

629
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,318
    The soup is so flavorful.   

630
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:15,786
  It's got a really good kick.  

631
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,521
  The chicken is really fresh.  

632
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,924
         It is so good.         

633
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,458
      Oh, yeah! (IMITATING      
     ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER)     

634
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,193
     Here at the pizza gym.     

635
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:24,261
          I wind it up.         

636
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,796
    This side here is working   
    to there, and down here.    

637
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,064
    That's what does it all.    

638
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,432
           [laughter]           

639
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:32,870
   The Triple D fans are some   
   of the best fans out there.  

640
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:34,271
     We're busier than ever.    

641
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,408
    We've put as much seating   
     in here as we can fit.     

642
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,942
       Expanded the patio.      

643
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,278
 We decided to get a food truck.

644
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:41,946
    Slice of cheese for Bird.   

645
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:44,682
It's just a way for us to expand
  a little bit without getting  

646
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,017
    another brick and mortar.   

647
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:47,952
           Thank you.           

648
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:48,819
        I'm a new parent.       

649
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:50,754
     I have a son named Leo.    

650
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:54,625
  We're continuing to grow each 
 year, so just stay the course. 

651
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,293
 That's what I'm talking about. 

652
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,227
      Talk to our pennies.      

653
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:58,028
          That's right.         

654
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:58,963
      They taught us well.      

655
00:19:59,098 --> 00:19:59,864
     My mom's a real Penny.     

656
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:07,371
      Just goes to show you     
      these Triple D places     

657
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,774
  really are just like family.  

658
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:11,575
        Like Piper, whose       
        pizzas are still        

659
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:14,045
         making her mom         
       proud in Santa Fe,       

660
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,914
     the Baltimore Minadakis    
     brothers and their mom     

661
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,117
    still cranking out dad's    
      killer crab recipes.      

662
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,452
       And my brother from      
      another mother, Glen,     

663
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:25,055
       in Honolulu, whose       
        bowley alley eats       

664
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,990
  are the perfect way to roll.  

665
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:29,460
     We'll keep shaking the     
      Triple D family tree      

666
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,362
  next time on Triple D Nation. 

667
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:32,663
       Get your lean, OK?       

668
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,732
   Gotta get your arms up, so   
   it doesn't run your elbows.  

669
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:35,666
        Called the hunch.       

670
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:36,934
               OK.              

671
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:38,869
         Relax the neck.        

672
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,405
       Pat me down, Mick.       

673
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,341
          There we go.
