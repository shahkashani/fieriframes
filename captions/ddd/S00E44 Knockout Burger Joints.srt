1
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:02,701
Hey. I'm Guy Fieri.
  And we're rolling out,

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:05,004
looking for
 America's greatest diners,

3
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:06,238
drive-ins and dives.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,706
This trip,

5
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:10,242
a full hour
 of classic burger joints...

6
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,910
This is kind of
   like a burger emporium.

7
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:13,312
...from Cali to Jersey...

8
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:14,747
Cheers.

9
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:16,482
...Minnesota to Oklahoma.

10
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:18,117
This is off the hook.

11
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,686
We've got lights-out
  local landmarks...

12
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,955
Been doing it that way
 for 50 years.
      50 years.

13
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:24,156
...piling 'em up.

14
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:25,491
I don't know where to post up
    on this thing.

15
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:27,593
...inside out...
   Oh, that looks killer.

16
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:29,228
...and even with a skirt.

17
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,264
That is the craziest thing
    I've ever seen.

18
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,733
Plus, peanut butter
   near Purdue...

19
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:36,001
That much?

20
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:37,970
...and a Boston mac attack.

21
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:39,304
Where has that been
    all my life?

22
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:40,773
So get ready
  to go old-school...

23
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:42,574
That's what a burger's
 supposed to be.

24
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,710
...A-plus real deal.

25
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:46,311
That's all America, baby.

26
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:48,380
That's all right here,
   right now

27
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,949
on "Diners, Drive-ins
   and Dives."

28
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:01,960
It's not often
 that you find yourself cruising

29
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:04,396
a residential area looking
  for a place to eat.

30
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,265
But the locals
 here in Glenview, Illinois,

31
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:07,666
say, "This is the spot."

32
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:10,069
Right behind Grandma's house
   is this joint.

33
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:13,172
And they say,
 "The burgers are the bomb."

34
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:16,442
- So great.
  -Oh, that looks killer.

35
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:19,078
There's a lot of fun
     in the bun.

36
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,980
Part of growing up in
 the northern suburbs of Chicago

37
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,482
is that you come to Hackney's.

38
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:25,117
- You sure do.
   -That okay?

39
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,186
After 80 years,
  for folks around here,

40
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:28,587
it's just that simple.

41
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,690
Number-one-selling item
 on the menu here is the burger.

42
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:32,991
Is the Hackney Burger.
 That's right.

43
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:34,526
- Just the straight-up burger.
 -The straight-up burger.

44
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,628
An 8-ounce oblong
  they've been getting

45
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,363
from the same butcher
   for 30 years.

46
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:40,099
I order the Hackney Burger
   every time...

47
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:41,600
- Every single time?
 -...because it's so good.

48
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,068
There's
  the inside-out burger

49
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,269
stuffed with cheddar and bacon.

50
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,171
It's a mess.
   It's so juicy.

51
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,140
And the blue cheese
  burger, with the cheese

52
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:50,609
mixed into the meat
  before it's grilled.

53
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,877
The patty melt,

54
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:55,314
the brick of onion rings
 and a huge menu of all kinds

55
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:57,850
of home-cooked favorites
 and home-baked desserts.

56
00:01:57,852 --> 00:02:00,085
Pretty much, you can't go wrong
   with the menu.

57
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,520
But when folks think,
   "Hackney's,"

58
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,755
the first thing
 they're thinking is the burger.

59
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:05,791
It's the best burger.
    It is.

60
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,927
And has been since
 Prohibition back in the '20s,

61
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,263
when Bebe Hackney
  started serving burgers

62
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:12,464
at the illegal beer joint

63
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,233
she was running
  on her back porch.

64
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:15,767
They gave the food away
  in the early days.

65
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,369
- Kind of like peanuts at a bar.
   -Exactly.

66
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,605
You come
    and drink the beer

67
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:20,906
and then we'll give you
   the burger for free.

68
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:22,007
- Exactly.
    -Wow.

69
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,409
I wish that was still
    the program.

70
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,512
Okay.
 So it's not free anymore.

71
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:28,080
But it really is a heck
   of a burger.

72
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:30,716
And this is kind of
   like a burger emporium.

73
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,050
Um, this is like
 a burger emporium.

74
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:33,018
Stuffed, you can get 'em
   done with blue cheese.

75
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,486
You get 'em
    the original way.

76
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,121
And check out the original way

77
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:38,157
they're still making
  the inside-out burger.

78
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,425
I mean, this is, like,
 the technique here.

79
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:41,660
This is the technique
     that we use

80
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,262
to make
   the inside-out burger.

81
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:44,530
What is this,
just a regular old lid

82
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:45,831
off of one
of the mayonnaise containers?

83
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,232
This is our very
    high-tech gadget.

84
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:48,767
Yes.
 I can see that.

85
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,304
And, uh, we take approximately
    half of the burger.

86
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,606
And we shape it out.

87
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,408
And you got to pack it
in there a little bit.

88
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,245
Next thing that we do is we put
   in the cheddar cheese.

89
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,681
Try to keep it a little bit
    towards the middle

90
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:03,715
in order to, uh,

91
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:06,251
let the edges
    of the burger meet.

92
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:08,120
Otherwise, when you do cook it,
    it falls apart.

93
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:09,421
It starts coming
 out the sides.

94
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:12,257
Okay.
 -Last, the, uh, chopped bacon.

95
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,960
Now, how many
of these burgers will you make?

96
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,295
- 50, maybe.
    -50.

97
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:17,396
Yeah.

98
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:19,431
You could count 51 today.

99
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,933
Okay, 51, good.

100
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:22,968
- That's our inside out, right?
  -That's our inside out.

101
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,970
- That one's ready to go.
    -Okay.

102
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:27,906
No mayonnaise,
    mustard, nothing.

103
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,508
That's right.
Just lettuce and tomato.

104
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,643
Oh, man.
    That looks great.

105
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,514
Little crunch in the bacon.

106
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:39,484
- Good meat.
  -Tons of flavor.

107
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:40,786
Oh, that is great.

108
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:42,788
Soft and cheesy on the inside.

109
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,590
Tastes bacony.

110
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:46,725
Or maybe you'd rather go
  with the blue cheese.

111
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,594
We have a lot of blue cheese.
   We -- we take our --

112
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:51,363
our, uh, Hackney Burger,
     8 ounces.

113
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:53,298
We throw about another ounce
    of cheese inside.

114
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,333
Mix it up.
 -And mix it all together?

115
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:56,201
- Exactly.
   -Let's do it.

116
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,469
Take about an ounce.

117
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:58,670
And then it
just all melts inside.

118
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:00,172
And then
what else goes in this?

119
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:02,107
No, uh, it's just a Hackney
   Burger and blue cheese.

120
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,842
That's it. The Hackney Burger
 with blue cheese.

121
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,110
That's right.

122
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,079
Once it's mixed,
 it's slapped on the grill

123
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:10,249
and even more blue cheese
  is melted on the top.

124
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:13,652
Mmm.

125
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:17,222
All the blue cheese.

126
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:20,993
That is rich.

127
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:22,461
Don't get emotional
     about it.

128
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:23,495
Wow.

129
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:25,697
Why not?
 They even bake their own buns.

130
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,633
The bread's off-the-hook.
     Smell.

131
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,001
And the special dark rye,

132
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:31,370
they've been serving
 on the signature Hackney Burger

133
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:32,504
forever.

134
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,072
It's a tradition.

135
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,874
Because you to go to Hackney's
 and you get the Hackney Burger.

136
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,810
And to go with it,
 a huge brick of onion rings.

137
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,113
So this is burgers plus, now.
  -This is burgers plus.

138
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:44,750
Tell me that's not
 six extra days at the gym.

139
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,885
Their fried onion
  rings are fantastic.

140
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,921
The onion ring loaf
 starts here.

141
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,256
That's right.

142
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,025
Okay. Now,
who made this recipe up?

143
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:57,696
It was on a Friday fish fry
   back in the early '50s.

144
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,464
And on a certain
    Friday night,

145
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,300
they ran out
    of, uh, lake perch.

146
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,402
And a customer
    had ordered it.

147
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:05,904
And Carmen, who was a cook here,
   said, "In the meantime,

148
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,639
I'm gonna fix up something
  you're never gonna forget."

149
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,541
So she came.
  She breaded up some onion.

150
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:10,809
And she fried it up
    in a basket.

151
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,878
And then that was the birth
    of the onion rings.

152
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,080
It looks like you've
 done it before.

153
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:16,248
Yeah.
      No.

154
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,950
Grandma made us
    pass this test.

155
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:21,353
You know, we had to make sure
   we could dump it good.

156
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,354
- Hey, hey, hey.
  -Oh, wait, wait, wait.

157
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:23,689
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

158
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,424
You're not taking it
  anywhere.

159
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,830
Oh, man.

160
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,732
Just like decades ago.

161
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,068
And that's the whole idea
  with everything here.

162
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,570
So many places
   change after a while.

163
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,238
And this one
    has stayed true

164
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,040
to their
    original concept.

165
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,275
It's our joint.

166
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:45,510
It's about the food.
  It's about being here.

167
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,279
It's about the people.

168
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:48,880
It's just...it's nice.

169
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:49,781
Feels good.

170
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:52,250
Oh, yeah.
  Tastes good, too.

171
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:53,652
This is awesome.

172
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:54,753
That's all America, baby.

173
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,021
This is great.

174
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,323
Next up, in Somerville,
  Massachusetts...

175
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,558
You can do it, man.

176
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,926
Work out harder.

177
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:03,562
...a righteous burger spot
capping things off with comfort.

178
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:05,030
Putting mac and cheese
on it's pretty gangster.

179
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:08,100
Plus, the bomb burgers
  in Hackensack...

180
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:09,768
I could have
 18 or 75 of these.

181
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,738
...at a Jersey diner straight
  out of Central Casting.

182
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,805
Don't make a wrong move
 in this joint.

183
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,117
You know, I think one
 of the big misunderstandings

184
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,718
about "Diners,
  Drive-ins and Dives"

185
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,887
is that I eat at burger joints,
  like, all the time,

186
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,222
which is not really the case.

187
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,823
So when I do eat
  at a burger joint,

188
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,760
it's got to be a place that's,
 you know, outside the box.

189
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:37,763
So here I am outside of Boston
  in Somerville, Mass,

190
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:40,866
to check out
 the Boston Burger Company.

191
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:43,802
We got another Killer Bee.

192
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:46,405
It's a great representation
   of Boston.

193
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:47,672
Three monsters up.

194
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:48,807
He has the best burgers
     in town.

195
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:51,610
I wouldn't eat a burger
 anywhere else in Boston.

196
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:53,578
Homemade, fresh.

197
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,514
You don't feel like you're
 eating something out of a box.

198
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:59,284
Handmade and grilled up
 daily by owner, Paul Malvone...

199
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,719
Table two, hot mess.

200
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:03,321
...who mailed in a job
  at the post office

201
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,991
to get back
 to his restaurant roots.

202
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:08,660
I was cooking for a
little while, and I liked it.

203
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,762
And when I got out of it and
got into the postal service,

204
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:11,763
I missed it.

205
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,098
So, I decided
 to come back to it.

206
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,032
Order's up!

207
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,067
And he came back in a big way,

208
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:19,571
creating 28 different kinds
  of gourmet burgers.

209
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,239
Got the Killer Bee first.

210
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,307
It's so good.

211
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,176
It's got, like,
bacon and onion rings

212
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:26,711
and cheese and the sweet,
delectable barbecue sauce.

213
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,514
It's so good.
 -Got the Pilgrim burger.

214
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:32,150
Turkey burger, stuffing,
   cranberry mayo.

215
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,486
It's basically Thanksgiving
  dinner in your mouth.

216
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,621
But he's got this one burger...

217
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,156
The Mac Attack.

218
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:41,359
...that's the dictionary
 definition of comfort food.

219
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,462
Mac and cheese in a burger,
    two best things.

220
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:45,664
You'd totally recommend it
 to anybody that's a burger fan?

221
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,365
- Highly recommend.
  -It's wicked awesome.

222
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:50,035
I'm gonna make
some mac and cheese.

223
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:51,069
I'm gonna make
 the cheese sauce.

224
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:54,439
Take our chopped onions,
  the butter.

225
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:55,874
We're gonna let that
  sweat up.

226
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,176
I'm gonna throw the flour
  right in.

227
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,513
Okay, so we've got
    the roux built,

228
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,315
cooked out the flour,
  got the onions in there.

229
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,716
Now we're gonna go
    with some milk?

230
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,251
We're gonna go
 with some milk.

231
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,519
Cheeses.

232
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,187
American.

233
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,322
Throw some cheddar.

234
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,290
Cheddar, wicked cheddar.

235
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,259
We definitely got
 the accent going.

236
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:15,560
We'll work on that.

237
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,629
We're gonna throw some
shredded cheddar jack cheese.

238
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,631
So stir it up,
    get it done.

239
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,399
Boil some water, make some
  pasta, and there we go?

240
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:22,300
Absolutely.

241
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,768
All right.

242
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,538
Cheese sauce is made.

243
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,773
Gonna throw
 a little hot sauce.

244
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,609
We're gonna mix this up.

245
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,010
Good-looking mac.

246
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,349
New ingredient I'm adding

247
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:40,652
to my mac and cheese
  flavor profiles, hot sauce.

248
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:44,055
Where's that been
   all my life? Andale.

249
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,191
All right, I'm gonna throw
 some Parmesan,

250
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,425
a little Pecorino Romano.

251
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,227
How you doing
with that right there?

252
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,730
And we're gonna throw
in some salt and pepper.

253
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,064
We're just gonna mix this
  right up.

254
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,566
It's like a workout.

255
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,401
You're a champion.

256
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,970
You can do it, man.
    Work out harder.

257
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:03,241
Now you dump it in the pan,
  let it set up overnight?

258
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,377
Absolutely.

259
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,578
And why are we
    letting it set up?

260
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,047
If it's too hot,
it's gonna fall apart.

261
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,115
Too hot,
    it'll fall apart?

262
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:11,483
Fall apart when
it gets on the grill.

263
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:13,752
We're gonna grill
    the mac and cheese?

264
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,887
We're gonna throw
a burger right down.

265
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,055
Okay.
     Nice 80/20.

266
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,857
Never frozen?
   -Never frozen.

267
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:21,126
We make every one of these
 by hand every day.

268
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,494
Throw on some bacon.

269
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:24,129
The bacon's cooked to order
     each time?

270
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:25,564
Yes, sir.
This way, it comes out nice.

271
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:26,831
Gonna be nice and pliable.

272
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,767
Bun's on.
We toast all our buns.

273
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:31,002
- And the buns are local?
  -The buns are local.

274
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,971
Throw that right
 on the grill,

275
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,473
put some
cheddar jack cheese on.

276
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,009
I'm gonna get, like,

277
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,045
one of those road construction
    signs on my heart.

278
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:42,914
Look at this.

279
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,683
I've seen ridiculous
   in the burger world.

280
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:47,052
This might have to be
    a contender.

281
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:50,689
Mac Attack.

282
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:53,592
Look at that goodness
 from the flattop.

283
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:54,960
Mm.

284
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,995
I'm telling you what, pretty
rockin' mac and cheese, bro.

285
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,168
Mm.

286
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,636
Really good meat
 in the burger.

287
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,304
It's got good tooth to it,
  good chew,

288
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,372
good texture, good fat.

289
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,544
The bun does a great part,

290
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:15,513
where it just kind of absorbs
into all these flavors.

291
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,317
If you're gonna go
 for a big burger,

292
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,852
putting mac and cheese on it
 is pretty gangster.

293
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,087
Go big or go home.

294
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:23,989
Or come here
 and go home big.

295
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,758
Table four, Mac Attack.

296
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,660
All right,
 hope we're hungry.

297
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,128
I've had
 a lot of mac and cheese,

298
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,931
but this takes the prize.

299
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,633
Best I've ever had.

300
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,968
It's gooey and cheesy
   and stringy.

301
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,939
There is just something
  about cute girls

302
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:42,374
eating big burgers, huh?

303
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:43,908
I'm gonna make a calendar.

304
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:46,411
Watch the burgers.

305
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,048
You make the chips.
 You make the slaw.

306
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,183
You make your sausage.
You do all your mayos.

307
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,386
You're pretty much
a scratch-made burger joint.

308
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:55,320
Pretty much.
     Try hard.

309
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,388
- I'm impressed.
   -Thank you.

310
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,255
Give me a hug.

311
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,523
There you go.
  See?

312
00:10:58,525 --> 00:10:59,891
Now he's in it to win it.

313
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:04,829
Well, it's lunch time.

314
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,531
So we're headed to Hackensack,

315
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,199
to a diner
  that's a burger joint.

316
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,503
And I mean, a burger joint.

317
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:12,971
- Who's next?
   -Six burgers.

318
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:15,040
Best burgers I've ever
   had in my life.

319
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,274
Would you like onions
  on it?

320
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,776
You don't get this
   anywhere else.

321
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:18,977
Delicious.

322
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,479
Every time you come by,
 you just got to stop in.

323
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,682
It's never frozen.
  And it's always fresh beef.

324
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:24,849
Totally fresh.

325
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:25,950
Oh, and they cook it
   right in front of you.

326
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,752
It doesn't sit
    under a heat lamp.

327
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:28,853
Three double cheese
   for you.

328
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,121
And here at the White Manna,

329
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,923
the question isn't do
  you want a burger...

330
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,591
Good? Mmm.

331
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:34,693
...it's how many?

332
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:35,760
Can I get
   three cheeseburgers?

333
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:37,262
Can I get six burgers?

334
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,164
Now, are you supposed
 to eat 'em dainty like that?

335
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,832
Or do you usually just do
  a little pile shove.

336
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,534
No. I just try
 to eat it dainty.

337
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,170
They've been cranking
 out these tiny sliders here

338
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:46,504
for more than 60 years.

339
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:49,407
Ronny Cohen and his brother
  bought the joint in '86

340
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,842
after moving here from Israel.

341
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,811
I got two cheese with onions.
  One cheese without.

342
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:54,612
And kept almost everything

343
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:55,880
just the way it was.

344
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,348
I'm the only one
 that stays the same, you know?

345
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,683
Culinary epicenter.

346
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:01,386
If you be out of this town
    for 30 years,

347
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,021
you won't recognize
  anything but White Manna.

348
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,923
But you'd recognize
   this joint.

349
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,157
I'll take the small box.
    You hold this.

350
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,292
Okay.
 That's good.

351
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,194
We get chopped meat
  delivered every morning.

352
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:10,228
That's some good-looking
    chopped meat.

353
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,464
Show me this little thing
     you did.

354
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,566
Uh, okay.
I do, uh, slow motion.

355
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,768
- Okay.
  -I grab a piece.

356
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,870
And then I...
  That's it.

357
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,206
And now, how many of these
   will you make in a day?

358
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,942
Well, we roll
 about 800 to 1,000.

359
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,643
And then, uh, sometimes
you got some more...

360
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:28,046
- A week?
    -A day.

361
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,114
Are you next?
   Go ahead.

362
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,082
Cheese.
  -Now what do we do?

363
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,051
Okay.
    This is a single.

364
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,954
And this is a double.
  -Two of 'em stacked up.

365
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,890
Sliced onions,
    we slice every day.

366
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,159
That's thin.
Oh, right into the patty.

367
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,895
Right into the patty.

368
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:44,996
- The cheese.
   -Cheese.

369
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,264
The bun on top.

370
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,500
So when the onions are cooking,
 the moisture

371
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:49,934
that's coming
out of those and then

372
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,003
the moisture that's coming
out of the meat steams the bun.

373
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,872
And the cheese melts
all in the same little package.

374
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,840
Exactly.
   And I take one, and...

375
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,476
Okay. So, you pick it up
with the top off it.

376
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,211
Oh, oh.

377
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:07,152
- Oh, look at this.
   -It's correct.

378
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,419
Just press it in
    and push it out.

379
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:11,656
Press it.

380
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,625
Don't make a wrong move
 in this joint.

381
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,360
Cheers.

382
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,998
Fresh made
 in front of you.

383
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,699
Not frozen.

384
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:25,103
Honestly, I could have
 18 or 75 of these.

385
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,705
How many will you have
   in a day?

386
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,374
Two doubles,
    two singles.

387
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:31,209
I normally get between four
   and six.

388
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,610
10 to 12 burgers each.

389
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:35,213
So we made an order
   today of 111 burgers.

390
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,614
It's -- it's a big hit
   in the area.

391
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,716
Everybody knows about the place.
  Everyone comes here.

392
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:41,219
This is kind of like
the all-American style of food.

393
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,654
I mean, was this something
you were thinking about?

394
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:43,988
In the beginning,
    I looked at is

395
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,323
as a business,
   to be honest with you.

396
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,625
And I...
  -It wasn't a life.

397
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:48,726
It was just a business.
   It was just a business.

398
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,762
But the more I was getting
     into it,

399
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:52,363
and got to love it.
    It's like a family.

400
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,899
And it's fun.
   It's fun to work here.

401
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:57,435
Oh, thank you.

402
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,571
Coming up,
 in Sacramento, California...

403
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:01,606
Dude,
you are full throttle.

404
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:02,974
...a funky little dive...

405
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,542
This really works.

406
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:07,045
...not messing around when it
 comes to their cheeseburgers.

407
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:08,046
That is money.

408
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,651
You know, there's a lot
  of great food here

409
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:16,521
in Sacramento, California,
  between the Sierras

410
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,889
and San Francisco.

411
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:20,158
But probably a place
 you wouldn't expect to find

412
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,593
would be a burger joint

413
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:24,395
where they put as much cheese
on their burger as they do meat.

414
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:25,797
You're gonna love it.

415
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,332
Oh, oh.

416
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,834
A 1/3-pound burger
and a 1/3-third pound of cheese.

417
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:31,703
It's called
  a five-napkin burger --

418
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,371
messy, juicy and tasty.

419
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,173
It's the squeeze with cheese,

420
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:37,709
an off-the-hook burger
  covered in cheddar.

421
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,345
Best burger in Sacramento.

422
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:43,381
That is the craziest thing
   I've ever seen.

423
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,516
Well, you see, the cheese
  just hangs down here.

424
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,952
It's very crisp and just cheesy.

425
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,354
Kind of wakes up the taste buds

426
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:51,222
before you bite
 in the big, juicy burger.

427
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,423
What time do you open?

428
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,025
10:00.

429
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,793
And they're already
   lining up...

430
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,262
I drive across town
     for this.

431
00:14:57,264 --> 00:15:00,732
...at this tiny 12-stool dive
  called the Squeeze Inn.

432
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,267
It's hard to find a seat
    in this place.

433
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,434
So when you find one,

434
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,303
you got to sit down
    and enjoy it.

435
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,804
I think that's why they must
call it the Squeeze Inn.

436
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:09,607
You're all set.
 Have a good day.

437
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,777
Owner Travis Hausauer bought
 this place six years ago.

438
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,647
And he's keeping a 30-year
 tradition alive and kicking.

439
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,215
That one got a little big
 on me there.

440
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,284
But we're gonna, you know,
it's just gonna right there.

441
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,119
We'll fold it up.

442
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,387
That is
   a good-looking burger.

443
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,622
See, I like flattop burgers.
    -Yeah.

444
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,424
I enjoy 'em.
 'Cause you get that little --

445
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,792
you get that little
  caramelized crisp there.

446
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:28,860
It's almost, uh...

447
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,161
- It's all good flavor.
   -It's the fat.

448
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,696
Oh, yeah.
 Oh, there's a little crunch.

449
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:32,964
We're gonna throw
some cheese on here.

450
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,198
Just grab a handful.

451
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,300
When it comes out,

452
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:36,467
I don't know, it's about
 1/4 pound or what.

453
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:39,237
But we lay that on there.

454
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,538
Did they --
   did they ask for extra?

455
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,807
- No, that's normal.
  -That's as much cheese

456
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,876
as it is burger.
  -Yeah. Pretty much.

457
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:47,445
Then comes
 the totally out-of-bounds way

458
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,746
they finish 'em off.

459
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:49,914
A handful of ice.

460
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,015
All that's gonna do
 is generate steam.

461
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,518
And we'll take
 the bun like this.

462
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,286
Throw it on top.

463
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,955
We'll throw a little
 more ice on there.

464
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,189
And then you're gonna
 put the lid on.

465
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,924
This does not make --
   I mean, it makes sense.

466
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,093
Who did --
    who invented this?

467
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,128
I think the previous owner
 got it going.

468
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,663
Pretty unique and original.

469
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:06,965
- It's pretty unique.
  -People love it.

470
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,566
This is
 what's so cool about it.

471
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,268
It cooks the cheese.

472
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,569
You add the steam factor.

473
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,004
Steams the bun.

474
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:14,772
Keeps the burger juicy.

475
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,307
There's components
 of cooking going on here

476
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,775
that I don't think anybody
would have designed it and said,

477
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:18,910
"This is how this is
   gonna work."

478
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,845
But this really works.
   -It does.

479
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,046
I mean,
 this really works.

480
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,082
- And then pull the hood off.
    -Wow.

481
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,483
So that's it right there.

482
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,518
See how the cheese
is all melted down on there?

483
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,586
Now that bun, see that?

484
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,821
Now, where --
  where does all the cheese

485
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:30,888
go with it?
 -It's all got to go with it.

486
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,390
Oh, man.

487
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,158
To fry cheese like that.

488
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,293
Yep.
  See.

489
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,627
It's bubbling up there.
 A lot of times,

490
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:37,562
if you do it right, you can get
it to the counter in time.

491
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,897
The cheese
 is still bubbling.

492
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,200
That is money.

493
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,002
Look at that.

494
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,203
Absolutely wonderful.

495
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:46,437
How much of that
 do you get through?

496
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:47,839
Surprisingly,
   almost the whole thing.

497
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,140
- No.
    -Yeah.

498
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,009
The standard squeeze
  comes done up right.

499
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,276
Mayonnaise, mustard,

500
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,045
long-sliced dill pickles,
    couple tomatoes.

501
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:55,546
The long-sliced
 dill pickle,

502
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,048
that's also part of the...
    -It is.

503
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,416
And it's
   a refrigerator pickle.

504
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,752
So it's not one
 of those real heavy, vinegary.

505
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:03,187
It's more of a crisp
   pickle taste that...

506
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,088
- Really?
 -...really jumps out at you.

507
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,189
Oh, it's great.

508
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,557
You got all your options, too.

509
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,059
Bacon burger.
    Mushroom burger.

510
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,627
We could add jalapeños,
     avocado.

511
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,796
I can help whoever's
   next to order.

512
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,564
And when the Squeeze Inn
   gets rocking...

513
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,466
That's an order for 10
right there at 11:30.

514
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:16,834
...so does Travis.

515
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,403
Well, there's four
 ready to roll.

516
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:19,670
That's crazy.

517
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,172
So then we're just gonna
come in and slice it.

518
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:22,707
Watch your toes, man.
 It's hot stuff.

519
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,510
Wrong day
    to wear flip-flops.

520
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:26,744
Who cooks with you?

521
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,346
I'll do all
the cooking by myself.

522
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,982
Up to 10 hours a day, non-stop.

523
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:33,151
Dude,
you are full throttle.

524
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,119
And don't think this is easy.

525
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,989
You got to really cut.
     Push hard.

526
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:38,890
There you go.
 You got to get force on that.

527
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,159
- Dear God!
    -Okay.

528
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:42,393
- The burger.
    -Where?

529
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,162
- Burger?
   -There. Yep.

530
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:45,296
There, you go.

531
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,998
It's hard to figure out
 where you land it.

532
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,133
I can't even
find the burger in it.

533
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,968
I guess it's okay
to make a mess here.

534
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,236
If you don't make a mess,
  you're not doing it right.

535
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,204
You're not doing it
  right?

536
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,338
Doesn't have
 the right flavor.

537
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,441
I think I got to
loosen 'em up first.

538
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:57,542
Ah-hah.

539
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,110
That's the key.

540
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:01,379
Coming over hot.
   -Perfect.

541
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:03,614
You're there, man.

542
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:04,615
I might as well
    just go home.

543
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,284
- Yeah.
  -You're dialed in.

544
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,286
You might as well
  go home.

545
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:10,788
And even if you master
 the melting of the cheese,

546
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,391
you still got to master
 the eating of the cheese.

547
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:14,926
Got to grab it just like that.

548
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,361
Known at the Squeeze Inn
   as the skirt.

549
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:20,698
Now, you took
    your skirt off.

550
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,400
I take part of it off.
  Eat it.

551
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,035
You got to fold it in.

552
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:26,304
Then you got to rip the side
   a little bit.

553
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:27,605
Now, do you eat the --
   the part

554
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,440
that you're tearing off?
  -Yeah. Of course.

555
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,776
Hold the burger with one
  hand and never let it go.

556
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,411
And you eat your fries
   with the other hand.

557
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:36,747
It can be a bit messy.

558
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,516
I just go like that.

559
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:39,717
Make a berthing spot.

560
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,452
There you go.

561
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,124
Yeah.
 It tastes great.

562
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,258
That thing is money.

563
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,927
Fast-food chains
 across America

564
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,263
want their burger
 to look like that.

565
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:54,265
- Yeah.
  -But it's about the --

566
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,367
it's about the real deal, man.
   -It is, yeah.

567
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:59,537
Not bad for a total
 newcomer to the restaurant biz.

568
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,038
Actually, I worked
   at a school for years.

569
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,908
I never, uh, never even thought
    about a restaurant.

570
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,042
But when an old Army buddy

571
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,878
told him the Squeeze Inn
  was up for sale,

572
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,813
he decided to take a chance.

573
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,715
Do you miss school?
   -Not at all.

574
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,717
Within months,
  he mastered the squeeze

575
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:15,219
with cheese and the rest
  of the menu, too,

576
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,988
like tacos made
  from rib-eye roast.

577
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,122
Hey, that's a pretty
   premium cut of meat.

578
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,991
- Yeah, it is.
 -And smothered in cheese.

579
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,026
Yay.

580
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,995
That's a good taco, man.

581
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:27,031
And steak teriyaki
 with a killer homemade sauce.

582
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,566
It's wonderful.

583
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,034
And Travis is turning this

584
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,402
into a family affair now, too.

585
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,704
- All right, the double.
 -That's my daughter, Morgan.

586
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:34,939
My future daughter-in-law,
  Katie.

587
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:36,607
- Now, this is your son?
 -That's my son, Brandon.

588
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:37,775
Are you gonna take over
   the empire some day?

589
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:38,809
Yeah.
  Some day.

590
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,511
The empire thing's no joke.

591
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,013
And you keep winning
  best dive restaurant?

592
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,115
Yeah. We have
 for four years in a row now.

593
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:45,750
- "Best dive restaurant."
    -Yeah.

594
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:48,319
For the food and the
 experience of chowing down

595
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,288
in what might as well
  be a phone booth,

596
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,490
well, a phone booth
   with a patio.

597
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,492
Have y'all been here before?
    -Yeah.

598
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:56,294
And hundreds
  of fanatic regulars.

599
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,696
- Squeeze burger.
   -A double.

600
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,231
Look at the pipes.

601
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,499
Of course you can eat
    the double, man.

602
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:02,934
- That's right.
 -The squeeze with cheese.

603
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:03,868
Look at that.

604
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,802
'Cause for tons of folks

605
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,070
around Sacramento,

606
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:09,006
the Squeeze Inn is a habit
  no one wants to break.

607
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,676
- Awesome.
 -You guys have this attitude

608
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:12,977
about sticking
 to what's real,

609
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:15,279
sticking what you already did,
sticking with what worked...

610
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:16,914
If it works,
 you don't want to change it.

611
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,218
You promise my doctor
   won't see this, right?

612
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,886
We have that
confidentiality thing.

613
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,788
TV host and some dude
 that's on...

614
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,489
Yeah, Russ.
 Don't worry, man.

615
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,124
Up next,
  on this full hour

616
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,459
of knock-out burger joints...

617
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,528
How many patties you think
  we've done so far?

618
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,829
...in Cloquet, Minnesota...

619
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,231
Healthy with that, huh?

620
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,267
...a timeless joint hitting
 the griddle for generations.

621
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:38,102
When you think about
the all-American drive-in,

622
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,737
that's the kind of burger
they're talking about.

623
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:40,771
And in Oklahoma City...

624
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,073
Let's go cook these.

625
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,809
...a stand-out spot sticking
  to the tried-and-true.

626
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:45,810
No frills,
straight-up quality.

627
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:46,877
I know why
this place is packed.

628
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,417
"Triple D" in history.

629
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,053
I think it's one of the things
  I love about this show.

630
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,388
It's finding the joints

631
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,890
that have been doing it
 old-school for generations.

632
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:03,794
So here we are, about 20 miles
 south of Duluth, Minnesota,

633
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:07,431
off Interstate 35
in a lumber town called Cloquet.

634
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,532
Now, check it out.

635
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,001
These folks have been rocking

636
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:13,771
over 11 1/2 billion
   burger patties

637
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,907
since they opened in 1960.

638
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,042
And here's the kicker --

639
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:19,610
They're only open six months
  out of the year.

640
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,812
You wrote in about it.
   We're here.

641
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:23,247
This is Gordy's Hi-Hat.

642
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:25,249
- Bacon cheeseburger up.
  -You wrote the e-mail.

643
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:28,119
- Why'd you want me to come here?
 -'Cause it's off the hook.

644
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,253
Mushroom and Swiss.

645
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:30,621
- Did you write in to me?
  -A couple times.

646
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,989
And you like it
'cause it's old-school.

647
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,424
They're still doing it
   the old-fashioned way,

648
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:34,859
making the patties
     by hand.

649
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,460
- Two hamburgers.
   -Look at that.

650
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,396
The burger is always
  so juicy and good.

651
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:39,797
Hand patty
  every day.

652
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,766
1,500 of 'em.
  That's about a ton a week.

653
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:43,634
Been that way
 since Gordy Lundquist...

654
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,336
- Can I help you?
 -...and his wife, Marilyn...

655
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:46,804
Order up.

656
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,139
...opened the place
   50 years ago.

657
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,106
Bacon deluxe.

658
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:50,408
And when son Dan took over...

659
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,575
Hi.
    What can I get you?

660
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,577
...he knew better
 than to mess with tradition.

661
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:54,712
Double cheese
    with the works.

662
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:56,914
What the number-one-selling item
   on the menu?

663
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,150
Double cheeseburgers with
Marilyn on the grill, my mom.

664
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,918
Now we're gonna make
   a double cheeseburger.

665
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,421
- With all these patties?
 -Put all those patties on.

666
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:04,855
I heard that you run
  this better than anybody.

667
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,324
I do.
I dump all the onions.

668
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,159
Onions are just sitting here
   all the time, going?

669
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,927
All the time.
Then, we have our pepper

670
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,329
and salt mixed together.

671
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,464
- Healthy with that, huh?
 -Then I start flipping 'em.

672
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:14,832
As soon as they go on,

673
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,233
you're already starting
    to flip 'em, and...

674
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,601
I flip 'em right away.

675
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,370
- How many times you flip 'em?
  -Just a couple times.

676
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:21,706
Then we'll put a bun on
and get 'em as they want 'em,

677
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,607
if they don't want mustard
 or whatever else.

678
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,543
- What about those onions?
  -Put some onions on.

679
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:27,211
Like your cheese melted?
   -Please.

680
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:28,979
We always melt the cheese.
 Couple pickles.

681
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:30,481
So it get all built
    right on there.

682
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:31,515
It's all built on there.

683
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,084
And then I just
 put it on the bun.

684
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:34,452
The bun tops are toasted.

685
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:36,120
Then we put it
 into the container.

686
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:37,521
And this is
   the number-one seller?

687
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,390
- Number-one best-seller.
    -Mmm.

688
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:41,559
There's something about when
you cook a burger on a flattop.

689
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:42,727
Builds a little crust.

690
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:44,729
Then, when you melt
American cheese on it,

691
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:46,931
it gets a creaminess about it.
Look at all that juice.

692
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:48,366
When you think about
the all-American drive-in,

693
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,134
that's the kind of burger
they're talking about.

694
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:51,836
Everything's fresh.
You make it yourselves.

695
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:53,237
Been doing it that way
 for 50 years.

696
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:54,638
- 50 years.
  -Pretty awesome.

697
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,340
- Awesome.
   -Cheeseburger.

698
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,042
Oh, man.
 These cheeseburgers are great.

699
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,944
Beef is incredible.
  Everything's fresh.

700
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:01,011
Double cheese.

701
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:02,213
The burgers
  are just really good.

702
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:03,647
427.

703
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:04,849
You ever eaten here twice
   in a day?

704
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:06,283
Oh, yeah.

705
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:08,519
But in the Minnesota winter,
 you can't eat here at all.

706
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:10,154
It's closed six months
    out of the year.

707
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:11,255
I know.

708
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:12,556
You guys should put
    a moose out front.

709
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,058
Tell people the park's
   closed for the season.

710
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,526
It's huge when they open.

711
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:16,927
And after six months
   of waiting...

712
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,562
Cheeseburger and an order
of onion rings, please.

713
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,798
...Gordy's customers
  know what they want.

714
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,733
Fish sandwich, the mushroom
 and Swiss and the onion rings.

715
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:23,901
Need a ring, please.

716
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,269
The onion rings is the best
   I've ever had.

717
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:26,837
We just
serve 'em with catsup.

718
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,838
- With what?
   -Catsup.

719
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,607
I think
    that means ketchup.

720
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:30,741
Is this how you do it
right here in the...

721
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,010
- Perfect.
    -Oh.

722
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:35,179
Those are great.
  -That's some awesome.

723
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:37,314
The food is wonderful.
 It's a very classic diner.

724
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:38,849
Proud to have capped
  a classic menu...

725
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:39,950
Burger's up.

726
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,986
Burger, fries
  and a shake every time.

727
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:43,187
Blackberry and a raspberry.

728
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:44,922
Let me just help you out
  with that.

729
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,857
- Roast beef sandwich up.
  -The food's great.

730
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,659
It's a family tradition.
 -Chili and a blackberry.

731
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:49,760
- Thank you.
  -It's comfort food.

732
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:50,995
It warms you up
  from the inside out.

733
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,229
Your Coneys are up.

734
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:53,564
Just great, down-home cooking.

735
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:56,033
They do it old-fashioned way.
 -You have a nice evening.

736
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,435
We walk in.
  They know us by name.

737
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:58,936
And you're welcomed,
   no matter what.

738
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,871
Dan, your fish
    and chips are up.

739
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,440
There's a lot of places
   in northern Minnesota,

740
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:03,574
but not like Gordy's.

741
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:04,875
Really?
 I mean, this is an institution.

742
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,977
- Gordy's is the best.
   -Thank you.

743
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,913
This is kind of therapeutic,
 you know, Gordy.

744
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:10,114
Oh, yeah.
    It's good for you.

745
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,282
It's a happy time, right,

746
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,950
when we don't see any red
   on the outside?

747
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,852
Perfect.
     Yep.

748
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:16,153
So how many patties
 you think we've done so far?

749
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:17,321
About 40, 50.

750
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:19,890
We're not even one-tenth
  of the way done.

751
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,058
No. No.
We're not even close.

752
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,259
Awesome.

753
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:24,195
I'm glad we could spend
  this time together.

754
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:27,932
Here we are, northwest area
  of Oklahoma City.

755
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:30,134
Locals around here
  call this Ten Pen --

756
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,802
10th at Pennsylvania Avenue.

757
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,605
Now, like just about every
 neighborhood, there's the gem.

758
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:36,273
And here at Ten Pen, the gem --

759
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:39,777
it's a righteous burger
 at a joint called Nic's Grill.

760
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:41,378
- There's one.
  -Love the burgers.

761
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,380
It's great.
 -Best burger I've ever had.

762
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,249
- There you go.
 -Burger that makes you happy.

763
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:47,585
It's always served
 with a smile around here.

764
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:49,220
- Nic, the owner...
 -Here's your burger, Bubba.

765
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:51,622
- He's just a great guy.
 -Your name's not even Nic.

766
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:52,990
Justin Nicholas.
    -Yes.

767
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,358
They called me Nic
  as a kid.

768
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,627
Milo, yours for here.
 -Never did restaurants before.

769
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:57,561
Never.

770
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:58,762
Till 12 years ago...

771
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:00,130
Some mustard
 and mayonnaise.

772
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:02,132
...when he bought a house
 that came with two apartments

773
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,101
and -- oh, yeah --
  an abandoned diner.

774
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:06,136
You're a landlord,
     a homeowner

775
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:09,139
and a restaurateur
    all within 50 feet.

776
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,342
- About like that.
  -About like that.

777
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,844
Good thing, too, 'cause
  he's here all the time.

778
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,112
I do breakfast
 all by myself.

779
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:16,280
Wait, wait, wait,
    wait, wait, wait.

780
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:17,681
You get here at 6:00 a.m.
    to do breakfast?

781
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,016
Yeah. I start
breakfast about 7:00.

782
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,385
The best breakfast in town.
   No doubt.

783
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:22,887
He's got everything in here.
    Look.

784
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:24,788
There's some love right there.
   -There we go.

785
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,557
Javon comes in at 10:30.
  All right.

786
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,791
And he helps me
through lunch 'cause

787
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:29,560
it's takes two of us at lunch.
   -Oh, yeah.

788
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:31,996
'Cause Nic's turned
  this 15-seat joint

789
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:33,130
into a local legend.

790
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,532
Really well-known
  throughout the city.

791
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:35,566
There you go.

792
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:37,134
And at lunchtime,
   folks pile in

793
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:38,135
for another local legend.

794
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,336
- Mmm.
   -Onion burger.

795
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:40,971
The onion burger's
  the best thing ever.

796
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:42,673
There's quite a few places
   in Oklahoma

797
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:43,874
that serves 'em.
   -Two burgers.

798
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,676
But Nic's famous
 for the way he does 'em.

799
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:48,212
- No one else even comes close.
  -What are we doing?

800
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,647
This patty next
 and my burgers.

801
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:51,916
It's about a half a pound,
somewhere around there.

802
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:53,717
75/25 burgers.

803
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,452
You just roll 'em up
    and patty it.

804
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:57,087
I try not
to pack 'em too tight.

805
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,856
No, 'cause you push all the fat
 out of 'em when you cook 'em.

806
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:00,024
- Absolutely.
   -And that's it.

807
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:01,825
Let's go cook these.
   -All right.

808
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:04,128
First, I usually put some onions
and get them sautéing.

809
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,963
- Little butter.
   -Lot of butter.

810
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:07,131
Get 'em grilling
  down good.

811
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:08,599
And put our burgers on.

812
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,067
You threw the ball
    of fun on there.

813
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,368
And then
   just smash it on there.

814
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,903
I like that you get
   the buns are kind of

815
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,272
getting cooked on there
 and soaking up a little juice

816
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:17,274
while they do.
  This griddle's pretty hot.

817
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:19,476
The hotter the grill gets,
the grease gets to flying.

818
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:21,679
And that's what glazes
 the buns over.

819
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:22,813
Puts a little extra.

820
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,515
You see the way his eyes
   sparkle a little bit

821
00:26:24,517 --> 00:26:25,549
when he starts talking
     about that.

822
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,751
It scares me.

823
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,687
The onions just sit there
    and do their magic.

824
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:32,156
If you cook 'em too fast,
they skin up, lose the juice

825
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:33,490
and all that.
 -That's a mess of onions.

826
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:35,326
And what can I get
   with these as a side?

827
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:36,527
French fries
 or mashed potatoes.

828
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:37,928
Well,
   let's do some fries.

829
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,663
That's Javon's department,

830
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:40,831
one spud at a time.

831
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,933
He cuts 'em up to order.
 7,500 pounds a day.

832
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,368
Cook 'em all
 in peanut oil.

833
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,203
Peanut oil takes a little
more heat and not burning.

834
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:47,404
Put the cheese
 on the burger

835
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:49,106
at the same time
that I drop the fries.

836
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,641
And then it gives
the cheese time to melt.

837
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:52,943
You see, it's starting
 to glaze up.

838
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,745
All right.
Let's get this baby off.

839
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:55,746
Bring the fries up.

840
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:57,348
Let 'em drain off
 a little bit.

841
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,416
- Is that a normal setup?
  -That's a normal setup.

842
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:00,584
Dude, that's huge.

843
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:02,219
Look at that monstrosity.

844
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:05,923
Served with more fries
than I'm gonna be able to eat.

845
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:08,459
Mmm.
 That's great, man.

846
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:09,727
Look at all that juice
 running off that.

847
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:10,928
Can't beat that.

848
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,196
That's what a burger's
 supposed to be.

849
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:13,464
Onions are killer.

850
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,399
No frills,
straight-up quality.

851
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:17,134
I know why
this place is packed.

852
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,036
It almost melts in your mouth.
  Like, it's so fresh.

853
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:20,838
The juiciness.
    And it's a handful.

854
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,041
It just runs all over the place.
   It's great.

855
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:25,743
Only burger joint I've ever
seen get served with a fork.

856
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:27,044
I eat mine with my hands.

857
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:28,946
I don't need a fork
  like the rest of them do.

858
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:31,548
Oh.

859
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,118
Gets a little saucy here
 at the counter.

860
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,286
- Everybody loves the place.
   -Thanks, buddy.

861
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:38,122
Sort of self-taught
 whatever I --

862
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:39,456
I guess I do my restaurant.

863
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:40,824
May sound crazy,
  but hey.

864
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,027
Right, wrong or in between,
 that's what I do.

865
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:44,528
- Welcome to Nic's.
  -What you having?

866
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,263
He passes the test
   with all of us.

867
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:47,865
Everything here's good.
 I've had all the specials.

868
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:49,033
There you go.

869
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:50,734
And you could set
  your calendar by him.

870
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:53,103
- Tuesday special.
 -Nice, big, thick pork chop.

871
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:54,571
There you go.
   Here's your meatloaf.

872
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:56,006
Meatloaf on Fridays.

873
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,708
- And it is fantastic.
    -Mmm.

874
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,843
That is comfort food
    101 right there.

875
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:00,978
There's your chicken, Bubba.

876
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,613
Fried chicken, burgers.
  All right.

877
00:28:02,615 --> 00:28:04,281
I'd serve one thing here.
  Burgers.

878
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:06,016
Potatoes and chicken, too.
   -All right.

879
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,519
You only go back to places
 that you really like the food.

880
00:28:12,158 --> 00:28:14,525
In dinerese, he said,
"This is off the hook."

881
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:15,592
Here you go, Bubba.

882
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:16,827
It's the best place
  to come in town.

883
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:18,195
I see why everybody
    lines up here.

884
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,330
Ten Pen's lucky to have you.
   You sure are the gem

885
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:21,498
of the neighborhood.
  -Well, thank you.

886
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,767
Thanks, bud.

887
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:25,169
Coming up,
 in West Lafayette, Indiana...

888
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:26,437
That's a good burger.

889
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:29,006
...a place keeping tradition
  alive and well...

890
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:31,108
When did Ben Franklin
    invent this one?

891
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,911
...while sneaking in
 some untraditional toppings.

892
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:36,113
I want to go home.
    I want my mom.

893
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:42,286
I'm here in West Lafayette,
   Indiana.

894
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:44,054
You know, the home
  of Purdue University?

895
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,589
And two things come to mind.

896
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:48,425
One, how did the Boilermakers
  really get their name?

897
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:51,295
And two, what in the world
  would they be serving

898
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:53,430
at a place called
 the Triple XXX Drive-In?

899
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:54,832
Triple XXX.

900
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,533
This is ready to go 'cause
  I don't see flour, right?

901
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:59,036
Okay.
  One answer is burgers,

902
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:00,738
burgers and burgers.

903
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,606
Is it a good hamburger?
  Look at that bite.

904
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:04,141
The burgers are excellent.

905
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:05,375
As for Purdue...

906
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:08,345
Without Triple XXX, Purdue
  would be incomplete.

907
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:09,747
The Boilermakers' nickname

908
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:10,981
may have come from the fame

909
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:13,484
of their engineering instruction
   in the 1800s.

910
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:15,152
As for the fame
  of their athletes,

911
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:16,587
it's a local obsession.

912
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,889
Check out the wall
  at the Triple XXX,

913
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:21,925
where they've even got burgers
 named for former players.

914
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,495
Like the Bernie Flowers
  with a Hunk of Onion

915
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:26,597
or the Drew Brees
  Breakfast Special.

916
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:30,033
I would choose Triple XXX
 over fast food any time.

917
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,069
Because for more than 75 years,

918
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:35,005
the Triple XXX has been way more
 than the average burger joint.

919
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:36,874
This is a tradition that,
 like, everybody knows it.

920
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:38,942
They know that the building
  is orange and black.

921
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,377
It's, like, an icon.

922
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,179
And owners Greg
  and Carrie Ehresman

923
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:44,148
are committed
  to keeping it that way.

924
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,316
We don't call 'em hamburgers.
They're steak burgers.

925
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,785
- Chopped steak.
   -Steak burgers.

926
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:49,052
Never hamburgers.

927
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:49,987
- They're called chopped steaks.
  -Chopped steaks.

928
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:51,288
- Chopped steaks.
  -Chopped steaks.

929
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,389
Since 1929.

930
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:55,359
All cut and ground
  fresh right here.

931
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:56,860
And not just any steak, either.

932
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:57,995
Top-choice sirloin butt.

933
00:29:57,997 --> 00:29:59,530
I mean, look
at the marbling on that.

934
00:29:59,532 --> 00:30:01,665
You could cut that
  into steak just by itself.

935
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,300
- That, we have done.
  -I imagine you have.

936
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,568
And it cooked quite well.

937
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,669
I've seen enough
    cut, cut, cut.

938
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:07,371
I want to see
   grind, grind, grind.

939
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:08,605
All right.
  Here we go.

940
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:10,040
It looks like
    we are making

941
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,675
a ton
  of multicolored spaghetti.

942
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:12,843
Wow.
    That is a nice --

943
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:15,078
that's a nice mix
    between, uh,

944
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,580
between
    fat-to-meat ratio.

945
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:17,581
It's a real nice blend.

946
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,349
Nice red, deep, rich color.

947
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:20,384
I mean, look at that.

948
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:21,885
He turns it all into patties

949
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:24,721
the same way it's been done
 for more than a half a century.

950
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:26,857
When did Ben Franklin
    invent this one?

951
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:29,393
This is the Hollymatic.

952
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:31,628
The Hollymatic
  Super '54.

953
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,863
What year
   was this thing made?

954
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:34,097
1954.

955
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:35,132
No.

956
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:37,167
Yes, way.
  1954.

957
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,602
I didn't say "No way."

958
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:40,504
So if I don't say "No way"...
  -I can't say "way"?

959
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:41,772
- ...You can't say "Yes way."
   -Yes way.

960
00:30:41,774 --> 00:30:43,040
'Cause it makes you
    sound like...

961
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:44,474
- Let's reshoot that.
  -...it's warm up here.

962
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:47,744
Okay.
     So, no way.

963
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:50,914
- Yeah.
    -No.

964
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:52,482
That's -- that's...
  -Oh, I missed it.

965
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:53,884
I missed my cue.

966
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:55,519
That's where you say,
     "Yes way."

967
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,821
It sounds
  as old as it looks.

968
00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:59,990
Sounds like it's just right
on the edge of breaking.

969
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:01,158
It does, doesn't it?

970
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,459
But it gets the job done.

971
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:03,927
You take 'em three
     at a time.

972
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:06,663
I feel like,
  uh, Lucille Ball.

973
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:09,566
Pull it.

974
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,168
There's your
    third one there.

975
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,373
Now you're back in rhythm.
   -There you go.

976
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,275
It's like meat poker chips.

977
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:19,643
Yeah.

978
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:21,311
I'm all in.

979
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:24,448
And so's Greg,
 who can't remember a time

980
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,450
when he wasn't hanging out
  at the Triple XXX.

981
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:27,684
As a customer growing up...

982
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,553
Dad always sat in the
corner at number 27.

983
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,054
And then I kind of
 went down the line.

984
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,990
...with his wife here
  when they were dating.

985
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:34,691
Finally, his parents
  buying the place.

986
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:36,059
Him working with them,

987
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,495
then taking over
 with Carrie 8 years ago.

988
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:41,565
How are they doing running
this place since you left?

989
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,100
- I haven't left.
 -You haven't really left.

990
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:44,801
I know you come in
 and grind the meat.

991
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:48,805
Best thing they have
 is their double cheeseburger.

992
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:49,907
The secret to their burgers

993
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:52,476
is something
  totally out of bounds.

994
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:53,744
- More flour.
   -More flour.

995
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,345
- More flour.
  -Drag a little up.

996
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:56,647
Okay.
    Drag a little up.

997
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:57,547
Drag a little up.

998
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:58,949
Right.
 Put her down there.

999
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:00,083
Whale on it.
    -Okay.

1000
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,084
Put her on the grill.
  Beautiful.

1001
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,119
- That's it?
   -That's it.

1002
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:03,353
On the grill.
 -On the grill like that.

1003
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:04,488
- Yeah.
    -Huh.

1004
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,690
Just a touch of oil.
Just a touch of oil.

1005
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:07,858
You're doing good.
 You're doing good.

1006
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,860
You need a rubdown,
we'll call the people in.

1007
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:11,495
- Okay. There we go.
   -That's good.

1008
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:12,629
See, I love that.
    I got to try that.

1009
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:13,897
This is
the coming-of-age burger.

1010
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:15,165
As a kid, I always head up
the counter with Dad.

1011
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:17,601
He would have this big,
fat double cheeseburger.

1012
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:18,802
- Okay.
 -And I always thought, "Man,

1013
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:20,237
whatever I get big enough,

1014
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:21,538
that's when I get that..."
 -Whenever I'm a big guy.

1015
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,906
Whatever I'm a big guy,
  I'm there.

1016
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:25,375
That's what I got to get.
Barney, one day, decides,

1017
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:26,743
who was the cook
 at the time,

1018
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:28,745
decides that I'm ready
for the double cheese.

1019
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:30,013
- Time.
   -It's time.

1020
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:32,983
So he makes it for me
and brings it out himself.

1021
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:34,885
And just looks at me
with a big grin on his face.

1022
00:32:34,887 --> 00:32:37,187
And he said,
 "There you go."

1023
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:38,822
And here we are.
  -And that was it.

1024
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,023
That was it.

1025
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:41,224
Double cheese.

1026
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:42,793
Cheers.
  -You got it, brother.

1027
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,528
All right.

1028
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,533
Oh. Oh.

1029
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:51,168
That's a good burger.

1030
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,337
Now, Barney himself
 wasn't a double cheese guy.

1031
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:56,306
So if you order the Barney
burger, you're getting this one.

1032
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,543
Barney loved to have
a thick white onion cut raw.

1033
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:00,877
But you can't do that to...

1034
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:02,179
- Most people can't handle that.
  -I understand that.

1035
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:03,981
- So we go with grilled onion.
  -I understand that.

1036
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:06,183
Or you could have
 a burger with your breakfast.

1037
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:08,151
Want to put gravy
   on the potatoes

1038
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,553
of the Drew Brees
   just like that.

1039
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:11,788
Lay it on there.
  That goes back in.

1040
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,323
And there's your
  Drew Brees special.

1041
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,760
And check out
 the Dwayne Purvis Burger.

1042
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:18,996
Peanut butter.
  Get a big slab of that.

1043
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:22,833
And you just take it
 and just lay it on there.

1044
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,601
- That much?
    -Nice.

1045
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:26,236
Well, you got to have a taste.

1046
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:29,139
We got to put tomatoes.

1047
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:30,173
Got to put
    some pickles on it.

1048
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:33,110
Put a little bit
     of lettuce

1049
00:33:33,112 --> 00:33:36,813
and some onion,
   fresh-cut white onion.

1050
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:39,249
- Have you eaten this?
   -It's a love --

1051
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:40,684
You either love it
  or don't like it.

1052
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,085
And I'm -- I'm a...
   He loves it.

1053
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:43,754
- And there you have it.
  -I don't care for it.

1054
00:33:43,756 --> 00:33:45,155
I envy you
  for the first bite.

1055
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:46,256
That's awesome.
   That is --

1056
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:47,524
that's gonna be great.
   -Go ahead.

1057
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:50,427
No. No.
   This is yours.

1058
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:55,732
I absolutely don't enjoy that
     at all.

1059
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,872
I want to go home.
    I want my mom.

1060
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:04,241
Okay.
  Not exactly my thing.

1061
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:06,710
But you can't argue
that whatever they're doing here

1062
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,078
is definitely working.

1063
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,213
If you don't go here
   as a Purdue student,

1064
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,049
then you're doing
    something wrong.

1065
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:13,817
Where did the name
   Triple XXX come from?

1066
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:15,552
That's a long story.

1067
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,820
Brand of root beer.

1068
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:18,789
Oldest brand of root beer
  in the United States.

1069
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:21,458
In the '20s, there were
 100 Triple XXX franchises

1070
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,726
around the country.

1071
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:23,960
That ended years ago,

1072
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:26,263
but this place kept the name
  and the root beer.

1073
00:34:26,265 --> 00:34:28,799
Has that sarsaparilla...
  -It's not as sweet.

1074
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:31,068
Yeah. It's got more --
    more bite in it.

1075
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,135
At the Triple XXX,

1076
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:33,603
there's no breaking
   from tradition.

1077
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,605
- Exact same machine.
  -With everything.

1078
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:39,109
The pork, the burgers,
 even your basic breakfast.

1079
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:41,711
The group over there
was all breakfast and pancakes.

1080
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,046
You're all omelets.

1081
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:45,082
If you're gonna be anywhere
  near Purdue, Triple XXX

1082
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:46,716
is by far the best food
   you can find.

1083
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:50,353
The best time is when that rail
is from here to here.

1084
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:52,856
And it's jammed up.
Tickets are stacking on the end.

1085
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:54,424
People are walking
 in the door.

1086
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,425
That's the best.

1087
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,060
It is -- it's a riot.

1088
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,295
It's a lot of fun.
   -No way.

1089
00:34:58,297 --> 00:34:59,796
- It is a heck of a lot of fun.
   -Oh, yeah.

1090
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:01,531
Just 'cause
   when I say "No way,"

1091
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:04,534
what would you say?

1092
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:05,569
"Way."

1093
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,537
I got like
   three no-ways on you.

1094
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:08,939
Finally.

1095
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:11,341
Up next, in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

1096
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:15,445
Baby burger, Mommy burger,
  go to the hospital burger.

1097
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,513
...a crazy campus hot spot...

1098
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:18,014
Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave.

1099
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:19,516
...where powering down patties

1100
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:21,518
has become
 a collegiate competition.

1101
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,586
Okay.
     That's it.

1102
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:28,925
So when I'm cruising the quad
 at the University of Michigan

1103
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:31,027
in my Mac '67 Camaro,

1104
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:32,462
a question comes to mind.

1105
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,797
Where should I eat?

1106
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,799
Now, if you ask anybody
in the student body where to go,

1107
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,701
for the bomb burger,
  they're gonna say,

1108
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:40,170
"Krazy Jim's Blimpy Burger."

1109
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:42,005
Regular buns, regular bun.
 What you having, girlfriend?

1110
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:43,106
I need two doubles.

1111
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:45,142
It's the best burger
  you can get. Mmm.

1112
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:46,743
This tastes better
  than anything else.

1113
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:48,111
Who's next?

1114
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:50,680
- You love the Blimpy, don't ya?
  -What do you want?

1115
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:51,948
I want a bacon,
 lettuce and tomato.

1116
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,517
B L what?

1117
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,485
At this joint, you may
  know what you want...

1118
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:58,388
No, like, I want a hamburger
 with bacon, lettuce and tomato.

1119
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,589
No. No.

1120
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:01,658
But you better know
   how to say it.

1121
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,026
You want a double
   with bacon on it, okay.

1122
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:04,161
Yeah.
  That's what I want.

1123
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:05,562
There you go.
   That's what you want.

1124
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:06,663
And you've got
  to order in order.

1125
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:07,631
What are you having, sir?

1126
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:10,066
Sides, then size...

1127
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:11,568
How many patties
did you say you wanted?

1128
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,003
...then grilled toppings
   and bun...

1129
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,337
You have nothing grilled
 on yours, sir?

1130
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,805
- No.
   -Why not?

1131
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,941
...before you even think
 about choosing your cheese.

1132
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:19,109
American.

1133
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:20,177
What I want to know
  is do you want a bun?

1134
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,178
That's real important to me.

1135
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,413
- God, I'm nervous for ya.
   -I know.

1136
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:24,648
I'm about ready
 to have a nervous breakdown.

1137
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,882
We've only made two patties.

1138
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:27,984
Yeah!

1139
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:30,120
Davee Askew's
 been doing this forever.

1140
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:32,155
I just love this job.
   I'm gonna cook for you.

1141
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:33,790
I've gotcha.
    I got you, baby.

1142
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:34,925
How long
you been doing this?

1143
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:36,826
Uh, I was 14
 when I started working here.

1144
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:37,827
Alongside Rich Magner...

1145
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:38,862
What do you want
    on your burger?

1146
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:40,497
...who was a college kid
   at the time.

1147
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:43,600
And I worked, uh, part-time
 off and on for four years.

1148
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:45,202
When Rich came back
  and bought the place

1149
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:47,771
more than two decades later,
 he changed almost nothing.

1150
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:49,406
Yes.

1151
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:50,640
From ordering etiquette...

1152
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:52,275
- Anything grilled?
   -No, ma'am.

1153
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:54,344
- Thank you.
  -It's not the military.

1154
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:56,046
Yes or no, ma'am?

1155
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:57,781
...to the burgers themselves.

1156
00:36:57,783 --> 00:37:00,016
From singles
  to a stack of five...

1157
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:02,352
- Okay. I'm the queen.
 -...or any size you want.

1158
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:03,720
Could I get, uh,
    10 on a kaiser.

1159
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:04,988
There you go, baby.

1160
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,624
With almost 30 toppings,
  cheeses and buns

1161
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,392
to choose from...
 -What are you having on this?

1162
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,695
...the possibilities
  will fry your brain.

1163
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:13,029
Get a quad on onion with bacon.

1164
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:15,098
Triple with bacon,
   banana pepper.

1165
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,567
Double on onion, Swiss cheese,

1166
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,336
banana peppers,
  pickles and ketchup.

1167
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:21,504
- Anything grilled?
  -Uh, no, thank you.

1168
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:23,607
Good.
 I don't want to do it anyway.

1169
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:25,141
And don't be fooled
  by the floor show.

1170
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:26,443
Lean back.
    Hey.

1171
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:28,245
These are
  the real-deal burgers.

1172
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,980
Outstanding.
  Absolutely awesome.

1173
00:37:29,982 --> 00:37:32,148
And the real foundation
you believe of this meat

1174
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,084
is fresh-ground
 by you every day?

1175
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:35,552
Yeah.
 And we're gonna double grind.

1176
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:37,120
- Okay.
  -Never been frozen.

1177
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:41,191
Now we're gonna make 'em
into the 10 balls per pound,

1178
00:37:41,193 --> 00:37:43,326
which is
 1.6 ounces a ball.

1179
00:37:43,328 --> 00:37:45,395
That's right.
    8 ounces for 5,

1180
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:47,597
which is
    16 ounces for 10.

1181
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,766
We go through easily
    500 pounds a week.

1182
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:50,900
500 pounds.

1183
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:52,569
That's 2 tons a month.
    Some are quints.

1184
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:53,803
Some are doubles.
    -Okay.

1185
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:54,804
What kind of burger
   would you like?

1186
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,339
Let me get a double with,

1187
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:59,242
uh, hot peppers,
onions on pumpernickel.

1188
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:01,711
I need a triple bacon
  sesame bun.

1189
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:03,480
She has no idea
 what's coming.

1190
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:07,584
Can I get a quint, onions,
peppers, bacon, salami

1191
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:08,952
and mushroom?
    -Yes.

1192
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,720
If I forget it,
  you just eat it.

1193
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,789
Uh.
   -Look at that.

1194
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,958
Mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup,
lettuce, pickle, onion

1195
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,326
and relish.
 There you go.

1196
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:19,863
Baby burger, mommy burger,
  go to the hospital burger.

1197
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:21,598
Think I'm gonna start
   with the little one,

1198
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,566
huh.
     Mmm.

1199
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:27,237
That meat is so tender.

1200
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,571
Wow.

1201
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:31,474
That's tasty with
  the cheddar, the peppers.

1202
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,809
The beauty
 is layering it.

1203
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,712
You get all your flavors
mingling just the right way.

1204
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:37,781
I don't know where to post up
    on this thing.

1205
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,852
Look at the festival
     of funk.

1206
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:45,689
So much salami.
    Call my mommy.

1207
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:54,764
That's one of our biggest
expenses, is the napkins.

1208
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,633
And for some folks,
  even these burgers

1209
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:59,102
are better with something
  fried on the side.

1210
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:00,737
You have to get a fries
  to go with your burger

1211
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:01,938
just to top it off.

1212
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,406
They've got
  deep-fried mushrooms...

1213
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:04,507
Delicious.

1214
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,643
...cauliflower,
  broccoli and zucchini.

1215
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:08,778
The zucchini is one
  of my favorites.

1216
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,913
And the onion rings...

1217
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:11,414
These are the best onion
 rings in the world.

1218
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:13,149
...they take three days to make.

1219
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:14,718
Ah, beauty, beauty, beauty.

1220
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,353
The first two
  just to dry 'em out

1221
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:18,054
so the batter will stick
  the way it should.

1222
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:19,856
First day,
 the onion comes in.

1223
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,192
And it gets the skin taken off,
 the ends cut off.

1224
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:24,561
And it gets thrown in a tub
and refrigerated for a day.

1225
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:26,062
Second day, gets sliced.

1226
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:27,230
Go back in the bins.

1227
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,199
From the third day...
 -Dipped into the batter.

1228
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:31,000
And then, uh,
   thrown in the breading.

1229
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:34,170
And taken out on the line
   and served that day.

1230
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:36,106
So I guess the sweating
 of the onion idea

1231
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:37,340
is when you cook it,

1232
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:39,709
the moisture would want
to expel out of the onion,

1233
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,177
which would blow
 the batter off.

1234
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:42,779
- Exactly.
  -Man, I cannot believe

1235
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:45,115
how that batter
holds on to those rings.

1236
00:39:47,185 --> 00:39:48,618
I'm having, like,
    a crunch fest.

1237
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:52,222
These onion rings,
     really,

1238
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:53,957
are up there
    in onion rings.

1239
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,191
- Thank you.
  -I mean, you guys

1240
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:56,326
should be proud of those.

1241
00:39:56,328 --> 00:39:58,161
But as good as the rings are,

1242
00:39:58,163 --> 00:40:00,130
the big show
  is still the burgers.

1243
00:40:00,132 --> 00:40:02,966
- Delicious and messy.
    -Next.

1244
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:04,868
And you'd better be ready
  to pack 'em away.

1245
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,170
Triple with bacon,
egg, cheese, grilled onions.

1246
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:09,239
Let's see. There's
   the single, the double,

1247
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:11,007
the triple, the quad
    and the quint.

1248
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,609
So why stop at five?

1249
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:13,743
10 patties?

1250
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,813
Yep. Mushrooms, onions,
    Swiss cheese.

1251
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:18,481
I'll just keep my hands
     and feet

1252
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:20,016
inside the ride
    at all times.

1253
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:21,885
Turns out there's a whole
 competition thing going on.

1254
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:23,353
Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave.

1255
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:25,522
- And we don't promote this.
  -No, no, no, no.

1256
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:27,991
The record stands
at a little over 4 pounds.

1257
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:29,692
And no one's breaking
   that today.

1258
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:31,594
But records are still a risk.

1259
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,397
There's a double snack bite
   with a pullaway cheese.

1260
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:37,700
Dave Williams is going
 for a personal best of 20.

1261
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:39,269
How are you feeling right now?
   -I'm hungry.

1262
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:40,770
Hungry.
    Oh, you're hungry.

1263
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,806
Get the forehead.
 -Need a pit crew in here.

1264
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:45,842
Some girl showed up
right here on her 21st birthday.

1265
00:40:45,844 --> 00:40:47,710
Looks like she wants
    to go for 21.

1266
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:49,579
And Lauren Lobert is serious.

1267
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:50,580
I'm a hockey player.

1268
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:52,081
I'm an eater.

1269
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,450
What's the most
    you've done?

1270
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:56,219
Um, 10 in 7 minutes

1271
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:58,421
and some french fries
 and dessert.

1272
00:40:58,423 --> 00:41:00,924
But today for her 21st birthday,

1273
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:04,060
Lauren Lobert's going
   for 21 burgers.

1274
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:05,128
I'm doing three sevens.

1275
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,496
- Three sevens.
    -Yeah.

1276
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:08,164
7, 14, 21.

1277
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:09,666
Are you really gonna
    be able to do 21?

1278
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:10,733
Oh, for sure.

1279
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:12,135
I think I'm in love.

1280
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,204
That is one juicy-looking
    burger, though.

1281
00:41:14,206 --> 00:41:16,139
Delicious.

1282
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:18,374
Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave.

1283
00:41:18,376 --> 00:41:19,442
Round of applause.

1284
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:21,144
That is 20 patties.

1285
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,912
He got his 20.

1286
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:25,081
But she's still chasing 21.

1287
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,816
I see the end is near.
    -Yeah.

1288
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:27,951
- You got it.
    -Do it.

1289
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:30,854
Lauren, Lauren, Lauren,
   Lauren, Lauren,

1290
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:33,690
Lauren, Lauren, Lauren.

1291
00:41:33,692 --> 00:41:35,859
Okay.
     That's it.

1292
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:38,294
Am I catching some eye water
     over here?

1293
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:40,597
Ow.
- I'm crying 'cause I'm so happy.

1294
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:41,764
Don't leave me hanging.

1295
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:45,268
So that's it for this episode.
  But don't worry.

1296
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,936
There's plenty
  more joints to find.

1297
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:48,471
I'll be looking for you
   next time

1298
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:51,307
on "Diners, Drive-ins
   and Dives."

1299
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:53,076
My girl, Rachael Ray,
    she gave you props

1300
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:54,277
about your burgers?
    -Yes.

1301
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:55,445
I got a hug on the --
 on the show.

1302
00:41:55,447 --> 00:41:56,713
You hugged?
     Really?

1303
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:57,680
Don't think you're getting
    that from me.
