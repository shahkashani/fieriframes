00:00:01,736 --> 00:00:03,068
      You know, people are      
     asking me all the time.    

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,469
    "Hey, Guy. That one joint   
  you checked out that one city 

3
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,738
 when you were doing 'Triple D,'
      how are they doing?"      

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,640
     You know, I don't know.    
     We should check it out.    

5
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:13,545
    Over the years, I've seen   
       and tasted it all.       

6
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,346
    This is ridiculous, dude.   

7
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,416
     But it turns out it was    
       only the beginning,      

8
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,485
    'cause "Triple D" joints    
      have been blowing up.     

9
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:22,888
      And we're going back      
     to see what's cooking.     

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,356
       Like on this trip.       

11
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,625
           Holy moly!           

12
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,760
     If you can smother it,     
         we'll cover it.        

13
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,095
             A chunk of buttah.

00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:31,362
 A chunk of buttah.

         A Mexican spot         
        in Salt Lake City       

16
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,300
        making a million        
        different moles.        

17
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:37,169
           Any minute,          
        this is going in.       

18
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,637
         My sunglasses.         

19
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,039
       in Reno, Nevada...       

20
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,173
              This is for you.  

21
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:42,641
        ...a corner joint       
        taking a gamble.        

22
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,510
            I got a rabbit stew,
                  table 2.

      out-of-the-box rats.      

25
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:50,916
            It's about as tender
 as anything that I've ever had.

26
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:53,452
           And a diner          
   living up to their name...   

27
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:55,254
 -Now, Grampa's your last name? 
           -Yes, sir.

          Send me home,         
       and call me Buford.      

31

         That is money.

   Familiar faces, new places,  
 and more off-the-hook flavors. 

33

             This is            
       "Triple d Nation."

35
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,076
         I went to this         
    family-run Mexican joint    

36
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,744

     different ingredients.

 down at their second location.

           Red Iguana,          

44
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,362

         and dear to me.

One of those places you can't go
wrong with anything on the menu.

46
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:43,502
      There's a huge menu.      
 There's so much variety on it.

  WOMAN: Like, you want a real  
      authentic experience,

     and her husband, Bill,     
         are dishing out        

51
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,313
     the same family recipes    
         her parents did        

52
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,950
   when they opened the place   
            in 1985.            

53
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,654
     Okay ready.                

54
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,990
   So, "Triple D"               
was maybe two years old.        

55
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:08,327
2008, we cruise into            
Salt Lake City, Utah.           

56
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:09,928
  Never been there              
     in my life.                

57
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,631
And, all of a sudden,           
I'm going to the house of mole. 

58
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,735
          CARDENAS: "Mole" means
          "sauce," "concoction."

59
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,203
            It's an Indian word.

60
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,339
  I've never been to a Mexican  
restaurant that had seven moles.

61
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,306
                     No.        

62
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:26,811
       That's your mole --
              the king of mole. 

63
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,012
  So, show me what              
   we're gonna do.              

64
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,815
       We're gonna add tortillas
             to the heated oil. 

65
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:30,882
   It's a natural               
     thickener.                 

66
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,951
        And put those onions in.
            Poblanos. Jalapeños.

67
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,486

         In the pool.           

68
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,888
                  Tomatoes.     
            It just keeps going.

69
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,291
Epazote. It's an herb.          
  It's licorice-y.              

70
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,560
 Parsley, cilantro,             
      raisins.                  

71
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:44,963
      Boy, I haven't sous-chefed
   on the mole train in a while.

72
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:45,964
          A little fresh garlic.

73
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,633
      A little.                 

74
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,167
    The plantain.               

75
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,902
                 Coriander.     
                The allspice.   

76
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,637
  Cinnamon sticks.              
 Here go the cloves.            

77
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,306
     Peppercorn,                
      marjoram.                 

78
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,974
                   Cumin.       
                 The anise.     

79
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,108
                Look at that.

put in the mole that day,       

81
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,712

    was my sock.

             This is the thyme. 

84
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,516

        Yes.

00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,986
                 That's it.     

88
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,187
              We have just gone 
               into a boundary

chocolate chunky thing          

93
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,397
that we put in the mole?        
What is that called?            

94
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,865
      The beloved chimole.      

95
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,066
    The chimole.                

96
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,936
     It's a seasoning paste     
   we add only to mole.   

97
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,337
     So, if you                 
  don't have this,              

98
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:28,807
you've got a big hole           
    in your mole.               

99
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,942
              Okay.             

100
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,278
          Tastes like a flavored
             charcoal briquette.

101

         Oh, it's good.

                to stir this?   

103
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:39,284
              Sure.             
            That's not charcoal.

104
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,819
              That is chimole.  

105
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,487
    Should we just go ahead,    
        and put these in?       

106
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,155
               I am doing it.   
         Want me to help you?   

107
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,157
              Now I lost count. 

108
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,292
               Oh.              

109
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,827
         The chocolate's        
            going in.           

110
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,562
    And you're almost there.    
        We let it simmer.
