00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,521
BOMBERO IS "FIREMAN" IN SPANISH.

105
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,389
WHAT ARE YOU ENJOYING?          
             A BOMBERO BURRITO. 

106
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,393
SAY THAT FIVE TIMES FAST.       
               BOMBERO BURRITO, 
               BOMBERO BURRITO, 
               BOMBERO BURRITO, 

107
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,662
               BOMBERO BURRITO, 
               BOMBERO BURRITO. 

108
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:26,198
  WHAT ARE WE GONNA MAKE FIRST? 
THE BOMBERO SAUCE.              

109
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,401
WE'RE GONNA START WITH          
OUR TOMATO.                     
     OKAY, JUST A WHOLE TOMATO, 
        JUST CHUCK IT RIGHT IN? 

110
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,204
WHOLE TOMATOES, JUST LIKE THAT, 
ONE ONION,                      
AND THEN WE ADD WATER.          

111
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,940
                  ROAST CHILES. 
THOSE ARE HOT.                  

112
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,875
            THEY'RE REALLY HOT. 

113
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,277
THAT'S IT, AND LET IT BOIL?     
                     THAT'S IT. 

114
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,146
        THEY SIT THERE AND STEEP
        FOR ABOUT AN HOUR,      

115
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,482
    LET IT COOL DOWN            
    AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT INTO
    THE SALSA.                  

116
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,351
WE'RE GONNA PUT THE WHOLE       
MIXTURE INTO THE BLENDER.       

117
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:49,220
AND THEN WE ADD SOME...         
              A LITTLE CHIPOTLE 
              WITH ADOBO SAUCE? 

118
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,356
   YEP,                         
   A LITTLE BIT OF BLACK PEPPER.

119
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,158
<i>COMINO.</i>                         
                      OR CUMIN. 

120
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:55,427
           A LITTLE GARLIC SALT,
           A CLOVE OF GARLIC.   

121
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,162
                    AND KETCHUP.

122
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:59,764
         IT HAS THAT            
         SWEET AND SPICY FLAVOR.

123
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,767
              WE'LL BLEND IT UP.

124
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,936
YOU'RE GONNA THROW THE THROTTLE 
ON THAT, AREN'T YA?             

125
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:10,042
          DUMP IT IN OUR POT... 
AND HOW LONG DOES THAT COOK FOR?

126
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,643
ABOUT 45 MINUTES TO AN HOUR.    

127
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,644
WHILE THAT'S GOING ON           
ARE WE GONNA COOK THE CHICKEN?  

128
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,247
WE'RE GONNA WORK ON OUR         
GRILLED CHICKEN.                

129
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,182
CUT INTO FAJITA STYLE.          

130
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:19,384
         YOU'RE LIKE A SURGEON. 
LEARNED SINCE I WAS 14.         

131
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,253
WE'LL PUT ALL THIS IN A BOWL.   

132
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,054
     AND THEN WHAT ARE WE GONNA 
     PUT ON IT?                 

133
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,457
SOME OF OUR SEASONING SALT...   
                A LITTLE CUMIN? 

134
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,793
GARLIC POWDER,                  
AND THEN SOME VINEGAR.          

135
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,662
JUST MIX IT UP                  
AND THEN WE'LL PUT IT           
ON OUR GRILL.                   

136
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,731
       GRILL IT UNTIL IT'S GETS 
       CRISPY BROWN,            

137
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,532
          AT LEAST TEN MINUTES. 

138
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,801
   IT'S REALLY SPICY,           
   YOU'RE GONNA NEED A FIREMAN. 

139
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,604
I AM?                           
               IT'S VERY SPICY. 

140
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,806
         WE'LL GET OUR TORTILLA,
         PUT IT ON OUR GRILL.   

141
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,743
              TAKE OUR TORTILLA,
              CHICKEN'S READY.  

142
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,345
               PICO DE GALLO,   
               PUT RICE ON HERE,

143
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,948
                    WRAP IT UP. 
AND WHERE'S THE SAUCE GO?       

144
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,617
        WE'LL GET TO THAT PART. 
DON'T RUSH IT, HUH?             

145
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,686
     WE'LL COME TO OUR SAUCE... 
MY MOUTH IS WATERING.           

146
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,155
THE BOMBERO SAUCE,              
SOME CHEESE...                  

147
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,357
AND GUY, YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.     

148
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,893
BOMBERO BURRITO.                

149
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,762
CAREFUL, IT'S HOT.              

150
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,499
   WOW, THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF 
   KICK TO THAT,                

151
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,034
BUT NOTHING'S TOO OVERPOWERING. 

152
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,036
KEEP EATING IT WITHOUT          
BEING SPICED UP.                

153
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,238
      THE CHICKEN'S GOT         
      A LITTLE CRUNCH           
      AND A LITTLE CRUST ON IT. 

154
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,373
              BUT THE SAUCE...  
              WITH THE KETCHUP. 

155

   A LITTLE COOL PICO DE GALLO, 
                     YOU GET... 
A LITTLE BIT OF                 
THE FRESHNESS.                  

156
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,845
EXCELLENT.                      

157
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,047
IT'S A HOT, SPICY TASTE,        
IT'S VERY GOOD.                 

158
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,182
IT'S VERY SAVORY,

A NICE SALTY PUNCH.

162
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,592
                AND I FOUND IT.

                     EVERY DAY.

173
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,420

     GREEK FOOD,                

174
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:04,956
 FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MIND 
 IS OUR FRIENDS AT              
 VOULA'S OFFSHORE CAFE.         

175
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:08,827
     BUT THEN WE HEAR ABOUT     
     THIS LITTLE PLACE          
     ON NORTHWEST 85th THAT     

176
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:12,030

 AT MO GRIDDER'S IN THE BRONX.  

177

  SEE, THIS PLACE WAS ONCE      
  AN AUTO REPAIR SHOP AND DELI,

      GYRO SANDWICH, COMING UP. 

184

BACK THERE.

00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,775
          GET STARTED WITH OIL, 
          ITALIAN OLIVE OIL?    

207
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,844
(sighs loudly)                  

208
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,779
WE GOT ONION, TOSS IT IN, BABY. 

209
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,114
         WE GOT DILL, BAY LEAF. 

210
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,384
MINT, A LOT OF MINT USED        
IN GREEK FOOD?                  

211
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,385
A LOT OF OUR COOKING IS FROM    
THE NORTHERN PART OF THE GREECE.

212
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,187
THE NORTHERN PART OF            
"THE GREECE?"                   

213
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:44,923
   NORTHEST PART OF THE GREECE. 

214
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,191
RIGHT, NORTH IS PART OF         
THE GREECE.                     

215
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:48,993
                     (laughing) 

216
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,795
A LITTLE BASIL,                 
IT'S GONNA BE A WILD ONE.       

217
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,797
SO THAT WAS OREGANO --          
I DON'T KNOW WHY                
I'M DOING ALL THIS.             

218
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,733
SALT?                           

219
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,735
OKAY, NOT ITALIAN PARSLEY.      
                             NO.

220
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,471
          THIS IS PROBABLY      
          "SOUTH OF THE GREECE."

221
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,539
        ALL THIS IS GONNA SAUTE 
        TOGETHER.               

222
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:04,142
OKAY, SO NOW THIS IS COOKED.    
     DICED TOMATOES, FOUR CANS. 

223
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,544
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,              
DON'T TOUCH THIS.               
            I WANT TO MAKE SURE 
         YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT. 

224
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:09,014
          TOMATO PASTE, GARLIC. 
A LOT OF IT.                    

225
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,549
                         SUGAR. 
WOW, GETTIN' DOWN THE SUGAR.    

226
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,318
CINNAMON STICKS                 
AND THE CLOVES.                 

227
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,287
SO THIS COOKS DOWN              
FOR HOW MANY HOURS?             
              1 1/2 TO 2 HOURS. 

228
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,823
           WHILE THIS IS COOKING
           WE'LL GO AHEAD       
           AND DO THE PATTIES.  

229
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,826
        OKAY, WE START OUT WITH 
        THE 50/50 GROUND MIX OF 
        BEEF AND LAMB.          

230
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,895
"FITTY-FITTY?"                  
                   FITTY-FITTY. 

231
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,031
BESIDES THE MINT,               
IN ITALIAN WE CALL THAT         
A MEATBALL.                     

232
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,634
I JUST...                       

233
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,636
           ONIONS, BREADCRUMBS. 

234
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:34,239
ANY PARTICULAR BREAD?           
           NO, WHATEVER WE GOT, 
                THE END PIECES. 

235
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,042
        THE PARSLEY AND THE MINT
        AND THE OREGANO.        

236
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:38,909
(whispering)                    
HE'S GONNA MAKE ME MIX THIS UP. 

237
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,911
                         BASIL. 

238
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,913
OH, MY WRIST!                   
IT'S BROKE!                     

239

     LET ME HELP WITH YOU THAT. 

240
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:46,251
                  GARLIC PUREE. 

241
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:49,186
    ADD THE EGGS, SALT, PEPPER, 
    AND NOW...                  

242
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,523
GET THE MIX ON?                 
                           YEAH.

243
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:54,125
WOW, LIKE A WORK-OUT VIDEO.     

244
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,794
ENOUGH ALREADY, WE'RE DONE!     

245
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,063
   WE SCOOP AND PLACE THEM DOWN 
   AND JUST FLATTEN THEM.       

246
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,932
                 GIVE IT A TRY. 

247
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:05,403
OKAY, OVEN 400, 15 MINUTES.     
                 ACTUALLY, 425. 

248
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,405
OKAY, SO WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

249
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,407
  WE'RE GONNA PUT THE SALSA ON. 

250
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,209
AND YOU JUST LADLE IT ON?       
            LADLE RIGHT ON TOP. 

251
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,545
            I TRUST YOU.        

252
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,814
    BEAUTIFUL, MUST BE THE GREEK
    PART OF YOU.                

253
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,481
I DON'T HAVE ANY GREEK IN ME.   

254
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:20,351
 WE'RE GONNA PUT THEM BACK IN   
 THE OVEN FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES. 

255
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:23,287
BEAUTIFUL,                      
AND WE'RE GONNA PUT A LITTLE BIT
OF FETA CHEESE ON TOP.          

256
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:25,756
          MY MOUTH IS WATERING. 

257
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,760
          WOW, MAN, IT'S TENDER 
          LIKE A MEATBALL.      

258
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:31,495
  LITTLE BIT OF THE LAMB FLAVOR 
  IN THERE.                     

259
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:34,032
      NOW MINT AND OREGANO BOTH 
      PLAY A BIG ROLE.          

260
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,367
I GET A LITTLE BIT OF SWEETNESS 
FROM THE SUGAR,                 

261
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,503
  BUT THEN IT ALL TIES TOGETHER 
  WHEN YOU BRING THE SALTINESS  
  OF THE FETA IN.               

262
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,373
        IT'S LIKE AN ORCHESTRA. 

263
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,774

             I'M TALKIN' ABOUT. 

312
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,750
SLAMMA-JAMMA, I LOVE THAT LAMBA.

313
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,419
THE PITA'S GOT A LITTLE CRUNCH, 
THE TZATZIKI'S NOT OVERPOWERING,

314
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:36,487
    LETTUCE AND TOMATOES,       
    SOME SWEETNESS OUT OF THAT, 

315
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,489
          THEN YOU GET THE LAMB 
          WHICH HAS BIG FLAVOR. 

316
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,358
              IT'S REALLY GOOD. 

317
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,260
YOU DON'T SHARE VERY GOOD,      
DO YOU?                         

318
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,229
                             NO.
I CAN TELL.                     

319
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,030
             THE LAMB IS FRESH. 

320
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,032
IT'S KINDA LIKE BACK AT HOME.   

321
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,900
        IT'S LIKE I'M TAKING    
        A LITTLE MINI-VACATION. 

322
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,836
IT'S REALLY A LOT OF FUN.       

323
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,372
        EVERY TIME I COME HERE, 
        I FEEL LIKE I'M PART OF 
        THE FAMILY.             

324
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,374
   GREAT TIME, I'M COMING BACK. 

325
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,710
 YOU GOTTA COME TRY             
 A FLAMING CHEESE FROM MR. OPA.

    I NEVER HAD ANYTHING HERE   
    I DIDN'T LIKE.              

329

   BY REAL CHARACTERS.          

332
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,462
    LIKE THIS PLACE, ROCCO'S.   

333
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:20,264
    NOW IT'S OWNED BY A DUDE    
    NAMED DON DIAL,             

334
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,400
 EVERYBODY CALLS HIM "DOUBLE D,"

335
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,670
    SO I THOUGHT IT'D JUST BE   
    PERFECT THAT HE BE ON       
    "TRIPLE D."                 

336

              OH, LOOK AT THAT. 

347

     AND ROAST PORK ON OUR MENU 

351
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,305
     SO IT'S ALREADY ROASTED IN 
     THE WINE, THE GARLIC,      
     THE ROSEMARY.              

352
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,707
         NOW WE PUT OUR CELERY, 
         RED AND WHITE ONION,   

353
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,842
       ITALIAN SAUSAGE -- MILD.

MILD, WHY?                      
      'CAUSE WE CAN ADD SPICES. 

355
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,981
      ONCE IT'S HOT,            
      WE CAN'T TAKE IT OUT.     

356
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,849
WHO WOULD'VE KNOWN.             

357
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,318
              ITALIAN PARSLEY,  
              SLICED MUSHROOMS, 
              FRESH BASIL.      

358
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,254
             STEMS OF ROSEMARY. 

359
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:17,889
IF YOU TAKE THOSE STEMS OF      
THE BASIL,                      

360
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,791
SOAK THEM IN SOME               
EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL,         

361
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,659
AND THEN USE THAT               
EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL          
TO MAKE YOUR SALAD DRESSING.    

362
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,795
BOOM, IT'LL KILL YA.            

363
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,330
     SO WE'RE GONNA MIX THIS UP 
     AND PUT IT IN A CUISINART. 

364
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,600
          IF YOU'RE IN A HURRY, 
          WHICH I ALWAYS AM,    

365
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,335
       DO A LITTLE ROCK-N-ROLL.

367
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,871

369
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,208
SO NOW WHAT TAKES PLACE?        

370
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:39,944
                1 CUP OF GARLIC 
                INTO OLIVE OIL. 

371
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,814
GROUND CHUCK,                   
THE GARLIC IS GOING IN THE MEAT 
SO IT WON'T BURN.               

372
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:45,083
     NOW WE PUT OUR GROUND PORK 
     AND GROUND BEEF.           

373
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,017
             SAME PROCESS HERE. 

374
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,821
WHO TAUGHT YOU THIS METHOD?     
  MY UNCLE, ROCCO'S SON IS LOU. 

375
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,423
SO YOUR MOM'S BROTHER LOU       
TAUGHT YOU THIS?                
                       CORRECT. 

376
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,425
      WE'RE ADDING A LOT OF WINE
      TO THAT.                  

377
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,427
REALLY?                         
                 A LOT OF WINE. 

378
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,696
ALL THREE?                      
              HALF OF THAT ONE. 

379
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:01,098
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT MUCH       
RED WINE GO IN A BOLOGNESE.     

380
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,300
  THEN WE ADD CRUSHED TOMATOES. 

381
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,903
  MIX IT UP                     
  AND I'M GONNA ADD SOME WATER. 

382
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,239
              THAT'S THE SALT,  
              THAT'S THE SUGAR. 

383
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,308
         A LITTLE BLACK PEPPER, 
         GROUND BLACK PEPPER.   

384
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:13,044
        DRY OREGANO, DRY BASIL, 
        A POUND OF BUTTER.      

385
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,112
THAT IS CRAZY.                  

386
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,982
HOW LONG'S THIS BAD BOY         
GONNA COOK DOWN?                
                    FOUR HOURS. 

387
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,984
SO YOU MAKE YOUR OWN POLENTA?   
       WE MAKE OUR OWN POLENTA. 

388
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,053
WHAT DO YOU PUT IN IT?          
 I BOIL HOMEMADE CHICKEN BROTH, 
   THEN WE POUR THE POLENTA IN, 
                   KEEP MOVING. 

389
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,322
    A CUBE OF BUTTER            
    BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING A LOT. 

390
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,258
HOW MUCH ARE WE MAKING?         
                  THREE LOAVES. 

391
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,326
                PARMESAN CHEESE,
                FRESH PARSLEY.  

392
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,462
      SO THEN WE PUT IT IN HERE,
      LET THAT CHILL.           

393
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,731
         THAT CHILLS OVERNIGHT. 
LOG-O-POLENTA.                  

394
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,133
                    POP IT OUT. 
NOT MY FIRST RODEO.             

395
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,536
TAKE A SLICE                    
THEN WE PUT IT ON THE GRILL.    

396
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:43,141
THEN COVER IT                   
TO STEAM IT A LITTLE BIT.       

397
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:45,076
YOU PUT THE VEGETABLES IN THERE.

398
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,744
NOW FRESH GARLIC AND OIL.       

399
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,479
AND YOU PUT BUTTER,             
VEGETABLES.                     

400
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,882
THIS PAN HERE,                  
ONLY FOR VEGETABLES,            
NEVER TOUCHES THE WATER.        

401
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:52,350
I'VE SEASONED IT,               
I BLACKENED IT,                 

402
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,485
THIS PAN'S BEEN HERE FOR        
16 YEARS.                       

403
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,553
FRESH BASIL, MONTEREY JACK.     

404
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,423
THIS IS READY TO GO,            
PLATE THE POLENTA,              

405
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,491
VEGETABLES SECOND,              
BOLOGNESE.                      

406
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,693
A LITTLE PARMESAN CHEESE        
AND FRESH BASIL.                

407
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:05,430
MMM, BOY, THAT'S NICE.          

408
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,632
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DEEPER      
THAN THE AVERAGE BOLOGNESE.     

409
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,501
IT'S A LOT SWEETER              
THAN I ANTICIPATED.             

410
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,771
BUT I THINK THE ROASTED MEAT... 
THAT'S THE BEST FLAVOR          
FROM IT.                        

411
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,973
 IT'S GOT SOME REAL COMPLEXITY, 
 THAT'S KILLER.                 

412
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,109
            GREAT POLENTA, TOO. 

413
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,044
        IS THE REST OF THE FOOD 
        GONNA BE LIKE THIS?     

414
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,846
YOU'RE GONNA EAT TODAY.         

415
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:23,781
     WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? 
OUTSTANDING.                    

416
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,716
THE LITTLE BIT OF GARLIC,       
REALLY, REALLY GOOD.            

417
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,585
DON IS THE SHOW.                

418

YOU GOTTA WATCH THIS.           

419
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,657
THIS GUY IS A MACHINE.          

420
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,459
  I LIKE TO SIT BY THE KITCHEN  
  AND WATCH.                    

421
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,394
            I HAVE HIGH ENERGY. 

422
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,463
IT'S VERY ENTERTAINING.

          LET'S GO, PICK IT UP! 

425
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:44,135
EGGPLANT SANDWICH,              
LOT OF FLAVOR, NICE AND JUICY.  

426
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,137
 THE FRITTATA'S ARE REALLY GOOD.

427
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,139
I'VE HAD ALMOST EVERYTHING,     
CHICKEN PICCATA.                

428
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,941
I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE SOME     
CHICKEN PICCATA                 

429
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:51,876
BECAUSE I AM A PICCATA          
AFICIONADO.                     

430
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:54,878
  OKAY, EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL. 
THE INDUSTRIAL CAN SIZE.        

431
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,880
         FRESH CHICKEN BREASTS. 

432
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,350
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU SLICED        
THESE BREASTS IN HALF...        

433
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,418
NOT POUNDED THEM.               
                    YOU GOT IT. 

434
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,221
YOU DREDGE THESE IN             
REGULAR ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR.      
                       EXACTLY. 

435
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,089
  WE PUT THE CHICKEN BREAST IN, 
  JUST MAKE SURE...             

436
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:07,492
WHOA, WHOA, WHAT IS THAT THERE, 
FREDDY KRUEGER?                 

437
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,760
  THAT'S MY FORK,               
  IT'S AN EXTENSION OF MY HAND. 

438
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:12,296
          THEN WE DRAIN THE OIL 
          OFF THE CHICKEN,      

439
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:14,565
             CONTINUE MOTION OF 
             WASHING THE PAN.   

440
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:17,168
I HAVE A NEW RESPECT            
FOR THE BARBECUE FORK.          

441
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,703
    FLOUR ON TOP OF THE CHICKEN 
    SO IT WON'T BROWN.          

442
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,706
            SHAKING AS YOU POUR 
            THE WINE IN.        

443
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,574
      NOW WE ADD CHICKEN BROTH. 

444
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,242
IT'S STARTING TO REDUCE,        
STARTING TO TIGHTEN UP.         

445
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,645
         BLACK PEPPER, PARSLEY, 
         BUTTER,                

446
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,514
      CAPERS, VERY LITTLE SALT. 

447
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:32,116
     FRESH SQUEEZED HALF LEMON, 
     RIND DOWN.                 

448
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,485
SEEDS AND ALL?                  
                 SEEDS AND ALL. 

449
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,654
THAT'S LIKE A PICCATA CROUTON.  

450
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,523
          USE THE LEMON,        
          THE LEMON'S IN THERE. 

451
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,126
        YOU WANT A THICK SAUCE. 

452
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:44,729
      YOU SHOULD TASTE THE WINE 
     A LITTLE STRONG RIGHT NOW. 
IT IS.                          

453
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,397
IT'LL COME DOWN.                

454
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,132
IT'S OVERPOWERING WITH          
THE LEMON?                      

455
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,267
        DO YOU LIKE YOUR LEMON? 
GET A LOAD OF THIS GUY.         

456
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:53,737
       OR DO YOU TAKE THE LEMON 
          OUT OF YOUR ICED TEA? 
HE DOES NOT STOP TALKING.       

457
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:56,207
 YOU SAID I HAD TOO MUCH LEMON. 
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.              

458
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,609
I MEAN, I'M GETTING MY VITAMIN C
INTAKE FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.

459
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,144
            THIS GOES LIKE THIS 
            FOR OUR GARNISH.    

460
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,013
OH, MORE LEMON!                 

461
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,281
               AND THERE IT IS. 

462
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,550
MMM, THE CHICKEN REALLY         
TOOK THAT SAUCE UP NICE.        

463
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,419
IT'S SUPER TENDER,              
RIGHT AMOUNT OF CAPERS.         

464
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,755
A LITTLE LEMONY.                
      I TOLD YOU IT WAS LEMONY. 

465
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,624
      IT'S AWESOME, DUDE.       

466
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,960
      THE TASTE IS OUTSTANDING, 
      VERY GOOD.                

467
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:18,296
  I'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING HERE  
  I DIDN'T LIKE.                

468
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,164

THESE ARE KINDA LIKE THE SHOW.  

489

THAT MANY CLAMS WITH SHELLS,    

491
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,955
YOU'D HAVE A WHOLE              
STEAMER BASKET.                 

492
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,624
    NOW WE ADD SOME WHITE WINE, 
    HALF AND HALF,              

493
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,494
        AND WE ADD SOME BUTTER. 
IT'S BETTER WITH BUTTER.        

494
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,763
PEPPER, BASIL.                  

495
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,731
WE LET THIS BAD BOY REDUCE.     

496
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,934
A GREAT TECHNIQUE ON THE CLAMS, 
BEFORE IT'S COOKED,             

497
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,036
YOU TAP IT ON THE SHELL,        
IT SHOULD CLOSE UP A LITTLE BIT.

498
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,038
'CAUSE IT'S STILL ALIVE.        
            RIGHT, THAT'S TRUE. 

499
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,974
    BUT THEN WHEN YOU DO COOK   
    THE CLAMS, IF THE CLAM SHELL
    DOESN'T OPEN UP,            

500
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:39,510
         WELL, THEN YOU PROBABLY
         SHOULDN'T EAT THAT ONE.

501
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,578
       AND THEY'RE POPPING OPEN 
       AS WE SPEAK.

TAKE A LOOK AT ME!              

503
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,449
                THEY'RE ON CUE. 

504
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,317
            SO I PUT THE PASTA. 

505
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,453
PRE-COOKED,                     
SHOCKED IN COLD WATER?          
                         RIGHT. 

506
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:51,922
GET ALL THAT WATER OUT,         
WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE CLAM SOUP.

507
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:54,124
WE'RE MAKING LINGUINI WITH      
CLAMS.                          

508
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,793
      CLAMS GO AROUND THE PLATE 
      FOR DECORATION.           

509
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,930
        OUR SAUCE RIGHT ON TOP. 

510
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,265
        PARMESAN CHEESE,        
        A LITTLE PARSLEY ON IT. 

511
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:05,403
     LOOK AT THE RATIO OF CLAMS 
     TO PASTA.                  

512
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:08,472
      NICE, GOOD SEAFOOD FLAVOR 
      AND THE CLAMS ARE TENDER. 

513
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:13,010
          I WILL FOR SURE STEAL 
                   THAT RECIPE. 
YOU CAN HAVE IT.                

514
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,878
I CAN MAKE SOME HAPPY PEOPLE    
WITH THIS.                      

515
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:17,148
SHOVEL THAT IN MY POCKET.       

516
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,618
A LOT OF FRESH BASIL,           
HEAVY CREAM, BUTTER,            
JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT.         

517
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,187
SOME OF THE BEST LINGUINI CLAMS,
I'M TELLIN' YA.                 

518
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,223
I LOVE IT, I NEVER LEAVE HUNGRY.

519
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,091
       ROCCO'S IS AWESOME.      

520
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,093
       IT'S WONDERFUL,          
       GREAT PLACE TO GO.       

521

  YOU'RE GONNA COME HERE TO EAT 
  AND EAT GOOD.                 

523
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,834
THE WORLD NEEDS TO TRY THIS,    
IT'S REALLY GOOD.               
   THE WORLD NEEDS TO TRY THIS? 

524
