         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:05,604
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

3
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:07,139
          This trip...          

4
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:09,007
 Like I was getting ready to fly
      "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,543
        we're hanging out       
   in South Beach, Florida...   

6
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:12,677
     Fantastic.                 

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,481
        ...taking a bite        
 of their cosmopolitan cuisine. 

8
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:17,282
         I'm really telling you,
               it's dynamite.   

9
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,818
             First,             
     a real-deal taqueria...    

10
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,286
                 This is not    
              your first rodeo. 

11
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:23,088
       ...getting way back      
         to the basics.         

12
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,890
               I've made a lot  
         of tortillas in my day.

13
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,491
         I have never seen this.

14
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,960
        Then an authentic       
       German beer hall...      

15
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,896
Will you be dressing in         
any type of lederhosen?         

16
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:32,231
   ...cooking up the classics.  

17
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:34,366
  This will not be              
the last time you see me.       

18
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,900
  Plus, Mediterranean flavor... 

19
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:38,237
There's a lot going on          
for one paella dish.            

20
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,505
          ...served up          
       at a hidden oasis.       

21
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,374
I don't want to hear it,        
but I'm almost speechless.      

22
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,778
     That's all right here,     
    right now, on "Triple D."

25
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,530
           I head down          
     to South Beach, Miami,     

26
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,732
 for one of the most outrageous,
      over-the-top events.

30

   well, you got to check out.  

32
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:18,410
 But just like any of my trips, 
  I'm saying, "Where do I eat?  

33
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:19,677

    the nixtamal,               

60
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:16,134

   to making masa.              

61
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,804
This is organic non-GMO         
blue corn from Mexico.          

62
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,339
                    Okay,       
        so let's get after this.

63
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,141
  Pickle and lime.              
       Water.                   

64
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,143

the pH a little bit.            

65
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,145
              Just so the skins 
               will come off?   

66
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:27,346
        Yeah.                   

67
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:29,681
        I've only seen one place
    in the history of "Triple D"

68
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:32,817
 that has made the nixtamal like
    this to make their own masa,

69
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,087
     and that was in, believe it
          or not, New York City.

70
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,822
              All right, so now 
    we let this go for how long?

71
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,424
Five minutes, super quick.      

72
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,026
Then it soaks overnight.        

73
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,896
           All right, so this is
               all of the corn  

74
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:45,363
               after the skin   
              has been removed. 

75
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,165
    Yeah.                       
                   Let's hit it.

76
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,901
 Like I was getting ready to fly
      "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."

77
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,836
I just want water to start      
flowing through the stones.     

78
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,572
             Oh, there literally
                 are stones!    

79
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:55,040
                Look at that.   

80
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:56,641
               That's real deal.
   Yeah.                        

81
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:57,843
                Now we gonna    
               make tortillas?  

82
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,177
     Yep.                       
                     <i> Andale.</i>   

83
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,179
              So, there we have 
                  the masa.     

84
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,647
              This is the right 
               moisture level?  

85
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:03,782
   You just want,               
  like, a Play-Doh.             

86
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:04,983
                    Okay.       
                  Drop it.      

87
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,319
So, we do about 100 grams.      

88
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,922
With all this moisture,         
   the fresh masa,              

89
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,724
 it's gonna puff up             
 with all the steam,            

90
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,526
  so it's gonna get             
a thin, crispy outside          

91
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:18,130
and the inside is gonna be      
fluffy, creamy, awesome texture.

92
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,064
                I'm with it.    

93
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,599
 Let's throw it into            
     the fryer.                 

94
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,066
                  Oh, we're     
             ripping off chunks?

95
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,803
 Hand torn.                     
                Hand torn chips.

96
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:29,107
             So, a lot heartier,
             a lot more magical 

97
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,743
than the regular chips and salsa
        that people are used to.

98
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,012
  Yeah, these are,              
like, really hearty.            

99
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:40,752
               That's so good.  

100
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,353
                    Outrageous. 
      Yeah.                     

101
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,822
                It's a cross    
           between the warm masa

102
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,490
        that you get in a 'male.

103
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,292
       Then you get a little bit
               of the crunch,   

104
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,293
             little bit of salt.

105
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,828
               You definitely   
             taste all the corn.

106
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,030
                  You make      
            the guacamole fresh.

107
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,566
            It's dynamite, dude.

108
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,835
         I'm really telling you,
               it's dynamite.   

109
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,436
                    Amen.       

110
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,305
    Totopos, guac and salsa.    

111
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,175
 You could eat your body weight 
   in those chips right there.  

112
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:04,443
   They're hot, they're soft.   

113
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:06,110
      It's full of flavor.      

114
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,180
        For me, Taquiza's       
      in the perfect spot.      

115
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,581
  Seconds away from the beach.  

116
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,850
  So, you're kind of right here 
  in the middle of everything.  

117
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,785
      People watching here      
          is wonderful.         

118
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,186
 MAN: You know, it's quick eats.

119
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,855
       I wouldn't miss it       
     if you're here in town.    

120
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:17,856
            So, here's the deal.

121
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,458
                I want to try   
          the grasshopper tacos.

122
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,725
            I can't even believe
              I just said that. 

123
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:21,859
               But I got to go  
               check on my car  

124
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,195
             'cause it's parked 
        right next door to where

125
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:24,730
          they rent the Ferraris
            and the Lamborghinis

126
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:25,864
            here in South Beach.

127
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,265
         So to make sure        
  that they didn't rent my car, 

128
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,600
               would you maybe  
           get everything ready?

129
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,001
               We'll be back.   
             Don't go anywhere, 

130
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,803
       'cause of course you want
    to see me eat a grasshopper.

131
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,705
          I'll see you a minute.
  I'll see you later.           

132
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,479
                     ♪♪         

133
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,215
       Welcome back. Here we are
          in South Beach, Miami,

134
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,483
       for the Food & Wine Fest.

135
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,953
   I'm hanging out with my buddy
              Steve at Taquiza. 

136
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,220
              I asked everybody 
                to come back    

137
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,690
           because I'm gonna eat
             a grasshopper taco.

138
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,157
                Don't worry.    
            It's not that scary.

139
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,226
                And what else   
             are we gonna make? 

140
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:55,427
    Carne asada.                

141
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:58,029
          Oh, really? You had to
          drop the whole accent?

142
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,964
   I'm from here.               
  This is my home.              

143
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,233
         The carne asada        
       taco is fantastic.       

144
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,836
     It's spicy, it's rich.     

145
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:05,971
             All right, hit it. 

146
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,639
Chile de árbol.                 
            You hear the accent?

147
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,707
  Black peppercorn.             

148
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,108
Some Mexican oregano.           

149
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,311
    Here is some                
naked pasilla chiles.           

150
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,512
Garlic cloves in there.         

151
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,314
    White onion.                

152
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,649
    Kosher salt.                

153
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,318
Little oil just to kind of      
get a nice texture going.       

154
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,786
  Fresh lime juice.             
     Fresh O.J.                 

155
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:22,987
       You just took this Cuban.

156
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,288
  This is my home.              

157
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,524
               No, I got you.   
 I know exactly where you're at.

158
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,259
 And what are we gonna marinate?
             What kind of meat? 

159
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,327
  Hanger steak.                 
                       Really?  

160
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,530
        Yeah.                   
Half an onion in the bag.       

161
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,533
And now we just pour            
the marinade right on top.      

162
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,067
Vacuum it overnight.            

163
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,002
           It really pushes that
         marinade into the meat.

164
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,138
  Yeah. Everything              
 gets vacuum sealed.            

165
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,539
                You nerdified   
                a taco stand.   

166
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,475
  Oh, if I have to.             

167
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:46,010
      Oh, there goes your little
  chefy, geeky part right there,

168
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,612
          you and your tweezers.

169
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:50,949
     Love them.                 
Marinated carne asada.          

170
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,751
                I made a lot    
         of tortillas in my day.

171
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,419
         I have never seen this.

172
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:57,022
So, we just kind of get it,     
    form in here,               

173
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,289
and we just crank it off.       

174
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,825
      So, see?                  

175
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,094
                Look at that.   
   This is not your first rodeo.

176
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,997
Here's our nice, little,        
charred hanger steak.           

177
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,634
Just a little greenery.         

178
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,771
All our tacos come with         
just tortilla and the protein,  

179
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,172
and then they can do            
 whatever they want.            

180
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,974
They add their onions,          
cilantro, lime, radish.         

181
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,110
We have two hot sauces          
   made in house.               

182
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,314
That's a charred cherry pepper, 
and that's a charred jalapeño.  

183
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:30,054
          The first thing you're
       getting is that tortilla.

184
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:34,125
              The hanger steak  
               is ridiculous.   

185
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,460
             Especially going on
               to blanch that,  

186
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,661
                you're going    
              on that flat-top, 

187
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:37,929
             really gets a nice,
           little texture to it.

188
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,263
              You get a little  
               caramelization.  

189
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,999
  Yeah, yep.                    
                 The marinade --

190
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,400
       the sour orange in there.

191
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,002
   Yeah.                        
               Salsa's dynamite.

192
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,606
             Mmm. Nice acidity, 
                nice balance.   

193
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,674
           This is spot on, man.

194
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:52,477
              This is a really  
               dynamite taco.   

195
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,678
                    Mmm.        

196
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,149
        They really nail        
     the meat to masa ratio.    

197
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:59,684
    I've never had a tortilla   
   like this ever in my life.   

198
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:03,087
Right now you're getting some   
"Triple D" royalty, all right?  

199
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,424
The guy that takes all of       
the blah, blah, blah            

200
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:08,159
that I do on the show           
and makes it turn into magic -- 

201
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,561
this is our editor, Jamie.      

202
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:12,831
This is where you'll dub        
in a bunch of clapping, okay?   

203
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,366
So, give me a breakdown.        
Tell me about the carne asada.  

204
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,503
 It's got some, like, brightness
     to it, tender, really good.

205
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,973
            Let's finish this up
         with some grasshoppers.

206
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,775
 They're nutty, they're crunchy.

207
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,977
        -Two chapulines.        
         -It's amazing.         

208
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:26,911
              Well, hop to it.  

209
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,513
      SANTANA:                  
These are from Oaxaca.          

210
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,715
Just kind of give them          
a little extra toast.           

211
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,250
                Okay, so now    
          we mix in the peppers.

212
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,718
Some oils from the chiles       
 are gonna come out,            

213
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,386
so we just give them            
a little more depth to it.      

214
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,855
           How long are we gonna
             toast them up for? 

215
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,256
 Like 10 minutes.               
                     10 minutes.

216
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:39,257
  250, real quick.              

217
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,859
               And this is all  
             it is in the taco? 

218
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,126
        Yes.                    

219
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,594
             So, basically we're
           putting the guac down

220
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,062
       just so we have something
          for the little hoppers

221
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,331
                to stick to.    
    Yeah.                       

222
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,132
Every time we make an order,    
we just kind of toast them      

223
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,667
a little bit more, just         
warm a little through.          

224
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,403
                 Wake them up?  
    Yeah.                       

225
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:54,138
And then there's one of my      
favorite misused ingredients -- 

226
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,208
Tajín -- so it's like           
a chile lime seasoning.         

227
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,810
It's made for fruit.            

228
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,746
        So, I can feel that I'll
      run faster, jump higher...

299
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,105

00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,573
                black pepper,

00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,042
           paprika, a little bit
              of sugar, nutmeg. 

302
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,244
    Mix that up.                

303
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:47,779
    Rub that on.                

304
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,048
     I will sear it on the grill
              on the flat-top.  

305
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,050
               And also I sear  
               the vegetables.  

306
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,185
So, once it's seared,           
it'll go back in the pan        

307
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,986
with the braising liquid?       

308
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,121
Braise the whole thing off.     

309
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,656
     For three-and-a-half hours.
 At what temp?

  All right.                    

316
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,667
       Then I have melted butter
                and hot milk.   

317
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,936
       This is                  
pretzel bread pudding.          

318
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:14,572
             I sauté with bacon 
          and onions to the mix.

319

Lots of deliciousness           
    right there.                

320
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:19,610

        the salt, ground nutmeg.

321
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:20,878
               Then toss them.  

322
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,081
             This has to set for
   10, 15 minutes in the fridge.

323
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,815
     All right,                 
so this is cooled down.         

324
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,217
Now we add the eggs.            

325
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,352
                Chopped parsley.

  some holes in it.             

336
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:49,507
                It has to get

337
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,574

338
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,177

             Just let it simmer.

339
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,779
Then we bring it out,           
unwrap it, and then slice it.   

340
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,381
               Then I sear it.  
 You sear it in butter.         

341
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,582
           In butter, of course.

342
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:58,650
     Fantastic.                 

343
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,385
                    Okay.       
         Here's the sauerbraten.

344
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,653
              Nice color, huh?  

345
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:03,721
 Look at that, huh?             

346
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,456
                  Let's see     
              how tender it is. 

347
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,325
              Some red cabbage  
               and then meat.   

348
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,460
          And a little of gravy.

349
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,262
And this is the drippings       
   out of the pan?              

350
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:14,332
      Absolutely. And then I add
             a pretzel dumpling.

351
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,867
                 Good to go.    

352
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,002
        Mmm.                    

353
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:21,706
I pick up the allspice          
and the crushed juniper.        

354
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,676
The gravy comes through         
 right off the bat.             

355
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:26,677
  You want to drink             
  a bucket of that.             

356
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,347
The pretzel dumpling            
 is just ridiculous.            

357
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,414
  I love pretzels.              

358
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,683
 You get that nice,             
    little flavor               

359
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,751
of that coming through.         

360
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,286
And then you get a little bit   
   of the cabbage.              

361
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,821
Refreshes the palate.           

362
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:37,755
        Mmm.                    

363
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,090
 Nicely done, buddy.            
    Nicely done.                

364
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,291
                      Thank you.
It's really good.               

365
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,492
    Really good.                

366
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,961
           Sauerbraten          
     with napkin dumplings.     

367
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:47,164
          So delicious.         
   Just a harmony of flavors.   

368
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,767
  Napkin dumplings are unique.  

369
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,902
    They're a little crispy,    
  but yet they're soft inside.  

370

371
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,972

 the window, please! Pick it up!

373
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,508
    Currywurst is very good.    

374
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,444
       Little more lively       
     than regular bratwurst.    

375
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,913
        So, for our curry sauce,

376
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:04,849
              I need oil, a lot 
      of onions, garlic, ginger.

377
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:06,050
             Our curry blend in.

378
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,318

   Ketchup.                     

379
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,452
     That's what                
   I was thinking.              

380
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,720
               Diced tomatoes.  

381
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:10,922
         A good amount of honey.

382
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,190
           And now we fill it up
                 with water.    

383
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,524
How long is this gonna          
  cook down, Chef?              

384
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,725
                 25 minutes.    

385
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,661
All right, so you hit           
the immersion blender in here   

386
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:17,728
to break it all down.           

387
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,465
            Score the bratwurst,
                curry sauce.

       More of                  
the currywurst powder.          

389
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,435
                    Yes.        

390
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,406
Mmm. That's a really            
    good sausage.               

391
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:31,142
 The gravy's great.             

392
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,877
It's deep, a unique flavor.     

393

There's nothing you're

455
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,464
                 White wine.    
       Let the alcohol burn off.

456
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,933
                And then add    
            our calasparra rice.

457
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,003
           We're gonna partially
   cook it for about 10 minutes.

458
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,738
So you make the paella          
to order every time.            

459
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,605
                 Every time.    

460
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,607
                 Olive oil.     

461
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,408
                  Shallots.     
                  Pancetta.     

462
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,877
                   Garlic.      

463
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,678
                  Chorizo.      
            Roasted red peppers.

464
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,079
               We're gonna add  
              plenty of clams.  

465
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,547
              They're gonna be  
             opening up slowly. 

466
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,216
  Got it.                       
             Add our white wine.

467
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,284
             It's gonna burn off
              all that alcohol. 

468
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,420
There's a lot going on          
for one paella dish.            

469
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,222
            Next, chicken stock.

470
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:01,158
              Our saffron rice, 
      which is partially cooked.

471
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,894
              Shrimp, mussels,  
               and, of course,  

472
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,630
         you know the last thing
    you want to add -- Calamari.

473
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:06,831
              So it doesn't get 
               chewy and dry.   

474
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,366
                   Butter.      
     Okay.                      

475
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,568
            The mussel have time
                 to open up.    

476
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,702
      And then?                 

477
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,237
    A little bit of lemon juice.
                 That's it.     

478
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,538
                   Plate it up. 
  Here we go.                   

479
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,707
    We're gonna build a fortress
       of mussels all around it.

480
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:17,842
 A mussel fortress.             

481
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:20,378
               Finish spooning  
                it up on top.   

482
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,981
               Celery micros,   
               and that's it.   

483
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,650
Doesn't look hot to me.         

484
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,719
I'll tell you what, buddy.      

485
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:29,920
That's real deal paella.        

486
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,255
                 Thank you.     

487
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:32,189
        Mmm.                    

488
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,858
Nice, big saffron flavor.       

489
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,728
The chorizo is spot on.         

490
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,996
 Your seafood depth,            
all that shell stock            

491
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,065
   from the clams               
and from the mussels            

492
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,267
really, really opens up         
   the big flavor.              

493
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:48,072
 If you like paella,            
you don't have to go to Spain.  

494
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,474
  Right next door.              

495
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,675
      -Paella for you, sir.     
      -Oh, it's beautiful.      

496
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,410
     You almost want to look    
    at it for a little while    

497
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,612
       before you dig in.       

498
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,281
    Everything comes together   
   to an explosion of flavor.   

499
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:58,483
    I'm in Miami.               

500
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,684
Of course I've got to have      
Carl the Cuban down here.       

501
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,819
He's been on "Triple D."        

502
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:02,954
He's won "Triple G."            

503
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,354
 What do you think?             
     Real deal?                 

504
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,625
     If this restaurant was next
to mine, I'd move my restaurant.

505
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,961
            Scallops.           

506
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:12,296
It's actually one of my favorite
      places to walk into.      

507
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:14,031
   MAN: You can really pass by  
         but not see it.        

508
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,366
   But once you come in here,   

509
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,101
  you feel like you're actually 
      in a different world.     

510
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,237
So you eat outside all the time,
the whole year round?           

511
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,772
                  RAMIREZ:      
            For eight years now.

512
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,372
            Order up!           
            Vongola.            

513
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,310
 It's a linguine based clam dish
    that's out of this world.   

514
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:27,311
What are we up to now?          

515
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,047
              We're gonna make  
          linguine from scratch.

516
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,448
   You don't have               
a dining room, okay?            

517
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,516
 People sit outside             
     by a pool,                 

518
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,785
but you're gonna make the pasta 
in this tiny, little kitchen.   

519
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:35,786
              Yeah, every day.  

520
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:36,921
  So, Caputo flour.             

521
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:38,322
                      Semolina. 
      Okay.                     

522
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,390
                Hook this up    
               to the blender.  

523
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,727
             And we're gonna add
            our eggs one by one.

524
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,794
        Okay.                   

525
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,530
            Then dust the table,
         and we're gonna roll it

526
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,765
                until you get   
           a doughy consistency.

527
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:49,667
                There you go.   

528
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,802
    Let it rest,                
   portion it off.              

529
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,203
      We're gonna hand-crank it,

530
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,605
            and then we're gonna
               cut it by hand.  

531
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,940
 Beautiful linguine             
      in house.                 

532
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,476
The fact you made it yourself --
      I mean...                 

533
00:17:58,478 --> 00:17:59,877
                There you go.   

534
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,812
     We're gonna start by adding
           olive oil to our pot.

535
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,014
                  Shallots.     

536
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:04,348
                Fresh garlic.   

537
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,016
                  Bay leaf.     

538
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,418
        Add a little pinch of...

539
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,619
    Chile flake.                

540
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:12,623
              We glaze the pan  
           with oil, white wine.

541
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,959
               Add our clams.   

542
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,294
        Okay.                   
Little chicken stock.           

543
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:18,362
                   Mm-hmm.      
                Pasta's down.   

544
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,030
           Clams are opening up.

545
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,566
        And then we're gonna add
     more pasta to our stockpot.

546
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:25,636
So that pasta will absorb       
all of that great flavor.       

547
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:26,703
It'll finish cooking            
   in that broth.               

548
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:27,905
   Got it.                      
                That is correct.

549
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:30,440
           Add some heavy cream,
       butter to finish cooking.

550
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,310
    Okay.                       
         A little bit of pepper.

551
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,979
             All right. Little, 
    tiny squeeze of lemon juice.

552
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:37,915
     Beautiful clams, little bit
              of sauce, micros. 

553
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,684
                   Voilà.       

554
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,789
The pasta's al dente,           
 really nicely done.            

555
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,023
Finishing it in the sauce       

556
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,925
  to let it absorb              
those great flavors.            

557
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,660
  It's outstanding.             

558
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,996
 Everything you do,             
    you do right.               

559
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,597
I mean, I'm -- I'm --           

560
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,866
And I don't want to hear it,    
but I'm almost speechless.      

561
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,802
                [ Chuckles ]    

562
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,270
   I said I don't               
  want to hear it.              

563
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:03,073
         Spicy linguine.        
      It's just incredible.     

564
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:03,941
Break it down for me.           

565
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,143
              It's just simple. 

566
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,710
             Everyone overthinks
                 this dish.     

567
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,012
         They do too much to it.

568
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:09,413
               The best thing   
                about this is   

569
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,615
            he had the restraint
               of a real chef.  

570
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,484
       Strong Bow Chicken.      

571
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,619
  It's a wonderful oasis here.  
          It really is.         

572
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,754
   You're a funky,              
    little joint                

573
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,290
     tucked away                
under an unassuming name,       

574
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:20,757
  and you're doing              
   rockstar food.               

575
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,326
               Thank you, sir.  

576
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,963
     FIERI: Think that's all    
     the South Beach we got?    

577
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:28,432
            Not yet.            
   There's just one more spot.  

578
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:29,834
  How are you, brother?         
                 I'm doing good.

579
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,703
  This is kind of an official,  
   unofficial "Triple D" spot   

580
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,371
    because I've been coming    
     to this place forever.     

581
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,840
        This is a walk-up       
       cool place to hang,      

582
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,375
  and the sandwiches are legit. 

583
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,643
  I'm talking real deal legit.  

584
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,778
 So, I think I want to do this. 

585
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,512
  Let's do a Napoli.            
                        Yeah.   

586
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:46,918
 Let's do a Frenchie            
  and a SOBE Club.              

587
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,786
             Okay. And you want 
             everything, right? 

588
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,787
 Do it up.                      
          With the magic sauce? 

589
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,389
With the magic sauce.           
                   You got it.  

590
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,258
So, tell me how this opened.    
Give me the rundown.            

591
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,993
                Before we was   
       living in Thailand and...

592
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:58,195
So you came to Miami            
 to go scuba diving,            

593
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,530
 but you were living            
    in Thailand.                

594
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,932
And you're from France.         
                       Yeah.    

595
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,533
 Oh, yeah. You hear             
that story every day.           

596
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,735
  And South Beach, at that time,
          it was really nothing.

597
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,003
    You were here               
 before it was cool.            

598
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,605
                    Yeah.       
                 Since 1988.    

599
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:10,207
So I mean, you're kind of like  
one of the anchors down here.   

600
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,276
How many sandwiches do you guys 
serve in, let's say,            

601
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:13,344
  a busy Saturday?              

602
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,813
               Sometimes 500,   
           sometimes like 1,000.

603
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,147
So, when you come here,         

604
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,349
you can stand in line,          
you can maybe get a stool.      

605
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,418
   You're probably              
 gonna get it to go.            

606
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,487
    Nice people,                
  great sandwiches.             

607
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:24,956
  I mean, you won't             
  be disappointed.              

608
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,957
  Right? Told you I'd bring you 
         a funky joint.         

609
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:27,825
          Here you go.          

610
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:28,826
              Here you go, Guy. 

611
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,561
                The Frenchie,   
           the SOBE, the Napoli,

612
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,163
            and the magic sauce,
                 my friend.     

613
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:33,831
   Oh, I get a jar              
 of the magic sauce?            

614
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,965
                    Magic sauce.
   You're the best.             

615
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,500
             You take care, man.
 I'll see you, brother.         

616
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:38,202
 Be good.                       
             I'll see you later.

617
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,373
  So, that's it for this trip,  
        but don't worry!        

618
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,108
       There's plenty more      
        "Triple D" joints       

619
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,509
      all over the country!     

620
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:47,177
         I'll be looking        
      for you next week on      

621
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,047
 "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives." 

622
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,049
 I want you to say,             
"It's all right here,           

623
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,785
    right now on                
'Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.'" 

624
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,855
                   Here on      
  "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives."

625
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:00,057
 I like that. I got             
to start speaking more German.
