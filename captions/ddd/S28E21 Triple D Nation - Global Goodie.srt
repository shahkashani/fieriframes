    that I would always serve   
at parties and things like that.

321

    put the garlic in there.    

323
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,527
       I use sharp cheddar      
  and medium cheddar together.  

324
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:39,130

  a little bit of extra flavor. 

325

    And I got the little bit    
        of half-and-half,       

326
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,201

   add to the creaminess here.

      Chili-queso is great.     

332
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,345
  It's cheesy with a little bit 
       of spice in there.       

333
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:57,281
    The cheese kind of helps    
with the spiciness of the chili.

334
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,485
 It's just delicious on chips --
  perfect for watching a game.

 with the onions pressed in it, 

337
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,494
      and then it just gets     
      the chili meat sauce      

338
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,430
     all over the top of it,    
 and then all the extras on it.

      it's full of flavor.      

342
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,907
  FIERI: Now things might move  
    at a snail's pace inside,   

343
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,310
       but outside, that's      
   a totally different story.   

344
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,312
     Since Diners, Drive-Ins    
       and Dives was here,      

345
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:28,779
       massive development      
          has happened.         

346
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,448
 So when they were getting ready
     to build this building     

347
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,850
           next door,           
       they came and tried      

348
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,853
 to have a little deal with us. 

349
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,387
    They walked in all cocky    
            and said,           

350
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,723
  "Hey, do I have enough money  
      to buy you guys out?"     

351
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:41,659
   and my dad basically said,   
           "Beat it."           

352
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,628
         It's been here         
      for four generations.     

353
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,129
     It's really what we do.    

354
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,065
   It's our family's heartbeat  
     is this location here.     

355
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,870
        Triple D has shot

      some of the funkiest,     

357
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,075
      but I gotta tell you      
when it comes to a family story,

358
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:58,676
    when it comes to a story    
        about great food,       

359
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:02,614
 when it comes to a story about 
   carrying on your tradition,  

360
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,149
          I think that          
     this is pretty amazing.    

361
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,353
           Now listen,          
    that is some bomb chili.    

362
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,555
 Now Mike, why haven't you made 
        Phil retire yet?        

363
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:13,624
  And the other question is why 
  can't I get mail-order chili?

             all together here.

433
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,493
            but the green papaya
         stays nice and crunchy.

434
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,827
    And each time               
this is the routine?            

435
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,095
               This is the way  
            we do it every time.

436
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,763
Man, someone's gotta be         
working hard at this job.       

437
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,566
  And then we pound each salad  
        to order and Guy        

438
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,568
      was really impressed      
  that we were making it fresh  

439
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,969
  like that every single time,  

440
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,038
  and we still do to this day.  

441
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,908
         Then you gotta eat this
              with sticky rice. 

442
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,711
My hope was that he was going to
    like it as much as I did,   

443
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:47,778
       and luckily he did.

everybody's playing nice-nice.  
There's no lead guitar in this.

      was about the wings.      

449
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,724
     And there, I had heard     
       about those wings.       

450
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,927
       If I hear one more person
              come and tell me, 

451
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:07,264
"Hey you that Dude from Diner's,
      go get the spicy chicken."

452
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,199
                Why even have   
               anything else?   

453
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,400
            You should just have
               chicken wings.   

454
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,534
   Yeah, you know               
I've thought about it.          

455
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:11,869
 I've thought about             
just gutting the shack          

456
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:14,605
and putting some fryers in there
and just making wings.          

457
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,941

    I think guy was skeptical   
 because we were using just a --

458
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,410
        kind of a dredge        
        for the wings --        

459
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:22,013
      no batter or anything     
      like that -- no wash.     

460
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,481
         I'm not typically a fan
             of a dredged wing, 

461
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,084
             but since it's such
                a fine flour,   

462
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,953
                I'll try it.

             You want it spicy? 

464
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,021
 Ah, throw a little             
     heat on it.

466
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,825
         That's going to give it
 that nice, toasty spice flavor.

467
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,094
             We're going to pull
              those wings out.  

468

            in our fried garlic.

471
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,101

              a touch of water.

474
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,973
