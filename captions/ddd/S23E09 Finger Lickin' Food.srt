1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,133
           Hey, there.          

2
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,601
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:07,072
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,340
          -This trip...         
             -Whoa!             

5
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,342
        ...it's time for        
     a little pick-me-up...     

6
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,476
   That is not for              
 the faint of heart.            

7
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,145
       ...with righteous,       
      finger-licking food.      

8
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:14,546
What are we gonna do            
      with this                 

9
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:16,748
besides just throw it           
    at my mouth?                

10
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,952
      We're talking a crazy     
      Minneapolis mash-up.      

11
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:21,553
               Filipino flair   
             on an English pub. 

12
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,756
 Dishing out the bomb bacon dip.

13
00:00:23,758 --> 00:00:24,823
             That is ridiculous.

14
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,825
    And the big-time bánh mi.   

15
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,093
          That's the hinge point
                of greatness.   

16
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:30,295
         Plus, a classic        
    Cape Cod seafood spot...    

17
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,031
           There's nothing wrong
                 with that.     

18
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,899
      ...where the lobster      
         is cracking...         

19
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,033
 You got that right.            

20
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,434
  ...and the mussels are money. 

21
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,037
         They just kind of start
          melting in your mouth.

22
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,039
  And a funkalicious brew house 
          in Atlanta...         

23
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,241
It's got to be the crown jewel  
    of the area.                

24
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:43,975
  ...re-inventing the corn dog. 

25
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,244
    You even get                
  souvenir sticks.              

26
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:47,779
  And pumping up the pastrami.  

27
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,582
Dude, out of bounds.            

28
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,651
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

29
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:53,852
         on "Triple D."         

30
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,734
 I'm in one of the famous parts 
      of Atlanta, Georgia,      

31
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,136
  known as Little Five Points.  

32
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,472
      I mean, all kinds of      
   great restaurants and bars,  

33
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:14,940
 good place to go and hang out. 

34
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:17,142
  Now, right around the corner  
    from that is Inman Park,    

35
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:19,344
  and that's one of the oldest  
    neighborhoods in the area   

36
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:21,412
   with all these really cool,  
      old, Victorian homes.     

37
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,681
 We're here to check out a joint
     in one of those homes.     

38
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,617
 This is Wrecking Bar Brew Pub. 

39
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,619
        Crispy pig ears.        

40
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,087
     It's definitely unique.    

41
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,757
    It looks like a dungeon,    
    but in a really cool way.   

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,025
       FIERI: Pull up, and I see
            the big old columns.

43
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,228
            I'm, like, "Oh, boy,
         this ain't a Triple D."

44
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,897
             But then you drive 
              around the back,  

45
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,966
        and that's when you come
       down here into Funkytown.

46
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,167
                 Going down     
             in the rabbit hole.

47
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:43,968
             FIERI:             
       And what you find,       

48
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,972
      well, is courtesy of      
Steven Rosslow and his partners,

49
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,308
         who transformed        
    this down-and-out mansion   

50
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,043
    into a brew pub in 2011.    

51
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:52,777
   So, what was it              
  when you got it?              

52
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,846
    -I mean, like, boarded up   
      and the whole thing?      
             -Yeah.             

53
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,514
  You come up with              
   the genius idea              

54
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,917
that you can take the basement  
and the back building           

55
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,919
    -and put a brewery in it.   
          -Perfect fit.         

56
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,788
        About as perfect        
   as putting chef Terry Koval  

57
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,390
    in charge of the kitchen.   

58
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:06,658
 It's not bar food,             
      you know.                 

59
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,793
It's the next level.            

60
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,328
       Beef heart tartare       
         in the window.         

61
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,664
  MAN: Local pork, local beef,  
   local chicken, local fish,   

62
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,466
        even the cornmeal       
        on the corn pups        

63
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,734
 is coming from a local farmer. 

64
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,135
             Corn pups for you. 

65
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,670
       It's really kind of      
    a step above a corn dog.    

66
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:21,406
   Probably one of my favorite  
       items on the menu.       

67
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:22,674
   Really cheesy, super good.   

68
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:25,477
    What do we do               
with this whole hog?            

69
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,880
             KOVAL: We're making
       the cheddarwurst sausage.

70
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:29,281
          Take out the shoulder.

71
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:32,017
    We're gonna break this thing
   down, grind it, and add salt.

72
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,952
                   Pepper.      

73
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,288
                Chili flake,    
              Colman's Mustard, 

74
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,024
                curing salt,    
          Vermont white cheddar.

75
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,225
         -And that's it?        
             -Yeah.             

76
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,761
    All right, we're gonna stuff
             some sausage here. 

77
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:43,562
    Okay, ready?                

78
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:44,463
       All right, let's do this.

79
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:47,833
                Take it off.    

80
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,368
         We're gonna tie it off.

81
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,236
            -Poke it.           
              -Yep.             

82
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,771
      All right, now we're gonna
             torque this thing. 

83
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:53,705
                 Watch out.     

84
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,641
         -Whoa, hey, ho.        
           -[ Laughs ]          

85
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:58,042
               You got to get   
     this thing tight, you know.

86
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,044
    I bet you do.               
Get right after that.           

87
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,447
            We're gonna hang it,
        let it dry for 12 hours.

88
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:03,915
Then we'll go to the smoker.    

89
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,118
 -How long is it in the smoker? 
          -40 minutes.          

90
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,852
  What kind of wood             
  we smoking with?              

91
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,321
        -Oak and hickory.       
             -Okay.             

92
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,056
Now we're gonna slice it.       

93
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,257
              Cut off the ends. 

94
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:15,627
           Take off that casing,
    then slice our little disks.

95
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,199
              -Dip.             
   -And what's in the batter?   

96
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:23,068
  Cornmeal, got some buttermilk,
      a little flour, that's it.

97
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,204
 I can already tell             
these are not going to suck.    

98
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,740
Just a little charcuterie plate 
     with this.                 

99
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:29,942
                    Yeah.       

100
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:32,877
That Vermont cheddar in there,  
   touch of smoke.              

101
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,546
        Mmm!                    
 Get all over that.             

102
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,480
  Let's fry these.              

103
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,952
Great ketchup, French's mustard,
              little kid style. 

104
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,054
  Little kid style.             

105
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,361
   Delicious, man.              

106
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,163
           -Thank you.          
              -Mm.              

107
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,099
     Nice spice,                
right amount of cheese.         

108
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,500
You can taste the pork.         

109
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,102
    I don't think               
I would have ever thought       

110
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:58,570
    curry ketchup               
to go with it, spot on.         

111
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,239
    Look at that.               

112
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:02,040
  And you even get              
  souvenir sticks.              

113
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,174
  Chef, well done.              

114
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,578
The flavoring of the meat inside
      was just phenomenal.      

115
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,081
 Bite into it, it's like cheese 
      that oozes out of it.     

116
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,449
             WOMAN:             
  It's fun to come and eat here 

117
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,052
 because there's no other place 
    like it that I've eaten.    

118
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,588
   20 years ago, this was not   
      a safe neighborhood.      

119
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,855
              MAN:              
    It was a pretty building,   

120
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,457
      but obviously, like,      
     had fencing around it,     

121
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,391
       had graffiti on it.      

122
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,127
             WOMAN:             
    I love that they came in,   

123
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,229
    and they brought it back    
          to its glory.         

124
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,401
Down here at the pub,           
they scratch make everything.   

125
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:30,869
      Well, that's the best part
                 about here.    

126
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,471
            They make           
  all their pastrami in house.  

127
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:33,271
     They cure it all here.     

128
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,140
      Pastrami and a slaw.      

129
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:37,142
   Call my mommy.               
It's time for pastrami.         

130
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,877
      So, we're gonna do a brine
              for our pastrami. 

131
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,946
Okay, we're gonna go            
      water in.                 

132
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,014
                   Sugar.       

133
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:43,281
             -Salt.             
             -Okay.             

134
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,482
                   Garlic.      

135
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,950
                   We got       
        our pickling spice here.

136
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,219
  This is the house             
   pickling spice.              

137
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:48,353
                    Yeah.       

138
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,621
And last but not least...       

139
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,022
               Pink salt here.  

140
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,358
Brings out that nice ruby-red   
color that we like. Okay.       

141
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,226
         Dissolve all this sugar
             and all this salt. 

142
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,628
And then drop the brisket.      

143
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,295
        Word.                   

144
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,163
 Mixture is cooled.             

145
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,498
 It looks like tea.             

146
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,032
    Look at that.               

147
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,100
How long we gonna brine it?     

148
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,134
           -Four days.          
             -Okay.             

149
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,769
                 All right,     
         so we got our rub here.

150
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,271
        We got ground coriander,
some fresh cracked black pepper.

151
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:09,241
Nice Vanna White pour,          
     by the way.                

152
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:10,375
             Lovely brown sugar.

153
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,243
   You see the way              
he popped and posed?            

154
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,111
             Granulated garlic. 

155
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:14,245
Make it rain up in here.        

156
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,480
                    Whew.       

157

     [ Laughs ]                 

158
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,582
              Granulated onion. 

159
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,851
        Got some smoked paprika.
                Dry mustard.    

160
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:22,454
                 And we got     
           a little kosher salt.

161
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,589
                Mix this up.    

162
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,192
It's like you're looking        
for a ring or something.        

163
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,327
Nothing in there, son.          

164
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,128
     -All right, we're good.    
             -Okay.             

165
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,329
             So, we're gonna rub
             these things down. 

166
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,831
                There we go,    
      let's dry that thing down.

167
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,765
             All right, perfect.

168
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,000
  Now, are we gonna             
    let this sit                

169
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,002
  with the dry rub              
  for a little bit,             

170
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,203
or is it just gonna go          
right to the smoker?            

171
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,337
             It's gonna go right
               in the smoker.   

172
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,005
   -Hickory and oak, 11 hours.  
              -Yep.             

173
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,574
225, then I eat it all.         

174
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,610
Now we're getting into this.    

175
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:46,878
      Oh, that                  
doesn't look terrible.          

176
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,080
                 Slice away.

00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,082
         Oh!                    

178
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,753
The pastrami bark on that       
  is out of bounds.             

179
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,288
What are we gonna do            
      with this                 

180
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,889
besides just throw it           
    at my mouth?                

181
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,157

182
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,825
Mmm, right amount of smoke.     

183
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,428
I mean, that is legit.          

184
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,963
            So, we're gonna make
          our pastrami sandwich.

185
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,232
     We got our marble rye down,
              some baby Swiss.  

186
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,033
                 Baby it up.    

187
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,170
          Melt the cheese, steam
     this pastrami a little bit.

188
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:12,971
               Cheese is good.  

189
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:13,972
      You sure?                 

190
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,974
                Yeah, add our   
            baby collard kimchi.

191
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,009
      And we got our chili mayo.

192
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,023
   Fantastic, man.              

193
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,594
   That is not for              
 the faint of heart.            

194
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,195
Everybody's playing nice        
  with each other,              

195
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,264
and then all of a sudden,       
someone invited the kimchi.     

196
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,132
It's kicking and screaming      
inside that sandwich right now.

    to hold onto

              of that pastrami.

       and very different.

         -Awesome place.

         An English pub         
      with killer grub....

    in southwest Minneapolis    

220
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,151
      on a beautiful, sunny     
         Minnesota day.         

221
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,287
 So, when I say the name to you,
         Green Mesquite,        

222
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,155
     what kind of restaurant    
        you thinking of?        

223
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,757
       Exactly, barbecue.

225
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:43,528
    I say Zydeco, you think,    
      it's got to be Cajun.     

226
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,697
  So, what do you call a joint  
     that is an English pub     

227
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,432
  with a little Filipino flair?

Got a merry salad in the window.

230
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,043
 Something different and unique,

231
00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:00,178
        yet down to earth       
    and in the neighborhood.

00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,649
     This is like the Cheers    
      of south Minneapolis.     

234
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,051
     Got an Asian hangover.     

235
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,785
               Filipino flair   
             on an English pub. 

236
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,454
             -Yeah.             
 -Something you hear every day. 

237
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,856
             FIERI:             
    Every day here since 2011   

238
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,326
   when this joint was opened   
    by the Navarro family --    

239
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,394
     Fred, Stacy, and Paco.     

240
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:17,596
                  They say,     
    "What kind of food is that?"

241
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:18,463
             And you say it's...

242
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,198
Well, it is home cooking,       
    pretty much.                

243
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,933
The kind of cooking that happens

244
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:26,604
when fans of British culture mix
 it up with old family recipes. 

245
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,339
            My family           
       is from Minnesota.       

246
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,741
 -Heritage is French and Irish. 
             -Okay.             

247
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,410
And both my parents were born   
and raised in the Philippines.  

248
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:33,811
   Got a curry in the window.   

249
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,079
     It's not just bar food.    

250
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,215
        It's dinner food.       
        It's brunch food.       

251
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:38,750
Delicious food, that's for sure.

252
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:39,951
What's your favorite thing      
    on the menu?                

253
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,886
         The bacon dip.         

254
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,355
              Bacon onion dip.  

255
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:47,025
It's one of those dishes you can
  have as a starter or a meal.  

256
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,960
  All right, so let's talk about
              this first dish.  

257
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,227
So, we'll make onion jam        

258
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,030
  which is gonna go             
into the bacon and onion dip.   

259
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,765
 A little house oil             
     in the pan.                

260
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,967
It's a blend of corn oil        
   and olive oil.               

261
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,835
 And then we add in             
   sliced onions.               

262
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:58,770
              Sweat these down? 

263
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,438
Yep, till they get nice         
      and soft.                 

264
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,240
A little sprinkle of salt.      

265
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,241
We're gonna sprinkle them over  
with some brown sugar.          

266
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,044
           Does anybody tell you
                that you have   

267
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,512
 the voice and the calm demeanor
           of Barefoot Contessa?

268
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,582
           -[ Laughs ]          
           -"The next,          
     I'll be adding the..."     

269
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,651
Little balsamic vinegar.        

270
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,452
 And let me give it             
a little bit of water.          

271
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:16,321
We let it simmer for            
about 30 to 40 minutes          

272
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:17,855
until all the moisture          
    is absorbed.                

273
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,324
             -Okay.             
  -And then we cool them down.  

274
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:22,126
       So, we've got the cooled,
             caramelized onions.

275
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,194
             Where's the bacon? 

276
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,862
     Sorry, man.                
  Bacon is coming.              

277
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,665
    So, we start                
 with cream cheese.             

278
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:29,333
We're gonna whip this           
until it's nice and fluffy.     

279
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,936
We're gonna add our mayonnaise, 
our Worcestershire sauce,       

280
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,471
 a little salt, cayenne pepper, 

281
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,607
Colman's dry mustard,           
  Parmesan cheese.              

282
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:36,675
                  And then      
         the caramelized onions?

283
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:37,876
      And then                  
the caramelized onions.         

284
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,143
      When is the bacon gonna be
              coming into this? 

285
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,011
             -Sorry.            
       -I'm calling Paco.       

286
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,680
                   I want       
        to talk to my union rep.

287
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:42,880
  You want to talk              
   to the emperor?              

288
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:43,815
              Let this mix up.  

289
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,417
                 And this is    
            a big-time favorite?

290
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,151
 Big-time favorite.             

291
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:47,285
So, we're gonna scoop it.       

292
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,889
Top it off with Parmesan cheese,
and we're gonna put --          

293
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,424
Wait, we're gonna put           
    bacon on it.                

294
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,094
         Cooked, cold bacon goes
             on top in the oven.

295
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,363
We're gonna bake it at 350      
for about 5 minutes.            

296
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:04,369
     This thing is coming out to
  the table el smoldering hotto.

297
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,437
And we're gonna finish it off   
  with some chives.             

298
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,274
                Ooh, this is    
           like cheddar dippish.

299
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,711
             That is ridiculous.

300
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,212
               You know what?   
         This should be illegal.

301
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,582
            It's not just onions
                 and bacon.     

302
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:18,849
        There's much more depth.

303
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,986
    I think you know what really
       makes it is that mustard.

304
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:23,054
          A little tang of that,
          it's better than good.

305
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,789
      -Excellent, nice job.     
        -Cool. Thank you.       

306
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,791
              Bacon onion dip.  

307
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:30,594
              GIRL:             
   You got the creamy cheese,   
       the crunchy bacon.       

308
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,997
 You can't make it exactly like 
 you can at George & the Dragon.

309
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,666
      -Meet your new host.      
           -[ Laughs ]          

310
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:35,933
     Got a bacon onion dip.     

311
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,535
    It's one of those things    
   that keeps you coming back.  

312
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,804
  FIERI: Bring the whole family 
    down while you're at it.    

313
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,006
                   WOMAN:       
          Kids love coming here.

314
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:43,208
            -Really?            
    -Yeah, Paco's book shelf    
           over there.          

315
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,875
                Tell me about   
               the book shelf?  

316
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,811
My elementary school            
had this competition            

317
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,947
 to see which class             
could read the most minutes,    

318
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,882
and I kind of wanted            
 to build a bookcase            

319
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:53,485
to help other people            
who are probably gonna come in. 

320
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,419
If you're waiting for your food,

321
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:55,953
          you can just          
    grab your book and read.    

322
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,823
  FIERI: Whether you're waiting 
 for classic British pub grub...

323
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,692
Certainly expect fish and chips,
which they do phenomenally here.

324
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,895
   FIERI: ...or something from  
  the Asian side of the family. 

325
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,497
               Got the bánh mi  
               for you, ma'am.  

326
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,565
   Bánh mi sandwich is pretty   
       delicious, as well.      

327
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,233
     Okay, so let's get into it.
             What are we making?

328
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,901
  So, we start with             
a whole pork shoulder.          

329
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,770
We're just gonna trim some      
of the fat off of here,         

330
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,172
   break this down              
into smaller pieces.            

331
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,440
                 And what's     
             gonna happen here? 

332
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,509
  I'm gonna rub it              
with Chinese five spice.        

333
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:21,178
It has fennel, star anise,      
black pepper, and kosher salt.  

334
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,580
               Super fragrant.  

335
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,515
         And then we're gonna go
     in the hot pan, sear it up.

336
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,318
    Yep, and then               
once this is browned,           

337
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,787
we're gonna pull it off.        

338
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:32,590
We're gonna add in onions, do   
a little bit of garlic, ginger. 

339
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:35,193
    Hoisin sauce,               
and then a little hot sauce.    

340
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,762
 And some soy sauce.            
And then a little chicken stock.

341
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:42,800
         So, the braising liquid
   comes out on top of the pork.

342
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,602
      Exactly.                  

343
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,070
         In the oven, what temp?

344
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,005
  -350 for about 2 to 3 hours.  
            -Next up?           

345
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,208
 We shred the daikon            
   and the carrot,              

346
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,210
and then we are just            
going to sprinkle it            

347
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,011
with a little sugar,            
   a little salt.               

348
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,546
  Mix this through              
  until it kind of              

349
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,148
 begins to soften up            
    a little bit.               

350
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,550
                 Sweat some     
            of the moisture out.

351
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,485
  Exactly, and then             
we go the cider vinegar.        

352
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,153
   We'll add sugar              
 and some hot water.            

353
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,154
            To help dissolve it.

354
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,688
                How long will   
             we let this pickle?

355
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,624
      48 hours.                 

356
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:10,228
 So, that pork that             
we put in the oven, it is ready.

357
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:15,500
 -So, you can see now it's nice 
     and fall apart tender.     
            -Mm-hmm.            

358
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,568
A little wasabi mayo            
 to put on the bun.             

359
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,904
     Both sides.                

360
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,240
And then we're gonna            
put the pork on there.          

361
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,108
              Look at that jus  
           going on there, whoa.

362
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,446
And then the pickled carrot     
and some green beans.           

363
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,047
     Green beans, of all things.

364
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,816
And then there we go.           

365
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,387
                     Mm!        

366
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,722
       That pork has more flavor

367
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,892
        than the average bánh mi
               by a long shot.  

368
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,264
     The wasabi mayo is kicking.

369
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,132
               Perfect bread,   
               nice and light.  

370
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,534
              And then you get  
      a nice little vinegar kick

371
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:53,671
       and then the great crunch
             of the green bean. 

372
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,940
       That's the hinge point of
         greatness, outstanding.

373
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,274
          The bánh mi.          

374
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,411
       It is always juicy,      
     and it's always tender.    

375
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,047
        I was blown away        
       with that sandwich.      

376
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,949
     The texture                
of the green beans is amazing.  

377
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,217
          Isn't that the kicker?

378
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,353
       We love this place       
 because it's consistently good.

379
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:11,623
             FIERI:             
   Cool English pub attitude,   
     a sixth grade emperor.     

380
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,424
        And a funky name,       
    we have it all going on.    

381
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,160
               Awesome place.   
               Awesome place.   

382
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:20,497
     Up next in Woods Hole,     
        Massachusetts...        

383
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,166
       -The man, the myth,      
         the character.         

384
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,168
   ...flavorful fresh catch...  

385
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,638
The fish that we buy today swam 
in the bay yesterday.           

386
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,772
               Don't you say?   

387
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,975
       ...with personality      
         backing it up.         

388
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,277
Isn't that beautiful, huh?      

389
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:41,653
   So, I'm here in Woods Hole.  

390
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:42,853
  It's one of the villages here 

391
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,522
   in Thalmus, Massachusetts,   
          in Cape Cod.          

392
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,257
       Thank you very much      
      for the ride, captain     

393
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,525
                  Aarrgghh!     

394
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,260
     Now, this area is known    
      for a lot of things,      

395
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,262
   and for most folks, this is  
    where you catch the ferry   

396
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,463
to go over to Martha's Vineyard.

397
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,064
           But there's          
      a more important one,     

398
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,400
and that is a little funky joint

399
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:58,536
     with a self-proclaimed     
     world-famous attitude.     

400
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:01,372
 That's right, this is Shuckers 
  World Famous Raw Bar & Café.  

401
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:08,012
    I need to get this order    
           outta here!          

402
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,549
The fish is fresh. It comes from
  the local waters in Cape Cod. 

403
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,084
        You wouldn't really know
                  it's here     

404
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,352
            unless you walk down
                 that alley.    

405
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,554
   The people that work here,   
     we've known for years.     

406
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,556
      Big stuffed lobster.      

407
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,758
    We love Murph and Karen.    
 They're just wonderful people. 

408
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,028
   FIERI: Murph's a character,  
   also known as Murph-quake,   

409
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,163
      or Chef Kevin Murphy.     

410
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:29,701
 He and his wife, Karen, opened 
  this harbor hideaway in 1981  

411
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,570
 and have been dishes out clams,
      oysters, and lobsters     

412
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,439
     to locals and tourists     
           ever since.          

413
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,108
 Folks love it here.            

414
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,509
It's part of their vacation.    

415
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,378
     Every year,                
they'll stop on the way         

416
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,179
or on their way back            
from Martha's Vineyard.         

417
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,048
        FIERI: How many of these
           do you cook in a day?

418
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,118
50 to 100, it depends.          

419
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,586
      And if your main meal     
     isn't a whole lobster,     

420
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:53,457
      well, it's more than      
     likely there's lobster     
       in there somewhere.      

421
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,193
       I have                   
a baked stuffed scrod.          

422
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,661
         It's the best.         

423
00:14:56,663 --> 00:15:00,397
   The fish is flaky yet firm,  
       a very nice sauce.       

424
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,600
The dish we're gonna make       
will be our stuffed cod.        

425
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:03,935
     Cod scrod.                 

426
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:07,205
Remember the word "scrod"       
is really not a species of fish.

427
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,806
It's the size of the fish.      

428
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,541
     So, you're saying when it's
          smaller, it's a scrod.

429
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:11,809
    It's a scrod.               

430
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,678
        So, let's take these in,
   and then we'll pick the meat.

431
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,879
    Sounds good.                
 You got that right.            

432
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,082
We really just rip off          
     the tails.                 

433
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,550
  You just crack it             
   with your hand.              

434
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,219
             A lot of people cut
         the shell with their --

435
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,421
When you're doing as much       
lobster as we are, you can't -- 

436
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,555
             We don't have time.

437
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:25,622
We don't got time to do         
 that kind of stuff.            

438
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:26,557
              The shenanigans.  

439
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,026
We're gonna chop it up          
    a little bit.               

440
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,895
   Cracker crumbs.              

441
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:35,766
Some pepper, paprika,           
 and melted butter.             

442
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,635
     All right,                 
so we've got that mixed.        

443
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,305
    I'm gonna cut               
a piece of fish for you.        

444
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,107
 We buy native cod.             

445
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,710
There is nothing fresher        
than the fish when we buy today 

446
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,313
   because it swam              
in the bay yesterday.           

447
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,181
               Don't you say?   

448
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:51,449
What we're gonna do is,         

449
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,984
we're gonna take a little bit   
 of the thicker end,            

450
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:56,921
and I'm gonna that nice lobster 
stuffing we just made           

451
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:59,190
and put it on top of the cod.   

452
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:00,191
                  How long?     

453
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:03,194
Okay, so that's gonna go        
  12 to 15 minutes.             

454
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:04,328
              Now we're making? 

455
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,130
  We're gonna make              
a beurre blanc sauce here.      

456
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,865
Put some butter in the pan.     

457
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:12,804
Put the shallots in there,      
Sauvignon Blanc wine.           

458
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:13,671
              And what's this?  

459
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,473
   That's a little              
    simple syrup.               

460
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,408
              -Ooh.             
   -Add some sweetness to it.   

461
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,610
   Takes the bite               
out of the shallots.            

462
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:20,544
                   Got it.      

463
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,079
 Then the next thing            
     I have here                

464
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,081
is a mixture of butter          
     and cream.                 

465
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,750
     We're gonna                
let that reduce down.           

466
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:30,021
It's gonna take maybe 15 to     
20 minutes at medium heat.      

467
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,422
We have the garnish.            

468
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:32,957
             Scalloped potatoes?

469
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,293
<i> Au gratin,</i> not scalloped.      
  Au gratin, buddy.             

470
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,760
            -Come on.           
           -Au gratin.          

471
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,563
 Look at this beauty            
     here, huh?                 

472
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,632
  We're gonna take              
that beurre blanc sauce,        

473
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,835
and we want to ladle a good bit 
   over the fish.               

474
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,103
We're gonna garnish it          

475
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:49,106
with a little dill weed,        
   a little lemon.              

476
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,909
    We're ready.                
This is the real Cape Cod thing.

477
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:58,316
      It tastes bright and fresh
              and like the sea. 

478
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,051
       Nice and flaky and light.

479
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:01,519
           Great seafood flavor.

480
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,855
   The beurre blanc is dynamite.

481
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,090
    Nice amount of wine in that.

482
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:08,993
               Chef, nice job.  

483
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,194
Thank you very much,            
   appreciate it.               

484
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,462
        -I'm telling you.       
           -I like it.          

485
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,264
                Murph-quake!    

486
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,134
   Hello, we have               
the baked stuffed scrod.        

487
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,469
           Delicious.           
  The fish is tender and sweet. 

488
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,138
     I taste a little lemon.    

489
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,539
      Perfecto.                 

490
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:25,342
The right amount of lobster,    
fresh fish, incredible sauce.   

491
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:28,012
                Hello, I have   
      your lobster boil for you.

492
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:31,482
    The quality and quantity    
   of the food is first class.  

493
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:35,553
             FIERI:             
 But it's not just the bomb food
    bringing customers back.    

494
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,356
      You want the seafood      
    in the right environment.   

495
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:39,624
              MAN:              
   You're right on the water.   

496
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,292
    Actually, we're floating    
          as we speak.          

497
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:44,896
   Love pulling up right here   
    for a nice, quaint lunch.   

498
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,030
                 All right,     
             so here's the deal.

499
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,631
         Not that I need to have
           anything else to eat.

500
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,434
             When we come back, 
       we're doing some mussels.

501
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,703
        Sweet and tender.       

502
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,238
 They're good to the last drop. 

503
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,040
   -And they're off the hook?   
         -Off the hook.         

504
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,708
           Says it all the time.
              See you in a bit. 

505
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,409
     All right.                 

506
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,585
                Welcome back.   
We're hanging out in Woods Hole.

507
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,121
      Yep, that's right, here in
         Thalmus, Massachusetts.

508
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,457
        We are right in the area
          where you jump a ferry

509
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,192
                 to go over     
           to Martha's Vineyard.

510
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,261
         So, when you're waiting
               for the ferry,   

511
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,196
             you're looking for 
             a place to come to.

512
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,866
     You end up here at Shuckers
       World Famous Raw Bar &...

513
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:23,133
        Café!                   

514
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,668
         -There you go.         
       -You got it, buddy.      

515
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,271
             My brother, Murph, 
     here has walked us through.

516
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,740
             We did a fantastic 
          lobster-stuffed scrod.

517
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,942
    Now we're into some mussels.

518
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,278
Portuguese mussels for you.     

519
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,413
         I'm Portuguese,        

520
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:38,348
 and the Portuguese mussels here
          are the best.         

521
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,752
     Portuguese mussels have    
  the chorizo and the peppers.  

522
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,721
     The sauce is delicious.    

523
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,824
            Give me the rundown,
                  brother.      

524
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:49,026
First thing, we're gonna take   
the beards off of the mussels.  

525
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,228
See that right there?           

526
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,697
That's how the mussels          
attach to the lines,            

527
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:54,097
to the docks, to the rocks.     

528
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,499
            So you're gonna take
               all the beards.  

529
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,167
Yeah. Maybe somebody didn't     
do that to you today.           

530
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,703
            Hey, watch yourself.
               Watch yourself.  

531
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:01,572
We're gonna take some butter.   

532
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:04,509
 Chorizo, ground up,            
  put it in there.              

533
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:05,709
                    Okay.       

534
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,779
     Smell that.                
Isn't that beautiful?           

535
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,848
Isn't that beautiful, huh?      

536
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,850
So, we're gonna take            
some peppers and onions,        
  put 'em in there.             

537
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,854
 Now, the next thing we're gonna
 add is a little Riesling wine. 

538
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:19,856
  It goes very well             
   with shellfish.              

539
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,326
 We're gonna put in             
 the mussels, okay?             

540
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,195
    -That's a lot of mussels.   
             -Yeah.             

541
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:25,729
Three to four minutes,          
and we got game time.           

542
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,131
             Soon as they open, 
            we're ready to roll.

543
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:30,467
That broth -- ooh, that's part  
of the show right there.        

544
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,603
Does that taste good.           

545
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,672
  I got to put out              
  the garlic bread.             

546
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,773
I'm gonna throw that on.        

547
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:40,277
               So, you get it   
            right down in there,

548
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,146
               throw a little   
         of that chorizo on top.

549
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,416
       -What do you think?      
              -Mmm.             

550
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:46,617
              -Huh?             
            -Tender.            

551
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,285
Has some flavor, too, huh?      

552
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,420
      Buttery, not overly salty.

553
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:51,622
                Super tender.   

554
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:54,025
                   I mean,      
            like, tender tender.

555
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,993
         They just kind of start
          melting in your mouth.

556
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,831
 "A," that's a ridiculous amount
                 of mussels,    

557
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,968
  but "B," and most importantly,
                outstanding.    

558
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,771
 They have a little kick to 'em.

559
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,640
    And they kind of explode    
         in your mouth.         

560
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:12,843
Right amount of garlic,         
right amount of acid.           

561
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,712
Love dipping the garlic bread   
    in the sauce.               

562
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,647
     -There's nothing wrong     
           with that.           
              -No.              

563
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:21,452
  This is what you look for when
   you come to a Cape Cod place.

564
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:24,322
So, even though you are right in
    the heart of a tourist area,

565
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,856
         you are doing it legit,

566
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,325
     keep paying respects to how
  the seafood should be treated.

567
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,261
     -That's the whole deal.    
     -You're exactly right.     

568
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:31,928
                 The seafood    
        is the star of the show.

569
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,531
     -You got that straight.    
           -Excellent.          

570
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:35,132
 Thank you so much.             
   Appreciate it.               

571
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,767
             The man, the myth, 
               the character.   

572
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:40,338
        So, that's it for       
   this trip, but don't worry.  

573
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,474
 There's plenty more "Triple D" 
  joints all over the country!  

574
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,343
     I'll be looking for you    
            next week           

575
