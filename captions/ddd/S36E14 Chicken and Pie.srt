  little sweetness, obviously.

in Southern cooking?

   Catfish hot up here. Ready.  

338
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,731
 Where did you learn            
to cook, by the way?            

339
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,666
         From my parents        
       and my grandmother.      

340
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,069
 Lillie Mae Abernathy-Lovelace. 

341
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,137
    That's, like,               
 the whole alphabet.            

342
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,204
                 I feel like    
              Southern grandmas 

343
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,539
             have to have, like,
             four or five names.

344
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,341
Is that your grandma's picture  
up there on the counter?        

345
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,809
              That is actually  
         someone else's grandma.

346
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,543
             We kind of collect 
               grandma photos.  

347
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,746
         But my grandma         
     is part of the gallery.    

348
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,081
 I've just got to do            
one more bite for science.      

349
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,015
           I love it.           

350
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,393
      -Ugh, this old girl.      
            -Come on.           

351
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,461
             FIERI:             
      You're not that old.      

352
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:37,661
             I was talking about
                 the mixer.     

353
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,330
                 Excuse me.     

354
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,099
        She came to play.       
          I'm playing.          

355
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,603
Welcome back, partner.          
  How'd that sound?             

356
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,671
          It was great.         

357
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:47,872
 Do we say "partner"            
 in North Carolina?             

358
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,006
  Not really, but that's fine.  
Not so much.                    

359
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,074
But we're at Yonder.            

360
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,143
Chef Maya hanging out           
in Portland, Oregon.            

361
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,478
  We're having some             
   dynamite food.               

362
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,213
           You chicken          
      and dumplings. Enjoy.     

363
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,549
        Yonder is a very        
       special restaurant       

364
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,951
   featuring a bunch of stuff   
         from the South.        

365
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,819
    WOMAN: Maya takes, like,    
          old classics,         

366
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,221
          and she puts          
    a creative twist on them.   

367
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,024
  Alright. I got catpuppies up, 
         ready to roll.         

368
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:07,158
            These are           
      catfish hushpuppies.      

369
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,694
         This beautiful,        
        pillowed, doughy,       

370
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,295
    fantastic fried fritter.    

371
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,031
So, the hushpuppy by itself     
 isn't good enough.             

372
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,699
We're gonna add catfish to it.  
         Exactly.               

373
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,834
        It's a Tennessee        
          wild catfish.         

374
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,235
      Bring it.                 
             Awesome.           

375
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,371
      We are gonna just do      
      a quick cure on this.     

376
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,040
         A little sugar,        
       and a little salt.       

377
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:24,108
       So, then, me go in       
      with our sweet onion,     

378
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,978
        eggs, buttermilk,       
     stone ground cornmeal,     

379
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,715
  garlic powder, baking powder, 
       black pepper, salt,      

380
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:34,852
      onion powder, sugar,      
 bourbon barrel smoked paprika, 

381
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,120
       and cayenne pepper.      

382
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,588
           It's a nice          
          thick batter.         

383
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,190
    That gives us               
   a little puff.               

384
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,658
 To the fryer, 350.             

385
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,926
       Yep. Four minutes.       
That's it.                      

386
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,060
           Easy peezy.          

387
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,329
 And what does this             
  get served with?              

388
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:45,863
       Our Comeback sauce.      

389
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,332
        So, we start with       
        our mayonnaise --       

390
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,600
         another crucial        
     Southern ingredient --     

391
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,536
our house-fermented chili paste,
       hot sauce, ketchup,      

392
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,939
      stone ground mustard,     
          lemon juice.          

393
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,542
    This is a bourbon barrel    
        smoked soy sauce,       

394
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,277
            paprika,            
         garlic powder,         

395
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,213
  salt, and good old-fashioned  
          black pepper.         

396
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,681
    Mix this up.                
  It's ready to go.             

397
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:06,016
 So, we have our hushpuppies -- 
    golden brown and crispy.    

398
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,885
    We are gonna finish this    
     with a little spice mix    

399
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,287
     that we make with salt,    

400
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,891
 a little bit of sugar, paprika,
    cayenne, and citric acid.   

401
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,359
     And you want to do that    
    while they're still warm,   

402
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:16,627
    so the seasoning adheres.   
Exactly.                        

403
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,295
How many in an order?           
          We do 8.              

404
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,098
  Oh, my goodness.              
               I know.          

405
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,366
     We finish these chives.    

406
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:23,500
   And then, we also serve it   
  with whipped sorghum butter,  

407
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,636
         which is sweet.        

408
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,304
       Serve them up with       
       the Comeback sauce.      

409
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,372
      Gorgeous.                 

410
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:30,174
                     ♪♪         

411
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,377
        When you look at        
       that nice crust...       

412
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,579
    Great crunch.               

413
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,514
     This is not                
your average hushpuppy.         

414
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,583
    it's tender.                
It's not overcooked.            

415
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:41,853
It's not fishy in any means,    
but it does add moisture to it. 

416
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,455
It does add texture to it.      
It does add flavor to it.       

417
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,524
You can go to the sweet side    
of it with the sorghum butter.  

418
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,726
You can go to savory side of it 
 with the Comeback.             

419
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,394
 If you've never had            
     a hushpuppy                

420
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,797
or if you want to have          
a really good hushpuppy,        

421
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,797
This is your hushpuppy.         

422
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,400
   Excellent job.               
             Thank you.         

423
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:58,403
    Catfish hushpuppies with    
   Comeback sauce for dipping.  

424
00:13:58,405 --> 00:13:59,871
       WOMAN: Super crispy      
         on the outside,        

425
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,339
          really flaky          
         on the inside.         

426
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,339
         It's delicious.        

427
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,808
     Instead of overspicing     
          the catfish,          

428
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,543
       she puts the spice       
     in the Comeback sauce,     

429
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,745
  so you keep on dipping it in  
     there, and coming back.    

430
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:10,748
 We are ready to go out the door
      to table 1. Order up.     

431
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,884
 WOMAN #2: Visitors in Portland 
       that come to Yonder      

432
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:15,353
   are gonna have a great time  
   no matter what they order.   

433
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,288
      This is a little bit      
          more special,         

434
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,622
          a little bit          
         more personal.         

435
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:19,824
      And you could really      
           taste that.          

436
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,626
 You're a fantastic             
     ambassador.                

437
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:24,162
You're showing folks            
this is how it's done.          

438
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:25,964
  This is spot on,              
 and it's delicious.            

439
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,431
       Thank you so much.       
   Well done.                   

440
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,500
           Thank you.           

441
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:32,570
             FIERI:             
   Coming up, a killer kitchen  
   at a Dania Beach brewery...  

442
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,772
        You're gonna gain weight
      hanging out with this guy.

443
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,107
         ...whipping up         
          wild wings...         

444
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:37,775
             I'm ripping it off.
             I'm taking it home.

445
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:40,711
  ...and topping Florida flavor 
         onto the crust.        

446

                on the menu?    

556
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,074
    WOMAN: I love               
  the shrimp pizza.             

557
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:32,609
        -Shrimp pizza up.       
       -It's just so good.      

558
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,077
        The shrimp pops.        

559
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,814
      The cheese just oozes     
         in your mouth.         

560
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,615
           Thin crust,          
         capers on top.         

561
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,017
         You can't stop         
           eating it.           

562
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,352
               What's the pie   
         we're gonna make today?

563
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,154
     Shrimp pie.                
                So it's small?  

564
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,288
         No.                    

565
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,556
  We're gonna make              
  our pizza dough.              

566
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:49,493
  Yeast, the water,             
  olive oil, flour.             

567
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,229
                  Mix this      
              for six minutes.  

568
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:52,296
   FIERI: Got it.               

569
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,632
        Then, it's going to rest
               for 15 minutes.  

570
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,434
              Then, we're gonna 
           hit it with the salt.

571
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:57,902
                You spin for    
              6 minutes again.  

572
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:59,770
    Pull it out.                
                    Rest for 30.

573
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:03,241
       Portion. And bulk ferment
         for three to five days.

574
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,509
        You're gonna gain weight
      hanging out with this guy.

575
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,710
                 So, this is    
              the vinaigrette?  

576
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:11,582
Correct. Dijon, shallots,       
thyme, sherry vinegar, garlic,  

577
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:14,185
  some lemon juice,             
extra virgin olive oil.         

578
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:16,386
        Where are we at?        
I just build my crust.          

579
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,322
         Fresh escarole.        
Didn't see that coming.         

580
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,457
       A little manchego.       

581
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:20,725
           Fresh mozz.          

582
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,593
   We use these really pretty   
        Gulf pink shrimp.       

583
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,328
And what did we marinate        
   these in, Chef?              

584
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,663
   Just extra virgin olive oil  
        and some oregano.       

585
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,932
        Now, we're ready        
       to get in the oven.      

586
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,534
   We're 800, 850,              
two to three minutes.           

587
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,070
            Yes, sir.           
Gorgeous.                       

588
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:36,941
     Garlic confit, capers,     
  vinaigrette, Pecorino Romano, 

589
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:40,678
  oregano, crushed red pepper,  
        Maldon sea salt.        

590
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,013
      Short of                  
  the kitchen sink,             

591
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,280
I think we got everything       
   on there, Chef.              

592
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,950
                     ♪♪         

593
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:49,020
We're breaking a lot of         
traditional Italian rules, here.

594
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,221
              I'm not Italian.  

595
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,956
     Good point.                

596
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:55,159
  I'll just eat it,             
    and shut up.                

597
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,693
With That beautiful shrimp      
      on there,                 

598
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,963
I think the escarole is         
a great supporting player.      

599
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:02,300
The saltiness of the manchego,  
the saltiness of the Pecorino.  

600
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,902
But the real key, Chef,         
    is the dough.               

601
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,504
  I'd eat the dough             
     by itself.                 

602
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:09,173
     Well done.                 
Watch out for this guy.         

603
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,175
         -Shrimp pizza.         
      -The manchego cheese      

604
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:13,644
         with the capers        
      just blends so well.      

605
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,046
   Holly and Dave               
are friends of mine,            

606
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,448
we share a common interest      
in the Best Buddies program,    

607
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,784
supporting intellectually       
disabled adults and kids.       

608
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,118
 What do you think?             

609
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,254
  I wasn't sure about the shrimp
          on the pizza, but wow.

610
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:24,988
                It's bursting   
                with flavor.    

611
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,056
                 So, I think    
               I'm converting.  

612
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,192
         -It's so good.         
          -Tuna tacos.          

613
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:29,526
          Once you come         
           to 3 Sons,           

614
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,128
     you're never gonna want    
         to stop coming.        

615
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,462
I know the beer here            
    is dynamite,                

616
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,498
and often the kitchen           
plays the second fiddle.        

617
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,600
But what you guys have here     
 are dueling banjos.            

618
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,603
           Well done.           
           -Thank you.          

619
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:40,938
    That's it for this week.    

620
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,206
      But don't you worry.      

621
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,475
 I'll be looking for more joints
     all over this country.     

622
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:48,679
    I'll see you next week on   
 "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives."

623
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:50,047
    Punch it down               
    a few times.                

624
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,016
       How do we do that?       
We punch it.                    

625
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:53,484
      She's very animated.      

626
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,686
     There's a lot of this,     
         a lot of that.         

627
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,421
        And don't want to       
         get in her way.        

628
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,123
     This one is a wildcat.
