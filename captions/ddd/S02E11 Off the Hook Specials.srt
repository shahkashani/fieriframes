126
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:05,170
HE CAME BACK AND HELPED ME      
    OPEN A RESTAURANT,          

127
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:07,839
 SO A LOT OF THE RECIPES ARE

         AS I REMEMBER          
        FROM BACK HOME.         
  THE SECRET IS DEFINITELY

NEXT TO SOME OF THE BIG BOYS.   

504
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,339

                 (Guy) THE PRIDE
                 OF THE VESSEL. 
GIVE THAT MAN A FORK.           

507

       THE SPICY JALAPEÑO,      

511
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,621
   THE BIG CRUNCH OF THE CHIP,  

512
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:27,091
  THEN YOU GET A LITTLE BIT OF  
  THE SWEETNESS FROM THE PORK.

                ENJOY THE MEAT."

516
