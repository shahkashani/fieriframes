 YOU'RE SOMEWHERE IN THE SOUTH.

    SOUTHERN FOOD IS ACTUALLY   
   AMERICA'S ORIGINAL CUISINE.  

109
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,112

110
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,715
 I WANTED A LITTLE BIT OF HOME  
     TODAY, AND I GOT THAT.     
       IT'S COMFORT FOOD.       

111
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,917

  <i> WITH ALL THE SOUTHERN SIDES.</i>

117
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,598
 GRITS AND FRIED GREEN TOMATOES.
       I LIKE THE BATTER.       

118
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,867
 THAT'S THE WHOLE TRICK--IF YOU 
   HAVE A GOOD BATTER OR NOT.   

119
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,536
LOOK AT THAT. UH-HUH.           

120
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,538
 GREAT TEXTURE                  
ON THE OUTSIDE.                 

121
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,540
THE RIGHT SIDE--                
THAT'S THE KEY.                 

122
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,610
 A LITTLE BIT OF SOURNESS       
OF THE TOMATO BEING GREEN.      
                           YEAH.

123
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,678
NOT OVER SEASONED               
 NOT TOO SALTY.                 

124
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,414
MMM, THAT'S GREAT.              
            THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

125
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,416
         I'VE NEVER HAD         
      FRIED GREEN TOMATOES,     

126
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,885
     SO I GUESS I'M KIND OF     
 GREEN ON FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, 

127
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,221
     BUT I JUST LOVE THEM.      
                 I HAVEN'T LIVED
                  IN THE SOUTH. 

128
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:52,024
  I JUST AM A PERSON WHO LOVES  
PHENOMENAL FOOD, AND I CAME HERE

129
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,226

       CORN BREAD STUFFING.     

130
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:56,694
WHAT'S SO GOOD ABOUT IT?        
          JUST THE FACT THAT    
      IT'S MADE WITH CORN BREAD.

131
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,230
WE MAKE THE CORN BREAD          

132
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:00,198
SPECIFICALLY JUST FOR           
    THE DRESSING?               
                            YES.

133
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:02,768
AND HOW DO WE GET STARTED?      
 OH, I KNOW WHAT THAT IS.       

134

135
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,772
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA            
     USE THAT?                  
                  YES, TO SAUTé.

136
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,774

        WHEN YOU WORK UP A SWEAT

137
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,776

            OKAY, SO WE'RE GONNA
              SWEAT THIS DOWN.  
IT'S GONNA GO DOWN UNTIL        
 THE ONIONS ARE CLEAR.          

140
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:18,383
      AND THEN WE'LL INCORPORATE
     WITH THE OTHER INGREDIENTS.
CORRECT.                        

141
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,385

VERY DENSE CORN BREAD.          

142
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:22,387
                    IT IS DENSE.
NOW WHAT GOES IN?               

143
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,389
                  CHICKEN STOCK.
YOU MAKE IT YOURSELF?

00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,597
SOME SAVORY?                    
                            YES.

148
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,200
  I DON'T SEE SAVORY            
GET COOKED WITH A LOT.          
                         MM-HMM.

149
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:38,470
                  AND SOME SAGE.
GOTTA HAVE SAGE                 
 IN STUFFING.

                      I KNOW.   
                  AND SOME MILK.

151
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,741
            AND THEN OUR ONION, 
           CELERY AND BACON FAT.

152
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,877
BACON FAT'S THE KICKER.         
         MMM.                   

153
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,613

            WE'RE GONNA STIR IT.
STIR IT ALL UP, AND HOW LONG    
  DOES IT GO IN THE OVEN?       

154
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,148
               ABOUT 30 MINUTES.
30 MINUTES.                     

155

00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:54,419
             OKAY. LOOK AT THAT.
                    WHOA.       

157
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:57,088
       YOU'RE GONNA PUT A LITTLE
        BIT OF OUR GRAVY ON IT. 

158
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:59,224
DO YOU MAKE YOUR GRAVY?         
                  WE DO MAKE IT.

159
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:02,160

SO YOU GET A LITTLE BIT         
     OF SWEETNESS               

162
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,500
   FROM THE CORN BREAD ITSELF.  
 THEN YOU GET THE SAVORY PIECE--

163
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,502
THE ONIONS AND THE CELERY--

                         MM-HMM.

164
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:13,772
BUT THE REAL KEY IS THE TEXTURE 
      OF THE CORN BREAD.        

165
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:16,708
   YEAH. YOU SHOULD JUST CALL   
 YOURSELF "THE STUFFING HOUSE."

     HERE YOU GO, DARLIN'.      

195

        WHAT IS IT ABOUT        
          THIS PLACE?           
NUMBER ONE--THE FOOD,           

196
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:29,147
    AND NUMBER TWO--            
THE WAIT STAFF AND RICH.        

197

         WHAT'S THE MATTER, YOU?
          HE'S A KICK.          

198

   <i> HE IS OWNER RICH BOCK...</i>    
         CHEERS, GUYS.          

199
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:37,088
  <i> AN ITALIAN FOOD FANATIC...</i>   
        SHRIMP RAVIOLI.         

200
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,090
 <i> AND A WORLD-CLASS MUSICIAN...</i> 

201
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,559
    (Rich) I ENDED UP PLAYING   
   PROFESSIONALLY IN NEW YORK,  

202
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:44,028
          GOT A CHANCE          
        TO GO TO ITALY.         
       <i> AND LANDED A GIG</i>        
         <i> IN FLORENCE.</i>          

203
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,897
           I WAS THERE          
     NINE YEARS AND CHANGE.     

204
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,833
    THE FOOD THING THERE IS--   
YOU KNOW, IT'S EVERYBODY'S HOBBY

205
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,501
AND PASSION.                    
         EVERYBODY'S EVERYTHING.

206
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,435
EVERYTHING.                     

207
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:54,239
           BEAUTIFUL.

      <i> AND SEVEN YEARS AGO,</i>     
    <i> GOT THIS PLACE ROLLING.</i>    

210
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,044
       NUMBER ONE ITEM          
ON THE MENU EVERYBODY LOVES?    

211
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,113
            THE BOLOGNESE RAGU. 

212
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,749
  IT'S NOT LIKE THE MEAT SAUCE  
I MAKE AT HOME, THAT'S FOR SURE.

213
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,985
        IT'S VERY GOOD.         
          VERY MEATY.           
               I HAVE TO TALK   
            SOME PEOPLE INTO IT,

214
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,987
                  BUT ONCE      
            THEY GIVE IT A GO...
YOU OWN 'EM.                    

215
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,056
                      I GOT 'EM.
SO IT'S BOLOGNESE TIME.         

216
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,658
                      RAGU TIME.
GET IT ON.                      

217
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,326
                 HOT POT,       
           WE THROW IN THE BEEF.

218
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,395
     HERE'S 5 POUNDS OF SAUSAGE 
         AND GROUND TURKEY.     

219
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:20,431
WHO DID THE RECIPE              
    COME FROM?                  
    THE WIFE OF ONE OF MY GREAT 
   TENNIS PALS BACK IN FLORENCE.

220
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,734
           SHE WAS BIG ON MIXING
            POULTRY AND MEATS.  

221
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,135
                     FANTASTIC. 

222
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:27,272
SO NOW WE JUST BREAK THIS UP,   
 LET IT BROWN A LITTLE BIT.     

223
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,274
SWEAT OUT SOME BACON.           
             RENDER OUT THE FAT.

224
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:32,677
YEP, AND THEN I TAKE THE BACON  
OUT, I PUT THE BACON IN HERE.   

225
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,013
            AND THEN USE THIS   
         TO SWEAT THOSE VEGGIES.
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

226
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,214
ADD A LITTLE OLIVE OIL          
   TO THE BACON FAT.            

227
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,017
RED ONIONS, CELERY...           

228
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,485
     THIS IS RIGHT UP THE LINES 
          OF MY BOLOGNESE.      

229
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,622
CARROTS, WHEN THE VEGETABLES    
HAVE SOFTENED A LITTLE BIT,     

230
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,156
  PUT IN SOME                   
CHOPPED GARLIC,                 

231
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,025
A LITTLE SALT, A LITTLE PEPPER. 
        THE REAL DEAL.          

232
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:50,095
 SO THIS IS A LITTLE WINE I MAKE
     WITH A GOOD PAL OF MINE.   
REALLY?                         

233
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:51,963
          YEAH, RUBY CABERNET.  
         WE MAKE IT EVERY YEAR. 

234
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,698
      NOTHIN' I DON'T LIKE MORE 

235
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,834
           THAN A LITTLE WINE   
         IN SOME GROUND-UP MEAT.

236
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:58,836
          OH, THAT SMELLS GREAT.
  NOW I'M GONNA PUT             
SOME TOMATO PASTE IN.           

237
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,973
           GOTTA COOK THAT DOWN.
   SOME "TI-MO"--THYME          
AND ROSEMARY COMBINATION.       

238
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,643
         AND THAT WAS FRESH THAT
         YOU GROUND UP YOURSELF.
FRESH, YES.                     

239
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,579
            YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE
             OF HOW DARK IT IS. 
LET THAT DO ITS THING           
FOR FIVE, TEN MINUTES.          

240
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:09,581
 THEN I'M GONNA PUT ALL         
THE TOMATO PASTE MIXTURE        

241
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,115
IN WITH THE MEAT.               

242
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,117
I THROW IN SOME WATER.          
           NO MORE TOMATO SAUCE?

243
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,786
NO MORE TOMATO.                 
                      SERIOUSLY?

244
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,055
YEP.                            
                 MINE WAS       
         A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

245
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,457
THIS IS MEAT TIMES TEN.         
               RAW CHICKEN LEGS.

246
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:20,925
                  LOOKS LIKE    
               VOODOO BOLOGNESE.

247
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,994
       YOU'RE JUST GONNA STICK  
     SOME CHICKEN LEGS IN THERE?

248
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,931
AFTER TWO HOURS, I TAKE 'EM OUT,
      I TAKE THE MEAT OFF,      

249
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,332
CHOP IT UP, THROW THE MEAT      
  BACK IN, AND THAT'S IT.       

250
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,735
     SO NOW I PUT               
THE CHICKEN LIVERS IN.          
                  OH, THOSE LOOK
                   SO GOOD RAW. 

251
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,937
    THIS WOULD GO               
FOR ANOTHER HOUR NOW.           

252
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,939
        <i> AND IT'S HEADIN'</i>       
    <i> FOR SOME HOMEMADE PASTA.</i>   

253

       WE MAKE THESE TAGLIATELLE
         JUST ON THE WEEKEND.   

254
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:38,943
         PEOPLE ARE HERE AT 5:00
            FOR FRESH PASTA,    

255
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:41,879
  AND WHEN IT'S OVER, IT'S OVER.
    PUT IT ON OUR NEW-AGE RACK. 

256
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:44,349
    THIS IS INSTEAD OF THE BACK 
   OF YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S CHAIR. 

257
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:47,018
            NOW WE CUT THESE UP,
             AND WE'RE ROCKIN'. 
THAT'S SOME NICE                
FRESH-MADE PASTA.

      I'M BARELY ABLE TO TALK   
  RIGHT NOW 'CAUSE OF THE DROOL.

259
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,557
 SO THAT'S HOT AND READY TO GO. 
  LOOK AT HOW THAT BROKE DOWN.  

260

LOOK AT THIS.

THAT'S DELICIOUS.

 WONDERFUL COMBINATION OF MEATS.

00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,725
OKAY, 45 MINUTES...             

390
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,859
                            YEP.
     AND THEN                   
QUESA-DILL-IA TIME.

               GOOD LOOKIN'.

       DO WE MAKE ONE OF THESE? 

393
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,201
WE USE FLOUR TORTILLAS          
      FOR THIS.                 
               BUT A NICE, THICK
                FLOUR TORTILLA. 

394
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:07,204
    AND THEN WE PUT             
ASADERO CHEESE ON THIS.         
                  WHAT--ASADERO?

395
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,074
ASADERO IS A MEXICAN            
   MELTING CHEESE.              

396
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,076
WHAT DO YOU THINK?              
             GOOD TEXTURE TO IT.

397
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,478
SOME CARAMELIZED SHALLOTS       
 AND OUR SMOKED SALMON.         

398
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,014
                  (whistles)    
               GENEROUS PORTION.

399
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,016
 AND NOW THIS IS GONNA          
GO INTO THE PIZZA OVEN.         

400
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,018
       JUST ABOUT THREE MINUTES.
THREE MINUTES.                  

401
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:22,286
   THERE'S OUR NICE             
MELTED ASADERO CHEESE,          

402
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:26,223
AND WE ARE GOING TO SLICE UP    
SOME AVOCADO TO PUT ON THAT,    

403
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,759
THERE WE GO, AND LET'S CUT      
     THAT BIG BOY UP.           

404
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,028
     THIS IS A SWEET            
RED CHILE SAUCE WE MAKE.        

405
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,696
                      (giggles) 

406
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,766
             THAT'S OUTSTANDING.
ISN'T THAT GOOD?                

407
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,768
   THAT IS A BALANCE OF FLAVORS 

408
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,303
               THAT COMPLEMENT  
             EACH OTHER SO WELL.

409
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,305
         YOU PUT SOME NICE HEAT 
              ON IT--MMM--      

410
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:44,241
 THEN YOU BRING THE SWEETNESS IN
 FROM THE CARAMELIZED SHALLOTS. 

411
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:47,111
MM-HMM.                         
          THAT CHEESE HAS GOT   
      SOME NICE SALTINESS TO IT.

412
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,113
             AND THE CREAMINESS 
              OF THE AVOCADO--  

413
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,582
        MMM, THAT'S REALLY GOOD.
I'M REALLY GLAD                 
  YOU LIKE IT.                  

414
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,317
EVERY TIME I COME IN HERE,      
         I THINK,               

415
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,054
  I'M GONNA EAT SOMETHING ELSE, 
 AND I END UP EATING THE SALMON.

416
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,654
               SAME THING AGAIN.
EVERY TIME.                     

417
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:59,257
WITH THAT SMOKED FLAVOR         
     OF THE SALMON              

418
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,925
   WITH A LITTLE BIT            
OF HEAT--LOVE IT, MAN.          

419
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:04,462
    JUST FRESH COOKED FOOD.     
WE'VE GOT AN ASIAGO             
 WITH VINAIGRETTE.              

420
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,464
   WE BUY IT FROM THE FARMER'S  
      MARKET IN THE SUMMER.     

421
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,533
WE BUY ALL OF OUR               
BEEF FROM A RANCH               

422
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:11,936
OUT IN EASTERN                  
 NEW MEXICO.                    
          ALL OF THE BEEF THAT  
        YOU'RE USING HERE IN ZIA

423
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,672
      IS COMING FROM THIS RANCH?
 THEY'RE ORGANIC,               
THEY'RE GRASS-FED.              

424
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,407
      <i> FOR THE BURGERS...</i>       
      LOVE THEIR BURGERS.       

425
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,342
       <i> THE MEATLOAF...</i>         
       THE MEATLOAF IS THE BEST.

426

       <i> EVEN THE HOMEMADE</i>       
       <i> CORNED BEEF HASH.</i>       

427
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,881
             ANY TIME SOMEONE   
           IS BRINING AND DOING 

428
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:26,551
           THEIR OWN CORNED BEEF
           FROM THE BEGINNING...
YEP.                            

429
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:28,753
     GIVE ME YOUR RUNDOWN HERE. 
         LOOKS LIKE SALT...     

430
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,755
THERE'S OUR PAPRIKA,            
    ALLSPICE...                 
                          THYME.

431
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,357
BLACK PEPPER.                   
   AND A LITTLE OF MY FAVORITE--
        THE JUNIPER BERRIES.    

432
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,293
AND LET'S NOT FORGET            
  THE BAY LEAVES.               
                       I DIG IT.

433
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:38,763
 WE'RE GONNA PUT SOME SPICE RUB 
   DOWN, AND THEN OUR BRISKET.  

434
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:41,566
         THAT'S KIND OF THE FLAT
             OF THE BRISKET.    
WE GET MUCH BETTER              
    PENETRATION                 

435
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,768
IF YOU'RE NOT USING A BIG,      
   THICK PIECE OF MEAT.         

436
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,770
SO NOW WE'RE GONNA              
    WRAP IT UP.                 

437
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,772
   NOW YOU DO WANT              
TO WEIGHT THIS DOWN.            

438
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:50,574
PUT THE HEAVY TIN CANS          
 ON THERE, AND THEN--           
         IN THE WALK-IN IT GOES.

439
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,511
 JUST LIKE THIS                 
INTO THE WALK-IN.               
       HOLDS IT BELOW 40 DEGREES
             FOR 5 DAYS...      

440
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,912
YEP.                            
                            WOW.

441
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:56,781
                   LOOK HOW MUCH
                  IT SHRINKS UP.
FIRST WE RINSE IT,              

442
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,716
'CAUSE THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT     
     OF SALT ON THERE.          

443
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,251
THEN IT GOES                    
INTO THE POT.                   

444
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,320
WE JUST PUT ENOUGH WATER        
  IN THERE TO COVER IT.         

445
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:04,989
 PUT IN SOME CARROTS,           
SOME CELERY AND ONION.          

446
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:08,059
SIMMER FOR THREE HOURS.         
        PULL IT OUT, LET IT COOL
         AND THEN TEAR INTO IT. 

447
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,627
WE CHOP IT.                     
                OKAY, LIKE THIS?

448
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,195
                       1/2 INCH?
   THAT'S IT.                   
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.               

449
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,197
           WE PUT THE POTATOES  
         AND THE ONION IN FIRST.
OKAY.                           

450
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,132
     THEN SOME BUTTER. WE LET   
   THAT COOK FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

451
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,134
          AND THAT MEAT'S GOT   
      SOME SALT IN IT ALREADY...
YEAH.                           

452
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,870
                 SO I KIND OF   
               UNDER-SALT THIS. 

453
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,538
       SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND PUT
           A LITTLE PEPPER,     

454
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,807
 AND THEN WE PUT THE CORNED BEEF
     IN AT THE LAST MINUTE.     

455
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:25,876
 BUT NOW WHAT IS THAT OVER THERE
    ON THAT PART OF THE WALL?   

456
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:28,746
                    I'M SORRY...
OH, THEY MOVED IT.              
   NEVER MIND.                  

457
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:30,748
                   ARE YOU READY
                    TO TASTE IT?
I'M READY TO ROCK.              

458
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:33,551
MMM. SMELLS KILLER.             
       MMM.                     

459
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,553
          THAT CORNED BEEF JUST 
         CARRIES ITS OWN FLAVOR,

460
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,222
   AND THAT REALLY IS GOOD BEEF,
         TOO, YOU'RE RIGHT.     
          IT'S GOOD BEEF.       

461
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,158
            THERE'S ENOUGH JUICE
              GOING ON WITH IT, 

462
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:43,227
            I'M NOT EVEN LOOKIN'
              FOR THE KETCHUP.  
DO YOU WANT TO PUT A LITTLE     
   GREEN CHILE IN THERE?        

463
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,229
       OH, YEAH. I HOPE I'M NOT 
        BREAKING ANY, YOU KNOW, 

464
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,231

YOU CAN'T COME TO NEW MEXICO    
AND NOT EAT OUR GREEN CHILE.

                HEY, WHAT'S THAT
                   OVER THERE?

00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,577
         AND OFF HE GOES        
   WITH THE CORNED BEEF HASH.   

470
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,113
           HOW'S THE HASH TODAY?
           IT'S GOOD.           

471
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:04,248
    I MIXED A LITTLE GREEN CHILE
          INTO MINE AND OH.

474
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:13,257
