1
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:03,135
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
   and we're going round two,   

2
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:05,870
 revisiting some of our favorite
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

3
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:09,208
   This is "Triple D Nation."   

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,011
    Over the years, I've seen   
       and tasted it all.       

5
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:13,879
    This is ridiculous, dude.   

6
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:17,216
        But it turns out,       
    it was only the beginning   

7
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:19,418
    because "Triple D" joints   
      have been blowing up.     

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,886
       Did you see that?!       

9
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:23,688
   And we're going back to see  
         what's cooking.        

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,890
      Like on this trip...      

11
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,157
    Look at that power bite.    

12
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,694
     ...it's a meat overload    
      all over the country.     

13
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:31,029
                  Awesome job.  
     In West Yellowstone...     

14
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,864
         Here, hold that for me.

15
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,034
  ...a brand-new barbecue joint 
 definitely not on the radar... 

16
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,502
   -We just opened up Friday.   
           -Four days.          

17
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:38,637
              Oh, 4 days then.  

18
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:39,772
       That's even better.      
         -Yeah, 4 days.         

19
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:41,373
      ...but ready to share     
        with the nation.        

20
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,774
               Dynamite, man.   

21
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,843
    Plus and old-school diner   
         in Nashville...        

22
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,912
Didn't Rick James do a song     
 about super Greek?             

23
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:48,380
Oh, that was "Super Freak."     

24
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,916
       ...doubling down on      
 their Greek-American mash-up...

25
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,851
      You're kind of like the UN
               in Flavortown.   

26
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,721
         -I love flavor.        
      -...and in Denver...      

27
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,922
         You're going to mess up
  the way people look at a taco.

28
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,458
 ...a Native American eatery... 

29
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,559
        He's going Barney Rubble
               on that thing.   

30
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,529
        ...where culture        
      and cuisine collide.      

31
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:05,630
             I've never hunched 
               a taco before,   

32
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,999
       but I'll do it this time.

33
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:12,270
    Old friends, new places,    
 and more off-the-hook flavors. 

34
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:15,607
     That's all right here,     
right now, on "Triple D Nation."

35
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:23,415
                     ♪♪         

36
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,217
     So this is what happens    
      on "Triple D Nation."     

37
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,818
    I go to check out joints    
          I've been to.         

38
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,620
      I go check out joints     
         I want to see,         

39
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,956
    and I go check out joints   
that I didn't even know existed,

40
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,824
          so we're here         
  in West Yellowstone, Montana, 

41
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,426
   right outside of the park,   

42
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,895
and my wife cruises by yesterday
   and picks up some barbecue.  

43
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,830
Everybody in the camp goes nuts,

44
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,966
 so, of course, I've got to come
        and check it out.       

45
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,434
       Hunter, is this it?      

46
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,103
 HUNTER: This is it, right here,
     Firehole Bar-B-Que Company.

47
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:49,041
     It's amazing barbecue,     
      some of the best that     
      you're going to find.     

48
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:51,243
         -Rack of ribs.         
      -They just opened up      

49
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:54,112
        a short time ago,       
    and it's just excellent.    

50
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,714
                There you go.   

51
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,716
             WOMAN:             
  They have a trailer out back  
  where they smoke their meats, 

52
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:00,919
   so they can get it in here   
  nice and hot and ready to go. 

53
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,655
 FIERI: That trailer is property
      of little Mike Shults     

54
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,057
     and his dad, Big Mike.     

55
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,858
          Your old man caught me

56
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,795
        sniffing around the back
     of the smoker this morning,

57
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,263
                 and I said,    
 "Well, how long you been open?"

58
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,932
                "Two weeks."    

59
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,233
We haven't been open            
      2 weeks.                  

60
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,668
    We just opened up Friday.   
           -Four days.          

61
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,536
              Oh, 4 days then.  
             That's even better.

62
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,804
           -Four days.          
         -Yeah, 4 days.         

63
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,874
       4 days or 4 years,       
    this place was so legit,    

64
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,343
    I knew I had to roll back   
      with my son, Hunter,      

65
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,544
       and my buddy, Paul.      

66
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:27,745
Million years that he'd show up,

67
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,614
        you know, 4 days        
        after he opened.        

68
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,551
  But the short time time frame 
     is just at this joint.     

69
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,619
    These dudes are actually    
         restaurant vets        

70
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,289
      with a place in Idaho     
      called Little Mike's,     

71
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,957
   so you could say they know   
       what they're doing,      

72
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,159
    especially when it comes    
           to brisket.          

73
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,030
   We're trimming the brisket   
  to about a quarter-inch fat.  

74
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,833
   Once I'm done trimming it,   
      I've got a rub here,      

75
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,301
     get some salt, pepper,     

76
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,436
      granulated garlic and     
 a little bit of seasoned salt. 

77
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,038
       It just brings out       
        the beef flavor,        

78
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,042
         and, you know,         
     it's not overpowering.     

79
00:02:57,044 --> 00:03:00,379
   The briskets, I cook at 220  
    for about 12 to 15 hours,   

80
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:03,315
    and I use a hickory wood.   
       It's not too harsh.      

81
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:04,849
It gives a perfect smoke flavor,

82
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,918
      and it seems to work      
    for what I'm doing here.    

83
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,320
            Brisket is not easy.

84
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:09,988
        I mean, that's what made
    my mind up about this visit.

85
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,323
You like the fatty part         
   of the brisket?              

86
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:14,793
                Come on, now.   
     What do I look like I like?

87
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,261
     Here's some                
  of that brisket.              

88
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:17,729
              You know this is  
              my brisket test.  

89
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,532
      You just give that brisket
    that little tug right there,

90
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,601
             and it just starts 
               to fall apart,   

91
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:25,804
        enough fat on there that
  it still stays nice and moist.

92
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,339
    Unbelievable.               

93
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,807
     You got the right amount of
   salt, right amount of pepper.

94
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,341
              It needs nothing. 

95
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:34,279
       It's really moist.       
  It's got really good flavor.  

96
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,416
        It's very tender.       
  It's got a little pull to it. 

97
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,351
  They do an awesome job at it. 

98
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:42,354
       -What do you think?      
  -I am sleeping good tonight.  

99
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:45,557
     Now, what do folks say that
    aren't really super familiar

100
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,360
with barbecue when they come in,
         and they see this setup

101
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:51,096
           with the white bread,
       the onion and the pickle?

102
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,432
We had to put the bread         
underneath the meat.            

103
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,566
That way, they quit asking for  
butter to butter their bread.   

104
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,102
          That's the power bite,
                right there.    

105
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:58,770
      -Yeah. See? That's --     
        -Onion, pickle...       

106
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,305
             -Yeah.             
     -...some of the brisket    
           and mop it           

107
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:01,640
               in a little bit  
                  of sauce.     

108
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:02,640
                That's legit.   

109
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,042
             FIERI:             
  But I can't just stop there.  

110
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:07,779
 Those ribs are calling my name.

111
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,849
  Here, I have the              
mustard-and-pickle juice,       

112
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,385
just to get the rub to stick    
to the rib, and right here,     

113
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,920
I use my brisket rub            
that we made up earlier,        

114
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,456
      and after                 
 we season them up,             

115
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,192
I cook them for 2 hours         
   at 300 degrees.              

116
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:23,261
We sauce them with some of our  
house homemade barbecue sauce,  

117
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,064
and I just kind of kick it up   
a notch with some brown sugar,  

118
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,333
     some honey,                
a little sweet chile sauce,     

119
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,868
and it sweetens it up           
just a little bit more.         

120
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,070
Wrap them in foil, and I stick  
them back on the smoker         

121
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,471
  for another hour.             

122
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,672
You want to them tender,        
but I don't like them           

123
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,541
falling off the bone.           

124
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:43,482
                     ♪♪         

125
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,484
     Seriously?                 

126
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:48,219
           -It hurts.           
   -I want you guys to learn.   

127
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,488
      This is an exercise, okay?

128
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,022
     I'm sweaty.                

129
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,225
             That's a good rib. 

130
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:55,293
         Here, hold that for me.

131
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,362
            All right. Go ahead.
              You guys can try. 

132
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,497
Falls right off the bone.       

133
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:05,236
   They're done just perfect.   
   It's got a good clean bite   
          to the bone.          

134
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,905
    They've got a good smoke.   

135
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,373
    The cut on them was good.   

136
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,543
   The meat was good, and the   
 barbecue sauce was phenomenal. 

137
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,381
  FIERI: Look how simple it is, 
        straightforward,        

138
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,650
       five smoked items,       
         a couple sides.        

139
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,852
 Of course, there's no-brainers 
           like beans,          

140
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,855
  but they've got a corn salad  
       that's off the cob.      

141
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,391
   We'll start with the corn,   
 add the cheese right in there, 

142
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:29,394
    onion, bell pepper, mayo,   
    mix everything together,    

143
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,863
     and then we will top it    
  with chili-cheese corn chips. 

144
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,131
         Now, see, we didn't get
              the instructions  

145
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,599
              on the corn salad 
               when we had it.  

146
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,001
               We didn't know   
     that you're supposed to put

147
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,403
            the chili-corn chips
       on top of the corn salad.

148
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:41,206
               Dynamite, man.   

149
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,009
       It's kind of mild,       
        so it complements       

150
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,410
   the smokiness of the meat.   

151
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,080
   The creaminess of the corn,  
and it also had the crisp taste.

152
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:49,614
       It was really good.      

153
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,283
      I'm glad that I caught you
             in your first week.

154
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:53,218
             -Yeah.             
         -Don't forget.         

155
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,088
              We show back up,  
                cut in line.    

156
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,690
       Uh-huh.                  

157
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,625
      I'm definitely picky      
        with my barbecue,       

158
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,828
      and to find something     
           that legit           

159
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,696
        in the middle of        
   the Fieri Family vacation,   

160
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,698
        I have a feeling,       
  well, we might be hitting up  

161
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,834
           Yellowstone          
      a little more often.      

162
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,035
   And coming up in Denver...   

163
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,571
          You dare me?          

164
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,906
    ...check out what Native    
   American food is all about.  

165
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,975
       I've never hunched       
         a taco before,         

166
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,243
    but I'll do it this time.   

167
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,845
        I guarantee you,        
  it will knock your socks off. 

168
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,248
     You're going to mess up    
 the way people look at a taco. 

169
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,925
   FIERI: Now, when I visited   
        Denver, Colorado,       

170
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,928
     it ended up being home     
   to "Triple D"'s very first   

171
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,198
   Native American joint, and   
 this place did not disappoint. 

172
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,067
     The dudes were awesome.    
     -Can I help who's next?    

173
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,603
    The energy was contagious   
   and the food out of bounds,  

174
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,739
          and now, it's         
       a "Triple D" double      

175
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,341
     since they've opened up    
       their second spot.       

176
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,311
         This is Tocabe:        
   An American Indian Eatery.   

177
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,415
 Dips with summer squash relish.

178
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,351
              Are you familiar  
           with our salsas, hon?

179
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:00,952
        I am.                   

180
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:05,157
    We saw Tocabe "Triple D"    
      right before we moved     
       here from Chicago.       

181
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:08,693
     It was our first stop,     
 and now, we're total regulars. 

182
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,428
       What's a better way      
          to introduce          

183
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,232
    somebody to your culture    
       than through food?       

184
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:17,636
Frybread nuggets up.            

185
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,570
FIERI: And I got a lesson in the
        lingo when I met        

186
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,740
   Osage Nation Tribal Member   
          Ben Jacobs...         

187
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,442
  This guy owns it              

188
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,578
  ...and his business partner,  
          Matt Shondra.         

189
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,979
                   Tocabe,      
             what does it mean? 

190
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:30,515
It's an old Osage translation   
 for the color blue,            

191
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,383
which is my mother's            
   favorite color.              

192
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,651
        When Guy came in.       

193
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,053
    You know, he really held    
           the respect          

194
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,589
 for what we were trying to do, 
    being culturally driven,    

195
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,925
       and that was really      
        important to us.        

196
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:42,727
 A big part of who Indian people
         are is getting together

197
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:43,995
                and feasting.   

198
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,530
    FIERI: So we jumped right   
   into their Native American   

199
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,466
  specialties like frybread...  

200
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:48,800
        Whoa.                   
 Gosh, this is thin.            

201
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,068
              Toss that bad boy 
               right in there.  

202
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,603
I think I just turned           
    into a pita.                

203
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:54,539
      ...which was part of      
   that fantastic Indian taco.  

204
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,074
Let's start with some           
    black beans,                

205
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,743
chicken we made earlier,        
  lettuce, cheese,              

206
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,411
make it look real pretty        
with the sour cream.            

207
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,482
        Look at that power bite.
                    Mmm.        

208
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:06,818
   Frybread is the bomb with the
  chicken that's been marinated.

209
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,819
 You don't need it.             

210
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,688
                I don't need    
              no stinking fork. 

211
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,223
                You dare me?    

212
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,158
             I've never hunched 
               a taco before,   

213
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,760
       but I'll do it this time.

214
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:18,696
   Just, like, went at it and   
   picked it up and just took   
           a big bite,          

215
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,031
  which was a nice compliment.  

216
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,366
    That means he likes it if   
 he's going to dig in like that.

217
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:22,901
           I'm going to tell you
               something, bro.  

218
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,969
         You're going to mess up
  the way people look at a taco.

219
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,771
             -Yeah.             
          -Look at him.         

220
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,340
              Look at the smile 
             on that guy's face.

221
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,441
             "Yeah."            
          -Bring it in.         

222
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:30,976
                Awesome job.    

223
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,911
      What are we into now?     
          -Bison ribs.          

224
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,445
            Flip them over here.
  We got a membrane on the back.

225
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,914
              You don't want to 
                 have that.     

226
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,715
             Nice...            
         -Butter knife.         

227
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,184
 Just nice and easy,            
   nice and easy.               

228
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,919
      Guy showed, you know,     
        a different style       

229
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,253
         on pulling off         
         the membranes.         

230
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,521
 The reason you use             
  the butter knife              

231
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,589
   is because that              
paring knife will tear it.      

232

             Get that right off.

234
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,261
 We actually kind of incorporate
 that and show our team members 

235
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,796
        a simplified way        
      to pull that membrane     

236
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,731
          off the back.

00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,668
Mmm. Huge flavor, on point      
   with that one.               
                       Awesome.

        He's going Barney Rubble
               on that thing.

    Yes, you did.

           Bison ribs?          

247
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,291
 FIERI: These days, they've got 
        a second location       

248
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,827
        with their bison        
  sporting a brand-new look --  

249
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,562
 inside the braised bison bowl. 

250
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,564
     So we're going to make     
       our bison dry rub.

00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,100
          Rubbed sage,          
 ground New Mexican red chiles,

00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,501
    dried sweet corn powder,    

253
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,505
   kosher salt, black pepper,   
      garlic, cumin seeds,      

254
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:35,573
         smoked paprika.        

255
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,509
 We like to grill it, so we get 
      a nice sear on there.     

256
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,243
      We'll put foil on it      
     and put it in the oven.    

257
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,911
     This is going to braise    
          for 12 hours.         

258
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,581
 Pull it apart after it braises.

259

    FIERI: And it's all about   
       building the bowl.

 JACOBS: Wild rice, pinto beans,
     the braised bison here,    

261
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,723
    lettuce, cheddar cheese,    

262
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:55,059
      and the fresh squash      
         relish on top.         

263
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:58,796
  We start with yellow squash,  
   zucchini, jicama, habanero,  

264
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:02,400
     cilantro, kosher salt,     
     lemon juice, red onion,    

265
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,002
        and then we mix.        

266
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,136
  So now, this is ready to eat.

    Braised Bison Posu Bowl.    

268
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:11,075
 WOMAN #2: The shredded bison is
        super flavorful,        

269
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:14,145
         really tender,         
        sweet and savory.       

270
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,881
  The squash relish is a little 
 bit sweet, a little bit spicy. 

271
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:20,218
        It was supergood.       

272
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,220
    JACOBS: Guy told us that,   
   you know, whatever he had,   

273
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,487
         "Make sure that        
      you put it out there      

274
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,822
    because people are going    
          to want it,"          

275
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,158
   and it was very much true,   
        so we made a menu       

276
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,027
  that had everything down to,  
       like, chicken taco       

277
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,496
         and bison ribs         
       called Guy's Menu.       

278
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,498
  We had a lot of women come in 
 and thought that it was saying,

279
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,033
   like, it was just for men,   
         and we're like,        

280
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,836
        "No, no, no, no!        
 It is not. It's for everybody."

281
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,704
  So now, it's the "Triple D."

283
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,775
            and I'm telling you,
              I learned a ton.  

284
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:44,909
    Awesome, man.               
    That's great.

00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:48,246
        -Appreciate that.       
         -Appreciate it.        

286
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,247
          So look out.          

287
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,849
       Besides doubling up      
          on locations,         

288
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,717
     they have a food truck     
          rolling out,          

289
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,519

            is, guys,           

290
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,989
    is, how much for delivery   
         in California?         

291
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,257
    Up next, in Nashville...    

292
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:00,525
  That is so good.              

293
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,393
       ...a little advice       
      can go a long way...      

294
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,063
   Guy Fieri, he encouraged me  
      to have my own place.

   FIERI: Now, check this out.

00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,647

            -Choice.            
  -There's a lot of other meats 

346
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,213
              you can grind up  
             to make a meatball.

347
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,414
     That's what                
   make us unique.              

348
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,749
            And then what are we
                going to do,    

349
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,084
             make some hot dogs 
       out of filet mignon next?

350
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:08,619
     What's the big deal if     
 I'm grinding the meat sirloin? 

351
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,821
    It's going to taste good.   

352
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,222
             FIERI:             
      What's the big deal?      

353
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,157
  I mean, it's Choice New York  
           steak, man.          

354
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,693
      Most people just eat      
       it whole as it is.       

355
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,295
Doesn't look very happy.        

356
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,831
  Don't be sorry for the sirloin
      because you will taste it.

357
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,033
You just took a New York steak  
  and ground it up.             

358
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,634
        -That's for sure.       
       -That is for sure.       

359
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,969
   That's exactly               
   what happened.               

360
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,504
     I was here.                
   I witnessed it.              

361
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,506
             Season the meat -- 
          kosher salt, nutmeg...

362
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,308
          -Love spice?          
   -Love spice, a little bit.   

363
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,776
        Okay.                   
    Chicken base?               

364
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:34,445
Grated onion with the juice,    
some Parmesan cheese...         

365
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:35,647
             -Okay.             
      -...red wine vinegar,     

366
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,048
                 some panko.    

367
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,383
              Going to make it  
              like a football.  

368
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:40,651
That's not a football.          
That is a lawn dart.            

369
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,254
                 45 minutes,    
                250 degrees.    

370
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:46,791
             Take it and dump it
                in the sauce.   

371
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,326
                   Enjoy.       

372
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,194
 You come to a great            
American-Greek restaurant,      

373
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,129
 this is what you're            
going to get -- super Greek.    

374
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,265
Didn't Rick James do            
a song about super Greek?       

375
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:57,134
    Oh, that was                
   "Super Freak."               

376
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,536
    I like them.                
     Great job.                 

377
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,804
           -Thank you.          
   -Here's your Soutzoukakia.   

378
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:02,072
You just can't go wrong in here.

379
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,207
         What are we onto, boss?

380
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,342
 We're about to make            
    the kotopita.               

381
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,610
 Koto, the chicken.             

382
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:06,744
                 Koto, okay.    

383
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,479
       -Pita, pita bread.       
        -Like pita bread.       

384
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,014
      Kotopita.                 

385
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,483
    How many times on "Triple D"
      have we shot Greek joints.

386
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,085
               No one has ever  
           broke it down for me.

387
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,086
                  Nice job.     
             You're the teacher.

388
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,755
You make the chicken pie        
     mix first.                 

389
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:18,890
     We'll start                
  with some butter.             

390
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:20,425
        -Chicken breast.        
         -Cut in cubes.         

391
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,559
                    Okay.       
                 All right.     

392
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:22,560
And I'm going to add            
a little bit of dill...         

393
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:23,694
                 Fresh dill.    

394
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,963
...some chopped onion,          
   chopped garlic,              

395
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,697
a little bit of kosher salt,    
    black pepper,               

396
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,833
  carrots, celery,              
 some chicken base.             

397
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:29,901
               Cook this down?  

398
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:31,769
    Let it simmer               
for about 30 minutes.           

399
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,037
        Now, we're going to make
        the rest of the mixture.

400
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,238
        Yes.                    
It's like the beginning of,     

401
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,773
      like, chicken potpie.     
        -Chicken potpie.        

402
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,777
Here we go, the Parmesan cheese,
  Feta, the béchamel, some eggs.

403
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,980
A little extra binder,          
and now you got to get into it. 

404
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,648
           -That's it.          
 -So now, we get the filo dough.

405
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,450
How did they make it            
     that thin?                 

406
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,851
                They flip it.   

407
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,052
   Do that again.               

408
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,320
             Flipping the dough.

409
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,922
Throw me some music to that     
 and one more time.             

410
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:52,123
      -Flipping the dough.      
          -Keep going.          

411
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,458
      -Flipping the dough.      
          -Slow motion.         

412
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,660
             Flipping the dough.

413
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,263
              Big, nice scoop,  
        now a little bit of mix,

414
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,798
         press it down a little,
               flip it over...  

415
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,600
   -Gracious with the butter.   
         -I love butter.        

416
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,669
        40 minutes, 350 degrees.

417
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:08,672
   Look are those.              
That thing is crunch-a-licious. 

418
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:09,741
        Wow.                    
 That's not creamy.             

419
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,076
   Knocked it out               
   with the filo.               

420
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,479
            Kotopita.           
 After the "Triple D" show here,

421
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,949
      we had people coming      
        from everywhere,        

422
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:19,150
     lines out of the door.     

423
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:21,219
        People basically        
      wanted Soutzoukakia.      

424
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,688
They wanted to get the kotopita.

425
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,290
 We sold so much of that stuff. 

426
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,692
    FIERI: But those weren't    
         the only dishes        

427
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:28,959
   flying out of the kitchen.   

428
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,361
     Lamburger.                 

429
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,895
       Lamburger -- a little bit
   of kosher salt, black pepper,

430
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,031
               the love spice,  
          a little bit of panko.

431
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:37,768
          Scoop just 4 ounce and
 another 4 ounce -- two patties.

432
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,969
Why won't you just get          
   a bigger scoop?              

433
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,171
             Well, I don't have 
                bigger scoop.   

434
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,307
-You want one for your birthday?
             -Sure.             

435
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:45,243
      Eight birthdays now,      
     and I'm still waiting.     

436
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,044
    -So what goes down first?   
           -The bacon.          

437
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,380
Then once I have it cooked      
  halfway at least,             

438
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:50,714
  I but the burger              
   on the flattop.              

439
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,516
         -Makes it sear.        
     -Flip this bacon over.     

440
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,251
   So you're going to fortify it
                with some fat   

441
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,586
            into that lean lamb.

442
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:56,854
              Now, we put some  
              of the charbroil? 

443
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:58,723
Yes, and I put the Swiss cheese 
    on top of it,               

444
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:02,126
then the bun here, the onion,   
lettuce and Roma tomato.        

445
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,128
                Ready to go?    
             It's a big burger. 

446
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,930
 Crushed red pepper,            
    there we go.                

447
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:08,532
             Served with fries, 
                look at that.   

448
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,334
        Mmm.                    
  That is so good.              

449
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:13,604
When you say, "Great American," 
and "Greek cuisine,"            

450
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,808
      together,                 
that's exactly what that is.    

451
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,210
      And today, Chef Adel      
       is packing new lamb      

452
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:20,678
     dishes into his menu...    

453
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,613
         Greek-style lamb shank,
         table four for Richard.

454
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:25,216
     ...with this next-level    
     Greek-style lamb shank.    

455
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:28,752
 I add some celery, carrots, and
 onion in the bottom of the pan.

456
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:33,091
   I season my lamb with salt,  
       pepper, olive oil.       

457
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:35,559
  I braise it with some broth.  

458
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,829
It comes out within 3 or 4 hours
          just tender.          

459
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,565
          -And on top?          
          -Orzo pasta.          

460
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,501
 I sauté my orzo with some onion
           and garlic.          

461
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,503
 I add some diced tomato to it. 

462
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,706
  I lay it on top of the lamb,  
 and I bake it back in the oven 

463
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,442
     for another 45 minutes.    

464
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:54,045
 I am a lamb fan from way back. 

465
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:57,648
  Nobody that I know of serves  
     a lamb shank like this.    

466
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,584
          It's killer.          
         It's terrific.         

467
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:02,720
            WOMAN #3:           
    The meat is very tender,    
    comes right off the bone.   

468
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,855
    The orzo is not something   
   you would typically expect.  

469
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,391
    It's just a nice mixture    
           altogether.          

470
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,593
              -350.             
           -350, yeah.          

471
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,863
Good job looking at the camera. 
 Take over the show.            

472
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,131
   See you later.               
      Good-bye.                 

473
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,532
   Put the shades               
on the back of the head.        

474
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,400
                There you go.   
                  Good-bye.     

475
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,070
   Guy Fieri, he encouraged me  
      to have my own diner.     

476
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,738
   You're putting               
all the love into that one.     

477
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,073
         -That's right.         
        -I like it, man.        

478
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,208
           Great job.           
           -Thank you.          

479
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,009
     FIERI: And guess what?     
          He listened.          

480
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,345
     Just wait until you see    
         what he's doing        

481
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,213
 across town when we come back. 

482
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,881
  You've got a lot              
on your hands here, brother.    

483
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,016
   You just wait.               

484
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,785
You wait until you see          
   what's coming.               

485
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:45,429
   A few years ago, I stopped   
  into Athens Family Restaurant 

486
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,964
          in Nashville.         

487
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,167
  Now, when I say, "Nashville," 
 what kind of food you thinking?

488
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:52,236
  Exactly, great American food, 
     but when I put a little    

489
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,572
   "Triple D" spin on things,   
        what do you get?        

490
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,708
   You know it, great American  
        and Greek cuisine       

491
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,711
   where Chef Adel was living   
      the dream cooking up      

492
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:04,115
    Greek-American favorites,   
  but he had even bigger dreams 

493
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:09,120
      and opened this joint     
across town, the Bellevue Diner.

494
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:12,456
   Guy Fieri, he encouraged me  
      to have my own place.     

495
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,192
         It worked out,         
       a dream come true.       

496
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,461
    Both Bellevue and Athens    
        are going strong        

497
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,930
      and look a lot alike,     

498
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,933
   but the food, well, that's   
    a whole different story.    

499
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,401
    We went more Americanized   
         with our menu.         

500
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:29,673
I want to add to it some classic
  dishes that you have at home  

501
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,475
        that your grandma       
      used to make for you.     

502
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,945
    FIERI: He's talking about   
    stick-to-your-ribs dishes   

503
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,013
    like the bomb breakfast,    
            Reubens,            

504
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,614
    and even beef Stroganoff.   

505
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,016
  MAN #2: It's a comfort food.  

506
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,417
         With the pasta,        
    it's one of my favorites.   

507
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,620
      But he didn't totally     
      get away from Greek.      

508
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,288
   Get me a bifteki sandwich.   

509
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,290
      The bifteki sandwich      
      is a sandwich you get     

510
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:50,094
     in Greece out of those     
       souvlavakia shops.       

511
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:54,831
   I started with ground beef   
         and ground lamb        

512
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,903
     with some grated onion,    
      garlic, salt, pepper.     

513
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,305
       I make it supreme,       
        which I grill it        

514
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,108
      with tomatoes, onion,     
     peppers, and mushroom.     

515
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,577
       I wrap it together       
    with a homemade tzatziki    

516
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:07,912
         and pita bread.        

517
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:09,713
            WOMAN #3:           
     It's very, very tender.    

518
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:13,317
  The pitas are very good here, 
        the best in town.       

519
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,254
MAN #3: You can taste the onions
    and the peppers in there,   

520
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,656
  and it tastes very authentic  
         like in Greece.        

521
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,124
 FIERI: And there's a few things
          you can find          

522
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,994
         at both joints         
        like this classic       

523
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,662
     Greek number, ktipiti.     

524
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,863
       A ktipiti for Alexandria.

525
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:31,869
    Ktipiti is spicy Feta dip   
   with some roasted peppers.   

526
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,804
      FIERI: And that's no      
       store-bought Feta.       

527
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:37,542
        I make the cheese       
  with whole milk, some rennet. 

528
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,409
          I salt it up.         

529
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,946
Within 4 days, it's hardened up.

530
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:43,147
           It take it.          
           I grate it.          

531
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:45,149
    I roast red bell peppers.   

532
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:49,020
  I blend it, add in some olive 
      oil and lemon juice,      

533
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,156
         cayenne pepper,        
       blend it together.       

534
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,558
   You serve it with hot pita.  

535
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,026
   MAN #4: The ktipiti is just  
        a little spicier        

536
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,494
      than pimento cheese,      
        extremely creamy.       

537
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,096
You can taste the peppers in it.

538
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:00,998
  I think that's what gives it  
    a little different flair.   

539
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,369
   A little bit of spice and a  
 little bit of heat is so good. 

540
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,570
     Give me one egg, over-easy.

541
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,238
       Chef Adel realized       
       his American Dream       

542
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,975
       through this place       
       and through Athens.      

543
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,376
        Coming right now.       

544
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,178
     Being that Adel's dream    
  was to open up the restaurant 

545
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,381
  and be successful as a chef,  
he's done very well for himself.

546
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,849
                  Kotopita.     

547
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:21,852
FIERI: And the "Triple D Nation"
has come calling to both joints.

548
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:24,055
   They stand here next to me   
         on the picture         

549
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,389
     and take picture of me,    

550
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,525
       like I'm, you know,      
     Brad Pitt or something.    

551
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,393
          [ Laughter ]          

552
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,061
You're doing exactly what       
 we call talk about,            

553
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,264
and that's living the --        
You're living your dream        

554
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,665
    You're living               
the American Dream, man.        

555
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,966
     -I am living my dream.     
        -Congratulations.       

556
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,201
              And that dream is 
                coming true.    

557
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,236
   That's awesome.              

558
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,073
  Man, it's so fantastic seeing 
        all these joints        

559
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,608
       living their dream,      

560
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,878
like the Denver spot dishing out
   real-deal culture cuisine,   

561
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,282
 and the Greek-American mash-up 
   doubling down in Nashville   

562
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,884
     and even the brand-new     
      killer barbecue spot      

563
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:57,288
   I staked out in the middle   
      of West Yellowstone.      

564
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,956
        They're all part        
    of the "Triple D Nation,"   

565
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,359
    and we've got plenty more   
         to catch up on.        

566
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:03,494
     I'll see you next week.    

567
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:04,762
    I'm trying to help here.    

568
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,965
           -Time out.           
  -No. You don't -- I need you. 

569
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,102
         Turn around. Show them.
           Show them the shades.

570
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,636
