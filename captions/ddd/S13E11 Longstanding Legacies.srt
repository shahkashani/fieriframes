      I JUST LOST A POINT.      

201
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,583
      I'M GONNA GET             
      MY BADGE TAKEN AWAY.      

202
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,585
       THE MOZZAREL GIVES       
       GREAT TEXTURE.           

203
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,587

205
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,325

IN TOWN, I LOVE IT.             

209
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,668
IT'S PHENOMENAL TO HAVE A       
NEIGHBORHOOD ESTABLISHMENT LIKE 
THIS                            

210
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,670

00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,940
OH MY GOD,                      
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.              

227
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:46,584

   THAT I'M A ROCKER.

THE TOMATOES                    
DON'T COME FROM CALIFORNIA,     
THEY COME FROM UP THE ROAD.

    TWO FINE-DINING VETERANS    
    BRINGING HIGH-END FOOD      
    TO EVERYDAY PEOPLE...       

245
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,763
IT'S THREE OR FOUR STAR DINING  
AT ONE STAR PRICES.             

246
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,500
     WE THOUGHT WE COULD APPLY  
     THE SKILLS THAT WE HAD USED
     IN FINE DINING             

247
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,968
         TO CREATE JUST A FUNKY,
         CASUAL ENVIRONMENT.    

248
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,572
(Guy)                           
BUILT AROUND THE TYPE OF COOKING
THEY GREW UP ON.                

249
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:42,640

    DONE A LITTLE DIFFERENT.    
IT'S CONFIT, MMM.

THE CRISPY CHICKEN LEG.         

255
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:58,056
CRISPY AS IF IT WERE FRIED,     
BUT IT'S CONFIT.                
                           OKAY.

256
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,524
I'M JUST GONNA POP THAT OUT     
AND TAKE THAT OFF.              

257
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,226

  OKAY, NEXT UP.                

258
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,928
  (Chris)                       
  WHAT I WANT TO DO             
  IS I WANT TO CURE THESE       
  SO WE CAN GET THAT CRISPINESS.

259
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,064
AND WHAT KIND OF CRISPY         
ARE WE TALKIN' ABOUT?           
           WE'RE TALKIN' CRISPY.

260
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:10,535
FRIED CHICKEN CRISPY            
WITHOUT THE BATTER?             
          YEAH, THAT'S BASICALLY
          WHAT WE'RE GOING FOR. 

261
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,937
    SALT, A LITTLE WHITE PEPPER,
    A FEW SPRIGS OF THYME.      

262
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,473
THAT'S JUST GONNA START SUCKIN' 
THAT MOISTURE OUT.              
                          RIGHT.

263
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:16,941
             AT THIS POINT      
             WE'VE GOT OUR CURE,

264
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,544
     WE'VE GOT SOME EXTRA FLAVOR
     GOING ON WITH THE THYME    

265
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:20,812
           AND THIS WHITE PEPPER
           AND EVERYTHING.      

266
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,747
        I'LL PUT THIS UN-COVERED
        IN THE FRIDGE OVERNIGHT.

267
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,014
            SO WE HAVE OUR NICE,
            DRIED-OUT LEGS.     

268
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,819
    WE'RE GONNA TAKE SOME WATER,
    RINSE OFF THE EXCESS.       
EXCESS SALT.                    

269
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,488
      SHAKE 'EM OUT, SHINGLE,   
      IT'S ALL ABOUT BEING FLAT.

270
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,891
  IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS FLAT,  
  LIKE IF THAT'S CURLED UNDER...
YEAH, IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?

271
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,761

    CLOVES OF GARLIC IN THERE   
    AND VEGETABLE OIL.          

272
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:40,432
       CAREFUL NOT TO UPSET     
       YOUR BEAUTIFUL SHINGLING.
SHINGLING.

          JUST COVER.           

274
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,569
           COVER WITH SOME FOIL.

275
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,971

             MAYBE FOUR HOURS.  

277
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,776
   (Guy)                        
   WE ARE LOOKING FOR THIS      
   TO GET CONFIT IN THE SENSE...

278
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:55,213
           I MEAN, IT'S GONNA BE
           ALMOST SHREDABLE?    
IT WILL BE VERY SHREDABLE.      

279
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,750
THIS IS COMPLETELY FINE.        

280
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,718
GENTLY LIFT,                    
PAT THIS DRY A LITTLE BIT       

281

            A CRISP ON THE SKIN.

286
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,665
            YOU'VE RENDERED DOWN
            A LOT OF THE FAT    
            THAT'S IN THERE.    

287
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,468

AND JUST PULLS APART            

297
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,359
AND THEN YOU GET                
THE CRISPINESS OF THE SKIN.     

298
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:45,630

00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,340
           (Guy)

  FASTER THAN YOU CAN SLICE 'EM.
I BET YOU COULD.                

344
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,855
       WE USE LEIDENHEIMER BREAD
       BECAUSE IT'S THE BEST.   

345
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:53,824
      TO KEEP IT AUTHENTIC      
      WE STILL CUT THE ENDS OFF.
THE ENDS OFF.                   

346
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:57,495
      A LITTLE CLARIFIED BUTTER.
CLARIFIED BUTTER'S GONNA GO ON. 

347

         I'M GOING TO TOAST THIS
         REAL QUICK.            

348

  AND MAYONNAISE.               
OKAY.                           

349
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,903
 THEN WE MAKE                   
 THESE BREAD-AND-BUTTER PICKLES,
 WHICH ARE DELICIOUS            

350
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,439
       AND WE JUST PUREE 'EM    
       AND MAKE A PICKLE RELISH.

351
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,907
        THEN THE DELICIOUS PORK.

352
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,377
 YOU REALLY FEEL                
 THAT'S ENOUGH PORK FOR ME, SON?

353
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,845

                  SOME TOMATOES,

00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,381
   SALT, PEPPER, THIS LETTUCE,  
   AND IT'S A FINISHED SANDWICH.

355
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,150
LOOK AT THAT, HMM?              

356
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,921
THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THAT,     
THAT I'D KICK OFF THE PLATE.    

357
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,723
LOVE THE PICKLE RELISH,

IT WOULD BE A GOOD MUSTARD.     

359
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:32,663
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT             
A LITTLE BIT OF SMOKE           
ON THE PORK,                    

360
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,599
BUT THE PORK IS SUPER TENDER    
AND THERE'S A LOT OF MOISTURE,  

361
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,001
THERE'S A LOT OF FLAVOR         
INSIDE OF IT, THIS IS DYNAMITE. 

362
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,804
PORK BOY,                       
READY TO GO.                    

363
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,939
WHATEVER CHRIS DOES IN THE BACK 
MAKES THE PORK RIGHT.           

364
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,808
THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS           
AND THE PRICES ARE RIGHT.       

365
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,344

THAT LOVE YA.                   

366
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,611
KEEP GOIN', KEEP DOIN' IT.      

367
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,814
THERE'S NO GLASS CEILING        
ON THIS GLASS ONION.            

368
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,017
           (Guy)                
           UP NEXT...           
OH, LOOK AT THAT MAGIC TRICK.   

369
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,685
     (Guy)                      
     WE'RE HEADIN'              
     TO ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND,    

370
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:57,288
      WHERE AN IRISH PUB...     
ANYTHING WRAPPED IN CABBAGE     
IS A WIN.                       

371
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:00,358
       (Guy)                    
       IS GOING REAL DEAL       
       WITH THE GRUB.

     HERE WE ARE                
     IN ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND.    

373
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,972
 THIS IS THE HISTORIC DISTRICT. 

374
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,841
     TO ME, IT'S ALL            
     THE HISTORIC DISTRICT,     
     I MEAN, IT'S AMAZING.      

375
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:19,711
  AND WE'RE ON MARYLAND AVENUE  
  BETWEEN THE NAVAL ACADEMY     
  AND THE STATE HOUSE --        

376
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:22,112
      WHICH I THINK             
      IS UNDER RENOVATION,      

377
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,849
 TO CHECK OUT A JOINT THAT HAD  
 BEEN A GREEK RESTAURANT FOR 70 
 YEARS.                         

378
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,584
        WELL THAT'S UNTIL       
        THREE IRISH DUDES       
        CRUISED INTO TOWN       

379
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,520
  AND SAY                       
  THEY'RE GONNA MAKE A GO OF IT 

380
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,655
      AND THEY OPEN UP          
      GALWAY BAY IRISH PUB.     

381
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,792
      (Irish music playing)     

382
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,395
CORN BEEF POPPER                
IN THE WINDOW.                  

383
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,530
      (patron)                  
      IT'S JUST LIKE IN IRELAND.

384
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:40,798
(server)                        
WE HAVE A DUBLIN DIP SANDWICH.  

385
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,067
AND THE FOOD'S                  
THE REAL DEAL.                  
                     IT'S SOLID.

386
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,935
             THE SHEPHERD'S PIE,
             THE FISH AND CHIPS,
             IT'S A REAL TREAT. 

387
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:47,471
           A LOT OF IRISH JOINTS
           IN THIS TOWN THAT    
           YOU'RE A FAN OF.     

388
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:49,740
ONE, YOU'RE LEANING ON IT.      
                       OH, GOOD.

389
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:51,943
    (Guy)                       
    AND THIS JOINT'S LEANING    
    ON THE TRUE IRISH ROOTS     

390
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:54,945
     OF OWNERS ANTHONY CLARK    
     AND FINTON GALWAY.         

391
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,947
IS THERE A BAY                  
CALLED GALWAY BAY?              
            THERE IS.           

392
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,684
   THAT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE,   
   I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY        
   NAMED IT AFTER US.           

393
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,485
     WE CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT,    
     BUT WHAT THE HELL.         

394
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,554
I LIKE THESE GUYS,              
THEY RUN WITH THAT              
IRISH MOXEY.                    

395
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,557
      (Guy)                     
      BUT THERE'S MORE THAN     
      IRISH ACCENTS KEEPING     
      THIS PLACE LEGIT.         

396
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,759
      DROPPING ONE ORDER OF     
      FISH AND CHIPS.           

397
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,961
  (Guy)                         
  MEET CLASSICALLY TRAINED CHEF 
  MIKE MARONE.                  

398
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:13,630
I LIKE TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF ME
IN AS MUCH OF THIS MENU         
AS I CAN                        

399
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,100
          AND NOT STICK         
          WITH A STRAIGHT IRISH.

400
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:17,835
  (Guy)                         
  SO SURE MIKE'S DOING          
  THE IRISH CLASSIC, CORN BEEF. 

401
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,771
IT'S THE CHUNKED CORN BEEF,     
THAT TEXTURE IS KILLER,         
IT'S AMAZING.                   

402
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,840
      (Guy)                     
      BUT HE'S STUFFING IT      
      INTO CABBAGE ROLLS        

403
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:25,576
    AND MAKING WHAT I'D CALL    
    IRISH SUSHI.                

404
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,179
            WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
            THE STUFFED CABBAGE?

405
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:29,714
THEY'RE GREAT.                  

406
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,715
WHAT ARE WE MAKING?             

407
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,784
          THIS IS ALL THE SPICES
          FOR THE PICKLING SPICE
          FOR OUR CORN BEEF.    

408
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,919
(Guy whistling)                 
LIKE THE CORNUCOPIA OF SPICES.  

409
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:38,656
AND WHAT'S THIS FOR?            
   THIS IS FOR THE CABBAGE WRAP.

410
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,658
ALL RIGHT,                      
GET ROCK-N-ROLLING.             

411
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,660
         ALL RIGHT, WE START    
         WITH DEHYDRATED ONIONS,

412
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,862
    CHILI POWDER, MUSTARD SEEDS,
    BLACK PEPPER, WHITE PEPPER, 

413
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:48,399
   ALLSPICE, WHICH IS<i> THE FLAVOR</i>
   FOR CORN BEEF.               

414
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,800
THAT IS THE KICKER?             
                            YES.

415
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,268
              GRANULATED GARLIC.
              A HEAD OF GARLIC. 
OH, LOOK AT THAT MAGIC TRICK.   

416
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:56,674
HEY, NOTHING UP MY SLEEVE.      
  A LITTLE CLOVES,              
  WHOLE PEPPERCORNS, BAY LEAVES,

417
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,277
CORIANDER, CRUSHED RED PEPPER...

418
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:01,212
SO YOU PUT ALL THIS TOGETHER,   

419
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,813
HOW LONG WILL THIS RUB SIT ON   
THE AH, OOH, UH, UH, EH, EH...  

420
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:05,082
        THE RUB DOESN'T ACTUALLY
        GO ON THE CORN BEEF,    

421
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,385
              THE RUB GOES IN   
              THE BOILING WATER.

422
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,622
SO YOUR BRISKET COMES IN RAW?   
             IT COMES IN CORNED.

423
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:14,358
YOU'RE GOING TO FORTIFY IT      
WITH MORE FLAVOR.               
                            YES.

424
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,960
AND WITH SPICES ARE US,         

425
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,697
A LITTLE BIT OF WATER           
COVERIN' IT BY A COUPLE         
OF INCHES.                      

426
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,434
SO NOW ONTO THE STOVE           
5 1/2 TO SIX HOURS?             
                            YEP.

427
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,702
ALL RIGHT, YOU BETTER HURRY UP, 
I'M STARVING.                   

428
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:30,040
SO COOKED, COOLED,              
AND READY TO ROLL.              
                            YEP.

429
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,044
THIS IS WHERE SCIENTIFICALLY    
WE SHOULD JUMP IN AND JUST      
CHECK IT.                       

430
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,649
MMM, I COULD DRINK THIS         
THROUGH A STRAW.                
                           YEAH.

431
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,651
            AND I LIKE TO CUT   
            ALL MY PIECES THICK.

432
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,453
OKAY, SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE THESE,
WHAT'S NEXT?                    
     INSIDE OF THE CABBAGE WRAP.

433
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,523
     TWO SPOONS OF THIS MUSTARD.

434
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,792
OOH, CAVIAR.                    
                   IRISH CAVIAR.

435
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,261
    THIS IS A WHOLE MUSTARD SEED
    THAT'S SOAKED IN GUINNESS.  

436
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,063
WHERE DO YOU FIND THIS?         
IT'S IMPORTED FROM IRELAND.     

437
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:56,400
IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE CAVIAR.    
   YES, THE GUINNESS            
   SEEMS TO SOFTEN UP THE SEEDS.

438
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,402
MMM.                            
     YOU CAN TASTE THE GUINNESS.

439
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,871
YES, YOU CAN.                   

440
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,539
 THEN WE ADD THE MAYONNAISE,    
 A LITTLE SALT, A LITTLE PEPPER,

441
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,609
           A BIT OF HEAVY CREAM.

442
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:07,411
OKAY, SO THIS GOES              
IN THE CABBAGE ROLLS            

443
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,413
AND IS SERVED                   
AS A DIPPING SAUCE?             
                            YES.

444
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:10,814
MAKE IT HAPPEN.                 

445
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,017
 WE'RE GONNA MIX                
 SOME PLAIN OL' MASHED POTATOES.

446
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:16,553
   THEN I ADD ALL MY CORN BEEF, 
   PLENTY OF THIS MUSTARD SAUCE,
   CAN'T HAVE TOO MUCH.         

447
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:18,889
            THEN AS A SURPRISE  
            I'M MASHIN' THIS UP.

448
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,492
          TAKE SOME STEAMED,    
          CHOPPED CABBAGE LEAVES

449
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:23,561
       AND TAKE SOME OF THE MIX,
       NOT TOO MUCH.            

450
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,429
    GET IT TO SIZE IN THE MIDDLE

451
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,231
 AND IT'S A SIMPLE BURRITO ROLL.

452
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,766
              POP 'EM BACK      
              INTO THE STEAMER  
              FOR A LITTLE WHILE

453
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,169
      AND SOFTEN UP THE CABBAGE.

454
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,704
IRISH FOG.                      

455
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,772
JUST LIKE THAT.                 
                 JUST LIKE THAT.

456
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:38,342
     STILL NICE AND TENDER,     
     SERVE 'EM LIKE IRISH SUSHI.

457
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,915
MMM, THIS IRISH SUSHI           
IS THE BOMB.                    

458
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,918
I LOVE THE CABBAGE,             
CABBAGE ISN'T COOKED TOO FAR    
TO WHERE IT'S FALLING APART.    

459
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,454
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD AMOUNT OF     
CORN BEEF IN THERE,             
CREAMY POTATOES,                

460
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,590
A NICE BITE OF                  
THE MUSTARD SAUCE.              

461
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,727
ANYTHING WRAPPED                
AND STUFFED IN CABBAGE,         
IN MY OPINION, IS A WIN.        

462
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,796
I WOULD ORDER THIS              
IN A HEART BEAT.                

463
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,599
                      VERY GOOD.
NICE JOB, IRISH SUSHI.          

464
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,067
        (server)                
        KILLARNEY CABBAGE WRAPS.
       GREAT COMFORT FOOD.      

465
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:05,802
  I USE IT AS A DINNER ACTUALLY 
  A LOT OF THE TIME             

466
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,939
       EVEN THOUGH IT'S ON      
       THE APPETIZER MENU.      

467
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,340
CALAMARI.                       
 IT'S NOT YOUR TYPICAL BAR FOOD.

468
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,410
REUBEN.                         

469
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,145
WHAT MAKES IT SO GOOD HERE?     
   YOU KNOW WHAT, THERE'S NO TV.

470
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:18,282
THAT'S FUNNY,                   
THERE ARE NO TVs IN THIS JOINT. 
              SO YOU'RE ALWAYS  
              TALKING TO PEOPLE.

471
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:22,886
HOW'S IT GOIN', BOYS?           

472
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,623
     MOST PEOPLE THINK OF       
     IRISH PUBS AS THE PUB,     
     THE CRAIC SIDE OF IT.      

473
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,491
THE WHAT SIDE OF IT,            
THE CRACK SIDE?                 

474
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,226
   C-R-A-I-C IS THE IRISH WORD  
   FOR FUN.                     

475
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:33,497
REALLY, THE PUB'S PART OF IT    
BUT THE FOOD REALLY HAS TO BE   
THE MAIN STAY.                  
              YEAH.             

476
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,299
I DIG IT MAN.                   

477
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,268
NO, YOU CAN'T DRIVE THE CAR.    

478
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:41,171
   SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP,  
   BUT DON'T WORRY,             

479
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,574
      THERE'S PLENTY MORE       
      "TRIPLE D" JOINTS         
      ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.     

480
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,643
        I'LL BE LOOKING         
        FOR YOU NEXT WEEK       

481
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:47,711
     ON "DINERS, DRIVE-INS,     
     AND DIVES."                

482
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,647
               HANG ON A SECOND.

483
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,716
              OUR PROUD OWNER...

484
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:54,585
(Nicky)                         
THAT'S ME RIGHT THERE.          

485
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,986
YOU GUYS, MIND                  
I'M TAKEN THE PICTURE WITH?
