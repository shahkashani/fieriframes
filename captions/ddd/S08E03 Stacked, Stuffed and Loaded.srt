YOU GOT THE SUGAR ALREADY       
   GOING IN THE BRINE.

  THE RUB WITH SALT AND PEPPER.

   TO IT, A LITTLE KICK.

      AND TOMATO.               
          YOU LET THAT SIT THERE
                AND SIMMER.     

398
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,174
WHAT ARE WE MAKING NOW?         
               THE SPICE MIX    
          FOR THE CARNE GUISADA.

399
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,977
         SO WE ADD WHOLE GARLIC,
               CUMIN SEED.      
NOW BEING THE CULINARIAN,       

400
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:15,914
YOU DON'T TOAST THAT            
   AHEAD OF TIME?               
        I'VE TRIED IT TOASTED.  
      MY GRANDMA DIDN'T LIKE IT.

401
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,715
REALLY?                         
      SHE SAID IT WAS TOO SMOKY.

402
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,351
        SO WE HAVE CHICKEN STOCK
          WITH TOMATO BOUILLON, 

403
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,854
                 BLACK PEPPER   
             AND CRUSHED TOMATO.
A LITTLE WATER.                 

404
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:25,390
     ALL PURéED TOGETHER.       
THIS IS GONNA GO FOR OUR BEEF.  
                            YES.

405
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:28,125
 AND THIS IS REALLY GONNA BE    
KIND OF LIKE THE BASE OF THIS.  
                 THE BASE, YEAH.

406
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,194
               ANYTHING ELSE    
          WE'RE GONNA ADD TO IT.
YES, A BLONDE ROUX.             

407
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,797
               BLONDE ROUX IS...
MANTECA AND FLOUR.              

408
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,598
               AND A LITTLE MORE
                 HEAT ON THAT   

409
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,934
             UNTIL THAT STARTS  
           TO DO ITS THICKENING.
AND THEN IT'S DONE.             

410
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,736
WE PUT TWO SCOOPS               
   ON A TACO.                   
                     TWO SCOOPS?

411
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,705
 YEAH, WE FILL 'EM UP.          
AND YOU CAN ADD CHEESE.         

412
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,974
                A LITTLE SALSA. 
              IS THIS SUPER HOT?
NO, IT'S MILD.                  

413
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,012
        THE MEAT--SUPER TENDER. 
      GOT SOME CREAMINESS TO IT.

414
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,014
       I LOVE SEEING THE PEPPERS
             INSIDE OF IT.      

415
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,950
   BUT THE NAPALM GRAVY IS HOT--
             THE LAVA.          

416
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,952
                  IS THAT       
          WHAT YOU GUYS CALL IT?
YEAH.                           

417
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,354
A TON OF PEOPLE ARE MAKING CORN,
 BUT THE FLOUR IS THE WAY TO GO.

418
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:57,889
                    NICE JOB.   
                THANKS, BROTHER.

419
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:00,758
CARNE GUISADA.                  
   THE MEAT JUST FALLS APART    
         IN YOUR MOUTH.         

420
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,760
            THE SAUCE           
    IS REALLY, REALLY YUMMY.    

421
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,762
 TO ME, IT TASTES LIKE POT ROAST
       WITH CHILI PEPPERS.      

422
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,430
MEXICAN POT ROAST.              
              MEXICAN POT ROAST.

423
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,966
    IT REMINDS ME OF THE WAY    
     MY MOM USED TO MAKE IT.    

424
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,968
 <i> 'CAUSE IT'S THE WAY BOB'S MOM</i> 
        <i> USED TO MAKE IT.</i>

           FOR YOU, SIR.        

428
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,978
   THE TAMALES ARE EXCELLENT.   
   THEY'RE HOMEMADE, AS WELL.   

429
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,647

           GO THROUGH IN A DAY? 
40, 50 DOZEN.

00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:25,649

          HOW DO WE GET STARTED?
PORK...                         

431
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,651
             PORK BUTT--        
    IT'S ACTUALLY SHOULDER MEAT,

432
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:30,187
         VERSUS THE HIND QUARTER
                  MEAT.         
       SALT,                    
PEELED GARLIC WHOLE.            

433
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,590
COVER IT WITH WATER.            
       OKAY, SO WE LET IT SIMMER
             FOR HOW LONG?      

434
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,024
ABOUT TWO, THREE HOURS.         

435
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,060
                 TILL THAT PORK 
               JUST FALLS APART?
JUST BREAKS APART, YES.         

436
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:38,596
 ONCE IT'S DONE, I PUT IT       
IN THE MIXER AND SHRED IT.      
                         GOT IT.

437
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,665
              SO WE GOT OUR PORK
                ALL MIXED UP.   
 NOW WE JUST                    
ADD THE LARD.

          A LITTLE BIT OF WATER.
TO BIND 'EM, YEAH.              

440
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:47,739
       SO IT PURéES UP EASY,    
  AND IT MIXES INTO THIS EVENLY?
YES.                            

441
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,741
        AND NOW I ADD           
THE PURéED GUAJILLO PEPPERS,    

442
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,810

     WHAT, ANOTHER 20 MINUTES...

443
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,747
15, 20 MINUTES.                 
  AND THEN LET IT COOL, AND THEN
   THIS IS GONNA BE THE MIXTURE 

444
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,749
                THAT'S GONNA GO 
               INTO OUR TAMALES?
YES.                            

445
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,150
  WE'RE GONNA MAKE PREPARED MASA
          FOR THE TAMALE.       
PREPARED MASA.                  

446
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,753
    SO ALL THIS IS              
IS THE CORN AND WATER?          
             AND THEN YOU ADD...

447
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:04,555
A LITTLE MELTED MANTECA.        
            MELTED MANTECA, YES.

448
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:07,358
IT'S BASICALLY                  
CLEAN PORK FAT.                 
             CHILI POWDER--     
         THIS IS FOR COLOR ONLY,

449
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,427
     NOT FOR TASTE OR ANYTHING--
           AND SALT, WATER.     
OKAY. CRANK IT,                 
  AND MIX IT.                   

450
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,429
  AS SOON AS ALL THE INGREDIENTS
         ARE INCORPORATED,      

451
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,398
            IT'S READY TO GO.   
        SCOOP SOME ON THE TABLE.

452
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:17,502
  AND WE HAVE SOME CORN HUSKS   
THAT HAVE BEEN SOAKED IN WATER. 
          PUT A DOLLOP ON THERE.

453
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,504
  YOU SPREAD IT                 
RIGHT TO THE EDGE.              
                            YEP.

454
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,506
           FILL IT WITH THE PORK
             THAT WE PREPARED.  

455
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,508
BOY, YOU PUT A NICE AMOUNT      
    OF FILLING IN THAT.         

456
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,510
FOLD IT OVER THE BACK,          
   AND THERE YOU GO.            

457
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,512
AND THIS IS GONNA               
GO IN THE STEAMER.              
                            YES.

458
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,514
 NOW HOW LONG                   
WILL IT STEAM?                  
                        AN HOUR.

459
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,516
(whistles) SO THAT'S            
 RIDICULOUSLY HOT.              
                       OH, YEAH.

RIGHT AMOUNT OF SEASONING.      

462

00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,213
CHERRY, COTTON CANDY,           
DREAMSICLE, MARGARITA,          

488
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,815
    ICE CREAM,                  
LEMON-LIME, LECHE?              
                LECHE--IT'S LIKE
                 A MILK FLAVOR. 

489
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:41,152
     WHY IS IT CALLED A SNOBALL?
BECAUSE THE ICE IS SO SOFT,     
      IT'S LIKE SNOW.           

490
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:43,954
       THE GURGLING MONSTROSITY 
          WE SEE BEHIND US--    

491
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:46,357
    'CAUSE I DON'T GET TO SAY   
 "GURGLING MONSTROSITY" ENOUGH--

492
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,758
THIS IS OUR ICEMAKER.           

493
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:50,160
  WE FILL THESE STEEL CANISTERS 
    ABOUT 2 GALLONS OF WATER.   

494
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:53,897
            WHAT'S THIS SOLUTION
               INSIDE OF HERE?  
  THIS IS WATER                 
MIXED WITH GLYCOL,              

495
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,767
WHICH IS AN ACCELERATION PROCESS
       TO FREEZE THE ICE.       

496
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:59,503
 THE GLYCOL CAN GET SUPER, SUPER
    COLD, BUT IT WON'T FREEZE.  
RIGHT.                          

497
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,038
        IF THAT WAS JUST WATER, 

498
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,307
         WHEN THIS WATER FROZE, 
        THAT WATER WOULD FREEZE.
RIGHT.                          

499
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,643
       OKAY, SO YOU TAKE THIS...
BRING IT OVER HERE.             

500
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:08,913
      RUN SOME HOT WATER ON 'EM.
AND THIS IS JUST GONNA          
   POP OUT THE ICE.             

501
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:11,381
              GET THE BAG READY.
ICE, ICE, BABY.                 

502
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,383
OH, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.          
                      YOU READY?

503
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,520
        PUT THE BAG RIGHT HERE. 

504
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,522
                     CATCH IT...
WHOA, YEAH.                     
I'M READY.                      

505
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,656
BRING IT. YOU GOT IT?           
                   THERE YOU GO.

506
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:22,393
JEEZ. I'VE BIRTHED A WALRUS     
     EASIER THAN THAT.          

507
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,195
LET'S GO MAKE                   
SOME SNOBALLS.                  
                           OKAY.

508
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,664
          OUR ICE BLOCK IN HERE.
RATCHET THIS.                   

509
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,666
        SECURE THE ICE BLOCK    
     SO IT WON'T RATTLE AS MUCH.

510
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,801
               WE PUSH THE ICE  
             THROUGH THE BLADES.

511
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,536
SO IT SHAVES THE ICE            
     THAT THIN,                 

512
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,338
IT'S LIKE SNOW.                 
                     YES, IT IS.

513
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,407
        THAT'S CRAZY.           
IT ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE SNOW.    

514
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:37,875
ALL THESE FLAVORS. OKAY.        

515
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,544
I THINK I'M GONNA GO...         
             DREAMSICLE IS GOOD.

516
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,146
OKAY, DREAMSICLE.               
                      ALL RIGHT.

517
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:44,882
SO I JUST POUR IT               
RIGHT ON THE TOP?               
        POUR SOME IN THE CENTER.

518
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,883
                       DROWN IT.
OKAY.                           

519
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,820
                  THEN THROW    
             SOME CREAM IN HERE.
 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,          
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME,         

520
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,822
"A," WE'VE HAD A SNOBALL        
     ON TRIPLE "D,"             

521
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,957
AND "B," THE FIRST TIME         
   IN MY ENTIRE LIFE            

522
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:56,027
I'VE EVER PUT MILK IN ONE.      

523
00:19:58,131 --> 00:19:59,696
DUDE, THIS IS NUTS.             

524
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,365
THAT TASTES JUST LIKE           
    A 50-50 BAR.                

525
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,234
 THIS IS NOTHING                
LIKE A SNOW CONE.               
                             NO.

526
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:05,903
               THE FLAVORS      
         REALLY COME OUT AT YOU.
   THAT'S WHY                   
IT'S A SNOBALL.                 

527
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,972
YOU WANT TO TRY THIS?           
   THIS IS KILLER.              

528
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:09,640
       THERE YOU GO, SIR.       

529
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:11,909
    I LIKE IT                   
'CAUSE IT'S SWEET.              
                 LOTS OF SYRUP, 
                 A LOT OF SYRUP.

530
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,644
                      HOW IS IT?
GOOD.                           

531
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,246
                 (mumbling)     
             GOOD. THIS IS GOOD.

532
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,981
MMM.                            
              IT'S REALLY SOFT. 
            IT'S NOT ALL FROZEN.

533
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:20,384
YOU JUST HAPPENED TO OPEN UP    
  A LITTLE SNOBALL STATION,     

534
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,120
 AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,   
YOU GOT THIS SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. 

535
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:25,055
 AFTER THEY CONVERTED TO TACOS, 
   I JUST KEPT COMING AROUND.   

536
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,057
       I LOVE TO COME HERE      
           EVERY DAY.           

537
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:29,860
     (woman) CHICKEN TACO SALAD.
IT'S JUST AWESOME.              
WE HAVE TO HAVE IT.             

538
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,862
   NEXT TIME I COME TO HOUSTON  
         IN THE WINTER,         

539
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:34,665
  PLEASE, LOAD ME UP ABOUT SIX  
 DOZEN OF THOSE FLOUR TORTILLAS 

540
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,667
    IN THAT '67, ALL RIGHT?     
           ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

541
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,469
      YOU GUYS ARE GREAT.       
        CONGRATULATIONS.        
                      THANK YOU.

542
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:39,870
        PACO, GREAT JOB.        

543
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:42,139
 SO WAS THAT A KILLER ROAD TRIP 
            OR WHAT?            

544
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:45,342
 DON'T WORRY, WE GOT PLENTY MORE
 JOINTS ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.

545
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:48,746
    I'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME ON   
 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

546
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,415
SO THERE'S VEGAN...             
                THERE'S VEE-GAN,
                THERE'S VAY-GAN,

547
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,483
     AND THERE'S VENTRILOQUISM. 

548
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,286
(laughing)                      

549
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,689
                YOU'RE DOING    
             A GREAT SHOW HERE.
