   WE HAVE, UH,                 
BLACK PEPPER HERE.              

203
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,915
           OOH, THIS IS A TASTE.

204
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,718
IT'S FRESHLY GRATED             
    LEMON ZEST,                 

205
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,853
SO IT GIVES YOU THAT NICE CITRUS
   FLAVOR WITHOUT THE ACID--    
          WITHOUT THE ACID, YEP.

206
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,589
ACID, EXACTLY, AND THEN WE LIKE 
A LITTLE BIT OR ORANGE AS WELL. 

207
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,324
               DUDE, I'M DIGGING
                  THE RECIPE.   

208
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,259
  ADD A LITTLE HEAT             
WITH SOME CHILI FLAKE,          

209
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,661
AND FINALLY, WE'RE GONNA        
 USE SOME FENNEL SEED.          

210
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,999
NOW WE'RE READY                 
TO ROLL IT UP.                  
                   LOOK AT THIS.

211
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:57,202
                  DUDE, YOU GUYS
                   ARE SERIOUS. 

212
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:00,605
AND THEN YOU WANT TO KEEP       
 YOUR FAT CAP UP ON TOP.        

213
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,008
                SO WHEN WE COOK,
                 FAT DRIPS DOWN.

214
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,577
    THIS WILL BE WHERE WE REALLY
      SEE HIS, UH, TRUE MERIT.  

215
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:11,282
                   THIS IS NOT  
                HIS FIRST RODEO.

216
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,952
           THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE.
WE'RE READY TO GO.              

217
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,487
                  SO THIS WILL  
                GIVE US A CHANCE

218
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:17,355
             TO REALLY BUILD    
        A NICE CRUNCHY EXTERIOR.

219
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,023
I'LL SEASON IT WITH             
 SALT AND PEPPER,               

220
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,559
AND WE'RE GOOD TO GO.           
              ALL RIGHT,        
      SO THE PORCHETTA PORK BUTT

221
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,762
                COOKS OFF AT 350
               FOR 3 TO 4 HOURS.

222
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:27,365
   REMEMBER "A CHRISTMAS STORY" 
  WHEN THE TURKEY WOULD COME OUT

223
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,835
                AND THE DAD     
           WOULD DO THE PICKING?

224
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:34,506
BE VERY CAREFUL. YOU DON'T WANT 
ANYBODY CHEWING ON THE STRING.  

225
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:36,441
                  REALLY NICE,  
                BEAUTIFUL CRUST.

226
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,442
                LET ME JUST TAKE
                 A LOOK AT THIS.
THERE YOU GO.

                  AT THAT, HUH? 

228

                  OVER THERE?   
THAT'S OUR FLATTOP, GUY.        

229
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:48,185
                            MMM.
HOW IS IT?                      

230
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,121

231
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,924

 NOW WE'RE GONNA                
MAKE THE SANDWICH.

            SOME GARLIC,        

235
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,466

           AND NOW WE DEGLAZE.

                WE ADD THE MEAT.

    AND TRY DIFFERENT THINGS    

401
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,004
      AND DO SPECIAL MENUS      
          EVERY NIGHT.          

402
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:22,874
  IT ENTICES YOUR TASTE BUDS.   
                            MMM.

403
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,209
    <i> THAT WAS THE PLAN WHEN</i>     
   <i> OWNER AND CHEF JOHN WALSH</i>   

404
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,745
<i> OPENED THIS TINY CAFé IN '08...</i>

405
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,413
     MEDITERRANEAN CHICKEN.     

406
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:33,484
       <i> BUT HE LEFT ROOM</i>        
      <i> FOR WHAT MATTERS.</i>        
                       ORDER IN.

407
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:36,753
WHERE THE KITCHEN IS TWO-THIRDS 
  THE SIZE OF THE RESTAURANT.   
             IT'S MY PLAYGROUND.

408
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,755
  SO HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE        
WHAT EDGEWOOD CAFE IS LIKE?     

409
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,757
                COMFORT FOOD    
           WITH A GOURMET TOUCH.
WOW.                            

410
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,961
                           YEAH.
   A COUPLE CASTANETS,          
AND YOU CAN SNAP THAT OUT.      

411
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:47,898
<i> AND HE'S KEEPING THE MENU FRESH</i>
<i> AND SEASONAL WHENEVER POSSIBLE,</i>

412
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,834
 <i> LIKE WITH THESE LOCAL CLAMS.</i>  

413
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,502
              LITTLENECK ENTRéE.

414
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,504
    THIS IS ALL I EVER ORDER    
       WHEN I COME HERE--       

415
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,239
   CLAMS WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL    
           SPAGHETTI,           

416
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,775
       AND, OH, THE BROTH       
   AND THE BREAD--FANTASTIC.    

417
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,177
   LITTLENECKS IN THE WINDOW.   
            PICK UP.            
          (bell dings)          

418
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,047
YOU CAN'T COME TO RHODE ISLAND  
  AND NOT HAVE LITTLENECKS.     
                          RIGHT.

419
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,582
LET'S GET HER GOING.            
            ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE 
            GONNA GRILL THE CORN

420
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,585
           AND THEN THE CHORIZO.
   AND WHERE'S                  
THE CHORIZO FROM?               

421
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,254
                  LOCAL SAUSAGE 
               FROM NEW BEDFORD.
   ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE          
GONNA GRILL OFF THE CORN,       

422
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,655
GRILL OFF THE SAUSAGE.          

423
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:14,392
I REALLY DON'T WANT THIS        
 TO SOUND OUT OF LINE,          

424
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:17,061
BUT I HAVE TO DO THIS JUST FOR  
 INTERNATIONAL TESTING LAWS.    

425
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,997
  THAT'S REAL. DELICIOUS.       
A LITTLE BIT OF SPICE TO IT.    

426
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,999
ARE WE GONNA DICE IT,           
 OR JUST CHOP IT UP?            
                     CHOP IT UP.

427
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:25,736
CORN'S NICE AND ROASTED. IS IT  
  PEELING IT OR SHUCKING IT?    
           MAKE SURE I GET ALL--

428
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,272
                  PEEL THE CORN.
WHAT REALLY FREAKS ME OUT       
 IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE         

429
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,207
  THIS BIG, THICK               
RHODE ISLAND ACCENT.            

430
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,476
  (Rhode Island accent)         
OH, THIS IS THE BEST PART.      

431
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,745
            ALL RIGHT, SO I WANT
              TO CUT THIS OFF.  
(normal voice) YOU WANT TO SEE  
   A COOL LITTLE TECHNIQUE?     

432
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:37,215
                           YEAH.
WHEN YOU'RE DOING               
 A LOT OF CORN,                 

433
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,815
SEE HOW NICE THAT IS?           
                       OH, YEAH.

434
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,618
NOW YOU'RE RIGHT                
  IN THE BOWL                   

435
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,620
AND IT'S NOT ALL OVER           
 THE CUTTING BOARD.             
              UH-HUH. VERY GOOD.

436
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,755
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT LITTLE
    TIP AND TRICK? I'M OUT.     
          HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU?

437
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,357
NEXT UP?                        
                   MY OLIVE OIL,
                    LITTLENECKS.

438
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,493
STEAMERS.                       
        THEN WHEN THE PAN'S HOT,
             SOME GARLIC...     

439
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,495
THAT EARLY, HUH?                
                     SHALLOTS...

440
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,231
LIVING ON THE EDGE.             
                   RED PEPPER...

441
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,365
THERE YOU GO.                   
              A LITTLE SALT,    
         BLACK PEPPER, CILANTRO.

442
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,235
EVERYBODY'S IN THE POOL         
    AT THIS POINT.              
                            YES.

443
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:59,570
                    AND CHORIZO.
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.             
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?            

444
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:05,109
            AND THEN WHITE WINE,

445
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,311
                SOME CLAM JUICE.
A LOT OF WORK                   
FOR ONE DISH.                   

446
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:11,115
OKAY, WE SEE THAT THEY'RE OPEN, 
   SO NOW THE CORN GOES IN.     
                          RIGHT.

447
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:14,318
         A LITTLE BIT OF BUTTER,

448
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,654
            SOME GRAPE TOMATOES.
NICE.                           

449
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,589
AND THE PASTA.                  
                         DOCTOR.

450
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:22,593
LET THAT GET HOT.               
     SO THE SAUSAGE, THE CLAMS, 
   EVERYBODY'S READY TO GO HERE?

451
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,929
YEP, EVERYBODY'S                
  READY TO GO.                  
                          GREAT.

452
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,064
ADD THE PASTA.                  
                 I'VE SEEN      
          SOME NESTING OF PASTA,

453
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,100
                 BUT NEVER      
           WITH A BARBECUE FORK.

454
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,871
        WITH THE SAUSAGE SITTING
          INSIDE OF THAT CLAM.  

455
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:36,674
 MMM. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA SERVE
   THIS WITH SOME BREAD POINTS? 

456
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,343
YEP.                            
OLIVE OIL WITH GARLIC AND HERBS.
        GRILL THAT OFF.         

457
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,945
RIGHT.                          
          THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE.

458
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:44,148
        GORGEOUS. LOOK AT THAT--
         NICE LEAN, MEAN BROTH. 

459
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,351
           MMM. I COULD EAT THIS
               ALL DAY LONG.    

460
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,753
             GET A LITTLE BIT   
         OF THE TOMATO IN THERE,

461
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,822
              THEN YOU GET      
        THE SAUSAGE AND THE CLAM

462
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,091
                  AND THAT BROTH
                   ALL TOGETHER.

               WANT TO TRY SOME?
YES.                            

465
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:01,365
    IT'S THE FAT OF THE SAUSAGE,
       TENDERNESS OF THE CLAM,  

466
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,168
      THE FRESHNESS OF THE CORN,
       THE GARLIC, THE SHALLOTS.

467
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,637
                     MMM.       
             EXCELLENT JOB, MAN.

468
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,839
              NO DOUBLE-DIPPING.

469
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,775
      LITTLENECK SPECIAL.       

470
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:13,710
      (man) YOU JUST WANT       
  TO TAKE YOUR TIME EATING IT   

471
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,513
   AND JUST ENJOY EVERY BITE.   

472
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:18,315
    (woman) IT'S ABSOLUTELY     
         JUST PERFECT.          

473
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,984
       YOU CAN'T GET THIS       
         ANYWHERE ELSE.         

474
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:21,919
     ORDER IN THE WINDOW--      
        FISH AND CHIPS.         

475
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,188
    THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING    
DIFFERENT, ALWAYS A NEW SPECIAL.

476
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,056
         IT'S FABULOUS.         
       YOU CAN'T BEAT IT.       

477
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,793
(woman) I LIKE THE WAY          
HE VARIES HIS DISHES.           

478
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:31,329
YOU GET A LITTLE SURPRISE       
 EVERY TIME YOU COME IN.        
              A LITTLE SURPRISE?

479
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,598
A LITTLE SURPRISE.              
            A LITTLE SURPRISE.  

480
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
            COME ON DOWN AND GET
             A LITTLE SURPRISE.

486

               DON'T BE NERVOUS,
                   SERIOUSLY.   

487
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,949
       IT'S--LET ME TELL YOU    
   HOW YOU MAKE GOOD TELEVISION.

488
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,951
       UM, IT--WELL, ACTUALLY,  
    MAYBE SOMEONE COULD TELL ME,

489
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:57,188
                      BUT, UM...
(laughs)
