1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,001
   So when I come off the road  
      from doing DDD,           

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:04,670
   the first thing I wanna do   
    is get home to my kitchen   

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,004
        and cook my food        
         for my family.         

4
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:08,940
     -And after a few weeks,    
          I gotta be...         
      -Dad, can we just...      

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,542
         I mean, please,        
       go to a restaurant       

6
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:13,344
       -at least one time.      
     -They start to revolt.     

7
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:14,613
   So I came up with the idea.  

8
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,949
     How about we reach out     
  to some of our favorite chefs 

9
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,550
  and have them send us dinner, 

10
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,219
              -huh?             
       -I like that idea.

    right when I bit into it,   
          little snap.          

113
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,886
      And when those cook,      
   it's even gonna get better.  

114
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,689
     All right. We got a lot    
  of ground beef to cook down.  

115
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,490
          [Gary] Yeah,          
       I gave you plenty.       

116
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:46,825
         There should be        
       onions and garlic.       

117
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,894
   You want the onions to get   
      a little translucent.     

118
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,896
  [Guy] You sent me enough here 
     for probably 50 people.    

119
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:52,831
       [Gary] Oh, easily.       

120
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,432
      I knew that there was     
         trouble coming.        

121
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,567
     Jazz, you're last today    

122
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:56,768
          -by the way.          
             -Uh-oh.            

123
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,371
      Because if I had you      
       on the show first,       

124
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,839
         there would be         
       no more show. Okay?      

125
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,507
   Because I know what you're   
         gonna do, Jazz.        

126
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,576
  So onions and garlic are in.  

127
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,711
         I would start,         
     uh, adding your spices.    

128
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,646
      -[Guy] Chili powder.      
      -[Gary] There you go.     

129
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:11,383
    [Guy] Now, wait a second,   
     that much cocoa powder?    

130
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,518
          -[Gary] Yup.          
  -I'm cocoa for cocoa powder.  

131
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,653
      [Hunter] That's a lot     
      of cocoa powder now.      

132
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,455
          That is a lot         
        of cocoa powder.        

133
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:18,456
         Cider vinegar,         
          the allspice,         

134
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:19,724
         cayenne, salt.         

135
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,660
      -That much cinnamon?      
           -Yes, sir.           

136
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,462
           [Guy] Dude,          
       I don't doubt you.       

137
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,797
      I mean, you are crazy     
 and what you guys do is crazy, 

138
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,733
      but do you still sell     
        my DDD dog?             

139
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,734
        Once in a while,        
      I get a call for it.      

140
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,603
         It was the most        
        ridiculous thing.       

141
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,738
       Bacon, little cheese,    
              chili,            

142
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:37,542
         dollop of slaw,        
   sprinkle with some onions,   

143
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,610
     sweet left, hot right.     

144
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,279
      Now, talk about that.     

145
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:42,281
           Hmm, dude,           
        that's dynamite.        

146
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,548
     Is that killer or what?    

147
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,483
      -That was a big dog.      
            -[laughs]           

148
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:46,484
         That's awesome.        

149
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:47,753
  When does the Worcestershire  
             go in?             

150
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,487
      [Gary] You could put      
          that in now.          

151
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,623
      How long do you guys      
    typically let it simmer?    

152
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,558
         Probably about         
        30 to 45 minutes.       

153
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,827
       You're gonna throw       
    that bottle of water in.    

154
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,297
   [Guy] Tomato sauce go down,  
         let this stew.         

155
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,630
        Tell me the deal        
         with the fries.        

156
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,832
  [Gary]<i> It's a Norwis potato.</i>  

157
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:04,102
      <i> Blanched for about</i>       
    <i> two and a half minutes,</i>    

158
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,771
    and then when you plunge    
   those back in that hot oil,  

159
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,772
     they're gonna crisp up     
          beautifully.          

160
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:08,774
  What do we do with the buns?  

161
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,508
    [Gary] Yeah, just butter    
     them up and face down.     

162
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,044
    [Guy] And then we'll put    
      this thing together.      

163
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:13,778
      So don't go anywhere.     
        It's DDD Takeout.       

164
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:16,514
 We're hanging out at the house 
  with our favorite DDD chefs.  

165
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,350
  You're gonna love this dish.  
     We'll see you in a bit.    

166
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,722
      [rock music playing]      

167
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,791
       [Guy] Welcome back.      
          DDD Takeout.          

168
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:28,393
       Hunter and I, well,      
    we're jumping into things   

169
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:29,594
   with one of our favorites,   

170
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:30,796
      and that is a hotdog.     

171
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:34,065
    Not any hotdog, but it's    
   a Super Duper Weenie hotdog  

172
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:34,800
       out of Connecticut.      

173
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,402
        Our buddy, Gary,        
     sent us all the goods.     

174
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,137
       Are we calling this      
           Cincinnati?          

175
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:40,004
           Cincinnati.          

176
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,340
  [Guy] So I got these hotdogs  

177
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:42,607
    that you have especially    
          made for you,         

178
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,609
      and then go straight      
  with the chili right up top.  

179
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,877
     [Gary] Yup. Ladle it       
        right on there,         

180
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,012
        nice good amount.       

181
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,748
   -Lots of shredded cheddar.   
     -[Gary] Onions on top.     

182
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,484
  [Guy] Hunter's got the fries  
   with a little bit of salt.   

183
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:53,885
              -Yup.             
       -That looks great.       

184
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:57,089
   My mouth is watering right   
   now just getting into this.  

185
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:01,492
     [Sirine] Our mouths are    
       watering watching.       

186
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:02,561
             Ryder.             

187
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,629
         Get this shot.         

188
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,297
           -[Gary] Oh.          
         -[Jazz] Yummy.         

189
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,332
            [laughs]            

190
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:09,634
     [Guy] I wanna make sure    
        this pot of gold        

191
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,502
          doesn't burn          
        right now, Gary.        

192
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:12,971
      I mean, the chili is      
    great, man. It really is.   

193
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,506
       That allspice there      
       is just super key.       

194
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:16,975
      And I've never had it     
      with a cocoa powder.      

195
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:17,843
     There's a lot of depth.    

196
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:18,843
      We've never had chili     
           like this.           

197
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:21,579
        The bun's great,        
      the dog is dynamite.      

198
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,314
      That snap in the dog.     

199
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,449
      It's no mushy hotdog.     

200
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,384
           Delicious.           
    Loved the chopped onion.    

201
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:27,719
      Fries are fantastic.      

202
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,254
  I gotta say my favorite part  

203
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,455
      is when you're eating     
            a hotdog            

204
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:31,656
         and everything         
      kind of falling off.      

205
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,658
   Now, you've got yourself     
   some chili cheese fries.     

206
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,393
   Only recommendation I have.  

207
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,395
       Send a beach towel.      

208
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,596
            -[laughs]           
             -Okay?             

209
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,332
        -Out of the park.       
           -Thank you.          

210
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,534
      Close to the park is      
         our next visit.        

211
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,603

     hanging here for years.

224
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,496
  [Mike] Well, on a side note,  
       Eric Lindell's band      

225
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:12,831
         has played here        
       in my Flying Mango.      

226
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,833
         -Oh, I love it.        
   -Take a look what that is.   

227
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:17,436
   So that's the whole lingcod  
       we sent out to you.      

228
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,370
              -Oh.              
              -Wow.             

229
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,439
         Wait a second,         
      you just sent a fish?     

230
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,308
      -That's a greenling.      
          -[Mac] Yeah.          

231
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,377
      A, where did you get      
        a greenling cod?        

232
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:26,578
     B, what are we making?     

233
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,779
  And C, gosh, you're awesome.

       [Guy] Oh, you sent       
        crab cakes also?        

238
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,588
      Yeah, buddy, come on.     

239
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:38,990
   What's the game plan here?   

240
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,859
      I was hoping we'd do      
         the fish tacos.        

241
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,394
         Let's start off        
     with the batter. Flour.

247
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:52,938
          -Is that what         
       we're looking for?       
     -Yup, that looks great.    

248

      -[Mac]<i> We wanna make</i>

  -Can I start the crab cakes?  
         -You can, yeah.

  Just not pretty looks, Jazz.  

259

        Hunter, those are       
          charring up?          

260
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,895

    [Hunter] Oh, look at that.  
            Way easier.         

263
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,701
       So we're gonna put       
      some panko in there.      

264
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,437
        [Guy] Just enough       
      to hold it together.      

265
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,771
         Dungeness crab,

270

    This is like my workout.

 the rest of the crab in there. 

275
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,455
    [Guy] Folding these over.

277
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,526
        And you still got       
     really nice big pieces     

278
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:48,660
       of leg meat of crab      

279

     Over to the crab cakes.    

290
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,149
      Put down a little bit     
            of panko.           

291

293
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,819

294
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,487

          Anything special      
       on the tortillas, Mac?   

297
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,693
       Just warm them up.       

298
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,628
   [Hunter] I could definitely  
   use a beer right about now.  

299

  little salad just went, dude. 

308

      let's do these tacos.     

326

          Two tortillas

423
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,590
   we're not gonna cook these   
         ahead of time.         

424
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:13,791
        We're gonna drop        
       these in the sauce       

425
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,593
      -to finish, correct?      
  -[Mike] Yup. That's correct.  

426
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,529
  [Guy] It's gonna like almost  
        poach the shrimp        

427
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,464
         and it's gonna         
      make it super tender.     

428
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,598
         Now, how are we        
        serving this up?        

429
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,533
         Are we a bowl,         
         are we a plate,        

430
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,667
        are we a trough?        

431
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:25,537
           I'd go with          
      a bowl-shaped trough.     

432
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:26,604

433
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,039
          [Hunter] Yes.         

434
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,608
        Those greens are        
           so tender.           

435
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,477
       Hmm, look at those       
        beautiful shrimp        

436
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,545
      and all those tails.      

437
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:35,747
      I'm around that stuff     
            all day.            

438
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,215

00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,983
          [Guy] Ha ha.          

440
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,487
        The right amount        
          of heat, man.         

441
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,422
    That little cayenne kiss    
            you gave.           

442
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,489
      [Hunter] Little kick.     

443
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,557
      Love the thyme.           

444
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,426
          The crawfish,         
          there's that          

445
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,295
      traditional Louisiana

446
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:52,430
       that you're getting      
            from it.            

447
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:53,697
       And then the shrimp      
        are mega tender.        

448
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,300
  And there's a whole contrast  

449
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:56,701
     of textures and flavors    
            in here.

   You keep crushing it, bro.

   I think it's awesome, Jazz.  

483
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,499

486

       -[Guy] Fish sauce?

557
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,867

       <i> and got ourselves</i>

         basil chicken.         

565
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:32,683
      So I got the chicken      
           right here.          

566

        chili and garlic.

    from Northern California.   

571
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,559
    You can handle the heat.    

572

          going in too?         

576
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:50,635
       Jazz, I don't think      
       you're being nice.       

577
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,570

     It just ate the enamel     
          off my teeth.         

580

585

591
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:13,591
       to get it all off.       

592
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:14,858
       I'll be right back.      

593
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:15,793

           your face.

     how to cook Thai food.     

605
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,415
         One tablespoon         
         of everything.         

606

 -[Sirine] Did you have to ask? 

611
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,693
  The last thing is the basil.  

612
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,762
   -[Guy] You grow this basil?

      it smells delicious.      

618
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,906
       It looks fantastic.      

619
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:02,974
   You might not have a chance  

620
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,643
   to make it to these places,  
    but you do have a chance    

621
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,245
     to bring these flavors     
         to your house.

        [Guy] And hitting       
      the basil into that.

       how does it taste?       

627
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,724
       Oh, Hunter, Hunter,      

628
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,194

       if it hit you yet.

633
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,535
  This is like a freight train  
     coming into flavor town
