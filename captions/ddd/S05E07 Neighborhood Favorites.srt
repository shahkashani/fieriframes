     I COULD COOK THIS          

101
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,618
   ON THE MANIFOLD              
OF MY '67 OUT THERE.            

102
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,953

                 LET IT BOIL.   

103
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,889
                 WE DON'T WANT  
              THE HEAT TOO HIGH.

104
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,157
      WE DON'T WANT IT TO BROWN 
    TOO FAST WITHOUT COOKING IT.
YEAH.                           

105

114
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,780
 IF THE MEAT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
         JUST BY ITSELF,        

115
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,650

          REALLY LIGHT.         

122
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,130
    IT HAS A DIFFERENT FLAVOR   
       THAN ANYTHING ELSE       

123
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,165

THERE YOU GO.                   

126
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:35,340

136
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,896
        THE CHILE RELLENO       
  IS A COMMON DISH IN SANTA FE, 

137
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,964

138
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:01,900
   THEY'RE SO LIGHTLY BREADED,  

139
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,035
    AND IT REALLY BRINGS OUT    
        THE CHILE FLAVOR.       

140
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,771
SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE             
   THE ANAHEIMS,                

141
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,507
 AND THIS IS GONNA BE           
FOR OUR CHILE RELLENOS?         
           YEAH, CHILE RELLENOS.

142
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,575
WE'RE NOT GONNA PUT             
 ANYTHING ON THEM?              
                             NO.

143
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,044
   JUST THROW IT ON THE GRILL.  
 YOU LINE 'EM UP, LET 'EM ROAST,

144
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:15,313
AND THEN WHEN THEY GET DONE,    
   YOU'RE GONNA SWEAT 'EM.      

145
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,716
   THEY'VE COOLED DOWN.         
NOW YOU TAKE THE SKIN OFF.

171
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,638
    WHEN THE CHEESE             
IS OOZING OUT LIKE LAVA

THAT'S MONEY, DUDE.             

175
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,183
     I'M GONNA                  
TELL YOU SOMETHING.             

176
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,452
I'VE NEVER BEEN THAT MUCH       
 OF A CHILE RELLENO FAN,        

177
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,322
TYPICALLY BECAUSE THE BATTER    
        IS TOO EGGY.            

178
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:33,792
THIS IS LIGHT AND CREAMY        
       AND TENDER.              

179
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:36,594
I MEAN, JUST CUT IT             
 WITH A FORK AND--

00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,730
       ON POINT.                
I'M A HUGE FAN OF THAT.         

181
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,132
   THE RELLENOS ARE EXCELLENT.

THERE'S NONE BETTER.            

191
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,487
 I THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK
        ABOUT EXPANDING.        

192
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,689
    TWO WALLS ARE GONNA NEED    
        TO BE PUSHED OUT.       

193
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,958
  YOU GOT TO COME CHECK IT OUT. 
  I'M NOT KIDDING YOU. BANANAS. 

194
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,361

     <i> TO SALT LAKE CITY...</i>      
    THIS IS THE GOOD STUFF.     

195

<i>WHERE YOU GOT TO CHECK OUT WHAT</i> 
<i>THEY'RE DOING WITH THE BRISKET.</i> 

196
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:14,699
          DUDE. THAT IS         
WHAT THEY CALL A BURNT END. MMM.

197
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,368
            SO GOOD.            
                  IS THAT MONEY?

198
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,203
THAT'S CHA-CHING MONEY.         

199
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,341
 WHEN YOU'RE THINKING BARBECUE,

  JUST USE OUR HANDS.           
WE'RE PRETTY INFORMAL.          

397

  SO THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF CRAB 
 TO THAT AMOUNT OF BREADCRUMBS? 

400
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,718

RIGHT DOWN THE SPINE,           

410
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,673
JUST KIND OF WORK YOUR WAY      
      DOWN THE BONES.
