                 It's called    
               a lobster tail.  

117
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:22,928
   I thought we're gonna have,  
              like,             

118
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,930
        Lobster Thermidor       
          or something.         

119
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,265
   <i> This</i> is what we're making?  

120
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:29,468
              That is a flaky,  
               layered pastry   

121
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,069
      stuffed with pâte à choux.

122
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:34,072
         And that's gonna expand
        and make an empty shell.

123
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:37,208
    Buddy, this is not funny    
  'cause you know I don't bake. 

124
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,877
          -Ah, come on!         
       -This is not funny.      

125
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,080
   -So put the oven about 350.  
             -Okay.             

126
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:45,684
             Take the raw tails,
 put a piece of parchment paper.

127
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,752
              I even sent them  
          parchment paper, Alex.

128
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:48,953
              I'm just saying.  

129
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,488
     Line them up like this?    

130
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,758
            Yeah, you got to put
                 six to nine    

131
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,891
          on a half a sheet pan.

132
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,093
         They're gonna get long.

133
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:58,429
         This is the best vessel
            that you'll ever use

134
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,433
        to put, like, a piece of
     prosciut and mozz in there.

135
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,568
  Oh, we're putting prosciutto  
    and mozzeralla in there?    

136
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,702
         I'm happy now.         

137
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,571
        -Forgeddaboutit.        
           -All right.          

138
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,573
        Throw those in the oven,
               bake them off.   

139
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,775
   -How long they got to bake?  
          -30 minutes.          

140
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,377
         So let me just         
       get this straight.       

141
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:13,979
     You wanted to go first,    

142
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,181
     and now we got to wait     
           30 minutes?          

143
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,716
     Hope you guys got a lot    
         to talk about.         

144
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,785
Should we hop onto someone else 
for now while we wait?          

145
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:21,653
          Perfect idea.         
      Who wants to go next?     

146
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,254
             -I do.             
         -Guarnaschelli.        

147
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,656
         ICAG's up next.        

148
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,993
      -Yay, yay, yay, yay!      
 -Guarnaschelli! Guarnaschelli! 

149
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,394
     I asked you to give us     
        a little rundown        

150
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,662
  of what's going on at Butter  

151
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,597
      and how you're doing      
     and all your projects.     

152
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:36,001
 This is the one and only ICAG. 

153
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,335
     I'm Alex Guarnaschelli.    

154
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,070
     I'm the chef at Butter     
          in York City.         

155
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,005
        I'm an Iron Chef.       
     I'm a "Chopped" judge.     

156
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,142
 I think it displays what a good
 cook you are, with no argument.

157
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,144
   I'm a "Triple-G" champion.   

158
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,545
        I love it, baby.        
            -Come on.           

159
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,013
And I'm gonna continue my streak

160
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,016
     by making the best dish    
          for you, Guy,         

161
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,751
        "Triple-D"-style.       

162
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,886
                     ♪♪         

163
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:57,688
So, Alex, is that it?           
Just one little package?        

164
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,291
                 Oh, my God.    
                  Come on!      

165
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,895
You know that this is not enough
    Parmesan for the Fieris.    

166
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:04,963
  It's one serving.             

167
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,098
          You only sent         
       one serving, Alex?       

168
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,568
    -Hi, Hunter. How are you?   
     -I'm doing great, Alex.    

169
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,036
      How are you feeling today,
                Hunter? Good?   

170
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,439
               Congratulations  
             on your graduation.

171
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,307
           Guy, how's your wife?

172
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,776
          [ Laughter ]          

173
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,179
Take notes, everyone.           

174
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,714
    Chef, what are we making?   

175
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,517
So we're doing a cavatappi pasta
       with yellow tomato sauce,

176
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,919
      which a little bit sweeter
                and low acid,   

177
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,788
         and spicy lamb sausage.

178
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,922
                 Super easy.    

179
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,257
       At my restaurant, Butter,

180
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:36,128
I have had this dish on the menu
         for, I think, 16 years.

181
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,397
   Chef, olive oil in the pan,  
         tomatoes first?        

182
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,134
     No, shallots, garlic first,
 please, with red pepper flakes.

183
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:43,401
             Got it.            

184
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,870
         One thing that's really
            important is cooking

185
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:47,672
         the shallot-garlic base
            and not browning it,

186
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:51,209
         but just gently kind of
cooking it in the oil with salt.

187
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,344
            No pepper because of
          the red pepper flakes.

188
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,481
    We don't want to mix peppers
        'cause it gets too spicy

189
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,350
                  and then      
            it burns your mouth.

190
00:06:58,352 --> 00:06:59,818
            -Got it.            
        -Give me a stir.        

191
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,885
      Give me some salt, Hunter.

192
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,355
                Come on, man.   
     I'm going for the win here.

193
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:06,357
   While that's working, Chef,  
    let's start on this lamb.   

194
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,693
              Okay, so you have 
              the lamb sausage. 

195
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:11,629
              It's ground lamb, 
    a mixture of different cuts.

196
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,632
     Usually I like the shoulder
   just 'cause the lamb shoulder

197
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:15,433
             has a lot of taste.

198
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,036
              Some cumin seeds  
                and cayenne.    

199
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,571
        Little bit of high heat,
                  browning,     

200
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,106
                  broken up     
              into little bits. 

201
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,241
                  Boy, Guy,     
    you have the best technique.

202
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,043
                Look at you.    
                 I love it.     

203
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,445
         Bringing it on.        
 Boy, she's putting it on there.

204
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,514
 Hunter, you've been working out
                  or what?      

205
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:32,450
         You look really jacked.
 Hunter looks great.            

206
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,386
   Can I season the lamb now,   
              Chef?             

207
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:36,120
             -Yeah.             
            -Paprika.           

208
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,455
                 Cumin seed.    

209
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,391
     I have some really good    
      fresh cracked pepper.     

210
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:41,059
      Fresh cracked pepper.     

211
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,727
             Okay, ay-yi-yi-yi. 

212
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,596
     Nope, not black pepper.    

213
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,664
      Don't mix the pepper.     

214
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,065
              GUY:              
     Okay, a little cayenne.    

215
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,267
 You just put a lot             
 of pepper in there.            

216
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,601
    Just a pinch.               
     Oh, my God.                

217
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:51,937
 Don't dump that in.            
Don't do it. Don't do it.       

218
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,206
   I put the amount of pepper   
    you put in the container.   

219
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,208
                   Do it!       
                 Do it now!     

220
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,809
    Killing 'em!                

221
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,011
            And salt.           
      All this salt, Chef?      

222
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:04,015
               I am exhausted.  

223
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,483
  Alex, can I dump              
    the tomatoes?               

224
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,153
               Please, Hunter.  

225
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,221
          Just start breaking up
                the tomatoes    

226
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,156
             a little bit, like,
                with a spoon,   

227
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,958
          'cause we're gonna put
                  your pan      

228
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,694
          of tomatoes and garlic
        and such in the blender.

229
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,097
              Okay.             
   Tomatoes are cooking down,   

230
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,898
   and I don't want you folks   
         to go anywhere.

235
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:32,611
          Welcome back.         

236
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:35,013
   This is "Triple-D Takeout,"  
       celebrity edition.       

237
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,148
 We have our favorite chefs from
      around the country --     

238
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,150
       Alex Guarnaschelli,      
       Brooke Williamson,       

239
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:44,956
   Cake Boss Buddy, G. Garvin,  
 and the one and only Beau Mac. 

240
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,292
           So, Buddy,           
   you sent us lobster tails?   

241
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:51,296
   And those guys are gonna bake
           for about 30 minutes.

242
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:54,632
     Alex sent us lamb pasta    
   with these yellow tomatoes.  

243
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,234
         Explain to me,         
  where's this dish from, Chef? 

244
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:00,972
               GUARNASCHELLI:   
        So I started out wanting
        to make, like, a lasagna

245
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,842
  that was kind of, like, punchy
             with, like, vinegar

246
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,777
               and brightness   
           with a ton of cheese.

247
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,245
       So I put it all together,
               and I was like,  

248
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,713
     "This sauce is really good.

249
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,982
          It just doesn't belong
              where I put it."  

250
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,585
       So I tossed it with pasta
              for family meal.  

251
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,920
                 I was like,    
   "I'm not wasting this sauce."

252
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:19,857
      And we were browning lamb,
 and I just threw them together.

253
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,993
           And people were like,
             "This is so good." 

254
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,195
   Tomatoes are cooking down.   
          White pepper?         

255
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,797
                    Yeah.       
             Only a little bit. 

256
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,765
                 Stop, stop.    
              Oh, my God. Stop. 

257
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,601
        More pepper, Guy.       
          More pepper!          

258
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:30,935
           Oregano --           
       all of it, though?       

259
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,271
          -I think so.          
   -And a little bit of salt.   

260
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,140
          -Yes, please.         
             -Great.            

261
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:36,341
      And then you want to      
            take that           

262
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,342
      to the food processor     
         or the blender?        

263
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:42,747
          If you have a blender,
              I would love it.  

264
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,615
             And you should have
         some rice wine vinegar.

265
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,951
   -All the rice wine vinegar?  
          -Yes, please.         

266
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,421
         Let's make that bad boy
                   smooth.      

267
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,023
              Then put it back  
     in the sauté pan and get it

268
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:55,026
     reducing a little bit more,
    and then we're gonna adjust.

269
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,494
        Looks beautiful.        

270
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,563
         How's my lobster tails,
                    Guy?        

271
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,365
              Ahhh!             

272
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,033
            Rowaahh!            

273
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,235
              -Yes.             
  -Oh, I gotta drop that pasta. 

274
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,371
                This is just    
              cavatappi pasta.  

275
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,840
        Cavatappi is "corkscrew"
                 in Italian.    

276
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,975
                   Hunter,      
              taste that sauce. 

277
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,978
         Do you get the vinegar?
  Does it need a pinch of sugar?

278
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,647
I mean, if I were there, like,  
I'd be big-time fussing         

279
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,449
and shooing you away            
   from the stove,              

280
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,651
  and now I have to             
just kind of like...            

281
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,119
      I think it could use      
     a little touch of salt     

282
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,320
    and black pepper, but...    

283
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,656
   -More pepper. More pepper.   
        -Okay. Put it in.       

284
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:27,525
   I love the vinegar in that.  

285
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:31,062
          Guy, I sent you, like,
    a beautiful block of cheese,

286
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:35,066
   and you're grating literally,
    like, a tiny cube right now.

287
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,868
                What happened   
               to the cheese?   

288
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,336
 Well, I'm gonna tell you this. 

289
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:42,006
      We kicked things off      
       with a nice snack.       

290
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,541
                 Oh, my God.    

291
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:45,009
          It's like he's grating
                  the rind.     

292
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,545
     There's, like, a tablespoon
                 of cheese.     

293
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:50,014
        So Alex sent this       
       to make pasta with.      

294
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,617
           That's odd.          

295
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,886
      Where's the pasta at?     
          Pasta ready?          

296
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,288
           Look at this, Hunter.

297
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,823
                  Just like     
         you're cooking at home.

298
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,425
              I always do that. 

299
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:03,762
           Look at those biceps.
             What did I tell ya?

300
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,897
        Bam! Watch this.        
     Hunter and his muscles.    

301
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,432
          I had to save         
        some pasta water.       

302
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:08,967
         I didn't know.         
                      okay.     

303
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,035
       Okay, you want this      
    all into the sauce, chef?   

304
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,037
   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
                    Ah...       

305
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,106
         You're pretty far away.
           How about half of it?

306
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,308
              'Cause I want it  
                to be saucy.    

307
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,043
     Could you just say that    
      for me one more time?     

308
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,178
      Saw-see!                  

309
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,346
      I know true Italian dishes
               are not saucy,   

310
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,448
              but this bad boy  
                  is saucy!     

311
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,585
              Yes! Say it loud. 

312
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:30,188
         -There you go.         
         -Okay, perfect.        

313
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,858
      Okay, so I need that sauce
      to, like,<i> cook</i> that pasta.

314
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,862
             -Okay.             
    -Isn't it so silky, Guy?    

315
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,597
               Isn't the taste  
                 wonderful?     

316
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,398
      It's silky and tangy.     

317
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,601
       Let's get the crispy lamb
                  on there      

318
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:46,271
       drained of excess grease.

319
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:47,539
                    Yes!        

320
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,207
         And then I need a bowl.

321
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,075
             And then I want you
                to layer it.    

322
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,877
Make sure there's sauce.        

323
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,412
Make sure there's meat          
      in there.                 

324
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,614
             -Yeah.             
      -Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.      

325
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:57,882
     Hype it up.                

326
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,018
 Would that be good             
   stuffed inside               

327
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,753
   one of Buddy's               
   lobster tails?               

328
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:05,289
      -Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.      
   -Let's just marry the two.   

329
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,158
Right now, let's do it.         

330
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,093
    GUARNASCHELLI: And then work
           that cheese in there.

331
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,561
         Cheese, cheese, cheese.

332
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,763
     I almost can't see it.     

333
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,031
     It's like it's snowing     
          in New York.          

334
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,166
                 I love it.     
                   Dig in.      

335
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:18,036
      It should be with a spoon,
               really, kind of  

336
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:19,704
           'cause you got to get
              sauce and stuff.  

337
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,039
You know what I'm saying?       

338
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:24,241
This is not for the --

00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,512
It's a sticky rice base,        

450
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,048
     a beautiful                
sesame seaweed aioli.           

451
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,249
And then what we're gonna do    

452
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,784
 is we're gonna cook            
the rock shrimp two ways.       

453
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,719
We're gonna deep fry            
     and sauté,                 

454
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:29,721
and we're just gonna            
  build this, like,             

455
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:32,056
almost like a casserole.        

456
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,192
        -That's so cute.        
    -Oh, you sent cast iron?    

457
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,793
     I sent them                
  a cast-iron pan.              

458
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,327
That's my little gift.          

459
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,197
I would have sent 20            
 if I'd known Buddy             

460
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,498
  was gonna step up             
    like he did.                

461
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,666
  Like, now I feel              
 ashamed of myself.             

462
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,801
         Wait a second.         

463
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,536
        I'm glad you knew       
    Jules was gonna be here,    

464
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:48,272
    'cause that's just enough   
rock shrimp for Jules's portion.

465
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:51,008
              -Yes.             
 -How do you want to start this?

466
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,276
Let's make the aioli.           

467
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,879
 So in a sauté pan,             
do equal parts of ginger,       

468
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:57,014
garlic, and shallots,           
and whatever you do,            

469
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,082
we'll add the mayonnaise        
   in at the end,               

470
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,349
and we'll figure it out.        

471
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,552
You want to get a little        
diced jalapeño in that mix.     

472
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,387
        Just gonna sweat        
         that out a bit.        

473
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,623
   Yep. Oh, yeah.               
And soak the seaweed.           

474
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,759
       So we're just gonna      
   steep this dry seaweed how?  

475
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:09,960
   Just in water.               

476
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,096
It's gonna take about five      
to six minutes to soften up.    

477
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,698
That just adds texture          
    to the aioli                

478
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,233
and a cool little taste.        
             Got it.            

479
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,436
 So now you can take            
some of that Chinese sausage.   

480
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:21,172
  I dice in, like,              
little 1/4-inch pieces,         

481
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,040
 and I flash fry it.            

482
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,242
Hunter, if you want to open up  
  the rock shrimp,              

483
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,511
some of that rock shrimp        
is gonna be sautéed lightly     

484
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:30,048
in a little butter with half    
a bunch of green onions,        

485
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,449
and then the remaining half     
 of that rock shrimp            

486
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,785
you just soak in buttermilk,    

487
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:36,521
and we'll just dredge it        
in a seasoned flour.            

488
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,523
       Now time to fry up       
        the rock shrimp.        

489
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,191
           -Beautiful.          
        -All right, Beau.       

490
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,792
    Am I pickling something?    
             -Yeah.             

491
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,795
The rest of those little        
jalapeños and Fresnos           

492
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:46,263
you can pickle in straight      
 rice wine vinegar.             

493
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:49,666
 Okay. What do you want going on
  with these cashews, Beau Mac? 

494
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,535
 Just a quick toast             
   in a pan, Guy,               

495
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,871
and a little crumble,           
like you can just smash them.   

496
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,473
      Good. We haven't used     
           every pan,           

497
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:58,209
         so this will be        
 rounding out to every pan now. 

498
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,945
  And there's just              
10 more steps to this dish.     

499
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,080
                 [ Laughs ]     

500
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,281
If your sautéed ginger,         
shallots, and garlic is ready,  

501
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,884
you want to deglaze that        
with a little bit of soy sauce  

502
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,352
and put a splash of mirin       

503
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,487
   and a splash of              
rice wine vinegar in that.      

504
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,823
  You just want to              
  deglaze it down,              

505
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:13,957
but have about an ounce         
 of that liquid left            

506
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:17,361
to fold into the mayo.          

507
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,096
    How much of this seaweed,   
            Beau Mac?           

508
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,898
     You squeeze                
a little residual out.          

509
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,833
     Let's make                 
about a cup of aioli.           

510
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,102
Just put enough in there.       

511
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,437
Give it a little texture        
 and a little body.             

512
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,038
        Hey, Guy, I hope        
         you don't mind         

513
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,107
    but I'm gonna take a bite   
    of my sandwich over here.   

514
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,376
        GUY: No, please.        
     Go right ahead, Buddy.     

515
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:34,112
     I'm watching you cook.     
      I'm hungry over here.     

516
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,647
    Beau, there's our ratios    
  that we got in there, buddy.  

517
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,449
That's perfect, Guy.            
   That's perfect.              

518
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,918
               Beau, this dish  
              looks delicious.  

519
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,521
      It has so many ingredients
    that we chefs ourselves eat.

520
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,325
       This feels like something
   I would cook on after service

521
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,660
          and eat in the kitchen
               with everybody.  

522
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,929
Alex, I will be there           
  when you do, kid.             

523
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,531
  Just let me know.             
     I'm ready.                 

524
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:54,598
        What do you want        
         first in this?         

525
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,667
 Rice gets lined up             
 almost to the top.             

526
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,802
Let's take some of that         
beautiful buttered rock shrimp  

527
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,339
with the green onions           
and just make a nice layer      

528
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,808
almost to kind of coat          
     that rice.                 

529
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,075
Take a little ground            
  Chinese sausage.              

530
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,811
You got that on there, too.     
  That's beautiful.             

531
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,146
  And a little bit              
  of your toasted,              

532
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,680
 crushed-up cashews.            

533
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:10,681
       HUNTER: Crushed-up.      

534
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,750
    Almost cover                
that whole thing of rice        

535
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:14,285
with this thin sheet            
    of the aioli.               

536
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:15,419
It goes out of the broiler,     

537
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,688
 and it will bubble             
  like bubbly love,             

538
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,492
hot lava bubbles like           
shrimp dynamite, deliciousness. 

539
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,961
        Hot, bubbly love!       

540
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,697
    GUY: All right, Beau Mac,   
 toasted up the mayonnaise here 

541
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,031
         with the ginger        
         and the garlic         

542
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,567
        and a little bit        
         of the seaweed         

543
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,968
         and little bit         
          of jalapeño.          

544
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,169
          Final steps?          

545
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,105
Garnish with that beautiful     
 fried rock shrimp.             

546
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,108
  Popcorn shrimp are delicious  
       in the buttermilk.       

547
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,443
        Nice.                   

548
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,112
Put some of your chilies        
     on there,.                 

549
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:44,114
        Beau, I can hear        
         Jules growling         

550
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,584
         across the way         
       from me right now.       

551
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:49,253
     Wait, wait, wait, wait.    

552
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,188
Fried popcorn shrimp tossing.   

553
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,857
         -In the mouth.         
   -This is a pretty big one.   

554
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,594
           Oh, money.           
        -Nice job, Jules.       

555
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:59,463
Put maybe a little dash         
  of that furikake.             

556
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,265
    There it is.                
That's what I'm talking about.  

557
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,666
              Ooh!              

558
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,069
         Fantastic dish.        
          Very simple.          

559
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,871
          Very petite.          
 Beau, where are the chopsticks?

560
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,206
       Right?                   
I didn't send chop--            

561
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,274
             Check Buddy's box. 

562
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,943
            Hell, you might find
             some in there, too.

563
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:13,945
  Found a pair of cowboy boots. 

564
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:16,547
        Mmm!                    

565
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,549
      -I don't know, Alex.      
            -Oh, no.            

566
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,419
          He might be giving you
           a run for your money.

567
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,687
            -Oh, man.           
    -Hunter, you look great.    

568
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,022
           I knew you were gonna
                  say that.     

569
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:27,691
Your biceps look great          
    eating that.                

570
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:31,228
   Have you worked out since you
     made my dish again, Hunter?

571
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,964
       -Ahhh, ha, ha, ha!       
          -This is sad.         

572
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,300
       This is what I love      
     about the way you cook.    

573
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:40,170
           Beau Mac is          
     a ballerina linebacker.    

574
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,439
   It looks petite and gentle.  

575
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:45,710
        And then it just        
         takes you out.         

576
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:46,977
   The rice -- thank goodness   

577
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,179
   we have a good amount of it  
          at the bottom         

578
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:51,382
       because its flavors      
      all the way through.      

579
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:52,649
     The tender rock shrimp     

580
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,118
         with the butter        
     and the green onion --     

581
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,986
         it's unctuous.         
       That's what it is.       

582
00:20:55,988 --> 00:21:00,391
And then I get to the crispiness
 of the sausage, the nuttiness. 

583
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,727
   But then as soon as you hit  
            the mayo,           

584
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,194
        back to unctuous.       
   The aioli, yeah.             

585
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,463
      Bam. Bam.                 

586
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:08,398
      Then you get the fry,     
     nice, light, and crispy    

587
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,535
 and the cleaning of the palate 
     with that Fresno chili.    

588
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:14,204
    And then you go back in,    
  and that's when they get you. 

589
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,673
       Right.                   

590
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:17,541
     When it hits your lips     
        the first time...       
    It's dangerous.             

591
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,943
     ...it's a texture train    
    going to Flavortown, bro.   

592
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,611
             You didn't say that
               about my dish.   

593
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,214
     'Cause yours is already    
        from Flavortown.        

594
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:24,949
       You just came back.      
 You're a rocket that came back 

595
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,284
        and picked us up        
 and took us back to Flavortown.

596
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,486
           Nice recovery, buddy.

597
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,088
        Now, do you guys        
    wanna see a magic trick?    

598
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,824
           Watch this.          
I'll hand it over out of screen,

599
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,693
     and it will disappear.     

600
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:36,894
             -Ta-da!            
             -Ta-da!            

601
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,562
  There goes the lunch bucket.  
           All right.           

602
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:41,031
 -Beau, that was awesome, dude. 
     -Beau, fantastic dish.     

603
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,300
You guys are awesome.           
Thanks, Hunter. Thanks, Guy.    

604
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,702
      -Good job, Beau Mac.      
           -All right.          

605
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:46,703
       Can we -- now that       
      we've had a chance --     

606
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,372
            I mean...           
          oh, my gosh.          

607
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:49,639
       -I'm already full.       
         -Shake it off.         

608
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,908
       -I'm already full.       
    -I got to get some water.   

609
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,243
        Gonna have to go        
        for a brief run.        

610
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,779
     Buddy, we ready to talk    
         lobster tails?         

611
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:57,982
          -I am ready.          
         -Lobster tails.        

612
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,783
     Nice and brown, Buddy.     
         They look good.        

613
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,585
                  Perfect.      
                Thanks, Guy.    

614
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,854
         -Let them cool?        
    -Yeah, let them cool now.   

615
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,789
    All right, lobster tails    
       when we come back.       

616
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:06,757
        See you in a bit.       
             -Yeah!

626
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:33,951
     Hey, Guy, I got someone who
 wants to come say hello to you.

627
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:36,754
              -Hi.              
    -Hey there. How are you?    

628
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:38,088
       Gosh, you're better      
         blond than me.         

629
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,890
        -Looks like fun.        
          -How are you?         

630
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:42,159
     -I'm good. How are you?    
          -Doing good.          

631
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:44,495
       Just eating myself       
        into the ground,        

632
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:47,164
            you know,           
       one bite at a time.      

633
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,432
       But you look great.      
        Nice to see you.        

634
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:51,034
   Buddy's walking us through   
    lobster tails right now.    

635
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,503
       So if you ever want      
         to see anybody         

636
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:54,905
    that does the piping bag    
   the wrong way, stay tuned.   

637
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:58,108
                 That's it.     
                 That's it.     

638
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,778
     This is Buddy, Round 2.    
         [<i> Ding! Ding!</i> ]        

639
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,313
It's like "Groundhog Day."      

640
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:04,782
    We're unpackaging again.    
       What's in here now?      

641
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:07,118
    -Didn't we just do this?    
   -An elf jumps out of here.   

642
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,653
             You need the cream 
              to stuff it with. 

643
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:13,057
          -Is this it?          
   -Yeah, that you need, yeah.  

644
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,659
        Okay. All right.        

645
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:18,596
    So I see the lobster tail   
           reference.           

646
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:19,997
       I understand that.       

647
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:22,332
         How would that be for a
    little sandwich vessel, Guy?

648
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:25,602
I think your idea of going ahead
  and making something savory,  

649
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,204
          that would be         
       right up my alley.       

650
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:28,605
       Do you warm this up      
        after you do it,        

651
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:29,740
    or it's room temperature?   

652
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,476
                 We serve it    
              room temperature. 
            Okay.               

653
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:34,611
              And then you put  
        the cold cream in there,

654
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:38,482
     but it could be served warm
    if you did something savory.

655
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:39,683
     Now, tell me, Buddy --     

656
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,353
    again, I don't know much    
        about this stuff,       

657
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:44,288
       but this looks like      
          a croissant.          

658
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,691
    It looks like it has all    
 the lacquering of a croissant. 

659
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:50,494
               We take a dough  
    that's just flour and water.

660
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:53,563
          We roll it out as thin
            as you possibly can.

661
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:57,434
      And then we lather butter,
             shortening on top. 

662
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,236
I love the word "lather."       

663
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:01,772
I think it might be my favorite 
word of the day today.          

664
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,841
      -Lather the layers...     
           -I love it.          

665
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:08,245
             ...and as it bakes,
      you get the crispy layers.

666
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:11,915
             -Whoo!             
 -They basically fry in the oven

667
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,384
              because they got  
        all that butter on them,

668
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,386
             and we roll it up. 

669
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,923
               And two people   
             have to stretch it.

670
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:21,658
             And then we cut it 
                into slices.    

671
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,862
     And then each one is opened
              into, like, a --  

672
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:26,897
             almost like a cone.

673
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:29,599
      And then when you bake it,
                 it expands,    

674
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,868
               and you fill it  
                with a spoon    

675
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,138
             with pâte à choux, 
              a creampuff mix.  

676
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,607
             Now, if you wanted 
               to get savory,   

677
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:39,143
       you can flavor the choux,
                   right,       

678
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:42,679
          with whatever you want
              to get that layer 

679
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:45,415
            of herbs or whatever
              you want into it. 

680
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:48,218
       Now, what do we do?      
Do we poke a hole in the bottom?

681
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,689
      Yeah. Poke a hole and then
        cut the tip of the cream

682
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:53,824
               and fill it up.  

683
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,359
    I'm not a big sweets guy.   
           What is it?          

684
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:58,161
   What is the filling inside,  
             though?            

685
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,365
         Okay, so the filling is
              our custard cream 

686
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:05,902
        mixed with whipped cream
and a little bit of Irish cream.

687
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,505
        Nice.                   

688
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:09,640
            Did you cut the hole
              big enough, Guy?  

689
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:11,375
                That's good.

         a hand-laminated dough?

693
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,718
     It's not a laminated dough,
                   but...       

694
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,185
             VALASTRO: It's not 
          a laminated dough, no.

695
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,055
    It is a laminated dough,    
 or it's not a laminated dough? 

696
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:27,525

             a laminated dough. 

697

of Alex's dish in it,           

698
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:32,596
it's a "lamb-inated" dough,     
        baby.                   

699
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:34,164

       on that dough, man.

705

             Buddy,             
    let me get back to this.    

711
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:04,161
        And I really want       
     to be serious about it.    

712

     I'm not a dessert guy,     
     and everybody knows it.    

713
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:10,300
  The mixture that you've made  
 inside of it is nice and light.

714
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:13,103
         So you got a little bit
   of that Irish cream in there,

715
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:15,239
                but it's not    
              too overpowering. 

716
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,841
  But really what wins it over  

717
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:20,711
      is all the texturing      
    inside the lobster tail.

      what you put in this.

Super crunchy and soft.

      to Playa Provisions.

and a couple of t-shirts.

     And the great thing is,    
  is you sent me a "schmedium,"

    I don't know.               
Hunter's been working out,      

793

796
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,783
        All right, Chef,        
    give us a little rundown.   

797
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:15,819
         Oh! I see some         
      big old fat lobsters.     

798
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:17,587
   I see a little lobster roll  
            going on.           

799
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,122
      Is that what we got?      
    Yeah.                       

800
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:22,392
So I was afraid that            
you would be a little let down  

801
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:25,462
by the fact that Buddy was      
giving you lobster tails,       

802
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:27,397
but they didn't taste           
    like lobster.               

803
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,733
          Shots fired!          

804
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:31,535
We're pretty well known         
for our lobster roll,           

805
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:34,671
which is a traditional          
fold-mayo-style lobster roll.   

806
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:37,207

 we're doing today.

808
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:42,212
            I got it.           

809
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:44,747
So, basically, we're doing a    
Connecticut-style lobster roll, 

810
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,217
 but we're mixing in            
 some Dungeness crab            

811
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,018
and some tiger shrimp           
      in there                  

812
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,288
and then sort of based          
  all that seafood              

813
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,289
in some lobster butter.         

814

              Ooh!

Butter those brioche rolls      
with that lobster butter.

       the lobster rolls?       

820
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:09,439
The actual rolls are made       
by Rockenwagner Bakery.         

821
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:12,108
A good friend of mine,          
Hans Rockenwagner, makes those. 

822
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,710
And they're the best            
      in town.                  

823
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:16,580
So I bought them fresh,         
wrapped them up individually.   

824
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:19,516
  They've got lots

        All right, Chef,        
      let's get into this.      

832
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:38,335
           How are we           
       starting this off?       

833
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:41,405
So that habanero hot sauce --   
that's just a gift for you.     

834
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,673
But it's really good            
on the lobster roll.            

835
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,675
             I am so            
       getting after this.      

836
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,544
I sent you a whole lobster,     

837
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:50,947
but you do have some containers 
of portioned-out seafood,       

838
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:54,618
so each one of those containers 
will fit into one roll.         

839
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,821
It's Dungeness crab,            
tiger shrimp, and lobster.      

840
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:01,891
It's all been cooked in,        
like, a court-bouillon of garlic

841
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,361
      and onion                 
and Old Bay Seasoning.          

842
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,229
So those are Meyer lemons.      

843
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,365
  -Beautiful ones, by the way.

        -Did you really?        
             -Yeah.             

846
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:12,836
     Chef, how are we gonna     
         start the dish?        

847
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:14,771
                 So open up     
            your lobster butter.

848
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:16,506
             We take the shells 
               of the lobster   

849
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:19,375
     once it's been cleaned with
    a little shallot and garlic,

850
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,445
           and then we simmer it
                 in butter,     

851
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,514
            and then we actually
           put it into a blender

852
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:27,050
    and grind it all up and then
  stream it through cheesecloth.

853
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,851
        So we get all the flavor
            out of those shells,

854
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,454
               which is where   
          most of the flavor is.

855
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:33,256
 And that technique right there 
of making that lobster butter --

856
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,925
   the richness and the depth.  
            I mean...           

857
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:36,259
Tastes like lobster, right?     

858
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,395
      Guy, you need to take     
       that lobster butter      

859
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,063
      and ship it to Buddy      

860
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:43,133
      so he bakes his dough     
    with that lobster butter,   

861
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:45,469
    and there you go -- bam!    

862
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:47,137
         The neckerchief        
       is too tight, Beau.      

863
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:49,138

        the circulation.

  Little butter on these, Chef? 

866
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:53,343
               On the outside   
                of the rolls,   

867
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:54,745
           like, a decent amount
                 of butter.     

868
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,613
  And then you're gonna go ahead
           and toast those rolls

869
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:58,749
              and then set them

               already cooked.  

871
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:02,419
             You just literally 
             want to warm it up.

872
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,154
               And I sent you

            some lobster butter.

874
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,693
  You kind of just want to sweat
    those shallots a little bit,

875
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:12,495
           and then you're gonna
              add your seafood. 

876
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,564
              Once it's totally 
               warmed through,  

877
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:17,167
       you're gonna put a little
        of that Meyer lemon zest

878

   So that's an original recipe.
                 True story.    

1006
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:10,660
           Delicious.           
       Thank you, G-Money.      

1007
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:11,861
                  The dish      
            we're doing today --

1008
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:15,265
        it is the short rib ragu
           with the penne pasta.

1009
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:18,668
    Let's talk about this, G.   
    Where's this recipe from?   

1010
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,937
               This is the way  
         my grandma raised me --

1011
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,339
       on incredible short ribs,

1012
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:24,474
   which you and I have actually
              cooked together.  

1013
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:26,876
    -I mean, there you go, G.   
       -Come on! Come on!       

1014
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:30,113
  Southern staple.              
Take these short ribs,          

1015
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:33,283
braise them down in their       
own liquid for four hours,      

1016
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:37,553
super low, cover and close      
for another 45 or so minutes.   

1017
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,889
 And then I do this             
    penne rigate                

1018
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:41,691
with the tomato sauce.          

1019
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:43,826
   Absolutely love              
    Italian food.               

1020
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:46,463
         He's my<i> pisan!</i>         

1021
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:48,231
You know, when I started        
in the food business,           

1022
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:49,966
there was no black chefs,       
       right?                   

1023
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:51,635
   And what I love              
   about today is               

1024
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:53,436
            it doesn't feel like
              a bunch of chefs. 

1025
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,438
           It feels like a bunch
               of good people   

1026
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,908
              making great food 
   that speaks to us all, right?

1027
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,110
                I appreciate    
              that so much, G.  

1028
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,512
I'm just happy to be here.      

1029
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:04,247
      So there's three different
         things you're gonna do.

1030
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:08,384
  So you want to start the sauce
     with the olive oil, garlic,

1031
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:13,056
     the onion, the bell pepper,
       garlic salt, red chilies.

1032
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:14,791
   So you want to get them soft,
                    okay?       

1033
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:15,725
             Got it.            

1034
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:17,126
             In a separate pan, 

1035
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,195
            shred the short ribs
   'cause they're already ready.

1036
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:20,397
             They're really nice
                 and tender,    

1037
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:22,064
        so you want to take them
                off the bone.   
   Okay.                        

1038
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,533
         That looks like        
          a Hunter job.         

1039
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:26,602
          But, Hunter, don't mix
               the short ribs.  

1040
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:27,937
     Don't mix?                 

1041
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:30,273
       Shred the short rib, then
      just put them to the side.

1042
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:32,809
           Go ahead and break up
     those peeled plum tomatoes.

1043
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:33,876
       You want to squeeze them.

1044
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,478
Do you want me to crush these   
     in my hand                 

1045
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,746
like I'm milking the cow?       

1046
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:39,349
                  Exactly.      
           Let them sauté a bit.

1047
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:40,817
             Make a small well. 

1048
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,486
              You're gonna add  
   a tablespoon of tomato paste.

1049
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:46,156
Got it, Chef. What does Hunter  
do with those short ribs?       

1050
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:48,624
              Gonna sauté them, 
               super hot pan.   

1051
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,293
             Add a little bit of
                 the broth.     

1052
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:52,495
              You're gonna let  
       that simmer in the sauce.

1053
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,696
           You got some oregano.

1054
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:55,365
        Want to get some oregano
                  in there.     

1055
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:58,835
           Then you're gonna add
                the red wine.   

1056
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,770
            Now you're gonna add
              the tomato puree. 

1057
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:03,373
 So what I did was I cooked down
                the tomatoes,   

1058
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,641
           and I pureed them up.

1059
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:06,776
           -Beautiful.          
 -You're gonna let that simmer. 

1060
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:10,379
 While those short ribs get hot,
   you're gonna cook that pasta.

1061
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:13,182
        -Got it. Got it.        
    -How's those short ribs?    

1062
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,717
Needs a little soft.            

1063
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,853
              Yeah, hit it with 
           a little garlic salt.

1064
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:19,255
            There you go. Do it.
               There, the boy.  

1065
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:22,592
        Then pull the pasta out,
               add the penne.   

1066
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:25,728
            I want you to add in
the ricotta cheese to the sauce,

1067
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,130
             add the short rib. 

1068
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:30,066
     Short ribs, ricotta --     
    everybody's in the full.    

1069
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:31,735
                  Toss it.      

1070
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:33,602
              All right. Yeah.  
      And go ahead and plate it.

1071
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,337
      Yes! Yes.                 

1072
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,873
           And then you're gonna
              shave that Parm.  

1073
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,676
              Put a few dollops 
    of the ricotta over the top.

1074
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,345
                 Top it off     
          with some fresh basil.

1075
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:44,213
   A little of the chiffonade.  

1076
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,016
                You're done.    

1077
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:48,417
                  Gorgeous.     

1078
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,620
           And just so you know,
   when you guys all get invited

1079
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:53,156
            to LowCountry Steak,
            when you order this,

1080
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:56,025
            it's not short ribs,
             it's "shawt" ribs, 

1081
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:59,295
              -Ah!              
   -"Shawt" ribs. I like that.  

1082
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:01,297
  This dish right here gives me 

1083
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:03,966
     American-Italian meets     
           Atlanta...           

1084
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,968
       -Homestyle cooking,      
 -...a little homestyle cooking,

1085
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,505
     little red chili flake     
      on top, which I love.     

1086
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:10,306
      The beautiful ricotta     
        cooling it down,        

1087
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:13,243
      chiffonade of basil,      
       a beautiful pasta.       

1088
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:15,578
         Delicious dish,        
  lots of big flavor profiles.  

1089
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,713
 I think the key to it, though, 
     really is the short rib    

1090
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,983
   and the amount of short rib  
    you had us put in there.    

1091
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:23,118
   But awesome. Listen, guys,   
      you're great friends.     

1092
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,588
    The dishes were amazing,    
         super eclectic.        

1093
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,990
           I know that          
      you got to be tired.      

1094
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:28,791
       But if you give us       
     just a couple minutes,     

1095
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:30,393
          let me speak          
      with my constituents,     

1096
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:33,463
and we are going to determine...

1097
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:34,731
              -Oh.              
     -...who gets best dish.    

1098
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:37,400
      We'll be right back.      

1099
00:40:37,402 --> 00:40:40,269
It's been my great honor        
to sit with you all.            

1100
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,772
And I hope that the world       
      allows us                 

1101
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,607
   an opportunity               
 to break some bread            

1102
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,743
  and have a drink              
and show you some love.         

1103
00:40:46,745 --> 00:40:49,679
  Amen, baby. It's great to be  
    on this with you as well.   

1104
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:52,815
      It wasn't unanimous.      
    Jules was the tiebreaker.   

1105
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,485
    But we do have a winner.    
             -We do.            

1106
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:56,819
      Ladies and gentlemen,     
          the winner of         

1107
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,889
     the "Triple-D Takeout"     
     celebrity edition is...    

1108
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,092
      ...winner, winner --      

1109
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:04,894
        Beau Mac dinner!        

1110
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:08,231
              -Ah!              
   -Congratulations, Beau Mac.  

1111
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:11,234
      I think it has to do      
     with Jules has a major,    

1112
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:14,303
        major love affair       
  when it comes to Asian food.  

1113
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,239
       I got to tell you,       
 everybody did a fantastic job. 

1114
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:17,707
   I want to remind everybody   
         that's watching        

1115
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:20,576
  all these chefs are prepared  
to send this dish to your house.

              I'm sorry, guys.  
              I got locked out. 

1123
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,390
     It's all right, Buddy.     
       You were gonna win,      

1124
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:36,926
      and then it went out,     
     so we gave it to Beau.     

1125
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:39,395

         I could eat...         

1128
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,336
       I went into a coma.      

1129
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,672
That's -- put you on the couch  
  under a blanket.              

1130
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,408
              I ate it nonstop  
            when I got pregnant.

1131
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:53,543
