00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,268
 Hey, everybody. I'm Guy Fieri, 
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,671
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,407
          This trip...          
This is gonna be good.          

4
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,209
         ...we're going         
        coast to coast...       

5
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:12,077
One of my many talents.         

6
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:14,012
       ...for some killer       
        cultural cuisine.       

7
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,614
Something funky, something      
a little off the beaten path.   

8
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,816
         In Los Angeles,        
          California...         

9
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,485
                There's a lot   
               going on here.   

10
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:20,686
      ...an authentic taste     
       of the Big Easy...       

11
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,354
     It is like                 
  I'm in N'awlins.              

12
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,023
   ...smack-dab in the middle   
          of Chinatown.         

13
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,024
 That is outrageous.            

14
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,092
No, it really it is.            

15
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:28,627
       Then in East L.A...      

16
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,295
       We just                  
 dropped the hammer!            

17
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:33,832
     ...a funky fusion joint    
  spicing up Far-East flavor... 

18
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,434
     I'm ripping                
 that one off, man.             

19
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:37,302
  ...with a south-of-the-border 
              spin.             

20
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,905
This just turned into           
a gigantic Mexican maki roll.   

21
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:41,840
        And in Charlotte,       
        North Carolina...       

22
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:42,508
                  En garde.     

23
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,444
 ...a one-of-a-kind pizzeria... 

24
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:46,845
You learn something new         
     every day.                 

25
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,580
          ...serving up         
       a slice of Serbia.       

26
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,582
                  Yes, sir.     
Yes, Serbian.                   

27
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,584
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

28
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,020
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

29
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,201
     So, I got one for you.     

30
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:10,936
        Why would a dude        
        from New Orleans        

31
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,270
       that's been living       
         in Los Angeles         

32
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:13,539
      for the last 18 years     

33
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,875
 decide to open a Cajun-Creole  
    joint in old Chinatown?     

34
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,477
          Because of...         

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,878
           the smoker?          

36
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,012
       This, I got to see.      

37
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,648
           Welcome to           
the Little Jewel of New Orleans.

38
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:27,352
   Chaurice is up.              

39
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:28,687
   It's amazing how delicious   
         this place is.         

40
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,088

 and half and half.             

41
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,624
  Marcus is definitely bringing 
       New Orleans to L.A.      

42
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,026
          in a big way.         

43
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:37,095
FIERI: And when Louisiana native
    Marcus Christiana-Beniger   

44
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,697
         started looking        
      for the right kitchen     

45
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,632
 to turn out a New Orleans menu,

46
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,834
        well, it led him        
       right to Chinatown.      

47
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,703
          Southeast Louisiana --
               We smoke a lot.  

48
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:49,307
  You name it -- Tasso seasoning
         ham, boudin, andouille.

49
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,709
        So, it's important to us

50
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,111
           that we have a smoker
                of some size,   

51
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,113
      and any Chinese restaurant
               worth its salt   

52
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,248
      is gonna have a large one.

53
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,117
            In 2014,            
       he hit the jackpot.      

54
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,053
 So, the main reason            
  to get this joint             

55
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:01,920
     is because                 
  of a big kitchen.             

56
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,721
                Big kitchen,    
                large smoker.

Can...you...hear me?

Half and half po'boy.           

61
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,668
        I'm sitting here        
      with Miss Alice Wong,     

62
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,937
     who was Miss Chinatown     
           this year.           

63
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:22,474
  How do the folks in Chinatown 
   feel about this crazy Cajun  

64
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,542
      opening up this joint     
  in an old Chinese restaurant? 

65
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:25,611
    It's awesome.               

66
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,345
It's definitely welcome.        

67
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,880
          This food is          
 about as authentic as it gets. 

68
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,616
   Cochon de Lait.              

69
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,283
        Today, I'm having       
       the Cochon de Lait.      

70
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,818
   It's absolutely delicious.   

71

  Pork, pork, pork, pork, pork, 
       pork...in a po'boy.      

72
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:39,625
                 First off,     
  we're gonna get our rub going.

73
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:41,960
      Our house Creole seasoning
                 right here.    

74
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,228
             Dark chili powder. 

75
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,896
        Some light chili powder.

76
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,231
                  Cayenne.      

77
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,500
          We're gonna finish off
               with some salt.  

78
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,771
   We're gonna take the pork and
  make about 12 to 15 incisions.

79
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,841
                 Then slide     
           whole toes of garlic.

80
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,176
    This is gonna               
    get a chance                

81
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,912
to break down and really perfume
all the way through this.       

82
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,647
       Now green Tabasco pepper.

83
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,316
        So, I'm just gonna cover
                 all of it.     

84
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:05,850
 Ooh, there you go,             
   right in there.              

85
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,187
             We're gonna put our
  chicken stock in on the sides,

86
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:10,455
   and then finally, we're gonna
     finish it off with our rub.

87
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,924
Nice, big, fat coating          
     up on top.                 

88
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,859
You should really think about   
opening up a Cajun joint.       
                    [ Chuckles ]

89
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,129
            We're gonna cover it
   with plastic and then foil --

90
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:19,331
              make sure we got  
    a really tight seal on that.

91
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:23,335
      Cook it for 8½ to 12 hours
             around 230 to 250. 

92
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,137
What's up next?                 
                    Creole slaw.

93
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:26,338
   We got cabbage.              

94
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,873
            Shredded carrots,   
     some shredded white onions.

95
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,276
           Gonna finish that off
  with some sliced green onions.

96
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,677
                Lightly toss.   

97
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,347
         Our wet ingredients are
          Blue Plate mayonnaise,

98
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,349
                a New Orleans   
              regional staple,  

99
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,284
                 our Creole     
             house blend again, 

100
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:43,088
Creole mustard, and then lastly,
            apple-cider vinegar.

101
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,023
                  Go ahead      
             and whisk this in. 

102
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,225
             And then we'll add 
                our dressing.   

103
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,897
          Blue Plate mayonnaise,
 dress it with shredded cabbage.

104
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,300
  Use that cabbage              
as a short of buffer.           

105
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:58,036
Then we put our slaw            
directly right on there.        

106
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,972
          It's a small sandwich.

107
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:02,173
      Top that                  
 with some pickles.             

108
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,976
Rough-chopped parsley there,    
and again, some green onions.   

109
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,713
   Copious amounts              
    of our pork.                

110
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:09,781
   Liberal amounts              
 of hot sauce there.            

111
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,150
We're just gonna go ahead       
and wrap this bad boy.          

112
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,520
       And that's all she wrote.
And that's it.                  

113
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,325
             That's a real-deal 
                po'boy, man.    

114
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,994
               Pork's tender,   
           seasoning's balanced.

00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,996
  The highlight of the sandwich,
           for me, is that slaw.

116
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:25,997
          The slaw is righteous.

117
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,399
          It all comes together 
            incredibly well.    

118
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,067
    People that don't understand
              what a po'boy is, 

119
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:32,270
we're talking about a tremendous
            amount of tradition,

120
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,939
              and there's a lot 
               going on here.   

121
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,407
           Real deal. Delicious.

122
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,876
     Working on                 
   Cochon de Lait.              

123
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,411
    There is an insane amount   
    of meat on this sandwich.   

124
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,548
 It's super tender and flavorful
           and juicy.           

125
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,482
          It's so good.         

126
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,285
    My good buddy               
Chef Phillip Franklin Lee.      

127
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:47,352
              I grew up in L.A. 

128
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,421
                Chinatown is    
               a spot in L.A.   

129
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,022
              where, you know,  
         you can taste the soul.

130
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,624
So, it fits?                    
                   I think      
          it actually fits here.

131
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,761
     There's no other place     
that's like Little Jewel in L.A.

132
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:58,997
             FIERI:             
That's 'cause we're talking more
  than just a restaurant here.  

133
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,366
     Also got a nice, little    
  marketplace going on inside.  

134
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,769
   MAN: You can get all kinds   
  of regional products here --  

135
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,771
     all the ingredients --     
 all the beans, all the spices, 

136
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:08,307
          and the rices         
      and everything nices.     

137
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,975
          This is Evey,         
 and Evey actually is on my team

138
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,044
   from "Guy's Grocery Games,"  

139
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:13,779
   is the one that recommended  
           this joint.          

140
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,048
             EVEY: It's amazing.

141
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,849
       I'm trying to find       
     an apartment close by.     
                      [ Laughs ]

142
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,252
        But not too close       

143
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:22,453
  'cause I'd be here every day  
      picking up this dish.     

144
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,688
       CHRISTIANA-BENIGER:      
       Crawfish Mac is up.      

145
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,056
Not your average mac and cheese.

146
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,191
      Totally blew my mind.     

147
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,592
     FIERI: It's not good...    

148
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:30,929
         it's not great,        
        it's outstanding.       

149
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,331
   And that's coming up next.   

150
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:32,998
   Out of bounds.               

151
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,405
     FIERI: The Little Jewel    

152
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,407
      might be in the heart     
      of L.A.'s Chinatown,      

153
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,743
       but its soul lives       
         in New Orleans.        

154
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,411
Not the kind of place you'd find
   in the middle of Chinatown.  

155
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:47,612
       Blackened chicken.       

156
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,548
      FIERI: That's 'cause      
    Chef Marcus has a handle    

157
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,484
       on the Big Easy mix      
      of Cajun and Creole,      

158
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,419
   and there<i> is</i> a difference.   

159
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,421
    The Creole side of things --
             it's not as spicy. 

160
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,823
                  There is      
             more of a subtlety,

161
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:00,559
             whereas Cajun food 
            is definitely spicy.

162
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,828
           Either way,          
  here it's all about comfort.  

163
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,230
         It's all about         
     sticking to your ribs,     

164
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,231
and this is what this food does.

165
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,500
 Love the Crawfish Mac N Cheese.

166
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:10,902
It's very cheesy and comforting.

167
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,704
Crawfish Mac N Cheese.          

168
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,907
  So, we're gonna start off here
              with some butter. 

169
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,977
          We're gonna caramelize
              some onions here, 

170
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:19,978
         along with some garlic,

171
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,979
            and just let that go
            until they go clear.

172
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,582
            Now we're gonna take
  our heavy cream and curdle it.

173
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,317
You're going to curdle          
  the heavy cream?              

174
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,985
                 Absolutely.    
    With some fresh lemon juice.

175
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,387
           It's gonna mix better
              with the cheese,  

176
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,255
                and it's also   
              gonna break down  

177
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:33,258
  all the elements combined into
    the sauce that we're making.

178
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,527
    So, we're gonna go ahead now
             with our crawfish. 

179
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,661
                It is frozen.   

180
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:39,130
So, if you don't get it fresh,  
'cause of the season,           

181
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,598
how are you accounting          
      for that?                 

182
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,734
       I make a shellfish stock.

183

       Got it.                  

184
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,071
         And puree that directly
             into the crawfish. 

185
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,739
               We want to put   
             more flavor in it. 

186
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,407

going to the dentist.

188
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:53,011
             We're gonna go back
               to our onions.   

189
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,280
               We're gonna add  
              our house Creole. 

190
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:56,882
   Little cayenne.

00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,283
                Chili powder.

00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,951

193
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,752
              We're gonna take  
               our white wine.  

194
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,355
      We're gonna add it to this
      till it hits a low bubble.

  some mozzarella and provolone.

199
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:14,632
      So, this                  
 will all cook down.

how's the pasta gonna work?

      that we get as much flavor

        we're gonna plate it up.

208
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,648
       Is this                  
  a normal portion,             

209
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,450
  or are we feeding             
a bunch of people outside?      

210
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,785
                   This is      
              a normal portion. 

211
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,188
          We're gonna top it off
        with some dried cheeses,

212
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,055
             a little Parmesan, 
               Romano cheese.   

213
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,858
      Green onions, and finally,
     some rough-chopped parsley.

                There you go.   

215
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,269
   It's not good.               
   It's not great.              

216
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,071
  It's outstanding.             

217
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,406
I get more crawfish flavor      
     out of this                

218
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,342
      than I do                 
when I eat crawfish.            

219
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,677
     It was all                 
from that seafood stock         

220
00:07:58,679 --> 00:07:59,678
   that you cooked              
    the pasta in.               

221
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,813
 That is outrageous.            
  No, it really is.             

222
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,415
It's got a nice bite,           
nice acid, nice heat,           

223
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,084
     nice salt,

00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,826
     WOMAN: It's delicious.     

228
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,029
        It's very creamy,       
and it has a little spice to it.

229
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,898
       Sauce and craw mac.      

230
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,766
              To my right here, 
              Alison Victoria.  

231
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:24,236
    Usually, you see her on DIY,
             "Kitchen Crashers."

232
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:25,370
                 When I say     
        "Crawfish Mac N Cheese,"

233
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,571
         how does this stack up?

234
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:29,374
   Every bite has               
the right amount of crawfish.   

235
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,643
  The sauce isn't,              
  like, too heavy,              

236
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:35,780
and all together, it's a        
beautiful palette of colors.    

237
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,715
  WOMAN: The food is delicious. 

238
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,584
   It has so much personality.  

239
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:42,120
          It really is          
     a special little place.    

240
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,256
       FIERI:                   
It is like I'm in N'awlins.     

241
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,191
       I mean,                  
it has that feeling.            

242
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,125
    Outstanding.                

243
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,527
I mean, really, dude,           
   out of bounds.               

244
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,998
        FIERI: Coming up,       
we're headed over to East L.A...

245
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,266
       I like                   
the way this is going.          

246
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,735
       ...to a funky place      
 totally off the beaten path... 

247
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,404
       This is                  
every bit fantastic.            

248
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,072
   ...where Korean and Mexican  

249
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:04,309
        are a match made        
      in "Triple D" heaven.     
Really is a nice fusion.        

250
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,853
  So, I'm here on the very busy 
        Valley Boulevard        

251
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:16,721
      in East Los Angeles.      

252
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,989
     Now, at any given time,    

253
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,991
        you can find some       
  righteous tacos in this area, 

254
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,693
  but I'm not just looking for  
           righteous,           

255
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,328
        I'm looking for,        
       like, funky fusion.      

256
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,262
            You know,           
    like Korean and Mexican,    

257
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,432
    and I found it right here   
        at Cha Cha Chili.       

258
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,003
     Spicy pork chimichanga.    

259
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,205
     Mexican and Korean food    
        brought together.       

260
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,206
         Can't go wrong.        

261
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,741
         Your kimchi quesadilla.

262
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,743
 WOMAN: At first, the idea of it
       seemed a bit weird,      

263
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:39,878
      but it's really good.     

264
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,479
          It's a great          
   kind of fusion of flavors.   

265
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:45,016
     FIERI: But confusion is    
 the story of this joint's past 

266
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:48,486
      before Chef Gavin Cha     
       grabbed it in 2009.      

267
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,021
            This got transformed
                a few times.    

268
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,223
             House, restaurant, 
             house, restaurant, 

269
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,726
         restaurant, restaurant,
           then we picked it up.

270
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,431
         But for locals,        
       it's crystal-clear.      

271
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,166
     You can't get any tacos    
    like this anywhere else.    

272
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,434
          El Jefe Taco.         

273
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,236
   WOMAN: Short rib, avocado,   

274
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,705
     the chipotle chilies --    
        it's a good mix.        

275
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,442
  What are we into?             
       We're making the marinade
             for the short rib. 

276
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,842
What's the short rib            
    gonna be on?                

277
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:12,977
              The El Jefe Taco. 

278
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,846
                 So, we have    
              the onions first. 

279
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,115
       Add a little bit of water
              so it can blend.  

280
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,383
                  Kiwis --      
             We need the enzymes

281
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,251
          so that it breaks down
             the meat a little. 

282
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:24,022
  Garlic, some green onion tips,
                dried chili.    

283
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:29,060
Drop the hammer, kid.           

284
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,862
        Now that they've blended
              for a little bit, 

285
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,263
          we're gonna start with
               the soy sauce.   

286
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,198
                   Sugar.       

287
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,001
   Okay, next up?               

288
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:37,135
                The mixture.    

289
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,135
       I like                   
the way this is going.          

290
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,739
            Apple juice, pepper,

291
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:43,074
              pineapple juice,  
              lemon-lime soda.  

292
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,943
 How much?                      
                  Half of it.   

293
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,346
             That's pretty good.

294
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,281
One of my many talents.         

295
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,616
        Okay,                   
so short ribs into this.        

296
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,218
    How long will               
the short ribs marinate?        

297
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,553
             We do it overnight,
        then we go to the grill.

298
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:57,822
Grilling outside here.          

299
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,991
I mean, although it's in        
the middle of almost a freeway. 

300
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,693
    You can't beat the mesquite.

301
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,561
      Not bad.                  
    Nice and hot.               

302
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,362
   Sear these off.              
Now, how long will these go?    

303
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,764
              20 to 40 minutes. 

304
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,900
Then we'll go inside and        
then break it down from there.  

305
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,268
                That's right.   

306
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,039
     All right,                 
what are we into now, brother?  

307
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,440
       Okay, so we're gonna make
  the masa for the El Jefe Taco.

308
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,643
We got the grilled corn.        
              Just cut it off.  

309
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,645
I like the technique.           

310
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,246
               Add some water.  

311
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,649
                        Lime.   
All right, a little salt.       

312
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,517
              Then blend this.  

313
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,652
  Masa in the bowl              

314
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,920
and then your mixture           
   with your corn.              

315
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,390
This, to make the tortillas,    
  that's different.             

316
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,525
               Add some water.  

317
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,795
Okay, now into my tortilla press
that I'll be taking home.       

318
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,797
   And that's it.               

319
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,132
                  Perfect.      

320
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,901
So, now onto the flattop.       

321
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,072
                 Short rib.     
   Nice.                        

322
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,940
                Salsa verde.    
   Okay.                        

323
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,543
             Pieces of chipotle.
 There you go.                  

324
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:52,810
                Some avocado.   

325
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,280
                We top it off   
         with the Cotija cheese.

326
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:56,414
     Here we go.                

327
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,153
        Mmm.                    

328
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,589
    Outstanding.                
The short rib is super tender.  

329
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,225
You get all the balance         
that you're looking for.        

330
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,427
Avocado works perfectly.        

331
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,763
Actually, the highlight,        
for me, is that tortilla.       

332
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:12,964
        Mmm.                    

333
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,434
Ground-up corn in there,        
I'm ripping that one off, man.  

334
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,703
   Excellent taco.              

335
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,237
          El Jefe Taco.         

336
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,174
   The spice from the chipotle  
 just makes a great combination.

337
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,577
       Handmade corn tortilla --
         it's out of this world.

338
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,512
              MAN:              
    Order up. Jalapeño Bomb.    

339
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:28,779
             MAN #2:            
  It has character and flavor,  

340
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,115
and I just like sitting out here

341
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:31,783
   watching the traffic go by.

stuffed cabbage guy?            

563
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,780

                as a kid, yeah. 

564
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,516
         Sorry, Mom, but this is
           actually much better.

565
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:20,251
    Oh!
