I walked into a fiesta.

     in Flavortown named tamale,

15
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,892
              that would be it.

              but there's also

salt, white vinegar.

the salsa verde right here.     

78
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,165
       We have                  
the boiled jalapeños,

00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:49,234

the onions, the salt,

the immersion blender.

        -Torta ranchera.        

120
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:10,515
 MAN #3: Well, there's obviously
 some very knowledgeable people 

121
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:13,051
      who prepare this food     
  because it's done very well.  

122
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,921
       FIERI: So well that      
     my Minnesota-based crew    

123
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,323
      gives it huge props.      

124
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,192
      We get off the plane      
         in Minneapolis         

125
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:21,459
     and head straight here     

126
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,128
     because it's the taste     
         of home for us.        

127
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,463
    It's just like the tacos    

128
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:25,597
  we had when we were all down  
       in Mexico together.      

129
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,732
               The al pastor,   
                off the hook,   

130
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,401
     and now we're making...    
         -The carnitas.         

131
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,269
           We're making carnitas
                for tamales,    

132
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,271
             and the hood is on 
        because this is smoking.

133
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,340
     This is hot, and you've got
           to have this cauldron

134
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:36,674
            to make this happen.

135
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,077
  We're gonna start             
with curing the meat.           

136
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,945
            And what kind of fat
                are we using?   

137
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,547
             -Lard.             
       -We're using lard.       

138
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,282
                   So now       
        we've seared it all off.

139
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,283
        Cola.                   

140
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,687
    You got to do a little cola,
                you know why?   

141
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:49,887
                   Color.       

142
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,624
      Cinnamon,                 
  oranges and salt.             

143
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,361
   We're gonna put              
the pork stomachs in there.     

144
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,363
     Boy, I hope they're not out
          of pork stomach today,

145
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,032
            when I go to Andale.

146
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:03,368
We're gonna cover it            
 with the pork skin.            

147
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,969
           -More lard.          
             -Yeah.             

148
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,571
          Yeah, this is awesome.

149
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,039
        A hot tub of pig.       
             -Okay.             

150
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:12,577
And we're gonna let it          
  cook for 6 hours.             

151
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,780
           How often do you make
             this much carnitas?

152
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,848
       -We make every day.      
     -Every day, this much?     

153
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,985
     Every day,                 
   this much, yes.              

154
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,319
The carnitas are ready.         

155
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,255
Now we're gonna pull them       
   and shred them.              

156
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:24,522
 We've got the masa.            

157
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,790
             And what is the red
                in the masa?    

158
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,859
     -Guajillo pepper sauce.    
        -The masa is hot.       

159
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,260
       It's almost cooked.      
            -Halfway.           

160
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,862
           Is that how it's made
    where you're from in Mexico?

161
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,330
    -That's the way we do it.   
         -You do it hot.        

162
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,532
        Yeah.                   

163
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,866
        I'm telling you, I learn
        something new every day.

164
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,068
      I had to come to Minnesota
               to learn about   

165
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,270
           cooking masa halfway.

166
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,805
   Wet a corn husk              
  with salty water,             

167
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:44,208
     then masa,                 
  some of the pork.             

168
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,344
   -That's a big tamale, boss.  
          -It is, yeah.         

169
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,679
              How many of these 
             do you make a week?

170
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,482
      -Maybe, like, 1,000.      
   -How many people work here?  

171
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,884
              How long are they 
                gonna steam?    

172
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:53,752
      One hour.                 

173
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,353
                    Okay.       

174
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,488
                Look at that.   

175
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,623
         This isn't my birthday.

176
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,892
             All right. I'll try
             to eat all of them.

177
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:02,894
  And do we serve anything on it
             or just as you see?

178
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,630
 No, just like that.            

179
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,165
               That's probably  
              one of the most,  

180
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,235
              if not the most,  
 flavorful tamale I've ever had.

181
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,903
        I'm savoring every bite.

182
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,906
              Most of the time, 
         the masa has no flavor.

183
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,908
           You're waiting to get
     to the center of the tamale

184
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,510
              to get the meat,  
             to get the filling.

185
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,179
Yeah, we give the flavor        
to the masa and also the meat.  

186
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,981
               I'm converted.   

187
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:26,852
           If there was a county
     in Flavortown named tamale,

188
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:30,388
          that would be it, man.
                 That is it.    

189
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,591
      WOMAN: They're moist,     
         very flavorful.        

190
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,526
   They have the best tamales   
       in the Twin Cities.      

191
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,394
  The tamales have a very good  
          consistency,          

192
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,329
      especially the masa.      

193
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:39,598
                This is where   
        the "Triple D" crew eats

194
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,466
       when they're not shooting
  "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives."

195
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:42,801
  This is how often             
    we come here.               

196
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,669
We've all filled out these cards
probably three or four times.   

197
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:45,737
    We have our punch cards.    

198
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,205
              What do you think 
             makes it so great? 

199
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:50,074
We've been to so many           
restaurants with you that,      

200
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,544
when you find the real deal,    
  you recognize it.             

201
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:55,413
   Authentic Mexican food that  
 you don't need a passport for. 

202
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,349
     This is a great place.     
      It's cheap and fast,      

203
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,750
    and it's just great food.   

204
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,419
     -This is just perfect.     
     -You love what you do.     

205
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,087
     I do, yeah.                
We have a lot of passion        

206
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,289
for what we do, yeah.           

207
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,057
 Good dude. You got to come down
            and meet these cats.

208
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,492
                  We've had     
          a lot of funky joints,

209
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:12,030
             but this right here
             [whistles] up top.

       ...it's like being       
   right there in the Yucatan.  

215
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,874
 You learn something            
new every day, baby.

217
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,185
    I'm here in Los Angeles,    
   just a few blocks from USC,  

218
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:34,785
      to check out a funky      
          little joint          

219
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,255
       that's housed here       
    in the Mercado La Paloma.   

220
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,923
        It's an economic        
      development building.     

221
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,325

00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,815
      and brought the food,     

233
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,352
     the spices, the taste,     
        the texture here.       

234

    Chef Gilberto Cetina Jr.    
       wanted to preserve.      

236
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,692
              This is the food  
            that I grew up with.

237
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:16,094
         This is what my grandma
                used to cook.   

238
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,563
        This is what my mom used
  to cook growing up in Yucatan.

239
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:19,564
   I love it, man.

    opened the joint in 2001.   

242
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,970
          This is very          
      labor-intensive food.

        -Longaniza asada.       

244
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:32,110
    So the longaniza is like    
     a chorizo sausage link.    

245
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,112
      It's full of flavor.

249
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,185
              We're gonna start

250
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,055

253
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,265
     Salt and...

00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,134
             -Cumin.            
            -Got it.            

255
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,736
Mix this all by hand.           

256
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:00,138
            And then we're gonna
          add the achiote paste.

257
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,740
  Oh, oh, oh, hey.              

258
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,875
 Not going light with that, huh?
        -About 4 ounces.

  It's kind of like a tostada,  

302

00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,720
 You learn something            
new every day, baby.            

344
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,589
              Okay.             
          -Open it up.          

345
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:07,258
     Some black beans ready.

346
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,926
              Cover the whole,  
             and spread it out. 

347
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,995
            -Love it.           
   -Now we're gonna fry them.   

348
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,397
         Double-cooked tortilla.

349
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,198
 -All right. Here we are, Chef. 
           -All right.          

350
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,667
               So we're gonna   
              make the achiote, 

351
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:18,136
                 marinate it    
         to paint our turkeys...

352
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:19,737
       -Paint our turkeys.      
 -...and put them on the grill. 

353
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,939
 -...and put them on the grill. 
           -All right.          

354
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,874
            So we're gonna start
         with some achiote paste

355
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,943
                  and then      
             fresh sour oranges.

356
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:27,545
           -I love it.          
           -Some salt.          

357
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:28,813
               Now we're gonna  
              paint the turkey. 

358
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,481
Some beautiful color            
   going in here,               

359
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,016

361
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,422
Then, we're gonna shred         
the meat off of the turkey.     

362
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,358
             -Right.            
   -Which part is the panucho?  

363
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,892

00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,574
Put them in our stove           
    and cover it.               

455
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,443
             Two hours until it 
              just falls apart. 

456
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,312
After we take them out,         
   we shred them.               

457
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,048
     How is the flavor so great,
             and there's no oil?

458
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,450
             The condensed milk.

459
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,652
         -And the soda.         
    -Okay. Let's make a taco.   

460
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,788
                   VICKIE:      
      Here's our pork over here.

461
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,457
            -Killer.            
       -Get our tortillas.      

462
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,592
         You have to spank them,
    make sure they're well done.

463
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,861
      -Bad little tortilla.     
           -Carnitas.           

464
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,930
       -A little cilantro.      
         -And red onion.        

465
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:08,199
             And then our salsa.
                There you go.   

466
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:11,602
              -Mm.              
             -Good?             

467
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,805
     -No, they're not good.     
        -They're awesome?       

468
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,539
I have some favorite            
  foods in my life,             

469
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,007
      and tacos                 
  are one of them.              

470
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,609
That's up there with some       
of the best I've ever had.      

471
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,678
The salsa, the onions,          
    the cilantro.               

472
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,814
             You have to have it
             exactly like that. 

473
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,349
              That's the taste  
                 of a taco.     

474
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:25,682
  Wow, that's good.             

475
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,151
           I absolutely love it.

476
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,886
     It reminds me of home,     
        more traditional.       

477
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,821
       -It's so delicious.      
    -It's all home-made food.   

478
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,156
             FIERI:             
      And home-made salsas.     

479
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,424
 Large pico de gallo            
       to go.                   

480
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,293
    -I love the green sauce.    
     -That's the red sauce.     

481
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,560
    FIERI: Made with roasted    
          red chilis...         

482
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,694
        Whoa.                   

483
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,430
    ...and an even hotter one   
         called bombero.        

484
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,365
       Bombero is fireman       
           in Spanish.          

485
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,100
           -It's hot.           
     -What are you enjoying?    

486
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,369
       -A bombero burrito.      
   -Say that five times fast.   

487
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,704
        Bombero burrito. Bombero
       burrito. Bombero burrito.

488
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,707
 -What are we gonna make first? 
       -The bombero sauce.      

489
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:50,775
  We're gonna start             
  with our tomato.              

490
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:51,909
                FIERI: Okay.    

491
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,511
  Red onion, water,             
    roast chilis.               

492
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,312
         -Those are hot.        
     -These are really hot.     

493
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,447
           -That's it?          
           -That's it.          

494
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,249
              And let it boil.  
        They sit there and steep

495
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,917
             for about an hour, 
              let it cool down, 

496
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,519
             and now we're going
      to make it into the salsa.

497
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,586
             -Salsa.            
             -Salsa.            

498
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,855
Yep. We're gonna put            
  the whole mixture             

499
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,724
   to the blender,              
and then we add some...         

500
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:07,992
               Little chipotle  
             with andobo sauce. 

501
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,860
       Uh-huh.                  
Black pepper, cumino.           

502
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,195
           -Or cumin.           
            -Mm-hmm.            

503
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,132
A bit of garlic salt,           
  clove of garlic,              

504
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,133
      ketchup.                  

505
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,202
  It has that sweet             
  and spicy flavor.             

506
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,937
               No, I got you.   

507
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,606
             You're gonna throw 
the throttle on that, aren't ya?

508
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:24,075
                    Wah!        

509
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,343
                   VICKIE:      
             Dump it in our pot.

510
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,611
  And how long does             
 that cook down for?            

511
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,079
          45 minutes to an hour.

512
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:29,480
While that's going on, are      
we gonna cook the chicken?      

513
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,482
  We're gonna work              
on our grilled chicken.         

514
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,217
             -Okay.             
   -Cut it into fajitas style.  

515
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,953
     -You're like a surgeon.    
    -Learned since I was 14.    

516
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,088
              Then, what are we 
              gonna put on it?  

517
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,357
  -Some of our seasoning salt.  
        -A little cumin.        

518
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,026
   Garlic powder,               
and then we'll add some vinegar.

519
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,027
   Just mix it up.              

520
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:45,029
And then, we'll put it          
    on our grill,               

521
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,498
  grill it until it             
gets that crispy brown,         

522
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,699
            at least 10 minutes.

523
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,368
       It's really spicy.       
          -Bombero man.         

524
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,636
              You're gonna need 
                the fireman.    

525
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:54,171
             -I am?             
          -Very spicy.          

526
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,641
          We'll get our tortilla
        and put it on our grill.

527
00:17:56,643 --> 00:18:00,978
              Got our tortilla, 
   chicken ready, pico de gallo,

528
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,514
              put rice on here, 
                 wrap it up.    

529
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,782
  -And where does the sauce go? 
     -I'll get to that part.    

530
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,384
      -Don't rush it, huh?      
             -Yeah.             

531
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,586
          Walk him to our sauce.

532
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,787
My mouth is watering.           

533
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,457
               Bombero sauce,   
                some cheese,    

534
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,658
                  and, Guy,     
             you're good to go. 

535
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,527
  Bombero burrito.              

536
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,428
      Careful.                  
      It's hot.                 

537
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,666
       Wow. There's a little bit
              of kick to that.  

538
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,067
             The chicken has got
               a little crunch  

539
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,001
       and a little crust on it,

540
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,870
                but the sauce   
              with the ketchup, 

541
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:27,672
      little cool pico de gallo,
      you get a little bit of...

542
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:29,306
    A little bit                
  of the freshness.             

543
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,408
                 Excellent.     

544
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,610
    It's a hot, spicy taste.    
         It's very good.        

545
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,145
  Very savory. It's got, like,  
      a nice, salty punch.      

546
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,014
       -Down-home cooking.      
    -I had a mission in life    

547
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,016
           to find the best taco
                in the world.   

548
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,284
               I've found it.   

549
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,487
    -What's your busiest day?   
           -Every day.          

550
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,822
 That's a good week.            

551
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:48,159
     FIERI: So in our search    
    for south of the border,    

552
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:51,229
   there's definitely one city  
      I don't want to miss.     

553
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:53,230
 So here I am in Santa Barbara, 
           California.          

554
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,832
    Now, there's a few things   
        you can count on        

555
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,033
   for sure when you get here.  

556
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:59,103
      That's great weather,     
      avocado trees galore      

557
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,771
     and great Mexican food.    

558
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:02,840
      The only question is,     
 how do you tell the difference 

559
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,241
     between all the Mexican    
          restaurants?          

560
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,378
     For me, it's all about

this down with some water.

          and blend it together.

     Fish tacos.                

670
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,963
We wanted to do food            
that's very authentic,          

671
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:47,297
very deep in Mexico.            

672
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,566
    ...from fried pork rinds    
       with salsa verde...      

673
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,769
           It's spicy.          
        It's really good.       

674
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:54,638
 FIERI: ...to the Mayan standard
       cochinita pibil...       

675
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,174
     The meat is just tender    
 and just goes down like water. 

676
00:22:57,176 --> 00:23:00,244
   FIERI: ...and this regional  
   specialty with pulled pork   

677
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:01,845
     and ancho pepper sauce.    

678
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,214
        -Chilorio torta.        
         -Never seen it.        

679
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,183
              I've been eating  
       Mexican food all my life.

680
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:08,518
        To make chilorio, first,
      we're gonna make carnitas.

681
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,054
            We got a Boston butt
                 right here.    

682
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,322
              We're gonna take  
                the fat out.    

683
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:13,257
FIERI: Okay. So cut it          
 into small pieces.             

684
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:14,658
                   Right.       
       Put a little bit of salt.

685
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,326
      And now we're gonna put it
         into the hot pork lard.

686
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,795
   -It builds a little crust.   
             -Right.            

687
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:19,730
              Put some Mexican  
                 bay leaves.    

688
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,731
Allspice, interesting,          
    I like that.                

689
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,667
                 And orange.    
                Here you go.    

690
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:26,470
     -Everybody in the pool.    
 -Simmer, so it's frying slowly.

691
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:27,938
        -How many hours?        
     -About a couple hours.     

692
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,406
     All right.                 
So it's all cooled down now.    

693
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,275
          We shred it?          
         -That's right.         

694
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:34,144
Mmm. I like that spice          
with the allspice in there.     

695
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,412
   We'll shred it,              
   make the salsa,              

696
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,680
      then make the torta.      
         -That's right.         

697
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:38,482
            -Got it.            
            -Anchos.            

698
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:39,749
          -Love anchos.         
           -Oh, yeah.           

699
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,751
         Oh.                    
    And pasillas.               

700
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,153
                  Pasillas.     
           We got a hot griddle.

701
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,554
                 We're gonna    
             put them in there. 

702
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,357
               It's gonna help  
             awaken the flavors.

703
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,091
And then we're gonna            
steep them in hot water?        

704
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,759
             -Right.            
-Okay. So we keep the lid on it,

705
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,428
     so it keeps                
the peppers submerged.          

706
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,030
Nice. So what are you           
doing with the seeds?           

707
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:54,565
We're just opening them up here?
             -Right.            

708
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,032
You can't make the sauce        
   with the seeds               

709
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,969
and then strain the seeds out.  
They become too bitter.         

710
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,304
         -That's right.         
       -We take all these.      

711
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:01,771
   Now we're gonna              
   grind these up.              

712
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,773
  -Yes, for the chilorio sauce. 
      -I know this routine.     

713
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,109
          Put in the red peppers
               in the blender.  

714
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,912
                I'm gonna put   
      a little bit of the water.

715
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:09,246
             -Okay.             
      -I take some oregano.     

716
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:11,181
         It's different.        
      -One of my favorite.      

717
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,983
                  Vinegar.      

718
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:16,253
                  And then      
         garlic cloves and salt.

719
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:18,188
               After we put it  
            through the blender,

720
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,456
          we're gonna strain it.

721
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,393
                     ♪♪         

722
00:24:22,395 --> 00:24:23,861
              Then we're gonna  
               put the sauce.   

723
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:25,128
             We're gonna fry it.

724
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,263
With a little bit of the lard   
that we put the pork in.        

725
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:28,398
         -That's right.         
        -This is gnarly.        

726
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,733
 That's what you got            
 to do right there.             

727
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:32,536
 You got to cook off            
a little bit of that bitterness.

728
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,304
            We put the carnitas,
              already shredded. 

729
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,539
And we're just gonna            
sit there and cook this up,     

730
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,007
          let it coat.          
             -Right.            

731
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,809
And then we're going            
 to make the torta.             
                   That's right.

732
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,077
   You can't make               
this sandwich fast enough.      

733
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,012
       So this                  
 is homemade bread.             

734
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,747
             Yeah. Refried beans
               on the bottom.   

735
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,215
                So now we put   
            the chilorio on top.

736
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,950
Refried beans almost work       
like the mayonnaise.            

737
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,685
         -That's right.         
     -Okay, a little queso.     

738
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,821
            Little queso on top,
                 jalapeños,     

739
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,823
               then tomatoes,   
                white onions,   

740
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,225
        marinated onions.       
            -Cabbage.           

741
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:56,227
   Don't be stingy              
  with the cabbage.             

742
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:57,761
                    Okay.       
                And cilantro.   

743
00:24:57,763 --> 00:25:01,498
          Here you go.          
         -Look at that.         

744
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,634
        Mmm.                    
That is out of bounds, dude.    

745
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:04,969
                 All right.     

746
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:06,837
The freshness of the bread,     
 right off the bat.             

747
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,573
Then, you get this hot,         
little bit spicy of the meat.   

748
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,108
    Then, you get               
the crunch of the onion.        

749
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:14,311
  And a little snap             
from the jalapeño. Mmm.         

750
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:16,914
This has got to be one of       
the best tortas I've ever had.  

751
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,315
           -All right.          
 -I mean, one of the best, dude.

752
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:20,383
That sandwich rocks.            

753
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:23,253
      I like Mexican pork,      
 and this is the porkiest pork. 

754
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,055
 MAN: The tenderness of the meat
       and the crunchiness      

755
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:28,592
   of the vegetables in there,  
   just like you're in Mexico.  

756
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:30,861
            Two tacos chicharron
     y speciale, rice and beans.

757
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,596
  MAN #2: The Taco Bus, there's 
  really nothing else like it.  

758
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:35,198
        This one was here       
  before food trucks were cool. 

759
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,534
  The nice thing is             
we don't move it around.        

760
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:37,734
 People can find it.            

761
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,536
             FIERI:             
     Anytime, day or night.     

762
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,605
  If you come here at 4:00 a.m.,
               you're hungry.   

763
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:43,540
              They're all part  
             of Taco Bus Nation.

764
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,942
  Wait. Wait. Wait.             
How late are they open?         

765
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:46,610
             They're open 24/7. 

766
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:47,745
              -No.              
             -Yeah.             

767
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:51,281
  For me, it's the healthy food 
        was what sold me.       

768
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,350
 FIERI: Because they're serving 
       up Mexican classics      

769
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:54,751
 with a little vegetarian spin. 

770
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:56,287
                 VALENZUELA:    
             Grilled tofu tacos.

771
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:58,822
I'm having the veggie burrito   
right now, and it's amazing.    

772
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:01,024
       My new favorite is       
  the butternut squash tostada. 

773
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:04,461
    FIERI: Yeah. He's putting   
 butternut squash on a tostada. 

774
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:06,630
VALENZUELA: It's still Mexican. 
It's not well known,            

775
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:09,700
and that's something unique     
that brings you to Mexico.      

776
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:11,368
       -This is delicious.      
          -The squash.          

777
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,302
      You wait until you try it.
              It's famous here. 

778
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:13,370
        Okay.                   

779
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,305
                First, start    
   with butternut squash, fresh.

780
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:17,107
              Just gonna cut it 
             into large pieces. 

781
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,176
 -And where is this recipe from?
            -Yucatan.           

782
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,445
So that's it, boil it with      
the seeds and everything in it? 

783
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:22,445
             -Right.            
       -Down in the water?      

784
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:23,514
         -That's right.         
           -How long?           

785
00:26:23,516 --> 00:26:25,315
        Once it boils, about two
              or three minutes. 

786
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:26,583
           It's got to be tender
              but not too much  

787
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,519
             because, otherwise,
             it gets all mushy. 

788
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:30,120
Don't want to get it mushy.     
     All right.                 

789
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:32,055
 So now it's boiled             
and cooled a little bit.        

790
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,323
   Now we're gonna              
 take the seeds out?            

791
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,925
             Right. We also got 
           to take the skin out.

792
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,393
    -We're gonna chop it up?    
             -Right.            

793
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:37,528
And what's the next step?       

794
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,730
               We're gonna put  
    a little bit of oil, onions.

795
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:42,599
        -Red bell pepper.       
  -Tomatoes, habanero peppers.  

796
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,667
    [ Whistles ]                

797
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:44,734
             I'm gonna put just 
             a little bit before

798
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:47,003
     I add the butternut squash.

799
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,672
            -Squash.            
   -Now, the butternut squash   

800
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,340
                is gonna get    
           a little softer here.

801
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,608
     We're gonna                
  just cook it down             

802
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,943
so it's a little bit            
    more tender?                
                   That's right.

803
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,011
           -We ready?           
          -We're ready.         

804
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:55,879
             So we're gonna top 
            our tostada with it.

805
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,814
Looks like he's putting         
a fruit cocktail on there.      

806
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:01,017
       Now put tomatoes, onions,
            cilantro and cheese.

807
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,087
          There you go.         
         -That's a lot.         

808
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:06,756
               You can do it.   
                There you go.   

809
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,959
It's got good texture.          
Tostada is nice and crunchy,    

810
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,496
  and the squash is             
not fall-apart soft.            

811
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:16,567
The mixture of the red bell     
pepper and the onions           

812
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:18,635
 and that little bit            
   of the habanero              

813
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,171
   was really done              
   the right way.               

814
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,373
 I'd order it again             
   in a heartbeat.              

815
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:24,308
           -All right.          
       -It's really nice.       

816
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,443
           -Thank you.          
   -Butternut squash tostada.   

817
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:27,844
    It's crispy, very light.    

818
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,114
   Great flavor you can't find  
       in a lot of places.      

819
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:31,315
              Cochinita pibil.  

820
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,782
   It's the best Mexican food   
        in West Florida.        

821
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,184
              Two steak tacos.  

822
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:36,053
Anybody that's into this kind of
   food knows about Taco Bus?   

823
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:37,321
             -Yeah.             
        -Oh, absolutely.        

824
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:40,457
  -Can I get a torta chilorio?  
    -I can go home now, dude.   

825
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:43,460
         We'll wrap up the torta
  for lunch later, for lunching.

826
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:45,195
    Do me a favor               
 and wrap up the bus            

827
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:47,330
and take it to my casa.         

828
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,867
           -All right.          
           -The bomb.           

829
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:51,935
         FIERI: Up next,

00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:53,737
    I got nothing               
 but happy on that.             

831
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:56,607

       big bad burritos...      

832
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:57,741
      Awesome.                  

833
00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:59,810
      ...then, green chili      
      as real as it gets...     

834
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,144
      I've had                  
a lot of chili verde.           

835
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,479
 This is fantastic.             

836
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,214
     ...right in the middle     
          of Missouri.          

837
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,350
   -I think it's a good thing.  
  -I think it's a great thing.  

838
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:11,822
     Usually, on "Triple D,"    

839
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:14,091
       you see me cruising      
      the convertible '67,      

840
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:16,893
     but when I find a joint    
   that's got a car this sick,  

841
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,829
    well, I just got to stop    
        and check it out.       

842
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:20,831
    And it's not just the car   
       that's unique here       

843
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,966
    at the Lone Star Taqueria   
       in Salt Lake City.       

844
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:25,635
   They're doing Mexican food   
       the real-deal way.       

845
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,170
Another chicken puerre,         
    no cilantro.                

846
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,106
        -It's delicious.        
   -Salsa, everybody is fine?   

847
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:32,042
       -Orders up, please.      
       -Casual and funky.       

848
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,310
      The car and the boots     
        really stuck out.       

849
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:35,846
 There's no other place like it.

850
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:37,314
  Lone quesadillas, solamente.  

851

   -Is it always this chaotic?  
             -Yeah.             

852
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,584
     I feel like                
I walked into a fiesta.         

853
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:42,719

857
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:49,927
    FIERI: Because this ain't   
   Susan Harry's first rodeo.   

858
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:52,196
 It's all I've done             
since I was the age of 13.      

859
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:53,530
        Taco de pescado.

         of restaurants,        

861
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:57,534
       she wanted to open       
        a Mexican place.        

862
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:58,668
         -Carne adovada.        
          -Right here.

-Appreciate it. Have a good day.
   -I mean, it's like family.   

868
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,746

      to get fresh seafood here?

875
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:19,689
        -Oh, yes. It is.        
            -Really?            

876

   -I'm having a salmon taco.

  -It's kind of like roulette.  

880
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:30,234
   You don't know what you're   
       gonna get that day.      

881
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:31,835

 we drop it in here?            

995
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:13,523
                    Yeah.       

996
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,926
              Then, we mix it.  

997
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:17,327
             Now we're gonna do 
                  the pork.     

998
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,729
                 Olive oil,     
             the chopped garlic.

999
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:21,331
                Turn it fast,   
      or you'll burn the garlic.

1000
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,066
               The whole pan,   
             you got your pork. 

1001
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:24,401
So you brown the meat.          

1002
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:26,136
         -Black pepper.         
            -Oregano.           

1003
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:28,605
                Dry oregano,    
             your lemon pepper. 

1004
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:30,941
I've never seen lemon           
  pepper in Mexico.             

1005
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:33,477
         That one is a new thing
              up here, I guess. 

1006
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:34,877
    Now, you add your cumino.   
             -Cumin.            

1007
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,212
            Put your salt on it.

1008
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:39,483
        Now, you add your onions
 to give more body to the sauce.

1009
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:40,883
             Diced green chilis.

1010
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:43,086
    Then, I got pork base...    
             -Okay.             

1011
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:45,355

                   to it.       

1012
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,223
 I like the bottom-             
 of-the-spoon move.             

1013
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,092
           Okay. And then, we're
           gonna put this sauce.

1014
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:50,427
             This is the sauce, 
               the one I make.  

1015
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:52,895
          See? Right to the end,
          you put your cilantro.

1016
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:55,866
      Stir it.                  

1017
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:57,033
      Cover it                  
 and lower the heat.            

1018
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,702
           In one hour, you have

  In 1914, a Belgian immigrant

      put up this building

      -Give me the rundown.     

1085
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,275
You start with wheat flour,     
then sea salt, baking soda.     

1086
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:20,676
         So that's gonna give it
          some of the leavening.

1087
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,745
Vegetable shortening.           

1088
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:23,480
Then some hot water.            
 Crank this baby up.            

1089
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:26,082
        So once the dough works,
              do you knead it?  

1090
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:27,217
       You got

1091
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,152
             Now, who taught you

00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:30,620
            -Nobody.

1094
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:33,289

little biscuits of friendship.

and roll these out by hand.     

1105
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,045
                  Exactly.      
                Power it up.    

1106
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,780
             And we don't do it 
        until we get your order.

1107
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:58,314
           Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
              whoa, whoa, whoa. 

1108
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,383
 You can make them ahead of time
        and just wax paper them.

1109
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,651
    Could. Don't.               

1110
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:04,587
 I want their tacos             
tasting like I want my tacos.   

1111
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:05,722
                So that's it.   

1112
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,523
             Now we can stuff it
          with whatever we want.

1113
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,058
Steak, chicken, beef.           

1114
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,793
   Now, this is what we're going
 to use to make the carne asada?

1115
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,795
 The steak, exactly.            
You take it over to the slicer, 

1116
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,196
put the spices together,        

1117
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:16,065
a little black pepper,          
      sea salt,                 

1118
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,267
     onion salt,                
   cayenne pepper,              

1119
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:19,135
    the oregano,                
    which I like.               

1120
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:20,736
            I like the seasoning
                mix on that.    

1121
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,204
     And then, we grill it?     
          -Open flame.          

1122
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,407
FIERI: Medium rare on both      
sides, so it doesn't dry out.   

1123
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,476
 You got it. And after it cools,
             then, we slice it. 

1124
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:28,078
  If you slice it right away... 
   -It'll lose all the juice.   

1125
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,612
                  Exactly.      

1126
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,013
                 That's some    
             pretty good carne. 

1127
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,481
              These get popped  
               inside of here.  

1128
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:34,216
 Right.                         
              That's a healthy  
               little portion.  

1129
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:35,551
               And that's it.   
             Bye-bye, let's fry.

1130
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,019
          -Let's do it.         
    -After it's done cooking,   

1131
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,288
   you let it drain a little bit
                 of the oil.    

1132
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,955
About 3 minutes. Should         
we see what she looks like?     

1133
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:42,025
 That takes a little something. 
         -Look at that.         

1134
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:43,760
      Lettuce.                  
We shred our own cheese.        

1135
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:46,296
            Queso. Look at that.

1136
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:47,697
       That's outstanding.      

1137
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:50,300
           Mmm. The meat has got
          great flavor, crunchy.

1138
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:52,102
                 Look at all    
             the juice in there.

1139
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:53,703
             Mmm, that's killer.

1140
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:55,905
           Do I look like I just
    took a bath in that or what?

1141
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,173
              Wow, that's good. 
               Nice job, man.   

1142
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:58,774
        -Appreciate that.       
         -Good texture.         

1143
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,110
  It's got a great taste to it. 
        -Tasted homemade.       

1144
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,179
    My mom didn't               
make them this good.            

1145
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:04,714
       That's kind of like      
      the seal of approval.     

1146
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,316
         We got to make         
       that tu-tung sound.      

1147
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:07,917
            Tu-tung.            

1148
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:10,053
     It's quick. It's easy,     
      and it's great food.      

1149
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:11,254
     It tastes really fresh.    

1150
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,455
              I want everything 
              cooked that day.  

1151
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:13,723
      This salsa is great.      

1152
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:14,857
 FIERI: Two kinds -- the red... 

1153
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:16,793
      Tastes like somebody      
    just chopped up a tomato    

1154
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,061
     and put it in a bottle.    

1155
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:20,196
    FIERI: ...and the green,    
   made with fresh jalapeños.   

1156
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:21,598
          Look at that.         
          -That's good.         

1157
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,400
          That's money.         
         -That's money.         

1158
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:24,534
              All the way down. 

1159
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:26,803
FIERI: And Brad keeps serving up
       all the favorites.       

1160
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,873
    -Three hard-shell tacos.    
     -There we go. Burrito.     

1161
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,875
The nachos supreme, really good.

1162
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:33,476
    FIERI: And when he heads    
      back to the fryer...      

1163
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,278
         -Chicken chimi.        
   -Let's make a chimichanga.   

1164
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,946
Big deep-fried burrito.         

1165
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:39,282
            -Exactly.           
       -80-20 ground beef.      

1166
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:41,284
  Add the seasonings right after
       we get the meat in there.

1167
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:43,086
             -Ancho?            
      -Ancho chili pepper.      

1168
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:45,021
         -The chipotle.         
           -Sea salt.           

1169
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,623
             -Okay.             
        -And onion salt.        

1170
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:48,157
      -Add a little water.      
   -Everybody is in the pool.   

1171
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,226
You're gonna let it sit here    
and cook for, what, 2 hours?    

1172
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:51,628
          -Right at it.         
     -So that's cooked down.    

1173
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,564
  I mean, that is,              
  like, beef sauce.             

1174
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:55,765
[ Whistles ] And this is        
  the method, huh?              

1175
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:58,301
        The spices help separate
         that oil from the meat.

1176
00:38:58,303 --> 00:38:59,702
   That's precise.              

1177
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:02,438
So let these cool down,         
and then what goes down?        

1178
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,107
  Pinto beans, we sort every one
     by hand, looking for rocks.

1179
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,043
       The thing I love is that,
      when you were hanging down

1180
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,244
          at the Mexican market,

1181
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:10,780
             you got some really
         particular information,

1182
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:12,649
  something like, sorting beans,
          which is quite an art,

1183
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:13,983
              very seldom done. 

1184
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:15,051
    And then you cook the beans,

1185
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,252
                mix the beans   
           into the ground beef.

1186
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:17,587
     Just a few.                
   Flour tortilla.              

1187
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,322
             Put a little steam 
          on it so it's pliable.

1188
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:21,257
Exactly, make it pliable,       
so you can fold it up.          

1189
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:22,925
      -So it doesn't crack.     
    -A little refried beans,    

1190
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,260
good amount of meat,            
       onions.                  

1191
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:25,395
      You know                  
 how I like cheese.             

1192
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:26,929
            -Cheesy.            
           -Like that.          

1193
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,331
             Are we gonna wedge 
            that in there again?

1194
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,133
     Then over to the fryer.    
          -You got it.          

1195
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:31,835
          -There we go.         
     -Plate it really quick.    

1196
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:34,003
  Lettuce on there.             
Cheese. Couple olives.          

1197
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:36,139
          So let's take a gander
              at that bad boy.  

1198
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:38,875
               Crispy outside.  
   Creamy, cheesy on the inside.

1199
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,810
                    Mmm.        

1200
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:43,079
            That's awesome, man.
      You know my favorite part?

1201
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:46,282
             Little bit of onion
              you put in there. 

1202
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,550
       Well done, brother.      
          -Thanks, man.         

1203
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,686
                Look at that.   

1204
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:50,953
              MAN:              
    It's got homemade flavors   

1205
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,356
       you don't find just      
         anywhere else.         

1206
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:54,890
All the meat and cheese,        
   it's just good.              

1207
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,426
      FIERI: And Brad just      
        keeps on frying.        

1208
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:59,095
Chicken enchilada, it definitely
   tastes fresh and homemade.   

1209
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:01,231
 So we're gonna make            
the shredded chicken.           

1210
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:02,898
                Chicken down,   
       little sea salt in there.

1211
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,434
 Water, just enough             
    to cover it.                

1212
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:05,702
    Simmer it for               
 an hour and a half,            

1213
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:07,570
 let it break down.             

1214
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,105
  It almost starts              
  to shred for you.             

1215
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:10,507
How much does that make for you 
     for a day?                 

1216
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:11,507
          -Half a day.          
            -Really?            

1217
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,508
      And then,                 
 you'll do it again.            

1218
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,110
Yeah. Just keep going.          
     Keep going.                

1219
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:15,311
         So the chicken         
        gets shredded up.       

1220
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:16,780
             We just want to add
        a little pungent flavor.

1221
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:19,248
This mixture of cumin,          
cayenne and paprika.            

1222
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,984
        Then you roll it around.

1223
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,320
     That's what                
 I'm talking about.             

1224
00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:26,656
   That's killer.               
That's some really nice flavor. 

1225
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:28,725
              We need the sauce 
             for the enchiladas.

1226
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:30,193
                 Start with     
              the tomato sauce. 

1227
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:31,460
             We've got the chili
               powder, ancho.   

1228
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,663
Well, the ancho chili           
farmers here in Nebraska are    

1229
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:35,732
  doing really well             
 with all your use.             

1230
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,467
       Then, we roll in...      
           -Chipotle.           

1231
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:39,135
                 Onion salt.    
                The sea salt.   

1232
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:40,669
              A little garlic.  
               A little agua.   

1233
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:41,804
You let that warm up.           

1234
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,205
This is one of the things       
 about Mexican food             

1235
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,808
people don't know is            
a lot of it is preparation.     

1236
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,210
   It's the low and slow idea.  
       -Let that warm up.       

1237
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:49,012
    We take some canola oil.    
         -Sauce is hot.         

1238
00:40:49,014 --> 00:40:50,413
      Dip, fry.                 
      Fry. Out.                 

1239
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:51,881
               Put it in this   
              enchilada sauce.  

1240
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:53,950
              Heat the tortilla 
     with that salsa in the oil.

1241
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,218
               It really makes  
         that enchilada sauce...

1242
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,819
    -Just soak right into it.   
     -...soak right into it.    

1243
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,154
              And that tortilla 
              holds the sauce.  

1244
00:40:58,156 --> 00:40:59,488
        Dip.                    
      Fry, out.                 

1245
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,957
 I like the concept.            

1246
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,758
Cook that right into it.        

1247
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,761
    You look like               
Edward Scissorhands with those. 

1248
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,830
  -We're doing the enchiladas.  
     -Look at that chicken.     

1249
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,165
            Little bit of cheese
                inside also.    

1250
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:12,368
 Then, it has to go             
through the steamer.            

1251
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,037
      I think we're ready.      
             -Nice.             

1252
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,039
  Roll it up here.              
Top it with some more cheese.   

1253
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,774
                    Okay.       
                Look at that.   

1254
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:19,308
    Now, I always               
dress it in lettuce,            

1255
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:23,245
couple of my homemade           
flour tortilla chips.           

1256
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,514
                    Mmm.        

1257
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:26,115
             Good, man. I got to
       tell you something, dude.

1258
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:29,986
               That tortilla,   
           fantastic flavor, mm.

1259
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,055
    That is really good, man.   
           -Thank you.          

1260
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:33,723
  The chicken is really juicy.  

1261
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:35,458
        The melted cheese       
      makes it really good.     

1262
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,261
      -The California Taco?     
  -It's fast, easy and unique.  

1263
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:39,729
         -How we doing?         
     -Congratulations, man.     

1264
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:41,197
             Got a great joint. 

1265
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,067
  Was that a road trip or what? 
        But don't worry.        

1266
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:46,870
   There's plenty more joints   
  all over this great country.  

1267
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:49,338
     I'll be looking for you    
    next time on "Triple D."    

1268
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,541
           Here, I got something
                for you, man.   

1269
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:54,344
     Seriously?                 
You carved this by hand?        

1270
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:56,212
All out of a watermelon?        

1271
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:58,281
      -A watermelon, yeah.      
         -You're crazy.         

1272
00:41:58,283 --> 00:41:59,516
You're like a surgeon.
