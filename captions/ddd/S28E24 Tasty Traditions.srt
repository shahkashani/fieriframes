And we're gonna add citric acid.

115
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,839
              Let it cook down. 

116
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,041
       And last but not least...

117
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,376
  We're gonna make              
  the meat filling.             

118
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:06,511

      grinding the mat in-house.

We're gonna add our water,      
in-house ground bread crumbs,   

120
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,715
   garlic powder,

                  The rice      
             is already cooked. 

123
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,988
 Sometimes when you cook cabbage
    leaves and you use raw rice,

124
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,057
 you have to add a liquid to it,
              which it absorbs.

                for some egg.   

128
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:23,795
To keep it all together.        

129
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:24,930
                    Stop.       
               Wait a second.   

130
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,131

               not catch that?

                Back that up.   

133
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,468

                for some egg.

 "A little egg for some binder."

135
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,409
            So, you're gonna mix
              this all together 

136
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:38,743

 add a little corn starch to it,

444
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,403
                tightens up,    
               let it cool...   
     Yeah.                      

445
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,138
      ...and then we'll use that
              for the filling.  
 Yes.                           

446
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,807
        So the dough is proofed,
               portioned out.   

447
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,010
          I got to introduce you
      to the world of a sheeter.

448
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:14,145
 We like everything             
 old-fashioned here.

            they only order one.

452
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,018
And then fold it into           
  a triangle shape.             

453
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,087

00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,489
             Oh, so you can tell
               what they are.   

455
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:26,023
Yeah.                           
      'Cause it would be awkward

456
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,559

  "I'll one of the "Asado" ones,

               that's 'Asado.'

Yes, we're putting egg

461
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,036

             Pushing down on it 
               the whole time,  

556
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,095
                until it cuts   
            all the way through?

557
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,164
         Yes.                   
                  So, now,      
         you peel all that away.

558
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,732
        Yes.                    

559
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:01,973
             There has got to be
       an easier way to do this.

560
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,375
We're going to boil them        
in the chicken stock.           

561
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:05,843
              So, a very simple 
               chicken stock.   

562
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,844
        Yes.                    
Add mushrooms, tomatoes...      

563
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,313
            A little fresh dill.

564
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,716
And then, when it starts        
boiling, we add our pelmeni.    

565
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:14,518
         So, 15 of the dumplings
                 per order?     

566
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,586
        Yes.                    

567
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:16,587
           So how long does that
                take to cook?   

568
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,789
About 5 to 10 minutes.          

569
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:22,126
 We add some pepper.            
It adds more heat to it.        

570
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:25,996
Then we add the sour cream      
on top and some more dill.      

571
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,598
       Bet you those aren't hot.
