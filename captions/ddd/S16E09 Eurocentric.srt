Hey Meatball in Toronto, Canada,

       is using meatballs

233
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,326

        chicken that we have...

  in this, as well.             

238
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,602
       You got to use dark meat.

239
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,870
100% organic, free-range.       

240
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,472
      A little                  
 granulated garlic.             

241

    fresh thyme.

    fresh pepper.               

243

We're gonna bring this          
   to a slow stir.              

244
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,753
And then we're gonna add        
 our mellow yellow.

          what chicken that is. 

248
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,359
              That's got to be  
           a red-headed chicken.

249
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:58,029
So, I'm gonna turn up the speed 
 just a little bit.             

250

We're just gonna drizzle        
     this cream.

252
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,104
And then we're just gonna add   
a little bit of breadcrumbs.    

253
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,438
        There's so much moisture
                  in there      

254
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,040
      that this will work itself
                  together.     

255
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:12,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so it soaks up
and gets that nice texture.     

256
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:15,747
Then just slowly incorporate    
those, and that's it.
