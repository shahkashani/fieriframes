1
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:03,302
         I'm Guy Fieri,
      and we're rolling out

2
00:00:03,304 --> 00:00:06,038
 looking for America's greatest
  diners, drive-ins, and dives.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,839
          This trip...

4
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:07,973
        Hey.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,608
  ...it's a Thanksgiving feast.

6
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,010
             Tastes like holiday
             right off the bat.

7
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:13,579
    Where the bird is flying
        front and center.

8
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:17,149
That's like someone shot off all
 the fireworks at the same time.

9
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:18,784
        Of course, we got
        the fully loaded

10
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:19,952
      traditional dinner...

11
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:22,121
 Get the hand cart.
I'm ready to get to my car.

12
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:23,889
          ...alongside
      some real ringers...

13
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:25,858
            Shut the front door.

14
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,693
      ...like turkey pizza
          in Detroit...

15
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:28,594
                Look at that!

16
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:30,429
        ...a turkey-twin
        in Albuquerque...

17
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,598
    People like to have a turkey
             to look that good.

18
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,400
  ...turkey tots in Milwaukee.

19
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:36,101
This is crunch-a-tastical.

20
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:39,171
        And in Syracuse,
    one funkalicious waffle.

21
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:42,441
                That is just,
         in so many ways, weird.

22
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:43,642
     Whether it's smoked...

23
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,377
              Teach me the rub,
                oh, wise one.

24
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,079
        ...sandwiched...
  Rocks the house.

25
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:48,247
        ...or stuffed...

26
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:50,149
                 Holy moly.

27
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:52,985
    ...get ready to gobble up
       this holiday hero.

28
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:55,487
          Dude, that has changed
    Thanksgiving for me forever.

29
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:59,158
     That's all right here,
    right now, on "Triple D."

30
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,635
     When I think of Boston,

31
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:10,969
    I think of the Tea Party.

32
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:12,805
 I think of the Sox, of course,

33
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:15,541
         and now a place
    called Mike's City Diner.

34
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:16,975
          Now, it's not
       because the owner's

35
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,977
       an immigrant living
       the American dream

36
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,979
 or because President Clinton's
           eaten here.

37
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:22,448
     It's because of the way

38
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,551
      they're cranking out
  an American favorite: turkey.

39
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:26,752
             Here you go, folks.

40
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,020
 All right, Jay.
         Thank you, Jay.

41
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:29,088
       Turkey's fantastic.

42
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,122
    The food is just amazing.

43
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:31,590
     Did you see this plate?

44
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,392
       That, it should be
      almost semi-illegal.

45
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:35,094
I remember
 the first time I came in here.

46
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:37,162
     I said, "Is that real,
       or is that a prop?"

47
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,764
Oh, it's real all right.

48
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,532
 One of four home cooked turkeys

49
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:43,802
        they're doing up
 and serving up every day here.

50
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:45,204
    The all-American meal...

51
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:46,138
  Nice to meet you.

52
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,406
          ...from a guy
        who's telling you

53
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:48,774
           he's living
     the all-American dream.

54
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,143
  How old were you
when you came to the states?

55
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:52,811
                     8.
                8 years old.

56
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:53,846
    8 years old.

57
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:55,314
                  Lebanon.

58
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:58,383
 Jay Hajj fell into the food biz
  as a dishwasher in his teens

59
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,219
     then worked his way up.
                 It's excellent.

60
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:03,522
  He bought this place 12 years
  ago, left the original name,

61
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,691
      but got right to work
       on his own menu...

62
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:06,892
                 Can I have
              some more fries?

63
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:09,161
      ...filled with fresh,
    homemade local favorites.

64
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:10,562
     We got some
good turkey dinner today.

65
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:13,232
    When he tried his hand at
 turkey, it was an instant hit.

66
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,666
             It kind of happened
                by accident,

67
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,236
      when I had no place to put
 the turkeys but on the steamer,

68
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:18,604
          on top of the steamer.

69
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:21,673
             And because it was
  an open kitchen, just it grew.

70
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,242
     It just got out of control.

71
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:24,443
    I was like, "Oh, my God.

72
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:26,578
      He's got real turkeys
     up there on the bone."

73
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,214
And on the plate
 and in huge sandwiches --

74
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:33,118
 turkey salad, turkey meat loaf,
       turkey everything.

75
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,853
   All made fresh every day...

76
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:36,021
Here you go.
    Grab them now.

77
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:36,922
          ...Jay's way.

78
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:38,090
         So,
someone made that for you?

79
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:39,791
                    Yeah.

80
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,994
      That's...
Dude, that's snazzy.

81
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,061
Where'd you get the idea?

82
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,630
       I mean,
I've done the beer-can chicken.

83
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,431
             Years ago, I found
    the stand for the chicken --

84
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,866
                  exactly,
           the beer-can chicken.

85
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:51,103
    And I realized that it cooks
     the chicken a little better

86
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:53,472
            because it's cooking
    from the inside and outside.

87
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:55,340
                You twist the...
I like this little maneuver.

88
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,341
       ...wings around the back.

89
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,676
   Put your wings
  behind your back.

90
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:58,610
                There we go.

91
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,078
    And we're not
 gonna season this?

92
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,914
                  No seasoning.
No seasoning on the skin?

93
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,415
                   Unless
       you want to eat the skin,

94
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:09,021
    I found that it doesn't give
  any extra flavors to the meat.

95
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,756
             But if you say so,
          I will agree with you.

96
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:14,793
     No need -- Jay's gonna
 be all over the seasoning thing

97
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:15,928
    with his homemade gravy.

98
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,529
                 All right,
      now, this is onion powder,

99
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,198
       garlic, and white pepper.

100
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,599
          That is for the stock.

101
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:21,867
 A little bay leaf?

102
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:22,734
                    Yep.

103
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,536
Turkish or Californian?

104
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,471
             That's Californian.
   Californian.

105
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:27,839
       So we're just gonna
     make a standard rouge?

106
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,241
    There we go.

107
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:30,909
                Come to papa.

108
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:34,012
You whisk that so you don't make
         yourself any dumplings.

109
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,280
    That's right.

110
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:41,587
              Oh, that's good.

111
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:43,288
     That's got real big flavor.

112
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,723
     The stuffing will, too.

113
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,892
              Celery, carrots.
             Just dump them in.

114
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,026
 Dump them right in.

115
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,361
               You don't have
      to sauté them or anything?

116
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:51,964
   No. No. No, no.
That's for fancy places.

117
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,532
                    White onion?
   White onion.

118
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,100
   Spanish onion.
        Yep.

119
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:58,203
            I didn't talk to it.
  How'd you know it was Spanish?

120
00:03:58,205 --> 00:03:59,171
   Now the turkey.

121
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:01,240
    Little chunks
between the stuffing.

122
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,642
            White pepper, cumin,
               seasoned salt,

123
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,677
      and the poultry seasoning.

124
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,579
                     Whisk.
   Whisk a little bit.

125
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:11,083
And now we let it simmer
for about 5, 10 minutes.

126
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,718
                We don't want
      to break the veggies down.

127
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,619
    That's right.

128
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,220
Put it right in here.
                         Wow.

129
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:18,223
      And now,
I'm gonna smash-a-matic.

130
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,626
        Now we got to bake this.
     It's not done. There we go.

131
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:23,095
 And there are potatoes to mash
     and squash to whip up.

132
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:25,731
      Whipping it where the whip
      keeps it a little stringy.

133
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,499
                 You want it
              a little stringy.

134
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,901
Everything you do has got
a little magic behind it.

135
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,036
      But the real magic...

136
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,170
                 Here we go.

137
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,206
           ...is when
     it's all on one plate.

138
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:39,311
         Wow. The turkey
     is super-money-tender.

139
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:42,281
   The gravy, which is money.

140
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:45,951
  Stuffing, you can still taste
 the texture of the vegetables,

141
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,954
        but it's creamy.

142
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,188
       That's really good.

143
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,990
         Have you eaten
     the Thanksgiving-a-thon

144
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:52,924
       here before, or...?

145
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,793
Thanksgiving in July.

146
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:58,030
             Yeah, Thanksgiving
       in September or February.

147
00:04:58,032 --> 00:04:59,097
                    About
           any time you want it.

148
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,332
 Well, that's one of
  the cool things.

149
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:02,067
   You can get it
 any time you want.

150
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,303
 And if Thanksgiving on a plate
       isn't your thing...

151
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:06,338
    Those are our
pilgrim sandwiches, you guys.

152
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,806
That's my
   Thanksgiving dinner.

153
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,341
    That's right.
 It is Thanksgiving.

154
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:10,876
      Thank you very much.
  All in a roll.

155
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:12,978
              We're gonna make
             a pilgrim sandwich.

156
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,313
Okay, so cranberries,

157
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:15,514
             Put stuffing in it.

158
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,215
That's a nice giddy-up.

159
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:20,152
    Usually, it's all white meat
 unless the customer asks for...

160
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:22,654
So you pretty much make and do
and give whatever they want.

161
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:23,889
                 They want.

162
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,824
   Holy enchilada!
How much you gonna give them?

163
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,793
You should call that sandwich
  "The Goodnight."

164
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,061
  How many of these
   you sell a day?

165
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:30,228
          About 45, I would say.

166
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,798
    45 a day?
                   45, 50. Yeah.

167
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,301
No wonder you go through
700,000 turkeys a year.

168
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:39,237
Now, do you eat this with --
Is there, like, a contraption?

169
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,672
                    Well,
       when there's gravy in it,

170
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,342
             it's best to eat it
          with a fork and knife.

171
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:47,379
I got the gravy, the stuffing.

172
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,980
   That's awesome.
                        Thanks.

173
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,949
That stands up there,
the best turkey sandwiches

174
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:51,383
   I've ever had.

175
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:52,784
                    w.

176
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,920
Did you hear a piggy
 noise when you bit into it?

177
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:56,822
       Say "Eat them up!"

178
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,724
Eat them up.

179
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:00,859
I like it all mixed up,
just like Thanksgiving.

180
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:01,893
      Put it all together.

181
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,128
Is this for real?

182
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,996
    Well, let me get another guy
             to help me eat it.

183
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:07,232
 It's like that with everything
       on the menu here --

184
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,401
          huge portions
     of real deal cooking...

185
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:10,635
  Eggs Benedict...
               Yes.

186
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,204
...with a huge chunk
       of ham.

187
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,872
  ...that has folks lining up.

188
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,140
Do you eat it all?

189
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:18,543
             I make a good dent.

190
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,145
        Yeah.
There's no gut down there.

191
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,447
          Dynamic Duo,
   and I get eggs and sausage.

192
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,849
This is called
    the Dynamic Duo?

193
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:24,983
             Uh-huh.

194
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,618
They usually order them
before I sit down, so...

195
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,587
          Oh, you're that loyal?
  Yeah.

196
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:29,755
              Gretchen. Amanda.

197
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:30,922
For Jay...

198
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,457
    And how's your breakfast
          this morning?

199
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,960
...It's all about owning
 a place people want to come to.

200
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,261
I'm very proud of that.

201
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,896
      ...and locals want to
      keep coming back to.

202
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,731
 Everything's good?
                   Very good.

203
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,268
     And a big part of that
 is basic American home-cooking.

204
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,472
 Like those four turkeys a day,
 Thanksgiving anytime you want.

205
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,808
               Really, I mean,
              that's a serving.

206
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,609
 Get another plate.

207
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:51,676
See, this is what I love.

208
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,011
This is the best thing
     about this.

209
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,780
    Dude, you are
 the American dream.

210
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:56,081
                    I am.

211
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,550
          I feel sometime, like,
    it's like winning a lottery.

212
00:06:58,552 --> 00:06:59,718
       It is!

213
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,921
 Get the hand cart.
I'm ready to get to my car.

214
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,389
     In Sarasota, Florida...

215
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:05,190
      Learn me.

216
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:05,991
       ...it's a chicken.

217
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:06,858
                    Rawr!

218
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,793
         ...it's a duck.

219
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:08,593
                    Whoa!

220
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,394
            It's a...

221
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:10,328
                 Turducken.

222
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,663
          ...Turducken.

223
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,765
This is kind of like culinary
Disneyland for a dude like me.

224
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,305
      When you're thinking
          about turkey,

225
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,340
  you're probably not thinking
      of a joint like this.

226
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,075
      The Alpine Steakhouse
      in Sarasota, Florida

227
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:26,878
   is more of a like a sirloin
   and sausage kind of place.

228
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,114
      But wait till you see
 what they're doing with turkey.

229
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,283
    It's gonna blow you away.

230
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,984
           I love it.
     All different flavors.

231
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,252
          You can't get
        anything better.

232
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,588
     It's like Thanksgiving,
       just, all the time.

233
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,989
             No. Seriously, man.

234
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,792
            They take a chicken,
        they shove it in a duck,

235
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,360
         and they shove the duck
             inside the turkey.

236
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,196
       And then they put a bunch
    of stuffing and stuff on it.

237
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:45,931
It's absolutely fabulous.

238
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,365
It's called a turducken.

239
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:50,135
   Just one of the hand-made,
      homemade specialties

240
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,404
    transplanted New Yorker,
          Mark Rebhan,

241
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,606
       and his son, Matt,
       are cranking out...

242
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:55,674
Need some fries down.

243
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,375
      ...at the restaurant
        and butcher shop

244
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:00,145
   first opened by Mark's dad
          32 years ago.

245
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,548
My dad basically came to Florida
                 to retire.

246
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,749
            And that didn't last
                  too long.

247
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,485
  Yeah, looks like
he really did a good job of it.

248
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,386
                And went back
               into business.

249
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:11,122
         And I came down in '75,
               and here I am.

250
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,791
       About 12 years ago,

251
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:15,594
    Mark says he heard about
  something called a turducken.

252
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,262
Your dad comes home one day
      and says,

253
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:21,032
"Guess what? You're gonna
start boning chickens,

254
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,934
 ducks and turkeys,
making all the stuffing,

255
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,436
and shoving it together,
and then sewing it up

256
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:25,470
  like a football."

257
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:26,638
   What'd you say?

258
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,206
              Well, basically,
       he put one on the counter

259
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,508
               and he started
             doing one himself.

260
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,675
             And we just did it
                side-by-side.

261
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,010
    Did you guys
  learn it together?
                         Yeah.

262
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,179
    Let me learn.
      Learn me.

263
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,714
        Well, basically, I mean,

264
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:38,450
             you have a chicken,
           a duck, and a turkey.

265
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:40,118
         So what I'm gonna do...
    Show me.

266
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,319
                Is I'm gonna
              take this chicken

267
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,521
                 and cut it
            right down the back.

268
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,022
                 I call this
           the scissor cut here.

269
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,824
               You want to get
         your knife tip in here.

270
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,692
         This is the oyster meat
               of the chicken.

271
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:48,693
                 Best part.

272
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,028
 All right. Now, the duck.
                    Same way.

273
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,496
   I like this.
                   All right.

274
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:54,332
This is kind of like culinary
Disneyland for a dude like me.

275
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,834
                   All right.
  Big turkey.

276
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:59,237
         If I'm down far enough,
   this is gonna pull right out.

277
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,541
         Oh.

278
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,975
                 Stock pot.

279
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:07,512
That was money, dude.
                         Yeah.

280
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:08,680
Okay. Can I try this one?

281
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,216
              Sure. Absolutely.
                Be my guest.

282
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,951
                I feel a good
       finger cutting coming in.

283
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:15,654
   And you're just gonna kind of
         go down, pull the meat.

284
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,856
    There it is.

285
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:20,225
    Good job.
                     Rawr!

286
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,960
We're gonna take the duck
  and the chicken,

287
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,329
and I'm gonna hit it
with a little Cajun seasoning.

288
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,665
Throw the duck down.

289
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,666
Same with the chicken.

290
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,034
             The chicken goes on
                 a little --

291
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:31,403
                   This is
             the super-hot side.

292
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,270
             A little less hot.

293
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,371
    Right. Right.

294
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,773
Now what I'm gonna do
 is put some of them

295
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,075
blackening seasonings
      on there.

296
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,678
              Whoa!

297
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,446
I like how you let me
jump in on this part.

298
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,615
             Hey. You can cough.

299
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,984
Now, to start
 piecing this bad boy together.

300
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,252
          Virgin olive oil here.

301
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,620
          Get it into the seams,

302
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:50,722
      the pockets where you took
            the thigh bones out.

303
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,190
             A little blackening
                on this guy.

304
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,593
          Then take some of this
        cornbread stuffing here.

305
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,595
     Now you're gonna go to your
          spinach stuffing here,

306
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,496
            and you're gonna put
         some andouille sausage.

307
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,198
And you guys make
the andouille sausage, also?

308
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,299
              Here on premises.

309
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,901
                    Some
       roasted red bell peppers.

310
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,536
Ah, that looks good.

311
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:07,372
 Now you're gonna take your duck
             inside this turkey.

312
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,107
Let me ask you this, boss.

313
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,376
Why isn't the chicken down?
    He's bigger.

314
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:15,213
              Well, turducken.

315
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,015
             That's the turkey,
              then the duck...

316
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,416
Give me the knife.
            ...then the chicken.

317
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,918
              You're not doing
                as much now.

318
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,252
You're just kind of hiding
  it in there now.

319
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,954
           Yeah. Now we're gonna
             go to the chicken.

320
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,322
   I bet you have
  a lot of friends

321
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,857
  come Thanksgiving
 and Christmas time.

322
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,726
      You're just gonna take it,

323
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:31,262
    and you're gonna bring it up
          and turn it like this.

324
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:34,032
    Sometimes, it's best to have
      a friend help you hold it.

325
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,201
     Let me see
if I can find somebody.

326
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:40,205
    When is your
spring clothing line coming out?

327
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,307
'Cause you're really
  doing a MAC job.

328
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,509
Dude, you make that look
      so easy.

329
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,011
That might be one of
  the best-looking

330
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:48,179
Dokood itemske that look
    I've ever...

331
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,447
I mean, it's just beautiful.

332
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,416
    And you just want to kind of
             set it up in here.

333
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:55,286
    Now, how long
does super bird take?

334
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,956
            This super bird here
             is gonna take about

335
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,058
               12 to 13 hours
               at 200 degrees.

336
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,292
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
      How many?

337
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,662
               12 to 13 hours.

338
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:04,696
        Okay.
  So that goes in.

339
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:06,665
           Slide it on in there.

340
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,167
  So you just close
  that oven and...

341
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,840
                  It's hot.

342
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,643
                One, two, three.
  One, two, three.

343
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:22,814
     All right.

344
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:23,882
   I feel better.

345
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,650
                   You do?

346
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:28,319
  I'm gonna cut it
right down the middle.

347
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:31,823
      The steam coming off that.
      Aw, you should smell that!

348
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,958
                 Holy moly.

349
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,827
How's that look for you?

350
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:43,034
                     Ah, man.
 It's a good combination.

351
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,235
         Definitely the richness
                of the duck.

352
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,705
                And the fat.

353
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:50,141
                  And then,

354
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,144
         you know what I pick up
      in there is the andouille.

355
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,483
               And the chicken
      has such a lighter texture

356
00:11:58,485 --> 00:11:59,350
              than the turkey.

357
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,318
        Yeah.

358
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,756
           That is a flavor-fest
                right there.

359
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:05,924
                    Mmm.

360
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:09,127
Guy, you haven't even had
  gravy on it yet.

361
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,662
        Why would you cover that
               with anything?

362
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:12,097
                 Seriously.

363
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,165
             That's like someone
      shot off all the fireworks

364
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,067
              at the same time.

365
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,068
            So good.

366
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,037
     It's very,
very tender and moist.

367
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,538
Seems Mark and Matt

368
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,308
      just have a way with
 stuffing things full of flavor.

369
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,976
Look at this thing.
                  There you go.

370
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,445
   First course or main meal.

371
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:31,316
  Set these guys loose, and you
   really are talking turkey.

372
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:33,084
        That's really good, man.
  Isn't that good?

373
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,086
                  This has
             fulfilled a dream.

374
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,554
        Good.

375
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,556
            Coming up
  in Albuquerque, New Mexico...

376
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:39,824
                Wait for it!

377
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,393
         ...we're baking
 a whole different kind of bird.

378
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,728
              That's beautiful.

379
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,463
  And in Syracuse, New York...

380
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:46,765
                   Welcome
               to flavor town.

381
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:50,268
      ...or waffle town for
the craziest turkey dinner ever.

382
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,970
                Oh, my gosh!
               That is killer!

383
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:00,578
   On the road to flavor town.

384
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,646
     I say it all the time,

385
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,548
 "If it's funky, I'll find it."

386
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,717
      I'm here in Syracuse,
 New York right by the campus --

387
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,118
   This is called S.U. Hill --

388
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,853
    To check out out a joint
          that's funky.

389
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,321
      "How funky," you ask?

390
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:13,258
            So funky,
   it's called Funk-n-Waffles.

391
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,901
       And this is, like,
    adult version of waffles.

392
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:24,836
         Falafel Waffle.
    There's nothing like it.

393
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,310
Who runs around with
a bunch of waffle irons?

394
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,411
These guys.

395
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:36,581
         Syracuse grads,
    Kyle Corea and Adam Gold.

396
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,249
We threw these crazy
    house parties

397
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,250
when we were in college.

398
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:40,752
  I'd be deejaying
   with my buddy.

399
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:41,786
And my business partner,
        Kyle,

400
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:42,921
would be slinging waffles
     at the bar.

401
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,355
 You got your beer.
You got your waffles.

402
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:45,623
                       Really?
   Just handing them out.

403
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,925
And in 2007,

404
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,661
       they made it legit
     and kept it underground

405
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,096
   when they opened this joint
        in the basement.

406
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,334
               Savory waffles
           and breakfast waffles

407
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,170
              and lunch waffles
  and fried chicken and waffles.

408
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,306
      And for the ultimate
          comfort food,

409
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,707
      the bird is the word.

410
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:06,277
  Jive Turkey -- a Thanksgiving
   dinner on top of a waffle.

411
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,613
All right, we're gonna
make the Jive Turkey.

412
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,148
 And that starts out
with our stuffing batter,

413
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,483
some cubed up bread, celery.

414
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:13,651
     A little caramelized onion.

415
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:17,455
I got our eggs and rosemary.
    Kosher salt.

416
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,691
A little bit of chicken broth.
Fresh ground pepper.

417
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:20,825
Spin this thing around.

418
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,160
             So this is gonna go
             in a waffle maker?

419
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,528
    That's right.
This guy's ready to go.

420
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,363
                Load that up.

421
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,998
    veer seen this before.
    That's right.
ThAll right.eady to go.

422
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,201
                That is just,
         in so many ways, weird.

423
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,269
 Weird can be cool.

424
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,503
    And now that
 the waffle's down,

425
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,272
we're gonna start preparing
  everything else.

426
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,007
We got some turkey right here.
                         Got it.

427
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,075
         This is probably one of

428
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,743
            the weirdest waffles
               I've ever seen.

429
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,245
              But I am going to
                 steal this.

430
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,580
     All righty.
This guy's ready to go.

431
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,249
          Let's just trim him up
                a little bit.

432
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:45,550
             Look at this thing!

433
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:47,452
                     Ah.

434
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,020
Let's throw some of this turkey
      on there.

435
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,455
  Let's get some of
these mashed potatoes.

436
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,724
             Mouth is firing up.

437
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:53,925
      Oh, yeah.

438
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,594
Then let's get a little bit
   of gravy on it.

439
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,329
     We're gonna
throw some cranberry sauce.

440
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,998
            This might be one of
             the funkiest things

441
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,133
              we've ever tried.

442
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:04,669
                    Mmm!

443
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,371
            Shut the front door!

444
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,873
                Oh, my gosh!
               That is killer!

445
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,509
             This is righteous.

446
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:15,079
  The stuffing, it's the crunch,
                the texture.

447
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,514
      Mashed potatoes are legit.

448
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,249
     That is funking ridiculous.

449
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,152
          Dude, that has changed
    Thanksgiving for me forever.

450
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,553
               I'm coming here
              for Thanksgiving.

451
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,855
                 You're in.
         Welcome to flavor town.

452
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:25,356
   Appreciate it.

453
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,660
It is probably

454
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,628
       the most ridiculous
  funking waffle I've ever had.

455
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,730
 Out of this world.
                   Delicious.
             You can't go wrong.

456
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,433
       This may be, like,
   the capital of flavor town.

457
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,677
   So, it's Thanksgiving time.

458
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,345
             Now, on
 "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,"

459
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,180
    I have traveled all over
       this great country

460
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,548
   meeting all types of folks

461
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,684
    celebrating this holiday
         their own way.

462
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:55,119
          So here I am
   in Albuquerque, New Mexico

463
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,721
   where a father-and-son team

464
00:15:56,723 --> 00:16:00,591
 have been baking up New Mexican
     specialties since 1972.

465
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:03,928
      And wait till you see
  the type of turkey they bake.

466
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,230
 This is Golden Crown Panaderia.

467
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:13,237
        It's a fantastic,
     family-oriented bakery.

468
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:17,075
  We feel really lucky to have
  them right around the corner.

469
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,010
Great food.
  Great customer service.

470
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,545
   Where you feel like family.

471
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:23,681
And they definitely know
 how to make a Guy feel welcome.

472
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,083
  Chris and Pratt are the best.

473
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:28,052
The father-and-son
 powerhouse behind this joint.

474
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:31,923
       It all began in '72
 when military-man Pratt Morales

475
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:34,859
            got after
   what he really loved to do.

476
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,260
I always wanted
 to be a baker.

477
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,429
And everywhere in the world
that I traveled in the military,

478
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:39,931
   I would wind up
at the local bakery.

479
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:42,433
        And it took just
     another 30 years to get

480
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,035
  a reliable business partner.

481
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,903
Couldn't afford a C.E.O.,
 so I raised my own.

482
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:48,506
  Together, they've turned out
      a one-of-a-kind menu.

483
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,675
         It's all about
      the bizcochitos here.

484
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,076
  I like the pumpkin empanadas.

485
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,778
But when it comes to
   Thanksgiving...

486
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,046
Isn't that beautiful?

487
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:59,217
    ...it's no surprise that
the bird is absolutely the word.

488
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,551
     Turkey bread is great.

489
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:03,121
        They make it look
       just like a turkey.

490
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:05,390
               Okay, what are
               we gonna make?
I want to make some dough.

491
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:07,592
And this is gonna be the wheat
part of the turkey...

492
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,093
               The wheat part.

493
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,595
...which is the leg,
the drumsticks, and the wings.

494
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:13,731
    Got some nice
stone-ground wheat flour.

495
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,299
This is the bread flour.

496
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:16,534
A lot of gluten in here.

497
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,136
Put a little bit of salt
      in there.

498
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:19,504
A little bit of shortening.

499
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,973
   And let it mix
  for a little bit.

500
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:24,175
Some molasses. That's gonna
give us some of the color.

501
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,810
   It's also some
of the sweetener, too.

502
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,678
And to soften up the dough
    a little bit,

503
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,946
   we're gonna put
     some honey.

504
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,148
                     Darling.
Beautiful.

505
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,817
And now we're going to add
  some water to it.

506
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:36,921
I'm gonna add it slowly,
little by little by little.

507
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:38,423
 Time for the yeast.

508
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,858
We got all the mixes in there,
   so here we go.

509
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:45,063
     We stop it,
bring it all out here.

510
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,231
And what I'm gonna do now
 to make a turkey --

511
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,966
 It's gonna be made
   in three parts.

512
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:50,835
    I'm gonna cut
   the drumsticks.

513
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:54,806
The wings is gonna be
 about 1/2 a pound.

514
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:56,574
    There you go.

515
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,342
I have another dough
     that I need

516
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,578
to make the white
part of the turkey,
which is the breast.

517
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,413
    White flour,
a little bit of sugar,

518
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,649
salt, the shortening.

519
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,818
                   Gotcha.
  Water.

520
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,519
 And add the yeast.

521
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,690
  Well, here we go.
                           Okay.

522
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:15,159
                  How long
       have you been doing this?
About 40 years.

523
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,527
                  40 years
       you've been making these?

524
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,628
    Yes. Mm-hmm.

525
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,299
Oh, this is gonna be
   the drumsticks.

526
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:22,433
                  I see it.

527
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,734
 They're dark meat.

528
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,336
And then we're gonna do
      the body,

529
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:28,005
which is the white part
of the turkey -- the breast.

530
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,141
And this is gonna go
   right in here.
                      Seriously?

531
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:33,077
Okay. And I'm gonna twist it
     like this.

532
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,412
 Now we're gonna do
     the wings.

533
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,020
    separate it.

534
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,156
    There you go.
 And then the wings.

535
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:46,924
Separate them over here, also.
      The bone.

536
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,459
               Could have been
               a taxidermist.

537
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,795
                  Giving it
               a little texture.
There you go.

538
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,930
  And I'm gonna do
a very light egg wash --

539
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,232
Give it the golden color.

540
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,500
   Some rosemary.

541
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,168
A little bit of parsley.

542
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,638
     Let it rise
 as high as it will.

543
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,807
                Wait for it!
                   Ready?

544
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,408
Ta-da!

545
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,144
  Here we go, guys.

546
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,378
                Look at that.

547
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,247
              That's beautiful.
Isn't that beautiful?

548
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,149
          I think people would
          like to have a turkey
          that looked that good.

549
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,050
I'm gonna slice you a piece.
    How is that?

550
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,685
              I'd like to have
              some of the knee.

551
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,554
    A little knee
    right there.

552
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,592
                    Mmm.

553
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,361
           Great crust on there.

554
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,465
             I get a little bit
             of that molasses.
There you go.

555
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,167
         Try some of the breast.

556
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,435
 There's a good part
    right there.

557
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,371
        It has huge crust on it,

558
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,873
 but then it's just pillowy soft
               on the inside.

559
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,646
             I get a little bit
     of that rosemary on that --

560
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:42,780
               On that bread.

561
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:44,582
          It tastes like holiday
             right off the bat.

562
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:46,584
It looks good on your table

563
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,386
        with your flowers
    or whatever you're doing.

564
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:50,721
It's a great place to come

565
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,590
  and feel like you're welcome
          all the time.

566
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:53,691
    There you go.

567
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,593
               Pratt, amazing.
Thank you, my friend.

568
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:58,162
                 I love it.

569
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:01,432
Up next, on this full hour --
  ultimate turkey fest...

570
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,266
That's good bird, man.

571
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,701
       ...in New Orleans.

572
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,636
This is like food Mardi Gras
   right here.
                   There you go.

573
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,772
 Thanksgiving, Big Easy-style...

574
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:10,808
I'm not kidding you.
That is ridiculously fantastic.

575
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,876
 ...all the way down to dessert.

576
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,344
  How do you think
I should get after it?

577
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,418
  So, I'm here in New Orleans,
    on Elysian Fields Avenue,

578
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,120
  right between I-10 and I-610.

579
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:25,489
     Now, when I'm thinking
   of great food in this area,

580
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:26,657
    and there's a lot of it,

581
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:27,725
       I got to be honest.

582
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,560
     I'm not thinking about
          Thanksgiving.

583
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:33,397
Well, that's until I heard about
 Sammy's Food Service and Deli.

584
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,832
               Turkey dinner,
             working coming up.

585
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,401
      It's just a wonderful
  New Orleans local restaurant.

586
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,603
               Turkey dinner.

587
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:40,171
Doing a killer
 New Orleans Thanksgiving.

588
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:41,272
              Mmm.

589
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:43,708
Thanksgiving is a big time
   in New Orleans.

590
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,676
           Coming up.
    And it's a huge tradition

591
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,578
      for self-taught chef,
        Sammy Schlegel...

592
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,280
When you cook everything
     homemade...

593
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,515
  ...at a joint that used to be
   his uncle's butcher shop...

594
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:52,683
Turkey dinner for here.

595
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:55,119
   ...till Sammy and his wife,
        Gina, took over.

596
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,754
     Turkey and oyster dressing.

597
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,889
    Butcher chop
turns into a sandwich shop.

598
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,825
Now turns into making
some Thanksgivings...

599
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:02,560
        Wonderful turkey
       and cranberry. Mmm.

600
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:03,861
Done the Big Easy way.

601
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,029
Dressing with oysters.

602
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,564
This is New Orleans.
We always have oysters.

603
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:07,565
           That's the way it is.

604
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:08,799
     Okay, well,
give me the rub down.

605
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,968
             Get our beds set up
       for our turkey to lie on.

606
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,871
               Celery, garlic,
        coarsely chopped onions.

607
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,740
These are also gonna
create a lot of great flavor

608
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:16,574
for our gravy later.

609
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:17,441
                   Absolutely.
     Okay.

610
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,242
                Paint him up.

611
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,377
     A little garlic butter oil.

612
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:20,645
              And that's gonna
          give him a nice sheen,

613
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:22,813
              make this poultry
         seasoning stick to him.

614
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,282
      Try not to miss any spots.

615
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,950
I think you might have
    missed there.

616
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,251
  There you go. Good job.
               Now we're good.

617
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:28,319
    Did you make
 the chicken stock?

618
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:29,387
         From the chicken backs.

619
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:30,354
It's a sandwich shop.

620
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:31,555
              Put it in there.

621
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:33,291
So that's gonna make some
great gravy on the bottom.

622
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,125
   Stuffing time.

623
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,159
         Half a pound of butter.

624
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,327
              We're gonna make
              a bechamel sauce.

625
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:37,995
      Bechamel?
    For stuffing?

626
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:39,630
                   Some flour.
Build a little rue.

627
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,798
   Throw a little
   milk in there.

628
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,266
             Get a nice, little,
             creamy paste here.

629
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:44,902
              Sauté some celery
           and red bell peppers,

630
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,637
      onions, green bell pepper.

631
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:47,872
         I'm gonna need a spoon.

632
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:49,874
    Well, listen,
I just showed up with car keys.

633
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:52,209
            Ah, I'm telling you.

634
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,779
       How you like them apples?

635
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,314
  Please don't ask
    for a mixer.

636
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,516
             Put our butter in.

637
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:00,184
Butter's kind of helping
  them mellow out.

638
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,887
      Take our oysters, put them
in this little chopping machina.

639
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,088
                Break them up
                a little bit.

640
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,791
That's not something
 you see every day.

641
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:08,159
         Releases up the flavor.
 Huge.

642
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,227
   Add some of this garlic here,
                 the thyme.

643
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:11,729
    What was that word?
                       Thyme.

644
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:12,963
        Thyme.
                      Thyme.

645
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:15,566
Red pepper flakes, black pepper,
             some Cajun season,

646
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:16,801
       bay leaves, chicken base.

647
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:18,035
    Smells great.

648
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,904
Look at the amount of oysters
to the amount of bread.

649
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:22,373
 This guy is crazy.

650
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,274
                    Hey.

651
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:24,508
        Hey.

652
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,943
You have the french bread
     brought in.

653
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:27,011
                    Yep.

654
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:27,912
That's good, even stale.

655
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:29,113
               All right, Guy.

656
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:30,715
         I know this is the part
        you've been waiting for.

657
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:32,483
              Put the bechamel
                in here now.

658
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:34,785
You're building the gravy
right into the stuffing.

659
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,654
    Here we go with the oysters.
                All that in.

660
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:39,223
I want that over some pasta.
Forget putting it in stuffing.

661
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:41,158
              Grated Parmesan,
           touch of lemon juice,

662
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,226
             flat-leaf parsley.

663
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:43,661
  Can I just start
dipping the bread in it,

664
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:45,062
  forget the whole
 Thanksgiving thing?

665
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,731
              Sure. Absolutely.

666
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,900
Is that your five bucks
on the floor over there?

667
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:52,203
          Oh, man. My lucky day.
                Look at this.

668
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:53,504
So worth five bucks.

669
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:56,273
This has just got to be a dip
with some bread and some...

670
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:57,742
              That's a thought.
                  Exactly.

671
00:22:57,744 --> 00:22:59,110
 Oh, and the oysters
     are fresh?

672
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:00,144
             Oysters are fresh.

673
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:02,613
           And we have five eggs
                beaten here.

674
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,582
   Oh. Wait, wait,
  wait, wait, wait.

675
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:06,250
Before you put the eggs
     in it, man.

676
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:07,785
    Now, I'm gonna fold this in.

677
00:23:07,787 --> 00:23:10,588
I'm not kidding you.
That is ridiculously fantastic.

678
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,423
Gonna bake a little bit?
         We're pre-cooking this.

679
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:13,791
  Out of the oven,
I'm not kidding you.
Thainto that bird.ly fantastic.

680
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,693
             Stuffing the bird.
              Tuck his legs in.

681
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:16,861
        Give him a little truss.

682
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:18,496
         Birds gonna go in, 350.

683
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:19,730
  Hour and a half?
                      Correct.

684
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,165
                Now it's time
             to make our gravy.

685
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:23,801
'Cause you already fortified it
with some chicken stock.

686
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:26,470
     Turn this boat motor loose.

687
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:28,339
     Add a little texture to it.
                 Here we go.

688
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:30,508
           Go ahead and cut this
        breast lobe off of here.

689
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,643
I don't really think it's fair
that I should have all that.

690
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:34,145
             Feel free to share.

691
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:36,447
   This seasoning
on the outside of this,

692
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:38,783
along with that garlic butter
    rub you did,

693
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:39,984
that's good bird, man.

694
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:41,218
         Put it on a plate here.

695
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,553
Did you make the cranberry?

696
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:44,455
     Yeah, this is what you been
         waiting for right here.

697
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:45,356
Right out of the bird.

698
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:48,325
            And a little topping
                of the gravy.

699
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,226
        Mmm.

700
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:51,529
Dude, that's super-tasty.
        Wow.

701
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:53,831
     The turkey
is ridiculously tender.

702
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,499
    The stuffing
has great texture to it.

703
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:56,834
I mean, it's big flavor.

704
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:58,769
You can really taste
the oysters, a boatload of them.

705
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:02,339
And the gravy is right on point,
up at ridiculous level.

706
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,375
This is like food Mardi Gras
   right here.
                   There you go.

707
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:06,811
The turkey dinner,
  it's really good.

708
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:08,279
   The dressing is delicious.

709
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,581
     You taste the oysters.
                       Oh, yeah.

710
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:11,849
                   Perfect
             Thanksgiving meal.

711
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:13,684
           And that's how you do
            a Thanksgiving right

712
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:14,485
               in New Orleans.

713
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,053
That's how you do it.
        Mmm.

714
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,455
- Pick up.
- And for dessert...

715
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,423
- Pumpkin bread pudding?
- Pumpkin bread pudding.

716
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:21,659
 Especially around Thanksgiving,
             you got to have it.

717
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:23,861
You know when it starts off
     with this,

718
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:24,762
   makes me happy.

719
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:25,763
   A mess of eggs.

720
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:27,498
                Mess of eggs.
               Whipping cream.

721
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,033
    Get in there
  and get you some.
                         Yeah.

722
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:32,870
  Brown sugar, some white sugar,
        roasted, pureed pumpkin.

723
00:24:32,872 --> 00:24:34,939
           And then we have some
               pumpkin spice.

724
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:35,739
     Necessary.

725
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:37,241
                Some vanilla.
   Vanilla.

726
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:39,109
                Vanilla beans.
  The scrapings
 of the vanilla beans.

727
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:39,944
                    Yes.

728
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:41,312
      Puree everything together.

729
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:44,181
A big pumpkin omelet
    right there.

730
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,550
                 All right.
          Now some French bread.

731
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:48,319
So, you take the french bread
  that's left over,

732
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,020
ind it up, crust and all.

733
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:52,056
            And we're just gonna
             pour that right in.

734
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:54,558
Wow. You guys get serious
     about this.

735
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,994
             This will sit for,
              maybe, 20 minutes

736
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,029
               just to absorb
               all the liquid.

737
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,264
 Into the big chunks
      of bread.

738
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:01,832
What are these little
   tasty morsels?

739
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,335
                    Those
            are candied walnuts.

740
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:06,136
        Just to add a little bit
              of flavor to it.

741
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:07,738
 There's some nice,
little texture in there.

742
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,875
         And then I'm gonna need
           that pan right there.

743
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:12,176
    There you go.

744
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,878
Down right
down to the number, huh?

745
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,912
                    Yeah.

746
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:16,447
     We're gonna bake it at 300.

747
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:17,648
  Down for an hour.

748
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,316
 So you bring a lot
of that moisture out.

749
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:20,618
   Just sits there
 and compacts down.

750
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,752
    That's crazy.

751
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:23,854
     But I like
these little candied walnuts

752
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,422
that I just picked out of there.

753
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:26,457
         Would you like a slice?

754
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:27,825
 Is that cooled down
    a little bit?

755
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:29,393
Them candied walnuts
taste like pumpkin pie.

756
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,395
I'm not a big bread pudding fan.
I got to be honest with you.

757
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:32,296
                   You aren't?
        No.

758
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:33,531
 It's the egg ratio.

759
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:34,665
 Just not necessary.

760
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:35,866
Should be able to put
something else in it.

761
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:36,934
    Chicken stock
   would be good.

762
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:38,135
                  Oh, okay.

763
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,703
           Well, we're gonna see
              if you like this.

764
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,238
    I'm a fan of
 this bread company.

765
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,707
So I got to believe that with
the bread being chewy and all...

766
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,942
             Oh, it's wonderful.

767
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:47,411
                 Rum sauce.
  Cream, sugar, rum, cornstarch.

768
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:48,445
         Ah.

769
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,614
  How do you think
I should get after it?

770
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:51,782
Attack it from the left?

771
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:52,850
    I'm gonna go
right in the center.

772
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:56,020
    Look at that.
Smells like pumpkin pie.

773
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:58,722
I'm gonna be
eating these words for a while.

774
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,624
    That is some
tasty bread pudding.

775
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:03,494
It's got a good crunch.
It's not pumpkin madness.

776
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:05,829
 The rum sauce isn't
super over-the-top sweet.

777
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:08,198
Could be the holidays
      or what.

778
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,533
  There's something
  about that combo

779
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:11,602
because I just ate four more
bites than I expected I would.

780
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:12,703
 That's really good.

781
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:14,204
    Nice job.
                   Thank you.

782
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:15,372
          Pumpkin bread pudding.

783
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,041
       It's just fabulous.

784
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:19,043
Pumpkin-y,
  nice cream sauce.

785
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:19,910
         Oh, it's yummy.

786
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,211
    Malata soup.

787
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:23,547
 Anything that they put together
       is excellent. Mmm.

788
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:26,250
And you can just count on coming
   here and having good food.

789
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,284
            Oh, yeah.

790
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:28,652
              That's my brother
            from another mother.

791
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:30,120
              A little goatee,
               some earrings,

792
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:31,689
    bleached-out hair, I'll have
       him working as my double.

793
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:33,691
       You drive the '67 around.

794
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:34,825
                I'll hang out
            and make sandwiches.

795
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,994
Oh, you got a deal then.

796
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:40,164
Coming up in Detroit...

797
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,132
All right, let me try to
explain things to you

798
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:43,968
as I shove my face with it.

799
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,704
 ...a joint putting the poultry
        right on the pie.

800
00:26:46,706 --> 00:26:48,906
You got to try this.

801
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:50,574
 And in Milwaukee, Wisconsin...

802
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:52,276
That gravy is legit.

803
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:54,979
      ...the whole shebang
   rolled into a single bite.

804
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:56,413
 Lucky you have her
keeping you in line.

805
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:57,615
                    She does.
This guy's out of control.

806
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:05,356
 I'm here in Detroit, Michigan,

807
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:07,224
     right across the street
    from the Eastern Market,

808
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:08,559
   to check out a pizza joint

809
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:10,494
         where the owner
       got his inspiration

810
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:13,397
 from a little village that his
   father grew up in in Italy.

811
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,032
         He got so much
       inspiration from it

812
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:16,634
     that he named the joint
            after it.

813
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,469
    This is Supino Pizzeria.

814
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:19,837
      Margherita going out.

815
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,705
   Supino's is the best pizza
      anywhere around here.

816
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:22,940
    Large Supino coming out.

817
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:24,742
     But not New York pizza,
         Italian pizza.

818
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:26,176
            What makes the pizza
                  so good?

819
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:27,945
The ingredients.
 Everything's great.

820
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:29,680
  Dave's excellent
  at making pizzas.

821
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:31,415
Large verdure e funghi
   coming out.

822
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:32,850
That'd be Dave Mancini,

823
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:35,085
       who chucked his own
  medical career out the window

824
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:38,489
             in 2008
  to open his own pizza joint.

825
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:41,025
Where did you become
the dough aficionado?

826
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:42,526
           Well, it was actually
                  Supino's,

827
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:43,927
the name of my father's hometown
                  in Italy.

828
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:45,596
          And I went back there,
         had some amazing pizza.

829
00:27:45,598 --> 00:27:47,131
You were the tallest person
   in the village.

830
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:48,532
               By a long shot.

831
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:50,434
  I was inspired by their pizza.
       I thought it was amazing.

832
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:52,036
               Over the years,
  I developed a crust of my own.

833
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:53,904
   In my little KitchenAid mixer
              on my countertop.

834
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:56,073
  I used to mix a batch of dough
              almost every day

835
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:57,007
           what I really wanted.

836
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,776
    You ate pizza
seven years in a row?

837
00:27:58,778 --> 00:28:00,644
        My friends and relatives
     benefited from it, as well.

838
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:01,779
     All right.
So let's make some dough.

839
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:03,147
              We're gonna start
          by putting the dry mix

840
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:04,114
                    into
       the 60-quart Hobart here.

841
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,315
 What kind of flour
    are we using?

842
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,117
        We're using bread flour.
              Nice elasticity.

843
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,686
      So, now,
you're not a double-zero guy?

844
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:10,454
      I'm not a double zero guy.
         This is not Neapolitan.

845
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:11,922
               It's more like
   an East-Coast-American style.

846
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:13,724
         It borrows a little bit
   from the Italian styles, too.

847
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:14,858
           A little bit of yeast
               to go in this.

848
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,126
  Dry active yeast.

849
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,761
             Now I'm gonna make
      my wet mix -- water, salt.

850
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:19,229
And the oil's gonna go in
the water here, too?

851
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:20,230
                  Yes, sir.

852
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:21,598
            And we're just gonna
                  add this.

853
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,966
And when will you use it?
                      Tomorrow.

854
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:24,802
   So you at least
give it a 24-hour rest?

855
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:26,370
Really develop some of
 that yeast flavor.

856
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,272
But we'll use some of the dough
that you made yesterday.

857
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:30,407
                 Absolutely.

858
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,710
Twice a week,
 Dave hits the Eastern Market

859
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:34,912
        across the street
  for the freshest ingredients.

860
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:36,213
             Thanks a lot, guys.

861
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:39,249
 But the key topping for
 one of his most popular pies...

862
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:41,118
Large City Wing Thing
     going out.

863
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,886
          ...comes from
       one of his buddies.

864
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,855
           It's a smoked turkey.
                 Delicious.

865
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:47,458
      Dave and the City Wing guy
           collaborated on this.

866
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,792
     Here's the City Wing Thing.

867
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:50,127
 Now, are you really
 a City Wings dude,

868
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:51,095
or did you just get the hat?

869
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:52,129
          It's my spot.

870
00:28:52,131 --> 00:28:53,497
Oh, that's your spot?
  You're the dude?

871
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:55,299
            Yes, sir.
  Nice!

872
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:58,068
Nice, brine-smoked
 turkey legs.
                      Yes, sir.

873
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,803
           We're gonna make some
             braised turkey legs

874
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:01,038
         for the City Wing Thing
                   pizza.

875
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,839
Oh. See it every day.

876
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:03,073
                    Yeah.

877
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,675
              I'm not a big fan
     of chicken breast on pizza.

878
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:05,976
           And I've been looking
          for a poultry product.

879
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,511
    Throw the smoked turkey legs
                  in here.

880
00:29:07,513 --> 00:29:08,712
                 We got some
           quartered red onions,

881
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:09,947
          Frank's Red Hot Sauce.

882
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:11,682
Oh, so we are going after
a real chicken wing flavor.

883
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:12,783
         A little bit of a tang.
                   Sugar.

884
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:14,051
               Now we're gonna
          cover this with water.

885
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:15,586
         I've got garlic cloves,
         really more for flavor.

886
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:16,787
So, how long we gonna
   let it go for?

887
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:18,288
              This is gonna go
          for about 2 1/2 hours.

888
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,890
  They're the bomb.

889
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:21,191
    That's tasty.

890
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:23,861
The turkey leg and the thigh,
they have such rich flavor.

891
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:25,129
                Yeah. We want
         a little texture there.

892
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:26,230
                We don't want
             to turn it to mush.

893
00:29:26,232 --> 00:29:27,631
Yeah, you don't want
 to turn into mush.

894
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:28,999
           But we want toothness
                to the meat.

895
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:30,300
  Toothness.
                    Toothy-ness.

896
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:31,435
Toothy-- tooth -- toothsome.

897
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:32,436
             One of them words.

898
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:33,437
          Yeah, yeah. Toothsome.

899
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,873
   Just 220, 221,
 whatever it takes.

900
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,144
   This is really
where we're gonna separate

901
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:41,445
the men from the boys.

902
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:42,746
I like the method so far.

903
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:43,781
 Building the edge.

904
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:45,949
   That's it.
                     That's it.

905
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,951
Cheese, and we're gonna
  put sauce on top.

906
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,020
            We're trying to keep
     that crust nice and crispy,

907
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:52,022
     so putting the sauce on top
             keeps the texture.

908
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:53,157
 And a little Gouda.

909
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,458
                Smoked Gouda.

910
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,326
          Fresh cubed mozzarella
              over top of that.

911
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:57,861
             The roasted garlic,
               cherry peppers.

912
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,730
     And we're gonna finish with
 that turkey we braised earlier.

913
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:01,198
  That's all she wrote.
          That is all she wrote.

914
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,699
  What temperature
you running that oven at?

915
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:03,901
          This oven's going 670.

916
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:06,270
You got brick lining the top,
the bottom, the sides.

917
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:07,604
  There's all kinds
of thermal mass in there.

918
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:08,806
This does not get cold.

919
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:10,207
I can open and close this oven
    all day long.

920
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:11,642
                Not something
             you hear every day,

921
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:12,643
       but today, on "Triple D,"

922
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,913
            you've learned about
                thermal mass.

923
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:17,080
With that kind of heat,

924
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:19,116
          the pie bakes
     for about six minutes,

925
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:22,486
       with a spin midway
 for an even cook on the crust.

926
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:27,858
                Look at that!

927
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,060
Enough of the Tom Foolery.
        Set up and ready to eat.

928
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:34,164
    Let me try to
explain things to you

929
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,766
 as I shove my face
      with it.

930
00:30:35,768 --> 00:30:37,301
 'Cause you can tell
  I don't like it.

931
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:39,603
   It's definitely
  light and crispy.

932
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:41,738
Cross between, probably,
  an American style

933
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,841
     and a Neapolitan style.

934
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,142
        Mmm.

935
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:46,743
  I give you an "A"
 in the dough, man.

936
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:50,414
    A nice blend
between cheese and sauce,

937
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:51,949
a little bit of spice
  from the vinegar

938
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:54,284
of the sweet peppers,
creaminess of the garlic.

939
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:57,621
Oh, I love it.

940
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:59,256
It's not Thanksgiving turkey

941
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:00,991
          that someone
     carved from the table.

942
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:02,693
          It's smokey.
   It's absolutely delicious.

943
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:05,495
   And it pairs excellent with
those peppers that are on there.

944
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:07,030
Large 'Pino ready to go out.

945
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,466
Dave is
 an absolutely fearless chef

946
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:10,634
 when it comes to making pizza.

947
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:12,636
    I don't have a favorite.
     I never order a pizza.

948
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:14,171
      I always come in here
  and say, "Dave, surprise me."

949
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:15,772
Do you think this is some of
the best pizza in town?

950
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:17,407
               It's definitely
          the best pies in town.

951
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:19,343
We really want to make sure
  it was something special.

952
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:20,878
           It's set itself apart
                a little bit.

953
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,346
You got to come down here
 and try this pizza.

954
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:23,947
 Well done, brother.
 Really, well done.

955
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:26,416
You know, I think one of the tag
 lines for "Triple D" should be,

956
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:27,985
 "If it's funky, we'll find it."

957
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:30,287
  Here we are on the east side
          of Milwaukee.

958
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:32,422
   Now, Lake Michigan's about
      two blocks that way.

959
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:34,658
      And the university's
     about a mile that way.

960
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,127
      And we're at a joint
  that used to be a coffee shop

961
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:39,396
         now turned into
     a restaurant and a bar.

962
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,898
    Welcome to the The Comet.

963
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,065
  Bacon apple pie.

964
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,867
      It's apple pie with bacon.

965
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,535
   From pancakes and burgers,

966
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:48,805
           to good old
    American mac 'n' cheese.

967
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:52,042
 It's all about the comfort food
 Adam Lucks and his sister, Val,

968
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:54,878
      have been cooking up
    since they opened in '05.

969
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,447
Just you two winging it
and doing it your way?

970
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:58,315
          Pretty much.
                   Essentially.

971
00:31:58,317 --> 00:31:59,783
      Ahi tuna.

972
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:02,052
And they're putting
 their mark all over this menu.

973
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:03,921
    Chicken, peach jelly on top.

974
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:04,922
   The vegan gyro.

975
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:07,324
Vegan Reuben tortilla.
             Fantastic.

976
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:09,693
            It's things you know
     in kind of a different way.

977
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:11,495
Like something
 they named after a buddy,

978
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:14,298
   A.J.'s Compact Turkey Dinner.
                           Mmm.

979
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,434
It's Thanksgiving and convenient
  to eat ball form.

980
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,436
              Killer stuffing,
              mashed potatoes,

981
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,071
              and fresh roasted
               turkey breast.

982
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:22,706
 Yeah. And you just
get in and mix it up.

983
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:23,941
We're gonna make them
 into little balls.

984
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:25,409
And then we'll flour them,
  -bter them.

985
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:26,443
               How do you make
              the beer batter?

986
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,245
   Flour and beer
and salt and pepper.

987
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:29,613
     Throw them
 in the deep fryer.

988
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,648
 They're get served
in a chicken gravy that we made.

989
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,050
Just place the turkey
     right there

990
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:34,217
in the center of the gravy.

991
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:36,653
A little parsley for color.
  And there you go.

992
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:38,989
        Mmm.
That gravy is legit.

993
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:40,290
See, this is the component

994
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,392
 that we're missing
in Thanksgiving, is crunch.

995
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:43,860
This is crunch-a-tastical.

996
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:44,995
    Look at that.

997
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:46,029
        Mmm.

998
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:48,165
   Thcove
   gravy emporium.

999
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,700
         Get just about anything
                off the menu,

1000
00:32:49,702 --> 00:32:50,968
     and it's just really great.

1001
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,436
Always tastes delicious.

1002
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:53,770
Kimbo Burger, order up.

1003
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:54,805
     I think it's fantastic.

1004
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,473
 Lucky you have her
keeping you in line.

1005
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,841
                     She does.
 This guy's out of control.

1006
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:58,809
      Someone's got to boss
           him around.

1007
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,310
    Bacon pusher.

1008
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:03,814
   Up next, in Albuquerque...

1009
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,549
  My mouth is already starting
            to water.

1010
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:06,984
      It smells so killer.

1011
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:09,953
      ...sandwiches stacked
    with a New-Mexican spin.

1012
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:12,155
    That's what she gave me.
              Okay?

1013
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,891
      And a barbecue champ
     in Glendale, Arizona...

1014
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:16,593
      Now I know why you been in
           so many competitions,

1015
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:17,661
            why you won so many.

1016
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:19,296
          ...smoking up
        the centerpiece.

1017
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:21,999
                  Aw, man.
   But it sure is tender turkey.

1018
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:33,643
 So, I'm here in the older part
   of Albuquerque, New Mexico

1019
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:35,045
     known as North Valley.

1020
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:37,147
   Now, out here, you'll find
  everything from horse ranches

1021
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:38,482
        to organic farms.

1022
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:41,218
But more importantly, you've got
    a cool, little restaurant

1023
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,520
  where the chef/owner started
       by selling burritos

1024
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,022
   out of the back of her car.

1025
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:46,857
          Now she's got
  a little take-out restaurant

1026
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,692
  where she's making, get this,

1027
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:51,595
     over 1,000 meals a day
       for local schools.

1028
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:53,764
       This is Bocadillos.

1029
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:55,532
     How long on a T&A, sir?

1030
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:59,336
        It's real people
        making real food

1031
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:00,504
  that real people want to eat.

1032
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:01,738
After that, a Philly.

1033
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,773
      It's fresh. Love it.

1034
00:34:02,775 --> 00:34:04,541
 They're good people, friendly.

1035
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,176
      Gonna be a busy day.

1036
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:09,513
And for owner and chef
Marie Yniguez, that's every day.

1037
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:11,948
           Since '09,
     this Albuquerque native

1038
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,751
  has been delivering the goods
    on what the locals crave.

1039
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,386
  We love chili in New Mexico.

1040
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,888
    We put it on everything.

1041
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,057
And they're a staple
 of Bocadillos' sandwiches.

1042
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,391
  Not only does it taste good,

1043
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:24,494
     but it makes the whole
    neighborhood smell good.

1044
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:26,563
So, I'm gonna follow
  my nose down the road,

1045
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:30,400
 where Marie's cousin Charlie is
 rockin' his Hatch-chili stand.

1046
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,436
So, let me
    get this straight.

1047
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:33,703
             This right here is
              the Hatch chili?

1048
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:35,372
Yes, it comes from Hatch,
     absolutely.

1049
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:36,540
            So Hatch is a place?

1050
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:38,075
 Yes, chili capital
    of the world.

1051
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:39,309
             Let's turn her on.

1052
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:40,911
 Now, that's my kind of machine.

1053
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,546
    Only takes eight minutes

1054
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:44,915
      to roast these babies
         to perfection.

1055
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,650
  My mouth is already starting
            to water.

1056
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:47,984
      It smells so killer.

1057
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:50,187
         I've never seen
     a chili-roasting stand.

1058
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:51,254
          Welcome to New Mexico.

1059
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,589
              Yeah,
     welcome to New Mexico.

1060
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:55,392
                There we are.

1061
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:57,327
          Look at that!

1062
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:59,229
And we're gonna cook with this?
                       Yes, sir.

1063
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:01,598
            In fact,
   they're the crowning glory

1064
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,533
on one of Marie's top sellers...

1065
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:05,001
          T&A on wheat.

1066
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:07,304
...a New Mexican spin
  on the turkey sandwich.

1067
00:35:07,306 --> 00:35:08,772
    It's extremely flavorful.

1068
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:09,806
           It's legit.

1069
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:11,875
              We're gonna start
              with the dry rub

1070
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:14,144
               for the turkey
           for the T&A sandwich.

1071
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:15,445
      The T&A?
                        T&A.

1072
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,580
    What does T&A
     stand for?

1073
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:17,747
             Turkey and avocado.

1074
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:22,385
        We got crushed peppers,
         garlic, salt, pepper,

1075
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:24,855
                a little bit
               of brown sugar.

1076
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:26,156
               Mix all this up
                  together.

1077
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:27,324
  Dry rub goes on?

1078
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:28,325
              Dry rub goes on.

1079
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:29,359
 Not on the inside?

1080
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:30,427
                No, I like it
                to fall apart

1081
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:31,962
            as soon as I pull it
              out of the oven.

1082
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:33,296
     And what is
  this concoction?

1083
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,365
        So, that right there is
   our house-made honey mustard.

1084
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:36,800
                Just go ahead
               and toss it on.

1085
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,168
                 Good to go.
                   Pretty.

1086
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,269
             Wrap it up in foil,

1087
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:43,507
            stick it in the oven
            for 12 hours at 250.

1088
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:49,980
                 All right,
               roasted turkey.

1089
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:51,581
    Pretty much when you take it
              out of the oven,

1090
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,549
            it just falls apart.

1091
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:54,217
That honey mustard...

1092
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:55,519
  rocks the house.

1093
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:57,187
          It's pretty sick, huh?

1094
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:58,989
              We're gonna make
  the green-chili apple chutney.

1095
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:02,325
            So, this is typical
    chili peeling in New Mexico.

1096
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,660
But you're wearing gloves?
                     Oh, yeah.

1097
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,061
  Because...
           'Cause you don't know

1098
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:06,863
 if you're gonna touch your face
        or anything else later.

1099
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:07,764
                Ready to go.

1100
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:09,099
            And then, basically,
                    you just...

1101
00:36:09,101 --> 00:36:11,701
Nice roasted flavor,
  not super spicy,

1102
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,103
but those will all range
   in heat, right?

1103
00:36:13,105 --> 00:36:14,337
                    Yes.

1104
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,239
And this chili apple chutney's
gonna go on the turkey?

1105
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:17,707
                    Yes.

1106
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:21,278
      You get your diced apples.
         A little bit of sugar.

1107
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,014
So, about a cup and a half
     of chilies.

1108
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,348
     Let it all
   just cook down.

1109
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,717
   And then you'll start getting
         the sweet and the hot,

1110
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,720
             and you'll be ready
                   to go.

1111
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:32,189
          So, we're gonna put it
              in a hoagie roll.

1112
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:34,157
   Whole wheat?!
                       Yep.

1113
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,892
       You have a little healthy
            somewhere in there.

1114
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,396
    So, you put your green-chili
               apple chutney,

1115
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:40,730
    let it soak into the turkey,

1116
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:42,332
   and that's kind of what makes
           your whole sandwich.

1117
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:44,234
         Got the Muenster cheese
                   going.

1118
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:45,902
  As in Herman?
                       As in.

1119
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:48,405
      So, we got the green-chili
               chutney going.

1120
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:51,575
                 Here we go.

1121
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:52,909
Is that a serious portion
      or what?

1122
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,010
       That's a serious portion.

1123
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:55,378
            We do about 8 ounces
                per sandwich.

1124
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,847
         Heirloom tomatoes fresh
         from one of the gardens

1125
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,716
             here in the valley,
                  avocado.

1126
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,818
               There you go --
             your very own T&A.

1127
00:37:03,956 --> 00:37:05,889
That's what she gave me,
        okay?

1128
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,057
             That's a sandwich.

1129
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:09,192
 No, that's a dinner
      for six.

1130
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:19,102
        What do you think, yeah?

1131
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:20,470
The sweet and the heat

1132
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:22,005
with the roasted turkey
 and the mustard --

1133
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:24,140
    I don't know
where you came up with the idea.

1134
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:25,342
   It's delicious,

1135
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:27,143
 and the little burn
of the chili in the back...

1136
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:28,478
             It's just the love.

1137
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,913
   It is the love.

1138
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:32,115
             Carley,
 you have a T&A sandwich ready.

1139
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:33,783
       The turkey's moist.

1140
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:35,418
      The bread is awesome.

1141
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,220
  It has all the chilies in it,
      which is really good.

1142
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:39,222
   It's enough for two people.
        That's for sure.

1143
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:40,790
Marie just wants to feed you,

1144
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:43,793
       a skill she's taken
way beyond this tiny restaurant.

1145
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,595
 What are you doing
for all these hours?

1146
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:46,830
       I mean,
there are seven tables.

1147
00:37:46,832 --> 00:37:48,164
           Well, because we feed
              charter schools.

1148
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,967
       So I feed a thousand kids
    before 10:00 in the morning.

1149
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,602
  A thousand?!
                   A thousand.

1150
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,704
      I'm here for my community.
        I'm here for New Mexico.

1151
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:57,007
    I'm here to feed the future,
   and we do it all from scratch

1152
00:37:57,009 --> 00:38:00,210
      just the way my mom and my
 grandma taught me how to do it.

1153
00:38:00,212 --> 00:38:02,412
  You're gonna get good quality
      every time you come.

1154
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:04,581
     Every time I come here,
   I get something different.

1155
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:05,448
       I love this place.

1156
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,716
You're priceless, girl.

1157
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:08,285
I'm gonna tell you something.
You really are priceless.

1158
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,153
You -- You give a lot
     to people,

1159
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:12,656
  and it comes out
    in your food.

1160
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:14,157
  You're the bomb.

1161
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,191
                 Thank you.

1162
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:20,697
           Something's
     a little strange here.

1163
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,299
    Joint looks like a diner.

1164
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:24,067
 But it's in Glendale, Arizona.

1165
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:26,436
  Oh, yeah, and they're serving
    southern style barbecue.

1166
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:27,904
     You know, low-and-slow.

1167
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:32,309
   But they tell me the guy's
 a competitive barbecue champion

1168
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:34,978
  who's won some of the biggest
  competitions in the country.

1169
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,013
                 Let's see,
            I've got 300 awards.

1170
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:39,849
What's the most prestigious
  event you won in?

1171
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,318
        Oh, always Jack Daniels.

1172
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,919
   And it's those same recipes

1173
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,954
     that he's cranking out
  for the neighborhood crowd...

1174
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,589
          Got the pork and slaw.
        ...every day.

1175
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:47,624
The ribs are really good.

1176
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:49,025
          Great flavor,
    and they're very tender.

1177
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:51,494
   The beef brisket. It tastes
  really good, and it's moist.

1178
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:52,662
I love the pulled pork.

1179
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,197
            The best.

1180
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:57,734
All done low-and-slow in
 Roger's mesquite-fired smoker.

1181
00:38:57,736 --> 00:38:58,902
                   This is
      the heart of the business.

1182
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:01,237
    He learned how to do this
       almost 30 years ago

1183
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,373
  at a joint called Thee Pitts.

1184
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:05,008
We got the whole farm on here,
      or what?

1185
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,509
         What he opened
       a place of his own,

1186
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,845
 he called it Thee Pitts Again.

1187
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:09,913
  I love the ribs.

1188
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:11,247
I like the chicken wings.

1189
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:12,482
I like the onion rings.

1190
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:13,850
        Sir, let's make it easy.

1191
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,552
        Anything you don't like?

1192
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:16,586
         No.

1193
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:19,122
      And beyond the smoke,
        there's the rub.

1194
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:20,890
              Teach me the rub,
                oh, wise one.

1195
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:22,792
Season salt,
 Spanish paprika.

1196
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:26,529
It's got a little different
taste than regular paprika.

1197
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,598
I toss in a little sugar.
               A little sugar.

1198
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,601
A little granulated garlic,
just a little bit of cumin.

1199
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:33,236
And also a pinch of salt.

1200
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:34,738
               A little onion.

1201
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,239
   A little onion.

1202
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:37,640
    Some paprika.
    The parsley.

1203
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:38,875
                The parsley.
   Parsley.

1204
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,310
         Because if your paprika
           is looking like that,

1205
00:39:40,312 --> 00:39:42,479
      that's why I'm not winning
              big competitions.

1206
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:44,214
             I've been thinking
    it's parsley the whole time.

1207
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:46,583
And then we have my ingredient
  here that I add.

1208
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:47,951
              You've got about
                half of one,

1209
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:49,419
                and then half
           of your secret, so...

1210
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:50,620
        Yeah.
Now you're calculating it.

1211
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:52,021
                  Who gets
           to make the rub here?

1212
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:52,889
        I do.

1213
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,023
                  Only you?
      Yeah.

1214
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:55,525
             You're the only one
             that makes the rub?

1215
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:56,926
  I'm the only one
 that makes the rub

1216
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,095
    And that goes on everything?
  Everything.

1217
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:01,030
   I've used this
  in competitions.

1218
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:02,899
And I've won chicken.
   I've won ribs.

1219
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,001
 I've won shoulders.

1220
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:06,136
It's very versatile.

1221
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:08,004
 He's even smoking whole turkeys
            with it.

1222
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:10,273
I've never had barbecued turkey.
        This is a first.

1223
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:11,641
       So how do you serve this?

1224
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,143
 We pull it.
                All pulled bird?

1225
00:40:13,145 --> 00:40:14,911
  All pulled.
       Give me the rundown here.

1226
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,946
  This is margarine
 to give it a glaze.

1227
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:20,517
It also let's the seasoning
    adhere to it.

1228
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,851
Give it the old rub.

1229
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:24,421
              Take this beauty
      and just lay her right in.

1230
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:26,189
Now, how long
is that gonna run for?

1231
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:30,059
       Usually, a bird this size
       will take about 14 hours.

1232
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:31,961
    Look at that.

1233
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:33,630
                    Mmm.

1234
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:34,664
                    Mmm.

1235
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,866
                  Aw, man.
       It sure is tender turkey.

1236
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:39,436
      Oh, yeah.

1237
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:40,670
         Were you talking to me?

1238
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:42,472
      Really, really good,
          moist turkey.

1239
00:40:42,474 --> 00:40:43,673
          Very tender.

1240
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:47,243
And great
 with Roger's homemade sauce.

1241
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:48,645
               Sauce is money.

1242
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:52,248
I start off with brown sugar,
Worcestershire sauce,

1243
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,516
 put in the mustard.

1244
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:55,552
       I've never seen that much
          mustard go in a sauce.

1245
00:40:55,554 --> 00:40:56,853
   Oh, yeah.
                Want me to help?

1246
00:40:56,855 --> 00:40:58,488
        Yeah.
  That'd be great.

1247
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,190
Heinz ketchup is what I use.

1248
00:41:00,192 --> 00:41:02,125
             So, no cooking it.

1249
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:02,926
   No cooking it.

1250
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:03,760
             No messing with it?

1251
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:05,061
 No messing with it.

1252
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:06,329
             That's good sauce.

1253
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:08,731
       And folks here say
    it's great on everything.

1254
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:10,967
    Tangy, but not too much.

1255
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:14,604
  He just, somehow or another,
  just has the magic about him.

1256
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:18,541
    I think he just eats it,
    sleeps it, and dreams it.

1257
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:19,876
                 Well done.

1258
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:21,444
      Now I know why you've been
        in so many competitions,

1259
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:23,746
            why you won so many.

1260
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:25,014
                 Real deal.

1261
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,550
          So, that's it
       for this road trip.

1262
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,885
        But don't worry.

1263
00:41:28,887 --> 00:41:32,021
    We got plenty more joints
 to find all over this country.

1264
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:33,623
     I'll be looking for you
            next time

1265
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:37,293
               on
 "Diners, Drive-ins and Dives."

1266
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:39,095
 You're gonna start
hearing some funny sounds.

1267
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:42,432
              What is going on
                 right now?

1268
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:43,299
'Cause it's still urgling.

1269
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:44,200
          "Urgling" is the term?

1270
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:45,034
                It's urgling?

1271
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:46,069
I clearly should just write,

1272
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:47,537
like, a new dictionary
for this restaurant.

1273
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:49,506
               You should have
         the funking dictionary.
