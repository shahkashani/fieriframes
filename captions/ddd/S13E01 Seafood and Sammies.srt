               LIMITED MOISTURE,
                MAXIMUM FLAVOR. 
I'M GONNA OVEREAT.              
I CAN ALREADY TELL.             

105
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,385
                  (laughs)      
           A LITTLE HEAVY CREAM.

106
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,854
NOW YOU GOT THE NICE RICHNESS   
     OF THE HEAVY CREAM         

107
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,389
WORKING WITH THE ROUX,          

108
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:19,391
 BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE            
TO BE ALL HEAVY CREAM           

109
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,393
IF YOU HAVE A NICE ROUX         
       IN THERE.                
            I'M GONNA USE MILK  
           FOR THE REST OF THAT.

110
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,662
  SO THIS IS THE LIQUOR THAT WE 
STRAINED OUT FROM ALL THE SHELLS

111
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,196
                 THAT WE COOKED.

112
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,732

                  YEAH, YOU DID.

113
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,201
       ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE GONNA
      BRING THIS UP TO A SIMMER.

      OUR PORTION OF GRAVY,     

115
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,407

117
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,944

THAT'S MORE SHELLFISH           

118
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,946
       THAN YOU GET

00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,782
  I'M HERE IN MIDTOWN DETROIT   

203
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,185
IN AN UP-AND-COMING NEIGHBORHOOD
      TO CHECK OUT A JOINT      

204
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,253
        THAT'S OWNED BY         
    A HUSBAND-AND-WIFE TEAM.    

205
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,255
    NOW THIS PLACE IS HUGE--    

206
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,792
    OVER 18,000 SQUARE FEET,    

207
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:16,460
      AND OVER 50% OF THAT      
          IS KITCHENS.          

208
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,462
     THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE     
      GOT THEIR OWN DAIRY.      

209
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,197
THEY'RE MAKING THEIR OWN CHEESE.

210
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,133
   THEY GOT THEIR OWN BAKERY    
    BAKING THEIR OWN BREADS,    

211
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:26,004
  AND THEIR KITCHEN IS SERVING  
  OVER 120,000 PEOPLE A YEAR.   

212
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,606
     LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,      

213
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:30,942
              THIS              
  IS THE TRAFFIC JAM AND SNUG.  

214
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,344
      ALL RIGHT, SMELT UP.      

215
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,212
    HAS IT ALWAYS BEEN THIS BIG?
             I GOT LOST.        

216
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,014
   VEGETARIAN TEX-MEX BURGER.   

217
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,815
          I MEAN,               
 THEY'VE BEEN HERE FOREVER...   
                 MEDIUM CHOWDER.

218
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,151
THEY'VE ALWAYS DONE SOMETHING   
THAT'S A LITTLE ON THE EDGE.    

219
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:43,421
          ALL RIGHTY,           
  HERE COMES THE JELLY BEANS.   
               THAT'S WHY I KEEP
               COMING BACK HERE.

220
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:45,423
                 EVERYBODY KNOWS
                 WHAT T.J.'S IS.

221
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,626
  <i> SURE, BUT EVEN THE REGULARS</i>  
   <i> ARE STUMPED BY THE NAME.</i>    

222
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,628
DO YOU KNOW WHY IT'S CALLED     
   TRAFFIC JAM AND SNUG?        

223
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,630
           I'VE OFTEN WONDERED  
               ABOUT THAT.      
     GREAT QUESTION.            

224
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,031
  <i> AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING</i>  

225
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,034
   <i> SINCE THE ORIGINAL OWNER</i>    
     <i> OPENED IT UP IN 1965.</i>     

226
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:59,704
    A SNUG REFERS TO A SMALL    
   ICE CREAM PARLOR UP FRONT.   

227
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,839
        ONE OF HIS FRIENDS SAYS,

228
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,841
    "HEY, IF IT GOES OFF RIGHT, 
  THERE'S GONNA BE A TRAFFIC JAM

229
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,844
      OF PEOPLE TRYING TO GET IN
         HERE," AND IT STUCK.   

230
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,846
          SO WE BECAME          
     TRAFFIC JAM AND SNUG.      

231
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,848
      <i> AND FOLKS ARE STILL</i>

   <i> EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH.</i>    

236
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,859
            PROBABLY ONE OF     
      THE MORE REWARDING ASPECTS

237
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,461
           OF HAVING THIS PLACE.

                  WE'RE ALSO

IF YOU CAN EAT THE WHOLE THING,

00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,781
THEY DO HAVE A NAPPING CENTER   
  RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.      

292
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,250
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN

SO, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

            IT'S DIFFERENT, TOO.

305
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,276
ALL RIGHT, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE 
    A GARNISH FOR A SALAD.      

306
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,146
THE GARNISH IS GOING TO BE      
  HOT SAUCE JELLY BEANS.        
                      OKEYDOKEY.

307
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,680
YOU LOOK WORRIED.               
                             NO.

308
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,682
      PRETTY SIMPLE. WE'RE GONNA
         START WITH HOT SAUCE.  

309
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,885
            YOU'RE FROM DETROIT,
              YOU USE FRANK'S.  
AND IF YOU'RE NOT,              
    YOU USE...                  

310
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,887
                 I THINK YOU    
             SHOULD USE FRANK'S.

311
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,889
    OKAY, LET'S ADD SOME HONEY. 
  AS SOON AS YOU GOT THAT GOING,

312
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,491
      YOU'RE GOING TO ADD SIMPLE
          CORNSTARCH MIXTURE.   
A LITTLE SLURRY.                

313
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,093
GETTING TIGHT FAST.             

314
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,495
       IT'S LIKE A FINE LINE    
   BETWEEN SUCCESS AND DISASTER.

315
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,232
OKAY, SO GET A LITTLE OIL       
     ON YOUR SPOON.             

316
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,768
         (Guy) SO IT JUST SLIDES
             RIGHT OFF, OKAY.   
        YEAH,                   
INTO THE LITTLE MOLD.           

317
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,837
         SO THIS WILL COOL DOWN,
           AND THESE WILL FORM. 

318
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,839
AND THEN THEY JUST POP OUT.     
      THEY'RE GREAT.            
             THEY'RE GOOD TO GO.

319
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,841
THEY'RE GOOD TO GO.             
                SO WHERE ARE WE?

320
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:25,043
WE'RE GOING TO GRIND THE SPICES 
   FOR THE PORK LOIN SALAD--    

321
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,045

325
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,387
ADD A COUPLE TABLESPOONS        
     TO THE FLOUR.              

326
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:39,256
SET UP THE ASSEMBLY LINE.       
           WE'LL DREDGE THE PORK
               INTO THE FLOUR,  

327
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,059
          INTO THE EGG WASH,    
     AND THEN OVER TO THE PANKO.
CORRECT.                        

328
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,395

YEAH.                           

329
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,897
A LITTLE BIT OF OIL IN.         
LAY THE PORK LOIN DOWN.         

330
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,999
    GET IT NICE AND GOLDEN BROWN
           ON BOTH SIDES.       
YEP.                            

331
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,001
      AND THEN                  
WE'LL MAKE THE SALAD.           

332
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,003
YOU GET THE PORK DOWN           
 ON THE PLATE FIRST,            

333
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,939
AND THEN WE'LL JUST             
 MIX UP THE SALAD.              

334
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,007

               WATERMELON BALLS.

337
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,014
 ADD STRAWBERRIES, BEAUTIFUL    
RASPBERRIES. ADD BLUEBERRIES.   

338
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:05,884
      ADD OUR DRESSING.         
ALL RIGHT, GIVE IT A NICE MIX.  

339
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:08,152
AND LADLE THAT ON.              

340
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,688
    WE HAVE TO ADD              
OUR FINAL INGREDIENT...         
                            YES.

341
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,758
HOT SAUCE JELLY BEANS.          
               THEY LOOK LIKE   
           LITTLE PLUM TOMATOES.

342
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,027
SO WE'LL JUST PUT THESE         
        AROUND.                 

343
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,962
AND THERE YOU GO--              
 PORK LOIN SALAD.               

344
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,298
                      VERY NICE.

345
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,766
                            MMM.

346
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,868
     GET A LITTLE OF THE GUILTY 
   PLEASURE WITH THE FRIED PORK,

347
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,836
   BUT THEN YOU BACK IT UP WITH 
 A BUNCH OF HEALTHY INGREDIENTS.

348
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,705
        SPROUTS ARE MY FAVORITE.

349
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:30,441
      BUT I THINK THE FREAKY ONE
         OF THE WHOLE THING...  
(laughs)                        

350
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,844
             IS THAT LITTLE GEM.

351
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,846
                     THAT'S HOT.
DEFINITELY GETS HOT.            

352
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,848
  I'M GLAD THAT YOU EXPLAINED IT
   TO PEOPLE BEFORE THEY GET IT,

353
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,850
       BECAUSE I'D SWEAR THAT'S 
      A CHERRY TOMATO, THEN THEY

354
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,852
     WOULD BITE INTO IT, I THINK
    THEY WOULD BE QUITE ALARMED.
(laughs)                        

355
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:42,253

     PORK TENDERLOIN SALAD.     

357
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,790
   THE COMBINATION, I THINK,    
 OF THE BREADED PORK TENDERLOIN 

358
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,125
   AS WELL AS THE FRESH FRUIT   
     MAKES IT JUST UNIQUE.      

359
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,128
  DID YOU TRY                   
THE JELLY BEAN?                 
             I DID. IT WAS GOOD.
                A LITTLE HOT.   

360
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,664
     THE FOOD'S AUTHENTIC.      
    THE PLACE IS AUTHENTIC.     

361
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,200
 I ALWAYS WILL LOVE THIS PLACE  
      AND COME BACK TO IT.      

362
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,202

00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,401
  SO FIRST, WE'RE GONNA MAKE    
THE CURE FOR THIS PORK BELLY--  

408
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,204

   FRESH BAY LEAVES.

00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,209
   WE'RE GONNA BLEND THIS       
IN OUR PSEUDO SPICE GRINDER.    

411
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,211
                   AND YOU DON'T
                    HAVE A LID? 

412
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,213
I DON'T HAVE                    
   A LID.                       

413
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,749
THIS IS GONNA GET COMBINED      
  WITH SOME KOSHER SALT.        

414
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,884
WE'RE GONNA GENEROUSLY          
     COVER THIS.                

415
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,286
     OH, ALL THAT TOASTED FENNEL

416
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,421

          OF THE PORK BUTT HERE.

419
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,694
     NOW WE'RE GONNA MARINATE IT

420
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,229

               WITH THIS.       

426
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,845
 NOW WE'RE JUST                 
GONNA COVER THIS.               

427
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,847
          IT LOOKS LIKE A FREAKY
         SAGE PESTO RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

428
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,849
        NOW THE SHOULDER        
GOES IN THE COOLER FOR TWO DAYS.

429
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,318
SO WE GOT THE PORK BELLY        
   THAT WAS RINSED...           
                           OKAY.

430

CURED FOR TWO DAYS.             

431
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:31,589
WE'RE GONNA SCORE THE SKIN ON A 
DIAGONAL SLIGHTLY INTO THE FAT. 

432
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,591
SO NOW WE'RE GONNA              
 FLIP THIS OVER.                

433
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,593
WE'RE GONNA WRAP THE SHOULDER   
        IN THE BELLY.           
                           OKAY.

434
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,595
 TIE IT UP,                     
AND ROAST IT.                   
                       HOW LONG?

             WITH THE FORK.     

480
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,741
THEY'VE GOT A SPECIAL INGREDIENT
        IN THE MEATBALLS        

481
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,543
   THAT KEEPS ME COMING BACK.   

482
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,812
I AM A MEATBALL-MAKING          
       MACHINE.                 
                  ALL RIGHT,    
               LET'S DO IT THEN.

483
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,814
  WHAT ARE WE                   
STARTING WITH?                  
                 THE FIRST STEP,

484
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,417
     WE MAKE A VEGETABLE SOFRITO
        FOR THE MEATBALL MIX.   
OF COURSE WE DO.                

485
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,352
                SO WE TAKE      
         EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL,

486
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,621
               YELLOW ONION,    
          SOME CHOPPED CELERY...
I LIKE IT.                      

487
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,623
                 KOSHER SALT,   
              SOME BLACK PEPPER,

488
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,625
       CRUSHED RED CHILI FLAKES.
WHOA.                           

489
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,627
    WE'RE IN THE SOUTH NOW, MAN.
      SO THIS GETS COOKED DOWN  

490
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,762
       TILL THE VEGETABLES      
ARE REALLY, REALLY, REALLY SOFT.

491
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:54,164
 AND THIS IS ALL THE SOFRITO    
THAT'S JUST GONNA BE MIXED IN   

492
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,100
AND ADDED WITH THE MEAT.        
                           YEAH.

493
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,102
             SALT-PACKED CAPERS,
                FRESH GARLIC,

00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,304
        AND CALABRIAN CHILIES...
YOU'RE TRYING IT FIRST.         

495
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,573
                       CURRANTS.
CURRENTLY,                      

496
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,708
HOW MANY DID YOU ADD?           

497
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,711
           NOW THE TOMATO SAUCE.
   HOW MUCH LONGER              
IS IT GONNA STAY ON?            

498
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,713
             TWO TO THREE HOURS.
DIG IT.                         

499
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:11,782
              SO WE HAVE        
     ALL THE CAST OF CHARACTERS.

500
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:15,186
THE FIRST STEP, SOAKING HALF    
OF THE BREADCRUMBS IN MILK,     

501
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:17,188
SOME BEATEN EGGS,               
    AND NEXT,                   

502
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,190
SOME OF THE COOLED              
VEGETABLE SOFRITO.              

503
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:20,591
THEN THE SOAKED BREADCRUMBS.    

504
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,793
      LOOK AT ALL THAT MILK THAT
     GOT INCORPORATED INTO THIS.

505
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,795
             SO YOU GET ALL THAT
               EXTRA MOISTURE.  

506
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,864
         YOU'RE NOT JUST RELYING
             ON ALL THE FAT.    
        AND SOME
