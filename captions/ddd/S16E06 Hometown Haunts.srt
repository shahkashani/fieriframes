I'd come back to Olympia        
      for that.

          So, I'm here          
     in Chatham, New Jersey,    

33
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,207
       about 35 miles west      
        of New York City.       

34
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,277
     Now, I've been cooking     
   with Carl Ruiz for years --  

35
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:19,278
          awesome chef.         

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,479
   And I've been telling him,   

37
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:22,281
        "You got to open        
        your own joint."        

38
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:24,149
    Finally, he and his wife    
         took my advice         

39
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:25,751
   and opened their own place.  

40
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,420
     And they were smart --     
    they named it after her.    

41
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,489
         This is Marie's        
      Italian Specialties.      

42
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,760
      This is like sitting      
     in my mother's kitchen.    

43
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:38,297
 The food is like you would get 
 in a little trattoria in Rome. 

44

     On a scale of 1 to 10,     
  I would give this place a 15.

   What makes your              
Italian food different?         

51

      simple Italian food,      

52

   with the best ingredients.

    But there's nothing funny   
 about Marie's Italian chicken. 

60
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,866
Baked and fried chicken         
  at the same time.             

61
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,868
It's like getting punched       
and kicked by a karate ninja.

         that mac and cheese up.

       of cheesy heaven.

  The best macaroni and cheese  
    I've ever had in my life.

What we're gonna do is we're    
just gonna brine this chicken.  

66
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,279
It's a simple salt brine.       

67

       It smells already brined.
What?

 We put water in it,            
 and then just salt.            

71
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,161

00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,297
 So, I stir this up.            

74
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,967
I leave it in the fridge        
 for a couple hours,            

75
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,835

       to go.

00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,373

which is garlic powder,

00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,799
That's hot, so we're just       
gonna take arborio rice.        

235
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,402
   And we're gonna              
   toast it first.              

236
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:00,405
       Okay, so now it's toasted
       up to the color we want. 

237
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:04,142
So, we add one quart            
  of salted water.              

238
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,476
  We don't want it              
to get really mushy.            

239
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,879
Normally, with risotto,         
it's very, very creamy.         

240
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,081
We want it to almost have       
the same texture as rice.       

241
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,417
            Now we're gonna make
              the tomato sauce. 

242
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:17,222
Extra virgin olive oil,         
   pureed garlic.               

243
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,357
And then we're gonna add        
    tomato sauce.               

244
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,560
     Dry basil,                 
 granulated garlic.             

245
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,429
            Copious amount. Wow!

246
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,498
      And just                  
a little bit of salt.           

247
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,367
            This is old-school, 
          leave-it-on-the-stove,

248
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,636
       cook-it-for-awhile sauce.
 Exactly.                       

249
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,704
 And we get it going            
 for about an hour,             

250
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,373
   and then we put              
our raw meatballs in.           

251
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,776
             This has got the --

252
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,177
    Ground beef,                
granulated garlic and basil,    

253
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,913
  parmesan cheese,              
 bread crumbs, salt.            

254
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,049
              So, they'll cook  
              inside the sauce? 

255
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,383
They cook in the sauce.         

256
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,118
Okay, we're gonna make          
     rice balls.                

257
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,519
             Give me a rundown. 

258
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,521
So, we're gonna start           
with our homemade meatballs.    

259
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,390
    The meatballs that we cooked
                in the sauce.   

260
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,825
The parmesan cheese,            
   dried parsley,               

261
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:58,396
 granulated garlic,             
   six large eggs,              

262
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:01,466
shredded mozzarella,            
and seasoned bread crumbs.      

263
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:06,671
 Now we're gonna add            
      the rice.                 

264
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:07,805
We're gonna fluff it up         
    a little bit.               

265
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,275
Then we're gonna add            
      our salt,                 

266
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:14,345
some of the tomato sauce,       
give it a final mix.            

267
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,281
       And now you start to form
                the arancini.   

268
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,083
      Exactly.                  

269
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,686
           Just a little coating
           of some bread crumbs.

270
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,220
               A lot of times,  
             people see arancini

271
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,823
   where they'll put the filling
               in the center,   

272
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,157
        wrap the rice around it.

273
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,361
    This is an all-encompassing,
    every-bite-you're-a-winner. 

274
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,662
   Right. Exactly.              

275
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:32,630
                    350.        

276
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,632
     3½ minutes.                

277
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,433
                      That's it?
  That's it.                    

278
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,135
           [ Whistles ] Some of 
      the homemade tomato sauce.

00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,574
   Dig in.                      
                 Look at that --

280
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:45,377
              nice and tender,  
          cheese coming through.

281
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:49,014
         And I can already hear 
  the crunch just from the fork.

282
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,584
       The texture's outrageous.

283
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,919
          I like the little bit 
       of the meatball in there.

               is outstanding.  

285
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,989
But the crunch on the outside --
       crunchy and then creamy.

    until they pop a little bit.

You're going wild on this.

                Sugar, salt.    

407
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,949
Can we put off to the side      
  and let it cook?              

408
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,619
              We'll let this go 
         for another 20 minutes.

409
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,154
             Let them turn into 
       like a nice smooth sauce.

your sous-chef for this.        

418
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:13,671
          I don't mind it a bit.

419
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,708
  Wow. Nice squash.             

420

           Thank you. [ Laughs ]

421
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,113
                We need that.   

422
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,515
    Did you think               
 I was gonna eat it?            

423

           what you're gonna do!

   we're just gonna chop her up.

426
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,859
       Just scoop out the seeds,
                  chop it.      

427
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,728
              Do a little oil.  
                  Do do do.     

428
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,196
How long's it gonna go?         

429
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,399
              About a half hour 
               at 400 degrees.  

430
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,534
                 Here's our     
          seasoned pork sausage.

431

       We're gonna cook that up.

432
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:45,770
    Break it down               
a little bit more, though.      

433

                    Whoo!

00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,944
        Got green pepper, onion,
                 red pepper.    

435
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,813
         Give that a little mix.

436
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,948
         And then we're gonna do
                 our squash.    

437
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,149
            Just about yea much.

438
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,084
       And a Granny Smith apple.

439
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:01,819
     Love this.                 

440
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,088
      Just let that go for about
          a couple more minutes 

441
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,289
         till it browns up nice.

442
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:09,427
                 We spoon in    
          our cranberry chutney.

443
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:10,694
             Slip on some eggs. 

444
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,629
Ooh, and you got them           
   runny upstairs.              

445
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:13,964
           Our homemade biscuit.

446
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,366
Make biscuits as well?          

447
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,267
               Every morning.   

448
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:23,240
The apple's still got           
 some crunch to it.             

449
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,842
The squash is nutty.            

450
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,915
It's nice to get the acid       
  of the cranberry.             

451
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:34,718
It reminds me of stuffing       
  at Thanksgiving.              

452
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,587
              Yeah, that's what 
              we're going for.  

453

    That's pure.

456
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,195
It's a little sweet,            
   a little spicy.              

457
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,130
    It's delish.

   up your sleeve?

We're hanging out here          
     in Olympia.

Welcome back to Darby's Café    
in Olympia, Washington.         

464
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:14,258
        They're creative.       
          They're fun.          

465
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,059
        Yeah!

00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,260
         They're funky.         

467
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,862
Blueberry roller up!            

468
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:19,263
        It's a tortilla.        

469
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,199
         Bowl of granola        
     and fresh blueberries.     

470
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:23,734
   Tastes healthy even though   
     it's full of ice cream.    

471
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,135
       FIERI:                   
So, what are we making?         

472
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:28,672
          Maple bourbon granola 
for our blueberry crunch roller.

473
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,208
                  Bourbon.      

474
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,475
Did you put enough in?          

475
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,544
          Mine will just have --
              little bit more.  

476
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:36,080
                 Very nice.     
               That'll do her.  

477
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,548

        Oil, real maple syrup --
                real stuff --   

479
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:41,752
            and vanilla extract.

480
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,287
          We're just gonna whisk
               this together.   

481
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,924
    Now we'll ask everybody else
     to come to the party here. 

482
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,293
                We got oats.    

483
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:53,464
         Sliced almonds, pecans,
                  and salt.     

484
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,034
And we're just gonna spread this
               on a sheet pan.  

485
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,302
             Let's get it done. 

486
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,638
    Cook this off               
 in the oven for...?            

487

             About half an hour.

488
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,441
        Okay.                   

489
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,376
 Mmm, that is good.             

490
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,244
            We're gonna roll up 
    the blueberry crunch roller.

491
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,180
 Do it before I eat             
  all the granola.              

492
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,648
       We start with a tortilla.

493
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,916
   We're gonna warm this up just
   a little bit so it's pliable.

494
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:16,721
      Looking good. Cream cheese
         frosting. Blueberries. 

495
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,589
Good-looking blueberries.       

496
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,257
           Yeah, they're great. 
  And our maple bourbon granola.

497
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:23,461
              Let's roll it up. 

498
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:24,996
              Nice, tight roll. 

499
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,665
     Gonna stab it in the middle
       and put it in the fryer, 

500
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,799
               get it crispy.   

501
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,467
     We're gonna                
   deep-fry this?               

502
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,869
        We're gonna deep-fry it.

503
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,205
  Oh, my son Hunter             
  would love this.              

504
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,808
                Have a scoop    
           of vanilla ice cream.

505
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,678
I thought this was a healthy    
joint at Darby's Café.          

506
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,746
              It's got calcium. 

507
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:44,949
 Got a point there.

    Look at this.               

510
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,222
It's like a egg roll            
of the week at Tex Wasabi's.    

511
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:53,357
          Wait, buh-buh-buh-buh!

512
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,360
     We're gonna do a little bit
           more granola on top. 

513
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,562
             A little blueberry,
              a little pow-pow. 

514
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,631
  A little pow-pow.             

515
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:01,799
        All right, get in there.

          Might be a little hot.

  It's gonna burn,              
  burn, burn, burn.

 are so super fresh.

  love this, dude.

     Two blueberry rollers.

           It's totally healthy 
        with the granola, right?
