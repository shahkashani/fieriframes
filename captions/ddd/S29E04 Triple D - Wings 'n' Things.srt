         I'm Guy Fieri,         
    and we're going round two   

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,670
 revisiting some of our favorite
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,373
   This is "Triple D Nation."   

4
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:11,943
         Over the years,        
  I've seen and tasted it all.  

5
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,745
    This is ridiculous, dude.   

6
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,748
        But it turns out,       
  it was only the beginning...  

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,082
         [ Both laugh ]         

8
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:19,151
   ...'cause "Triple D" joints  
     have been blowing up...    

9
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:20,819
       Did you see that?!       

10
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:23,555
     ...and we're going back    
     to see what's cooking.     

11
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,157
      Like on this trip --      

12
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:26,491
     In Post Falls, Idaho...    

13
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:27,892
         Is your mouth watering?

14
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:31,496
 ...an Italian pub slinging pie 
     as legit as the name...    

15
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:34,299
           A name like "Capone,"
                it better be.   

16
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:36,702
     ...a spot in Nashville     
        going hog wild...       

17
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,370
                  Holy hog!     

18
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,438
                Oh, my gosh.    

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,440
   ...opening barbecue joints   
         all over town.         

20
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,043
    And an eclectic eatery...   

21
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:45,910
           Aren't you gonna make
              any for yourself? 

22
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,846
         ...classing up         
          comfort food.         

23
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:51,116
I have to jog back to California
           to lose some of this.

24
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:55,253
    Old friends, new places,    
and more off-the-hook flavors...

25
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,590
     That's all right here,     
right now, on "Triple D Nation."

           road trip.           

28
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:08,534

29
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:10,268
       and we're cruising       
       along Interstate 90      

30
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,604
 going to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, 
      to check out a joint

00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,873

         on "Triple D."         

32
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,843
       And all of a sudden      
    I see this big billboard.   

33
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,144
    I said, "Wait a second!"    

34
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,279
  They've got another location  
         in Post Falls?

00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,280
    I've got to check it out.

45
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:42,901
         so, we decided

     checked this place out,    

53
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,518
        I knew they were        
         the real deal.

       how to cook Italian food,
              and he taught me.

00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,062
                 Guy and I,

       What are we making first?

63
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,271
All right. We're gonna          
make some pizza dough.          

64
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:21,139

Flour, active dry yeast.

 Salt. Brown sugar.             

68
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,614
              You've got a ton

69
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,283
            and you think that's
               gonna be okay?

              TOM:              
  He asked me why we put brown  
  sugar instead of white sugar. 

71
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,955
    We just found that we get   
 a better rise out of our dough.

72
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,757
Adds, like, a little            
  different taste.

00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,027
           -I love it.

     and sundried tomatoes.     

82
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,517
       It's gonna be a good pie,
                  you say.      

83
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,584
           I hope so.           

84
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:07,586
         Name like Capone, it...

85
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,988
        BOTH: Better be.        

86
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,989
           Cut it up.           

87
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,457
    We're gonna top the pizza   
        with the chicken.

         Is your mouth watering?

89

90

                    Mmm!

91
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,398
         And that's great dough.

92
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,333
              It's kind of like 
       putting the icing on top.

106
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,428
       Steam the burger in beer.

107
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,431
        Now, the cheese.        
     This is the super mix?

             Mmm! Dude, that bun
              is off the hook.  

111
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,442
   If you're gonna eat a burger,

          There's no half booth?

174

        What they do have       
     is a multi-national pie

          The salsa is          
        my mom's recipe,        

181
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,241

          It's not for

183
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,313

    our salsa pizza sauce --

     whole-milk mozzarella.

      throw it in the oven.     

186
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:02,253

  We just wanted to come up with
something that nobody else does.

              and a little bit  
                of jalapeño.    

192
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,739
            The last thing to on
 is our fresh ground beef, here.

193

  who better to join the taste  
    test than my son Hunter?

           You say "Taco Pizza,"
              and I'm thinking, 

203
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,965
    "It's either gonna be a taco
   that has a little pizza idea,

              a pizza with a -- 

205
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,369
                just a brief    
              representation."  

206
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,637
               But it is both.  

207
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,972
         That's got it going on,
                right there.    

208
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,173
           I love it.           

209
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,108

       tastes like a taco,      

210
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,044
   but the crust and the bread  
     makes it into a pizza,     

211
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,445
     and a really good pizza    
            at that.            

212
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:04,182
  There's a little zest to it,  
      a little zing to it.      

213
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,184
      If you've ever tried      
         the Taco Pizza,        

214
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:10,121
     you'll come back again     
       for the Taco Pizza.      

215
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,789
        What else should we try?

216
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,859
    Sweet Hot Boneless Wings.   

217
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,793
  -You make the sauce in-house? 
              -Yes.             

218
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,029
     It starts with ketchup,    
         cider vinegar,         

219
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,999

 spicy brown mustard, sriracha. 

220
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,469
        To sweeten it up,       
 we're gonna put honey in there.

221
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:27,138
        These are breasts       
   that have been chopped up.   

222
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,206

         add the sauce.

      Our hot sauce is hot.     

336
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,750
 I made it as hot as I could get
   where it still had flavor,   

337
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,485
   and I thought it was gonna   
     scorch his tongue off.     

338
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,487
              It's not hot yet? 

339
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,522
 Tell me that's hot.            

340
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,160
              That's the mild.  
We need to go get the hot sauce.

341
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,028
          [ Laughter ]          

342
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,497
      My guy put the sauce      
       in the wrong thing.      

343
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,167
    Yeah, it was mild, so...    

344
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,703
             FIERI:             
  But what is hot -- Martin's.  

345
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,571
       This place blew up.      

346
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,439
             MARTIN:            
   We've got six locations --   

347
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,375
       five here in town,       
       one in Louisville.       

348
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,643
   FIERI: And the massive one   
      in downtown Nashville     

349
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:03,581
       can hold up to 500       
     of his closest friends.    

350
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,383
    MARTIN: When we opened up   
       this spot downtown,      

351
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,452
   I needed to put appetizers   
          on the menu.          

352
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,054
     FIERI: So, he turned to    
 his old friend, the whole hog, 

353
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:12,390
    for a new spin on nachos.   

354
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:17,328
             MARTIN:            
    My tortilla chips are cut   
    and fried fresh in-house.   

355
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,999
     Our nacho cheese sauce     
 is cheddar and jack cheese mix,

356
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:24,068
      whole-hog pulled pork     
         on there, slaw,        

357
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,938
  then, my vinegar-based sauce, 
           jalapeños.           

358
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,541
        It's got balance        
     throughout the nachos.     

359
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:32,810
  MAN: When you put pulled pork 
   into a product like nachos,  

360
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,778
         you can't help         
   but come out with a winner.  

361
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,080
   WOMAN: You still get, like,  
         the jalapeños.         

362
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,149
   You got that kick with it,   
      the crunchy coleslaw.     

363
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,952
         I haven't found        
    anything like it before.    

364
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,286
    Oh, my gosh.                

365
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,822
Brother, you have got           
some positions on barbecue      

366
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,824
that I just got to --           
I got to tell you, I respect.   

367
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,426
                 Thank you.     

368
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:51,029
 FIERI: But these days it's not 
    just all about the 'cue.

     game with his family's

          not-so-secret         
     Broccoli Salad recipe.     

371
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,636
 MARTIN: It was my mom's recipe,
    and it has quickly become   

372
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:01,239
   one of our top-three sides   
           we've got.           

373
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,241
          The dressing          
         is real easy --        

374
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:06,310
  mayo, sugar, side of vinegar, 
          mix it up --          

375
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,312
  kind of small-head broccoli,  

376
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,449
      sundried cranberries,     
      green onions, pecans.     

377
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,517
   FIERI: But what makes this   
   a Martin's signature salad?  

378
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,721
   MARTIN: You got some bacon,  
 you got some shredded cheddar. 

379
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,990
    They bring the smokiness,   
just like they do with the meat,

380
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:21,526
   into the broccoli, and you   
 combine that with the bacon -- 

381
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:22,660
         It adds a great        
         deal of flavor.        

382
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,929
   WOMAN #2: It takes broccoli  
       to the next level,       

383
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:28,666
       and throws a little      
      Southern twist in it.     

384
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,201
   MARTIN: What it did for the  
    business -- It was great.   

385
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,404
 But I have never forgotten how 
 much fun we had goofing around.

386
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,139
        I love this guy.

00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:38,142
          [ Laughter ]          

388
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,615
              Wow.              
    Where has this day gone?    

389
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:49,086
  Now, who knew that whole-hog  
   barbecue could be so funny?  

390
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,021
          Coming up...          

391
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:52,223
             That's a lot of ox 
                  in a box.     

392
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,291
       ...a joint in Miami      

393
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:56,093
    putting a whole new spin    
        on motel dining.        

394
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,428
              Mmm!              

395
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,130
  Think they'll rent me a room? 

396
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:03,568
    FIERI: So, back in 2014,    

397
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,103
        about 10 minutes        
 outside of South Beach, Miami, 

398
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:10,108
I found this funky spot cranking
   out high-class comfort food  

399
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,778
     inside of a soon-to-be     
    remodeled Art Deco motel.   

400
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,180
       Now, the building's      
      had a facelift since,     

401
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,383
         but the food's         
        as legit as ever.       

402
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:19,717
      This is Blue Collar.      

403
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:20,718
    Oxtail on 1.                

404
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,589
       Guy was 100% right       
       about Blue Collar.       

405
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,458
     The menu definitely has    
    something for everybody.    

406
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,393
      It's kind of a staple     
      in South Florida now.     

407
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,796
           Oh, my God,          
  that's a good-looking ragout.

          on the show,          

409
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:36,200
        so I had to come        
   and try it out for myself.   

410
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,403
        Ever since then,        
       we've been hooked.       

411
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:40,537
      Danny is the same guy     
     he was four years ago.     

412
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,975
    He's never lost his heart   
    or his passion for food.    

413
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,412
      FIERI: That would be      
       Chef Daniel Serfer,      

414
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,280
    who looked at this place    
          and thought,

     "Braised spicy oxtail?"    

416
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,953
             When I pulled into 
    this parking lot, I thought,

00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:56,553
                    "Mm.

     That probably over there --
    They got good, spicy oxtail.

              any for yourself? 

425
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,371
        It felt good that       
   we were gonna be picked --

    I wanted to do it right,

               awesome oxtail.  

450
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,292
  The day where they're serving 
    the oxtail, people know.    

451
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:11,029
          They want it.         
           They come.           

452
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,964
      FIERI: But something      
     you can find every day?    

453
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,233
           The monster          
         five-meat mess         

454
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:18,302
 of cheesy delicious-ness called
        "The Big Ragout."       

455
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,438
         You look like you could
       have been The Big Ragout.

456
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,240
   The Big Ragout sounds like   
an appropriate kind of nickname.

457
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,642
      Locally made sausage.     

458
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:25,843
           -Pancetta?           
              -Yep.             

459
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,645
          This is some          
         veal shoulder.         

460
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,380
             All kinds of flavor
              down in that pan. 

461
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,515
         -Whole garlic.         
    -That's the way to do it.   

462
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,517

00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,185
                I love where    
               this is going.   

464
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,053
  Now, we're gonna start adding 
    everything else back in.    

465
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,255
            Brisket.            

466
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,389
        -Same thing with        
       the pork shoulder?       
              -Yep.             

467
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,724
               Tell me that's   
             corn-starch slurry.

468
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,392
        -It's just milk.        
            -Really?            

469
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,061
    I learned it from, like,    
     an old Italian person.     

470
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,464
The lactose in the milk is gonna
    help break down the meat,   

471
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,733
     and it's gonna help it     
    pull apart and shred up.    

472
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,936
           I'm gonna go try that
           just because of that.

473
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,672
            And it's got a nice,
         little salty provolone.

474
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,541
       That's ridiculous.       
         -It's way big.         

475
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:58,142
                 How did you    
               think this up?   

476
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:02,480
 The Ragout is something I would
 make for myself and my family. 

477
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:05,282
  We would always eat it, like, 
   on fettuccine or linguine,   

478
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,685
 and the next day, I would make 
      a sandwich like that.

I have to jog back to California
           to lose some of this.

00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,982

we sold out of that sandwich in,

491
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:43,121
     I dropped the ball. So,    
 from then on, I upped the par.

00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,655

 a motel diner, you'd be wrong. 

498
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:00,204
     First, we have to cure     
      the duck with thyme,      

499
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:03,540
          kosher salt,          
     granulated white sugar.    

500
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:07,277
 Take our duck legs and thighs, 
 give them a real good coating. 

501
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,079
  Now, these ducks are gonna go 
      into the refrigerator     

502
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,882
        for 24-36 hours.        

503
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:12,816
  We're gonna cover them in fat 
    and put them into an oven   

504
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,818
         at 300 degrees

     swapping in for salsa?

 SERFER: The jam -- just little 
blueberries, sugar, lemon juice.

509
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,567
The sweetness of the jam kind of

     MAN: I'm a duck lover.

      But what's the hook?      

519
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:51,121
     The key to the Buffalo     
   drumsticks is the marinade,  

520
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,923
        which is yogurt.        

521
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:56,327
   We really just take garlic   
 powder, onion powder, paprika, 

522
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:59,397
  salt, and pepper, and cumin,  
  combine that with the yogurt, 

523
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,600
     let the drumsticks sit     
       for 18 or so hours.      

524
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:03,934
       And then, drop them      
          in the fryer,         

525
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:07,938
    and then, just toss them    
    in hot sauce and butter.

527
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,076

        spiced correctly.       

528
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,143
         They're crisp.         

529
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,479
   it's not overwhelming hot,   
           the sauce.           

530
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,214
       It's just perfect.       
    I could eat them all day.   

531
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,683
MAN #2: They're really enormous,
       and they're covered      

532
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,951

     and some blue cheese --
