00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,491
        YOU'RE GONNA FILL IT UP.
   LOOK AT THAT.                
MAY EAT IT THAT WAY.            

98
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,626
                  TOP CRUST ON, 
                 TRIM THE EDGES.
MAKE IT PRETTY.                 

99
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,896
      FOLD THE EDGES UNDER      
 AND SEAL THEM DOWN WITH A FORK.

100
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:54,098
SCORE THE TOP SO IT DOESN'T     
      BUBBLE ON YOU.            
               JUST A LITTLE BIT
              OF EGG WHITE WASH.

101
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:55,834
    BROWNS THE EDGES            
AND BROWNS THE TOP NICE.        
                      THAT'S IT.

102
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:58,503
SO YOU THROW IT                 
  IN THE OVEN.                  
               ABOUT 20 MINUTES,
                 GOLDEN BROWN.  

103
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,772
         OKAY, LET'S ROLL. MMM. 

104
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,774
                GET OUTTA HERE. 
              THAT'S REMARKABLE.

105
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,776
       THAT'S GOT SOME REAL     
   DEPTH AND SOME GREAT FLAVOR. 

106
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,978
               ALL THE ESSENCE  
            OF DUCK CONFIT. MMM.

107
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,781
 THE RICHNESS, BUT THEN YOU GET 
THAT LITTLE TOUCH OF FIVE SPICE.

108
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,517
     NICE LITTLE SNAP OUT OF    
THE PEAS. THE CRUST IS ON POINT,

109
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:16,455
  AND THAT'S FOUR BITES, AND I  
 HAVEN'T EVEN MADE A DENT IN IT.

110
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,589
           THIS IS OFF THE HOOK.
                PRIME TIME.     

111
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,858
                   DUCK POT PIE.
    ALWAYS FLAKY AND CRISPY.    

112
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,261
 IT'S VERY RICH IN FLAVORS. YOU 
CAN TASTE THE FRESH INGREDIENTS.

113
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,730
     IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE.      
                 FLATBREAD PIZZA
                   OF THE DAY.  

114
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,600
EVERYTHING ON THE MENU IS GREAT.
          YOUR CHOCOLATE BROWNIE
                A LA MODE.      

115
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,602
 IT'S JUST REALLY FUN. SOMETIMES
    WE COME REAL LATE NIGHT.    

116
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,803
       COMING FROM              
THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS,        

117
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,805
IT IS TERRIBLY IMPOSSIBLE       
    TO EAT PAST 9:00,           

118
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,807
AND SO THE GOAL WAS ALWAYS      
      TO BE OPEN LATE           

119
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,543
      AND SERVE                 
REALLY GOOD FOOD LATE.          
        CHICKEN TENDERS         
          CORDON BLEU.          

120
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,011
     THE OWNERS HERE UNDERSTAND 

121
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:42,814
          WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

PERFECT PLACE TO GO SIT DOWN,   

122
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,883
RELAX, AND ENJOY A WELL-THOUGHT-
  OUT COOKED-TO-PREPARED MEAL.  

123

 MELTED CHEESE WITH A LITTLE BIT
OF TRUFFLE, JUST DRIVES IT HOME.

125

   IT'S A MIXTURE OF FLYING FISH
       BEER AND GOODNESS.       

126
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,895
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE            
THE FLYING FISH SAUCE           

127
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:59,498

129
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,101
LITTLE BIT OF OIL, MIREPOIX,    
  GARLIC, SALT, AND PEPPER.     

130
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,504
   CARAMELIZE THIS UNTIL        
EVERYTHING'S NICE AND BROWN.    
       THEN WE POUR IN THE BEER.

131
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,640
THE BOURBON PORTER.             
              DO THEY REALLY PUT
                BOURBON IN IT?  

132
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,776
           THEY DO.             
WE'LL LET THAT REDUCE BY HALF.  
              NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

133
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:13,311
VEAL STOCK, POUR THAT IN.       
        YOU MAKE THE VEAL STOCK?

134
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,646
WE DO.                          
               OF COURSE YOU DO.

135

AND MORE SALT AND PEPPER.       

136
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,650
WE REDUCE THIS BY HALF AGAIN.   

137
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,852
STRAIN IT INTO A FRESH, CLEAN   
POT SO WE CAN FINISH IT OFF.    
                     IT'S CRAZY.

138
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,054
       IT'S ONE SAUCE FOR       
A TRUFFLED CHEESESTEAK EMPANADA.

139
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,458
         DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
                WHAT ELSE?      
   DIJON MUSTARD,               
WHOLE GRAIN MUSTARD,            

140
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,393

                            AND?

141
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,728
CARAMEL.                        
          CARAMEL THAT YOU MAKE?

142
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,062
YEP.                            
                OF COURSE.      
          I'M GONNA QUIT ASKING.

143
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,732
THAT'S IT. BRING IT TO A BOIL.  
TIGHTEN IT UP WITH FLOUR WATER. 

144
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,867
   SIMMER IT JUST TILL          
THAT FLOUR'S COOKED OUT.        

145
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:38,537
15-20 MINUTES,                  
AND WE'RE DONE.

        WOW, MEGA THINLY SLICED.

         AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT
          IN CHEESESTEAK STYLE? 

149
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,545
    OH, YEAH. JUST TILL         
THE MEAT'S COOKED THROUGH,      

150
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,947
TAKE IT OFF THE GRILL,          
     LET IT COOL.               

151
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,684
   THE NEXT STEP, SEASON IT WITH
     THE TRUFFLE OIL ALL OVER.  
     NOW IN WITH                
AGED NEW YORK CHEDDAR.          

152
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,619
                         MM-HMM.
FLUFF IT TOGETHER.              

153
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,622
    DEFINITELY SMELL THAT       
TRUFFLE OIL RIGHT OFF THE BAT.  
   NOW WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA MAKE
           OUR EMPANADAS.       

154
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,892
 CUT THE DOUGH FOR THE EMPANADA 
     DOWN TO THE MOLD SIZE.     

155
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,027
         WE USE A PIEROGI PRESS.
          STICK THAT IN THERE.  

156
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,831
             PUT OUR FILLING IN.
LITTLE WASH TO SEAL IT,         
     SLAM IT SHUT.              

157
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,966
        GIVE IT A TIGHT SQUEEZE.
AND THEN IT'S READY TO ROCK.    

158
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,768
NOW YOU'RE NOT FREEZING THESE   
        AHEAD OF TIME?

         THEY'RE MADE EVERY DAY.

159
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,371
   SO YOU BUST THESE OUT,       
DUST IT WITH A LITTLE FLOUR.    

160
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,575
      THEN WE GO TO THE FRYER.  
   HOW LONG DO THEY GO DOWN FOR?
    THREE, FOUR MINUTES.        
PULL THOSE OUT OF THE FRYER.    

161
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,643
                SERVE THIS

LOVES THE TRUFFLE,              

167
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,188

  IT'S JUST LIKE NOTHING ELSE.  
          FIRE ON THE PORK CHOPS
                RIGHT NOW.      

196
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,925
       IT'S COMFORT FOOD.       

197
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,594
  <i> THE WAY OWNER CELESTE SHAW</i>   
      <i> REMEMBERS THEM...</i>        
   VEGGIES ARE LOOKING GOOD.    

198
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,529
        <i> FROM GROWING UP</i>        
   <i> ON HER GRANDPARENTS' FARM.</i>  

199
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,932
I WANTED TO RECREATE WHAT       
MY LIFE WAS LIKE WITH THEM      

200
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:47,999
FOR OTHER PEOPLE.               

201
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,735
 <i> SO SHE OPENED THIS JOINT...</i>   
I THOUGHT, I CAN DO THIS.       

202
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,671
       <i> WITH A LITTLE HELP</i>      
         <i> FROM GRANDMA.</i>         

203
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,472
                   LOOK AT THIS.
DON'T I LIKE NORWEGIAN?         

204
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,208
            HOW AWESOME IS THIS?
    THESE WERE SOME OF          
MY GRANDMA SELMA'S RECIPES.     

205
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,745
<i>LIKE GRANDMA'S BAKED OATMEAL...</i> 
LIKE NO OTHER OATMEAL           
  YOU'VE EVER HAD.              

206
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,481
     <i> AND A FARMHOUSE TWIST</i>     
        <i> ON FRENCH TOAST.</i>       

207
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,816
         IT DOESN'T LOOK        
       LIKE FRENCH TOAST.       

208
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,552
      IT'S NOT LIKE TOAST,      
 NOT LIKE BREAD. IT'S LIKE CAKE.

209
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,754
     WITH BLUEBERRY-FLAVORED    
 SWEETENED CREAM CHEESE ON TOP. 

210
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,023
            SO THIS IS FROM     
      YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S RECIPE?
THAT'S CORRECT.                 

211
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:15,426
BLUEBERRY MUFFIN                
  FRENCH TOAST.                 
           I ASSUME WE'RE MAKING
             BLUEBERRY MUFFINS? 

212
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:16,895
     WE ARE MAKING              
BLUEBERRY MUFFIN BREAD.         

213
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,697
SO BUTTER.                      
       WE'RE CREAMING THE BUTTER
               RIGHT NOW.       

214
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,766
WE CREAM THE BUTTER             
  AND THE SUGAR,                

215
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:24,435
HEALTHY AMOUNT OF SUGAR.        
      FRESH EGGS.               
               OH, LOOK AT THAT.

216
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,836
LITTLE BIT OF VANILLA.          
                           OKAY.

217
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,838
KOSHER SALT.                    
     AND THEN A LEAVENING AGENT.

218
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,908
YES, BAKING POWDER.             
   BLUEBERRIES.                 
                 YOU'RE KILLING 
                THE BLUEBERRIES.

219
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:33,511
NO, THE BLUEBERRIES ARE FINE.   
          SO THERE'S GONNA BE   
      NO CHUNK-AGE OF BLUEBERRY?

220
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,714
YOU'LL STILL SEE THAT LATER.    
       AND THE FLOUR.           
                           A.P.?

221
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,649
YES.                            
                 YOU'RE CRUSHING
                  THE BLUEBERRY.

222
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,584
THEY DON'T GET CRUSHED.         
                  YOU CAN DO IT.

223
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,119
I CAN DO IT.                    
              A LITTLE AQUA NET.

224
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,721
DON'T WANT YOUR BREAD           
     TO STICK.                  
         SO WE'LL GO TO THE PAN.
                 THAT IT?       

225
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,790
I THINK WE'RE GOOD.             
          WANT TO LICK THE BOWL?
              IT'S GOOD, HUH?   

226
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,459
            WE'RE GONNA THROW IT
           IN THE OVEN HOW LONG?
ABOUT AN HOUR.                  

227
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,995
   SO THE BLUEBERRY MUFFIN BREAD
            IS COOKING.         

228
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,731
          NOW WHAT ARE WE ON TO?
    THE EGG WASH                
FOR THE FRENCH TOAST.           

229
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,599
           GO AHEAD, FIRE IT UP.
OKAY. WHOLE EGGS.               

230
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,800
                           OKAY.
A LITTLE WATER.                 

231
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,735
  JUST MIX IT UP                
LIKE A SIMPLE WASH.             

232
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,738
WE JUST PUT IT ASIDE.           
   NEXT, SUGAR AND CREAM CHEESE.

233
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:04,009
WE MAKE A FROSTING THAT GOES ON 
 THE TOP OF THE FRENCH TOAST.   
                           COOL.

234
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:08,012
IT'S CREAM CHEESE,              
   MORE SUGAR.                  
              18 POUNDS OF SUGAR
                    IN THERE.   

235
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,482
BLUEBERRIES.                    
       NOW YOU'RE REALLY KILLING
            THE BLUEBERRIES.    

236
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:12,083
NOW WE'RE GONNA KILL 'EM.       

237
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,418
  WE'RE GONNA HAVE              
PURE PURPLE FROSTING.           
                THAT LOOKS GOOD.

238
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:16,687
I KNOW.                         
                       NOW WHAT?

239
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,689
WE'LL GET THE FRENCH TOAST OUT  
       AND DRESS IT UP.         
             SO IT'S COOLED DOWN
                A LITTLE BIT.   

240
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,626
       NOW WE'RE GONNA SLICE IT?
SLICE IT AND GET IT             
 READY TO GRILL.                

241
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,095
              WOW, YOU'RE MAKING
                HONKING CHUNKS. 
YEAH.                           

242
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,364
HONKING CHUNKS IS A SCANDINAVIAN
      WORD FOR LARGE PIECE.     
(laughs)                        

243
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,898
  THINK IT'S GONNA COME UNDONE? 

244
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,701
              DID YOU HIT IT    
           WITH ENOUGH AQUA NET?

245
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:30,835
             WOW, LOOK AT THAT. 

246
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,704
           YOU DIDN'T BEAT      
    THE BLUEBERRIES UP THAT BAD.

247
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,706
 LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT THING.
           ALL RIGHT.           

248
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,375
            NO CINNAMON, NO NADA
                 IN THERE.      
NOTHING, JUST THE REGULAR       
        EGG WASH.               

249
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:38,709
                    MORE BUTTER?
CLARIFIED BUTTER.               

250
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,444
PUT THE BACON ON.               
                     TWO PIECES?

251
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:43,448
     WHO ARE YOU TRYING TO TEASE
              WITH THAT?        
IT'S A BIG PIECE                
OF FRENCH TOAST.                

252
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,049
                             OH!
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL?           

253
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,785
   IT IS BEAUTIFUL. ARE WE READY
    FOR THE WHOLE PACKAGE DEAL? 
WE ARE.                         

254
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:50,988
NOW WHAT HAPPENS?               
    WE'RE GONNA PUT THE FROSTING
        ON THE FRENCH TOAST.    

255
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:55,527
OKAY. HOW DO YOU ATTACK THIS?   
                    FORK, FROST,
                     BREAK INTO.

256
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,729
            SYRUP NOT REQUIRED. 

257
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,598
    MMM. SUPER MOIST,           
WARM ALL THE WAY THROUGH,       

258
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:01,733
TRUE BLUEBERRY FLAVOR.          

259
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:04,402
YOU GET A LITTLE BIT OF THE ACID
     FROM THE CREAM CHEESE.     

260
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:05,470
IT'S NOT OVERLY SWEET.          

261
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,672
AND JUST LOOK AT HOW MOIST      
   YET CRUMBLY THAT IS.         

262
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,674
I MEAN, THIS IS OVER-THE-TOP,   
        REALLY NICE.            

263
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,476
 I'VE HAD A LOT                 
OF FRENCH TOAST,                

264
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,478
       NEVER HAD IT             
WITH BLUEBERRY MUFFIN CAKE.     

265
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,680
 MY KIDS WOULD--MATTER OF FACT, 
   MY KIDS ARE GONNA SEE THIS.  

266
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:18,082
I'M GONNA BE MAKING THIS        
       ON SUNDAY.               
                BLUEBERRY MUFFIN
                  FRENCH TOAST. 

267
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:21,753
      IT'S JUST WONDERFUL.      
(man) ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.     
    I LOVE THIS STUFF.          

268
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,688
 I FEEL LIKE I'M EATING DESSERT,
       BUT IT'S BREAKFAST.      

269
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,690
      JUST AMAZING FRENCH TOAST.
       HOW LONG                 
YOU BEEN COMING HERE?           

270
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,359
 SINCE RIGHT AFTER IT WAS MOVED 
       ACROSS THE FREEWAY       

271
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,228
                 AND OPENED UP. 

272
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,963
          THIS IS THE OLD HOUSE?
THIS IS THE ORIGINAL HOUSE      
 THAT I BOUGHT AND MOVED.       

273
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,699
 IT WAS THAT PORTION THAT       
WAS BROUGHT OVER, CORRECT?      
                 THAT'S CORRECT.

274
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:38,436
IS THIS WHAT YOU THOUGHT        
 IT WAS GONNA TURN INTO?        
           I DIDN'T REALIZE     
       WE WOULD END UP THIS BIG.

275
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,905
          HOW ARE YOU?          
  BUT I KNEW IT WOULD BE A PLACE
  THAT PEOPLE WOULD EXPERIENCE  

276
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,775
       THE KIND OF COMFORT      
 YOU'D ONLY HAVE IN A FARMHOUSE.

277
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:46,511
   <i> LIKE BEEF STROGANOFF...</i>     
        WONDERFUL, HUGE SERVING.

278
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,513
       I ALWAYS HAVE TO SHARE IT
             WITH SOMEONE.      

279
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,582
    <i> CHICKEN FRIED STEAK...</i>     
           ORDER UP.

       <i> STUFFED PORK CHOP.</i>      

281

WE CUT OUR OWN PORK...          
                           OKAY.

282
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,655
AND WE ORDER IT FRESH           
     EVERY DAY.                 
     (man) IT'S DELICIOUS,      

283
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:59,123
      SINGED ON THE OUTSIDE     
 BUT REALLY JUICY IN THE MIDDLE.

284
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:02,460
        IT'S JUST FILLED        
  WITH MELTY GOODNESS INSIDE.   
                WE'RE GONNA MAKE
                   A DRY RUB.   

285

287
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,466

WE'RE GONNA USE                 
THE HOUSE SPICE,                

291
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,474
 MAKE THE FILLING               
FOR THE PORK CHOP.              
                        RICOTTA.

292
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,943
GOAT CHEESE.                    
                      PINE NUTS.

293
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,345
HOUSE SEASONING.                
                SOME SUN-DRIEDS.
                  INTERESTING.  

294
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,947
      SO NOW WE GOT THIS READY. 
     CUT THE CHOP, DO THE STUFF.
LET'S DO IT.                    

295
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,617
       HOLY HOG. WHAT SUPER PIG 
        DID YOU GET THAT FROM?  

296
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,552
                 THAT LOOKS LIKE
                 A 900-POUNDER. 

297
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,621
    EVERY DAY WE GET            
AN ENTIRE LOIN LIKE THIS        

298
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,689
TO DO PORK CHOPS FOR DINNER.    
          BONELESS, THOUGH, HUH?

299
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,958
BONELESS. WELL--                
                  THE BONE-IN   
               IS THE FLAVOR-IN.

300
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,494
NO, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS.     
         IT'S GOOD-LOOKING MEAT.

301
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:37,629
                  LITTLE POCKET.
LITTLE POCKET.                  

302
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,031
       NOT TOO DEEP, DON'T WANT 
       TO POKE THROUGH, GOT IT. 

303
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,034
I'M GONNA FILL IT UP.           
  WE'RE READY TO GO.            
        AND THEN YOU JUST HIT IT
         WITH A LITTLE SPRINKLE 

304
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,034
              OF THE HOUSE RUB. 

305
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:46,104
         SO WE'LL GO TO THE PAN.
IT'S READY FOR THE SAUTé.       

306
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,372
        CLARIFIED BUTTER, I BET.
       CLARIFIED BUTTER.        
WE'RE GONNA SEAR THE PORK CHOP. 

307
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,376
     THERE YOU GO. SO WE'LL JUST
        MARK IT ON BOTH SIDES.  
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA ADD        
    OUR WHITE WINE.             

308
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,178
         FINISH IT IN THE OVEN  
      AT ABOUT 250 FOR HOW LONG?
ABOUT 9 MINUTES.                

309
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,914
     SO WE LET THAT GO. WHAT ARE
      WE GONNA SERVE THIS WITH? 
THE SWEET POTATOES.             

310
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,849
          THE SWEET POTATOES    
       AND A LITTLE BROWN SUGAR 

311
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,386
      AND ALSO SOME MORE BUTTER.
VEGGIES ARE DONE.               

312
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,655
                      PORK CHOP.
RIGHT OUT OF THE OVEN.          

313
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,456
     ALL RIGHT,                 
NICE COLORFUL PLATE.            

314
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,791
  LOOK AT THAT,                 
PERFECTLY COOKED.               

315
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,727
MMM. NICE LITTLE CRUST          
   TO THE PORK CHOP             

316
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,795
AND ALL THAT JUICE.             

317
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,797
      TELL YOU WHAT,            
IT'S NOT LACKING IN FLAVOR.     

318
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,799
YOU GET A GOOD AMOUNT OF SALT   
          AND TANG              

319
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,801
BETWEEN THE RICOTTA             
AND THE GOAT CHEESE             

320
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,803
AND THEN, OF COURSE,            
THE SUN-DRIED TOMATO.           

321
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,339
THE KEY IS THAT THE PORK CHOP   
    IS COOKED PERFECTLY.        

322
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,607
THAT IS THE ABSOLUTE KEY.

325
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,613
   THAT'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF  
 A STUFFED FARMHOUSE PORK CHOP. 

326
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:29,814

  GOOD TIMES AND ITS BAD TIMES, 

346
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,729
     BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

347
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,697

       A LOCAL BUSINESSMAN      

348
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,300

  <i> WANTED TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.</i>  

354
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,913
     I WAS REALLY CONCERNED     
      THAT THE DEVELOPMENT      

355
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,581
  ON THE WATERFRONT WOULD PUSH  
     A PLACE LIKE THIS OUT.

OKAY, SO WHAT ARE WE MAKING?

00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:09,547

                    JUST LEMONS.
AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA    
    SUBMERGE THEM INTO?         

371
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,484
                            YEP.
SEE YOU IN THE SANDWICH.

00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:14,752

00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,754

PULL 'EM OUT, COOL 'EM DOWN.

           CUT THE TAIL IN HALF 

378
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,833
         AND REMOVE THE MEAT    
    FROM THE TAIL AND THE CLAWS.
  SO THIS WILL

385
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,982
          THEN WE ADD SOME MILK.
MILK AT ROOM TEMPERATURE        
   TO GIVE THE YEAST            

386
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,783
A LITTLE EXTRA KICK.            
            ADD SOME A.P. FLOUR,

387
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:48,920
   A LITTLE BIT OF SALT, SUGAR, 
   AND THEN WE GOT SOME BUTTER. 

388
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,922
AND THEN IT'S MIX?              
        AND THEN IT'S MIX TIME--
          FIVE TO TEN MINUTES.  

389
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,123
  OKAY, SO IT HANGS OUT         
FOR A DAY IN THE WALK-IN.       

390
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:55,926
NOW WE'RE GONNA                 
BREAK IT DOWN.                  
            TOSS A LITTLE FLOUR,
            CUT IT RIGHT IN HALF

391
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,929
   INTO TWO LOAVES, PUSH IT OUT 
        A LITTLE BIT HERE.      

392
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:01,199
         YOU'RE GONNA ROLL IT UP
          IN A NICE TIGHT LOAF. 
YOU GONNA GREASE                
   THOSE PANS?                  

393
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,067
  NO. THE BUTTER THAT'S ALREADY 
  IN THE DOUGH, THEY DON'T SEEM 

394
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,471
         TO STICK WHATSOEVER    
    SO IT WORKS OUT PRETTY GOOD.
   SO THAT'S IT.                
GO IN THE PROOFER?              

395
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,139
                        EXACTLY.
OKAY. ONCE IT PROOFS,           
 IT'LL HIT THE OVEN,            

396
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,742
 EGG WASH RIGHT AT THE VERY END,
      GIVES IT A NICE COLOR.    
GOT IT. NOW AIOLI.              

397
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,344
   THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA USE 
        TO MIX THE LOBSTER      

398
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,545
  TO MAKE THE LOBSTER SANDWICH. 

399
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,014
WITH SOME ANCHOVY.              
              WITH SOME ANCHOVY.

400
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:18,549
I'M IMPRESSED.                  
               WE GOT EGG YOLKS,
                 FRESH GARLIC,  

401
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,685
       A LITTLE WORCESTERSHIRE, 
        TABASCO, SALT, PEPPER,  

402
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,820
                  OUR ANCHOVIES.
LEMON JUICE--MY MOUTH'S         
  STARTING TO WATER.            

403
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:25,556
            A LITTLE DIJON HERE.
A LITTLE EMULSIFYING AGENT,     
   AND THEN THE DRIZZLE.        

404
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,492
             DRIZZLE OF THE OIL.
OLIVE OIL?                      

405
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,093
           THIS IS A MIX--90/10.
A BLEND. YEP.                   

406
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,296
 YOU CAN HEAR IT KIND OF        
SLOW DOWN AND THICKEN UP.       

407
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,630
MMM. THAT'S SO RICH             
    AND CREAMY.                 

408
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,366
IT ALMOST TASTES LIKE BUTTER.   
   LET'S MAKE A SANDWICH.       
                      WE SHOULD.

409
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,769
THIS IS THE BRIOCHE.            
  NICE CRUST ON IT.             

410
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:38,903
LET IT REST A LITTLE BIT,       
   THEN SLICE INTO IT.          

411
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,005
THROW 'EM ON THE FLATTOP?       
       THROW 'EM ON THE FLATTOP,

412
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,907
              GRILL 'EM WITH    
         A LITTLE BIT OF BUTTER.
AWESOME.                        

413
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:46,110
    AND TOSS THIS AIOLI RIGHT IN
          WITH THE LOBSTER.     
VERY LITTLE AIOLI.              

414
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,779
 THIS IS NICELY BROWNED. I KNOW 
    WHY YOU NEED THE BRIOCHE.   

415
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,248
YOU'RE PUTTING, LIKE, A 15-POUND
     LOBSTER ON THAT THING.     

416
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,649
LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT.       
             I WANT TO MAKE SURE
               YOU GET ENOUGH.  

417
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,651
  THAT'S A PRETTY FAT SANDWICH. 
   LOOK AT THAT--PRETTY THICK.  

418
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,387
MMM. I'M A BREAD JUNKIE.        

419
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,855
SO RIGHT OFF THE BAT,           
     I'M A FAN.                 

420
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:58,856
   THE BUTTERINESS              
OF THE LOBSTER--MMM.            

421
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,725
I WOULDN'T CALL IT              
  INTENSE FLAVOR,               

422
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,727
       BUT THE AIOLI            
JUST REALLY ACCENTUATES IT,     

423
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,729
AND THAT'S A LOT OF LOBSTER     
         IN THERE.              

424
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:06,731
       THE TOASTED BREAD,       
CREAMY LOBSTER, THE AIOLI PLUS--

425
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,665
           DUDE, A LOT          
OF LOBSTER SANDWICHES OUT THERE,

426
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:11,335
         BUT THIS ONE           
HAS ITS OWN IDENTITY. I DIG IT. 

427
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:12,737
        LOBSTER SANDWICH        
           ON BRIOCHE.          

428
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:15,406
    IT'S DELICIOUS. IT'S GOT    
   A NICE LEMONY FLAVOR TO IT.  

429
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:16,874
        IT'S FALLING OUT        
        OF THE SANDWICH,        

430
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,610
  THEY PUT SO MUCH IN THERE--   
    DEFINITELY REALLY FRESH.    
      <i> AND FOR THESE GUYS,</i>      

431
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,814
<i>THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO ROLL...</i>  
     I GOT A FRIED SCALLOP      
           COMING UP.           

432
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,816
  WE JUST TRY AND KEEP IT LOCAL 
       AS MUCH AS WE CAN.       

433
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:27,217
    VERY LOCAL--DIRECTLY FROM   
         THE FISHERMAN.         

434
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,553
    YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T GET    
     ANY FRESHER THAN THAT.     
        <i> FROM HADDOCK...</i>        

435
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:32,556
THEY MADE A NICE AND LIGHT      
    HADDOCK SANDWICH.           
       <i> TO SQUID...</i>             

436
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,492
(whistles) SQUID COMES IN       
   FRESH IN THIS AREA?          
                            YEP.

437
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,962
         <i> FOR THE FRESH</i>         
       <i> GINGER CALAMARI.</i>        
NICE COMBO. YOU WOULDN'T THINK  
   TO PUT THOSE TWO TOGETHER.   

438
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,631
         <i> BUT HE DID.</i>           
       FRIED GINGER SQUID       
         IN THE WINDOW.         

439
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,032
     DIG THIS. OKAY.            
SO WHAT'S THE BREAKDOWN?        

440
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,435
   FIRST THING WE START DOING,  
 WE CUT THE TENTACLE RIGHT HERE,

441
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:45,770
       PULL THIS WHOLE MEMBRANE 
              RIGHT OUT.        

442
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,239
   THE ONLY THING YOU GOTTA PULL
      OUT HERE IS A BIG PIECE   

443
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:51,308
                OF CARTILAGE    
           THAT THEY CALL A PEN.
  THAT'S ALL HE HAD             
HOLDING HIM TOGETHER.           

444
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,644
     THAT'S ALL HE'S GOT HOLDING
     HIM TOGETHER. WE'LL CUT IT.
FRESH CALAMARI.                 

445
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,779
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT TENDER?  
    YOU CANNOT BEAT THIS.       
                       CALAMARI.

446
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,849
   ONCE IT'S CUT UP, WE SOAK IT 
   OVERNIGHT IN THE BUTTERMILK, 

447
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,584
  AND THEN EACH ORDER WILL GET  
TOSSED IN A DRIED GINGER DREDGE.

448
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:01,919
         THE DREDGE IS SIMPLE-- 
         JUST ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR,

449
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,054
  POWDERED GINGER, PEPPER, SALT.
      TOSS THAT ALL TOGETHER.   

450
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,724
            TOSS THIS IN A BOWL.
I CAN SMELL THAT GINGER         
  RIGHT OFF THE BAT.            

451
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,926
    YEAH, THE SWEETNESS BETWEEN 
   THE BUTTERMILK AND THE GINGER

452
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,463
         REALLY SEEMS TO GIVE IT
              A GOOD FLAVOR.    
WE'LL DROP THIS                 
 IN THE FRYER.                  

453
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,798
                            YEP.
350. THAT'S A MONSTER PORTION.  

454
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,534
              THAT LEMON AIOLI  
           THAT WE MADE EARLIER.
I LIKE IT.                      

455
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,869
     A LITTLE BIT OF FRESH LEMON
               ON TOP.          
YOU SQUEEZE IT YOURSELF         
ON THERE AHEAD OF TIME          

456
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:21,338
BEFORE IT GOES OUT              
  TO THE GUESTS?                
                            YEP.

457
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,606
I'M A FAN OF THAT.              

458
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,809
     SERVE IT TO THE GUESTS     
THE WAY YOU WANT THEM TO EAT IT.

459
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:27,078
I MEAN, THE CALAMARI HAS ITS OWN
  FLAVOR RIGHT FROM THE GET-GO. 

460
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,747
A LITTLE BITE OF THE BUTTERMILK,
  A LITTLE HINT OF THE GINGER.  

461
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,482
TALK ABOUT CALAMARI             
   BEING TENDER.                

462
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,418
THIS HAS CHEW TO IT,            
  BUT IT'S TENDER.              

463
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:34,885
    THAT'S GOTTA                
BE FROM BEING FRESH.            

464
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,887
 YOU FIND CALAMARI THAT IS THAT 
   FRESH, HAND-BATTERED SERVED  

465
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,623
WITH JUST A LITTLE BIT OF AIOLI,
    A SQUEEZE OF SOME LEMON--   

466
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,625
  THAT'S GREAT STUFF.           
THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT.        
                    THANKS, MAN.

467

CALAMARI--WHAT DO YOU THINK?    

468
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:46,297
      IT HAS A KICK TO IT.      
             THE GINGER FLAVOR  
           REALLY SETS IT APART.

469
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,698

   LOBSTERMEN, THERE ARE LAWYERS

485
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,537
          SITTING SIDE BY SIDE. 

486
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,739
   BREAKFAST IN THE SUMMER ON   
 THE DECK WHEN IT'S A NICE DAY. 

487
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,541
        NOTHING BETTER.         
              BLUEBERRY PANCAKE.

488
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,543
   THE PANCAKES ARE AWESOME--   
       CLASSIC MAINE DISH.      

489
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:33,811
    FLIPPING THE HASH, GUYS.    

490
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,546
HOW'S THE HASH?                 
    THE HASH IS OUTSTANDING.    

491
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,149
     <i> WITH CHEF PAUL DYER'S</i>

          HASH IS UP.           

492
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,484
   <i> HE'S NOT BRINING HIS BEEF.</i>  
        <i> HE'S BOILING IT.</i>       

493
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,620
      IT'S BRISKET SIMMERED     
      PERFECTLY--FABULOUS.      

494
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,022
    WHAT'S THIS                 
GOING TOGETHER FOR?             
                 OUR HASH       
          FOR OUR HASH AND EGGS.

495
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:48,493
SO GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN.         
      WE'LL TOSS IN OUR MIREPOIX
     WITH ONIONS, THE CARROTS...

496
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:49,826
AND THE CELERY?                 
                     AND CELERY.

497
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,428
FANTASTIC.                      
                BRISKET GOES IN.

498
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,898
WHERE DID THIS RECIPE           
     COME FROM?                 
           A LITTLE BIT OF THIS,
           A LITTLE BIT OF THAT.

499
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,766
SO THIS IS JUST à LA PAUL?      
                      à LA PAUL.

500
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,702
à LA PAUL. YOU'RE JUST GONNA    
  SIMMER WITH THE MIREPOIX      

501
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,570
THREE TO FOUR HOURS.            
             THREE TO FOUR--YEP.

502
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,639
   I WANT TO SEE                
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN             

503
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,374
WITH THIS SIMMER MIREPOIX.      
                 WE'LL FIND OUT.

504
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:05,042
SO WE STRAIN THE BRISKET        
   FROM THE VEGGIES.            
                            YEP.

505
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,778
            NOW SHE'S GONNA HEAD
           INTO THE FLOOR MIXER.
AND LOOK AT ALL THE FAT         
 THAT'S STILL ON THAT.          

506
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,648
THAT'S GOING IN THIS MIX.       
              MOST OF THAT      
         WILL BE MIXED RIGHT UP.

507
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,049
WHEN YOU BLEND THAT FAT         
    INTO THE MEAT,              

508
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,051
  IT'S GONNA ADD                
A LOT OF OF FLAVOR.             
                 FRESH POTATOES.

509
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,987
THAT'S ALL THE POTATO           
    THAT GOES IN?               
           THAT'S ALL THE POTATO
               THAT GOES IN.    

510
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:20,257
   THAT WAS ABOUT 15 POUNDS     
OF MEAT, 2 POUNDS OF POTATOES.  
                          MAYBE.

511
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,459
I'M GONNA LIKE THIS.            

512
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,661
               SAUTéED ONIONS,  
            FRESH THYME, GARLIC.

513
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,663
    YOU DON'T HOLD BACK AT      
THE SEASONING SECTION, DO YOU?  
                             NO.

514
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,665
WHEN IT SAW IT GETTING BOILED   
    WITH THE MIREPOIX...        

515
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,866
               A LITTLE WORRIED?
      I THOUGHT,                
WHAT ARE WE GONNA HAVE?         

516
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,603
    WE'RE GONNA                 
HAVE BOILED O'HASH?             
            FRESH MUSTARD, SALT,
                 AND PEPPER.    

517
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,605
AND THEN HIT THE THROTTLE?      
               HIT THE THROTTLE.

518
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,007
THAT PROBABLY IS ONE            
 OF THE MOST UNIQUE             

519
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:38,609
HASH-MAKING EXPERIENCES         
       I'VE HAD.                
               IT'S DEFINITELY  
             A LITTLE DIFFERENT,

520
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,811
        BUT WE SELL A LOT OF IT.
IT'S CALLED CRAZY HASH.         

521
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
          CRAZY HASH. I'LL PUT  
         A HANDFUL ON THE GRILL.

522
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,749
PATTY IT OUT.                   
          WE'LL THROW THE WEIGHT
               RIGHT ON IT,     

523
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:46,617
GET IT NICE AND CRISPY.         
                   AND GET NICE.

524
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,019
NOW I'LL FLIP IT.               
      WE'VE GOT EGGS READY. MMM!

525
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,621
                     HASH READY?
 YEP. WE GOTTA GET NICE         
AND CRISPY ON BOTH SIDES.       

526
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:53,557
      NOW YOU GET TWO FRESH EGGS
             RIGHT ON TOP.      
SO LIKE I SAID,                 

527
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,693
 THERE'S BARELY THAT MUCH POTATO
         INSIDE OF THIS.        

528
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,361
HMM. LOTS OF FLAVOR.            

529
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,629
IT ALMOST TASTES TO ME          

530
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,631
    LIKE A CROSS BETWEEN        
A BRISKET SANDWICH AND HASH.    

531
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,566
MMM. GREAT CRUST,               
 A TON OF MEAT,                 

532
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,835
  A LITTLE BIT OF POTATO        
JUST TO CREAM IT UP A BIT.      

533
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,771
FOR HASH LOVERS,                
YOU'LL LIKE THIS.               

534
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:08,639
I'D EAT THAT ALL DAY LONG.      
                        AWESOME.

535
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,107
CAN'T BEAT IT.                  
      HASH IN THE WINDOW.       

536
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:12,709
         THE HASH HERE          
       IS JUST FANTASTIC.       
               IT'S REALLY GOOD,
                REALLY HEARTY.  

537
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,978
  I FEEL AS IF MY GRANDMOTHER'S 
    IN THE KITCHEN MAKING IT.   

538
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,648
     CRISPY ON THE OUTSIDE,     
     BUT IT'S REALLY TENDER.    

539
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,717
             THE BRISKET HASH   
           IS JUST OUTSTANDING. 

540
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,452
I WANT THIS ON SOME BRIOCHE     
WITH A LOBSTER ON THE SIDE.     

541
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,388
        LOBSTER BENEDICT        
         IN THE WINDOW.         

542
