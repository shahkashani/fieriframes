80
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,922

81
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,592

82
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:15,594
            FOLD IT OVER ONCE.

83

00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,932
              A LOT OF WORK JUST

85
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,735
                  NOW WE'RE AT  
               THE RIGHT NUMBER.
AND NOW WE ADD                  
 THE FILLING.                   

86
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,604
                           OKAY.
SO THIS LOOK WONDERFUL.         

87
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,606
    SPRAY A LITTLE BIT OF WATER.
GOT A LITTLE WATER.             

88
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,942
                  SO IT'LL STICK
                  TOGETHER NICE.
NOW WE SQUEEZE A LITTLE BIT     
      OF THE AIR OUT.           

89
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:32,144
       IF IT GETS AN AIR BUBBLE 
       IN LIKE THAT, IT CRACKS, 

90
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:34,946
             AND THEN YOU'VE GOT
               AN OPEN RAVIOLI. 
THEN GO ALL THE WAY DOWN.       

91
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,548

93

  IT COOKS THE RIGHT WAY, RIGHT?

94
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,021
     PUT IT IN

00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,232
   THEN I ADD                   
THE HEAVY CREAM.                
              WHIPPING CREAM,   
          BUT WITHOUT THE SUGAR.

100
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,568
         NICE LITTLE PINK SAUCE.
   THERE WE GO.                 
WHAT DO YOU THINK?              

101
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,503
               LOOKS GOOD TO ME.
COUPLE OF FLIP.                 

102
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:02,040
                   NIAGARA FALLS
                    IN MY MOUTH.
AND THERE WE GO.                

103
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,375
     PUT A LITTLE BIT OF PARSLEY
            JUST FOR LOOK.      
GOOD OLD ITALIAN                
    PARSLEY.                    

104
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,978
                  YEAH, ITALIAN 
                 PARSLEY ALWAYS.

105
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,714
OKAY. IT'S GOT GREAT COLOR.     

106
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:10,648
(groans) THE PASTA              
   IS SO TENDER                 

107
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,784
THAT IT MELTS                   
IN YOUR MOUTH.                  

108
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,853
 THE PORK IS GROUND             
JUST TO THE RIGHT BIT           

109
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,855
SO YOU GET THE TEXTURE          
   OF THE PORK. MMM.            

110
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,857
IT'S AN ORCHESTRA               
   OF FLAVOR.                   

111
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,725
    I DON'T THINK I COULD       
ACTUALLY EAT MORE THAN FOUR.    

112
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,195
MMM.                            

113
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,197
   ONE LAST BITE. MAYBE         
I COULD EAT MORE THAN FOUR.     

114
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,832
I MEANT 14.                     

115
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,801
      IT'S LIGHT AND FRESH.     
      IT'S REALLY AMAZING.      

116
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,738
             EVERYTHING'S JUST  
          VERY GOOD, VERY TASTY.

117
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,006
MAKE THE PIZZA, MAKE THE SAUCE, 
      MAKE THE FOCACCIA.        

118
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,075
                PIZZA PROSCIUTTO
                   MASCARPONE.  
MMM.                            

119
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:40,411
CREAMY, SALTY AND CRUNCHY.      
        THAT'S IT.              

120
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,413
    BASICALLY, EVERYTHING HE    
     MAKES HERE IS HOMEMADE.    

121
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,283
    THE PESTO GNOCCHI           
IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE.        

122
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,817
     (man) LINGUINI VONGOLE.    

123
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,352
           CRISPY FRIED POLENTA 

124
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:49,954
          WITH THE OFF-THE-HOOK 
         PORCINI MUSHROOM SAUCE.

125
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,556
  <i> YEP, PORCINI MUSHROOMS...</i>    
            PERFECT.            

126
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,759
   <i> A STAPLE IN FLORENCE...</i>     
PORCINI MUSHROOMS.              

127
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,427
      <i> THAT LUCA IS PICKING</i>     
   <i> IN SEASON RIGHT OUT BACK.</i>   

128
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,230
         WHAT ARE WE GONNA MAKE,
                  BOSS?         
WE'RE GONNA MAKE                
   POLENTA.                     

129
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,566
WE GOT SOME BOILING WATER,      
          SALTED.               

130
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,168
I'M GONNA TURN IT OFF THE WATER.
  JUST SLOWLY ADD THE POLENTA.  

131
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,638
                    WHY SO SLOW?
IT'S NOT GONNA BECOME           
     COAGULATED.                

132
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,574
        SO IT DOESN'T COAGULATE.
COAGULATE. THAT'S WHY           
  WE TURN IT OFF.               

133
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,110
OTHERWISE, IT WOULD BIND UP.    
          BIND UP.              

134
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,646
PERFECT. NOW WE'RE GONNA        
TURN ON THE HEAT AGAIN.         
                  LET IT SIMMER?

135
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,715
LET IT SIMMER A LITTLE BIT.     
                ADD A LITTLE BIT
                  OF CHEESE?    

136
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,183
            PARMIGIANO-REGGIANO.
PARMIGIANO-REGGIANO.            

137
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,519
        THE ONLY CHEESE, BABY.  
       AND THEN HOW MUCH BUTTER?

138
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,854
300 GRAMS WOULD BE FINE.        
          ABOUT A CUP OF BUTTER.

139
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,056
           A LITTLE HEAVY CREAM?
YEP, LIKE A CUP                 
  AND A HALF.                   

140
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:27,125
 IT'S GOTTA COOK UNTIL          
THE POLENTAS COME APART         

141
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,527
FROM THE SIDE OF THE BOWL       
  LIKE THE PIZZA DOUGH.         

142
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,829
 YOU'LL SEE A LITTLE GAP BETWEEN
    THE POLENTA AND THE SIDE.   

143
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:34,066
           SO ONCE THIS IS DONE,
           OIL UP A SHEET TRAY. 

144
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,401
POUR IT SLOWLY.                 
  BE CAREFUL.                   
                      (whistles)

145
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,536
AND NOW WITH THIS               
 OILED SPATULA,                 

146
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,939
WE JUST FLATTEN IT UP           
      A LITTLE.                 
                  NICE AND EVEN.

147
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,408
PERFECT. LET IT COOL DOWN.      
  PUT IT IN THE WALK-IN.        

148
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:45,410
         THEN ONCE IT'S COOLED, 
       WE CAN CUT IT, FRY IT UP.
FRY IT UP,                      

149
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:48,413
 BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY         
MY FAMILY USED TO DO IT.        

150
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,415
                AND THIS GOES   
             RIGHT TO THE FRYER.

151
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,417
     POLENTA'S FRYING.          
WHAT ARE WE PUTTIN' ON IT?      

152
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,419
I'M GONNA DO A PORCINI          
     CREAM SAUCE.               

153
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,287
A LITTLE BIT BUTTER.            
A LITTLE BIT GARLIC.            

154
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,556
THIS IS THE PORCINI.            
                            MMM.

155
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,959
              WE ALL SMELLED IT.
A LITTLE PINCH LIKE...          

156
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,561
                 A LOT OF FLAVOR
                     THERE.     
   YEAH, I LOVE                 
PORCINIS THE BEST.              

157
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:05,563
THE KING OF THE MUSHROOM,       
 I THINK. TOUCH PARSLEY.        

158
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,499
WE WANT TO PUT IN               
 SOME MARSALA.                  
           OH, A LITTLE MARSALA.

159
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,235
                            MMM.
AND THE CREAM.                  
   REDUCE.                      

160
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,637
     I LIKE WHERE THAT'S GOIN'. 
          A LITTLE PEPPER.      

161
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,639
         AW, THAT SMELLS GREAT. 

162
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,774
LOOK WHAT WE GOT, HUH?          
            I THINK WE'RE READY.

163
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,178
                   LOOK AT THAT.
NICE AND CRISPY, AND JUST POUR  
       THIS CREAM ALL OVER.     

164
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,914
                    THERE WE GO.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,               
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.               

165
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,250
               OKAY, PARMIGIANO?
MMM. SMELLS FANTASTIC.          

166
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:28,787
                           DONE.
(chuckles)                      

167
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,923
WOW, WHAT A GREAT SAUCE.        

168
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,991
NOT REALLY HEAVY. YOU THINK,    
  CREAM SAUCE--SUPER HEAVY.     

169
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,994
THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT       
   OF CREAM IN THERE.           

170
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,531
    THIS, MY FRIEND,            
IS BORDERING ON ILLEGAL.        

171
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,667
AND I SAID "ILLEGAL," NOT       
"ILL EAGLE," A SICK BIRD.       

172

          ONCE YOU GET ALL THAT 
         IN THERE, PULSE IT UP. 

222
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,193
WHAT ARE WE GONNA MAKE

                     OUR VERSION
                    OF COLESLAW.

223
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,995
LET ME SEE THAT AGAIN.          
                THE WHOLE THING.

224
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,997
 NOT WITH THE KNIFE!            
           CAREFUL OF THE KNIFE.

225
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:54,732
DEAD HOST, NO SHOW.

          CHOP GREEN CABBAGE UP.

226
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,202
          NICE. THEN MAYONNAISE.
 SO WE'RE GONNA MAKE            
  THE SLAW DRESSING.            

227
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,204
      YEP. LITTLE WHITE VINEGAR,
                SUGAR.          
SUGAR.                          

228
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,205
             AND WE USE A LITTLE
               SEASONING SALT.  

229
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,207
             LIGHT CHILI POWDER,
              DARK CHILI POWDER.
DIG IT.                         

230
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,209
        CHOP UP CARROTS, CELERY,
              WHITE ONIONS,     

231
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:08,346
            ROASTED RED PEPPERS,
               GREEN PEPPERS.   
     AND YOU PREP THAT          
AND PUT IT IN OTHER DISHES.     

232
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,414
YES, A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT STUFF.
        THAT ALL GOES IN.       

233
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,550
I LIKE IT.                      
       THEN THE KEY INGREDIENT--
               CILANTRO.        

234
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,486
CILANTRO.                       
                 AND THEN MIX IT
                     ALL UP.    

235
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:16,488
    NOW WHO CAME                
UP WITH THIS RECIPE?            
                             ME.

236
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,423
             AND, UH, IT'S BEEN 
             TWISTED AND TURNED 

237
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,491
       OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS.
          WE ADD THE CABBAGE.   

238
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,094
         AND THEN WE USUALLY LET
          THIS SET UP 24 HOURS. 
SOAK IT UP                      
A LITTLE.                       

239
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,962
LOOKS GREAT. I'M GONNA          
   AT LEAST TRY IT.             

240
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,898
NICE LITTLE BITE TO IT.         
       ON-POINT.                

241
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,699
WE'RE GONNA MAKE OUR            
BARBECUED MAHI TACOS.           

242
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,768
START WITH 2 6-INCH             
 FLOUR TORTILLAS.               

243
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,237
  FIVE SECONDS. FLIP 'EM.       
IT'S LIKE FLASH-FRYING 'EM.     

244
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,640
NOT VERY LONG.                  
               SO YOU USE FLOUR,
                   NOT CORN?    

245
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,776
I THINK IT TASTES BETTER.       
                   WHOA. REALLY?

246
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,310
WE'RE GONNA MAKE MAHI.          

247
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,246
    START WITH A LITTLE         
OLIVE OIL ON THE FLAT TOP.      

248
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,581
A LITTLE MAHI ON THE GRILL.     
           COMES IN FRESH,      
    AND YOU BUTCHER IT YOURSELF.

249
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,517
YEP. PUT MY BLACKENING          
      SEASONING.                
                          GREAT.

250
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:47,719
 I'M JUST GONNA WHIP            
IT AROUND. ALL RIGHT.           

251
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,721
    SO WHILE THAT'S COOKIN',    
WE'RE GONNA TAKE OUR TWO SHELLS.

252
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,324
             ADD FRESH GUACAMOLE
              WITH THE CHEESE.  

253
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,259
       A LITTLE BIT OF TOMATOES.
            COLESLAW NEXT.      

254
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,661
THAT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S          
  SOFTENED UP A LOT.            
         WALK BACK TO OUR GRILL.

255
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,663
COVER. WE MAKE OUR OWN          
   VEGETABLE STOCK,             

256
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:01,266
AND I USE THOSE                 
 FOR STEAM.                     
         SO YOU PUT A LITTLE BIT
           OF THE GRILL ON IT.  

257
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,601
    THAT STEAM RIGHT THERE WILL 
    FINISH THE COOKING PROCESS. 

258
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,670
 AS SOON AS THAT MOISTURE PRETTY
         MUCH GOES AWAY,        

259
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,938
    I SHRED IT, GRAB            
THE MANGO BARBECUE SAUCE,       

260
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:10,675
       PUT IT ALL OVER IT,      
  TURN THIS INTO MAHI BARBECUE. 

261
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:13,678
    SO EACH ORDER IS MADE FRESH.
           NOTHING'S HELD.      

262
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,814
NO HEATING LAMPS HERE.          
AND I GRAB THIS MAHI.           

263
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,349
              YOU REALLY HAVE   
           SOME NICE, FIRM FISH,

264
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,217
        BUT IT'S NOT OVERCOOKED.
EXACTLY.                        

265
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:23,088
   PLATE THESE GUYS UP, AND THEN
     THE CILANTRO WHITE SAUCE.  

266
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,823
 A LOT GOING ON FOR             
 JUST A SIMPLE TACO.            
           BLACK BEANS AND RICE.

267
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,825
        WE HAVE OUR CORN SALSA. 

268
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,227
          GONNA NEED A NAPKIN   
      FOR THIS ONE, "BIG DOGGY."

269
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,563
THERE'S A TON OF FLAVOR.        
I MEAN, A TON OF FLAVOR.        

270
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,966
THE FISH IS COOKED REALLY NICE. 
      THE SLAW BY ITSELF        

271
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,902
      HAS HUGE FLAVOR.          
THE WHITE SAUCE--HUGE FLAVOR.   

272
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,837
THAT MANGO BARBECUE SAUCE       
      IS ON-POINT.              

273
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,507
RICE IS NICE AND FIRM.          
YOU GO FROM DRY BEAN?           
                 YEAH, DRY BEAN.

274
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,242
MMM, IT'S GOOD, BROTHER.        

275
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,978
              I NEED FOUR MANGO 
               BARBECUE TACOS.  
A LITTLE BIT SPICY.             

276
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,313
 CABBAGE GIVES IT               
   SOME CRUNCH.                 
        THE WHOLE THING         
      IS JUST PHENOMENAL.       

277
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,582
       EYE-ROLLING GOOD.        
      PRETTY MUCH               
THE WHOLE MENU IS GREAT.        

278
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,185
             I NEED A CABO ROLL.
YOU DEFINITELY NOTICE           
    THE FLAVORS.                

279
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:57,255
YOU GOT IT EVERYWHERE.          
      THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE IN 
     CHARLOTTE THAT YOU CAN FIND

280
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,791
      FOOD LIKE THIS. THIS IS   
   THE CABO ROLL. MMM. OH, YEAH.

281
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,261
          THAT'S GOOD.          
  CRAB DIP MEETS                
AVOCADO SPRING ROLL.

                   TUNA BURRITO!

283
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,931
      WASABI TUNA BURRITO--     
       PERFECT EVERY TIME.      

284
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,000

       THEIR WASABI SAUCE.      

285
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,202
WHAT'S NEXT?                    
            WE'RE GONNA MAKE OUR
             HONEY WASABI SAUCE.

286
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:13,337
            FIRST WE START WITH 
            SOME WASABI POWDER. 

287
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,406
       I KIND OF JUST LOOSEN IT 
           UP A LITTLE BIT.     

288
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,342
     THEN ICE-COLD WATER, RIGHT?
      GET THAT INTO A PASTE...  

289
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,144
        (speaking indistinctly) 

290
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,145
       JUST THROW A LITTLE BIT  
     OF RED PEPPER FLAKES IN IT.
OKAY.                           

291
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,347
   NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD THE HONEY
       TO OUR HONEY WASABI,     

292
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,416
        AND ADD SOME MAYONNAISE.
YOU LOVE THAT MAYONNAISE,       
       DON'T YOU?               

293
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,552
        TWIST THIS ALL TOGETHER.
THAT'LL BE TASTY.               

294
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,288
          MMM.                  
I'M TAKIN' THAT ONE HOME.       

295
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,491
SIMPLE, CREAMY, SPICY,          
          OH.                   

296
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,226
               PUT A LITTLE OIL 
                ON MY FLAT TOP. 

297
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,895
GRAB SOME OF MY NICE,           
     PRETTY TUNA.               
       THAT'S GOOD-LOOKING TUNA.

298
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,764
    A LITTLE BIT                
OF BLACKENING SPICE.            

299
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,966
SQUEEZE A LITTLE LEMON.         
    MIX IT AROUND.              

300
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,768
THIS DOESN'T TAKE LONG,         
SO WE'LL LET THAT COOK.         

301
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,570
FLOUR 12-INCH TORTILLA.         

302
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,239
   ALL RIGHT, WE'LL START WITH  
 A LITTLE RICE, A LITTLE CHEESE.
DIG IT.                         

303
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,975

        VEGGIE PURéE CONCOCTION.
LOVE THAT.                      

304
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,311
         THEN THE MUSHROOMS,    
    THEN OUR HONEY WASABI SAUCE.

305
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,313
THE VEGGIE BURRITOS             
  MUST ROCK HERE.               
                        THEY DO.

306
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,915
           A LITTLE BIT LONGER. 

307
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,717
 DRENCH WITH                    
VEGGIE STOCK.                   
                LET THAT STEAM  
              FOR JUST A SECOND.

308
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,120
    ONLY TAKES ABOUT A MINUTE   
 AND A HALF, TWO MINUTES TOTAL. 

309
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,655
   THERE YOU GO.                
IT'S ALL COLORED UP.            
            MEDIUM-RARE? MEDIUM?

310
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,058
    UNLESS THE CUSTOMER         
WANTS IT RARE OR WELL-DONE,     

311
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,060
        RIGHT ABOUT MEDIUM-RARE.
COOL.                           

312
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,529
     GONNA ROLL MY BURRITO JUST 
     LIKE THAT AND GRAB MY PAN. 

313
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,065
   THROW IT DOWN HERE           
IN MY OVEN, 500 DEGREES.        

314
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,267
               THREE MINUTES.   
             WE CUT 'EM IN HALF.

315
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,869
     THIS IS OUR MANGO-PINEAPPLE
             SALSA RICE.        

316
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:23,140
AND THAT'S THE GAME PLAN?       
                      THAT'S IT.
                       TRY THAT.

317
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:26,010
THE FISH, MAN, BY ITSELF        
     IS OUTSTANDING.            

318
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,546
    LOOK AT THAT RIGHT THERE.   
 STILL NICE AND FLAKY AND MOIST,

319
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,548
    AND YOU GET                 
THE MELTED CHEESE,              

320
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,350
THE WARM TORTILLA               
TOGETHER WITH IT?               

321
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,352
I'LL DO THAT ALL DAY LONG.      
  THE HONEY WASABI SAUCE        

322
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,420
IS ABSOLUTELY WHAT TIES         
   IT ALL TOGETHER.             

323
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,490
JUST ENOUGH HEAT, BUT THEN YOU  
GET THE BACK SIDE OF THE SWEET  

324
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,492
RIGHT AT THE SAME TIME.         
    GOOD JOB, MAN.              
                         THANKS.

325
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,828
          I NEED A HONEY WASABI,
          GOING WITH THE WASABI.
    (woman) IT'S EXCELLENT.

00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:20,692

I THINK TURKEY LEG'S            
A VERY GOOD CHOICE.             

364
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,826

00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,575
NOW WE'RE GONNA PUT IT          
     IN THE BOAT.               

470
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,310
          LIKE, "ROW, ROW, ROW"?
"ROW, ROW, ROW."                

471
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,579
NOW WHAT ARE WE MAKIN'?         
           WE'RE GONNA TAKE THIS
           BONELESS LEG OF LAMB,

472
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,849
BRUSH IT UP WITH SOME OLIVE OIL,
    A LITTLE SALT AND PEPPER,   

473
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,784
         THEN WE'RE GONNA INSERT
          SOME GARLIC IN HERE.  

474
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,786
             WE'RE GONNA TAKE   
           A LITTLE ROSEMARY... 

475
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,788
KINDA THREAD IT UP              
UNDERNEATH THERE.               
       AND JUST DRESS IT AROUND.

476
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,991
TOUGH TO FIND FRESH HERBS       
   HERE ON THE ISLAND?          
            NO, GREAT HERBS FROM
              THE ISLAND HERE.  

477
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,993
                 THEN WE'RE JUST
                 GONNA SPRINKLE 

478
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:51,395
                 A LITTLE THYME 
               OVER IT AS WELL. 

479
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,463
   PUT IT ON THE ROASTING RACK, 
      AND WE'RE READY TO GO.    

480
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,134
AND HOW LONG WE GONNA           
 ROAST THIS OFF FOR?            
               ABOUT AN HOUR 45.

481
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,202
350?                            
             YEAH, A LITTLE BIT 
           UNDER THAT, ACTUALLY.

482
00:18:58,271 --> 00:18:59,736
(whistles)                      

483
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:02,673
    (shouting)                  
SHE'S A QUIET ONE!              

484
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,275
                       (laughs) 

485
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,410
(normal voice) SO WE'LL LET     
 THESE REST A LITTLE BIT?       

486
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,679
          NOW WE'LL CUT THE, UH,
                STRING OFF.     
DIG IT.                         

487
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,748
      OKAY, NOW WE'RE JUST GONNA
          CUT IT UP IN CUBES.   

488
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,150
 LOOK AT THAT PIECE RIGHT THERE 
        WITH THE GARLIC.        

489
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,419
THAT BITE'S NOT                 
GONNA BE GOOD.                  

490
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,422
MMM. YEP, GLAD I GOT THAT       
 OUT OF SOMEBODY'S WAY.         

491
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,691
                  CUBE HER UP   
              KIND OF BITE-SIZE.
WHEN I CAME TO HAWAII,          

492
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,494
THIS WASN'T NECESSARILY WHAT I  
THOUGHT I WAS GONNA BE HAVIN'.  

493
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,229
                      I'LL BET. 
                     (chuckles) 

494
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,298
OKAY, SO IS THAT ENOUGH         
  TO GO IN ONE DISH?            
                     OH, PLENTY.

495
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:30,234
     THEN WE JUST ADD SOME IN,  
  PUT A LITTLE REDUCED BEEF BASE

496
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,770
        WITH A LITTLE PORT IN IT
              RIGHT ON TOP.     

497
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,772
         A LITTLE THYME ON TOP. 

498
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:37,375
        NOW WE'RE GONNA PUT YOUR
         MASHED POTATOES ON HER.
THERE WE GO.                    

499
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,111
              NOW YOU GOT       
         SOME MASHED POTATOES.  
   NOW YOU CAN POP THAT IN      
THE OVEN AND LET IT BROWN UP?   

500
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:41,512
                         READY? 

501
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,615
THAT'S A LOT OF MASHED          
POTATOES THERE, BOSS.           

502
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,387
YOU SELL A LOT OF THIS?         
                    QUITE A BIT.

503
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,855
      THE LAMBS NICE.           
I THINK THAT'S THE TREAT--      

504
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,857
ROASTING THE LAMB,              
 COOKING IT SLOW,               

505
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:56,193
THE ROSEMARY AND THE GARLIC,    
        AND THE PORT            

506
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,796
THAT GOT MIXED IN THERE, THAT   
 LITTLE SUBTLETY WORKS WELL.    
                           GOOD.

507
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,798
                      THANK YOU.
     A LOT OF MASH.             
THAT'S THE WAY YOU DO IT.       

508
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,801
                   HERE'S YOUR  
                 SHEPHERD'S PIE.

   BY SEAFOOD,                  

510
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:08,005
AND YOU'RE HAVING               
 SHEPHERD'S PIE.                
                        EXACTLY.

511
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,607
MAKES SENSE TO ME.              

512
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,676
SHEPHERD'S PIE.                 
              (woman) MY PARENTS
                  ARE IRISH,    

513
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:14,412
               SO IT'S A TASTE  
            OF HOME FOR ME. MMM.

514
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,414
    (man) EVERYBODY YOU TALK    
      TO WHO'S FROM HAWAII      

515
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,416

               TURKEY "JALA"    
           AND A FISH-AND-CHIPS.

516
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,418
        IF IT'S NOT MURPHY'S,   
        IT'S JUST NOT LUNCH.    

517
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,687
"IF IT'S NOT MURPHY'S,          
IT'S JUST NOT LUNCH."           

518
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,755
        I'M NOT GOIN' OUT.      
I'D MAKE A COMMERCIAL           
   OUT OF THAT.                 

519
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,824

GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.               
 IT'S GOOD FUN.                 

521
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:30,761
   IT'S OUR LIFE. YOU KNOW,     
IT'S 22 YEARS, AND I DON'T KNOW 

522
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:32,630
THAT I COULD DO                 
ANYTHING ELSE.                  
                    DO YOU SURF?

523
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,098
NO.                             
                  PADDLE? FLOAT?

524
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,899
 NO.                            
                   BRAISE? BURN?

525
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:37,434
DRINK.                          
                         GOT IT.

526
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,370
BINGO.                          
                        (laughs)

527
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,772
   SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP,  
        BUT DON'T WORRY.        

528
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,774
   THERE'S PLENTY MORE JOINTS   
     ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY.

           AND DIVES."

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,114
           WHAT DOES IT SAY     
       ON THE MENU RIGHT THERE? 

532
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,717
           (laughter)           

533
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:55,852
        (speaking indistinctly) 

534
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,888
          IT SAID "FREE FRIES."
