AND TURKEY CHILI, THAT'S BOMBER.

119
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,803
          THE CHILI HAS         
      PEANUT BUTTER IN IT,      

120
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,606
          SO IT'S GOT           
     A UNIQUE FLAVOR TO IT.     
SERIOUSLY PEANUT BUTTER'S       
 GONNA GO IN THE CHILI?         

121
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,274

00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,680
         OKAY, SO WE START OUT  
       WITH SOME BROWNED TURKEY.

00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,748
          GRIDDLE THIS UP,      
   ADD A LITTLE SALT AND PEPPER.

00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:46,551
   JUST GET IT SLIGHTLY BROWNED.
     SCOOP THAT INTO THE POT.   

126
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,287
             WE'RE GONNA ADD    
         OUR CARAMELIZED ONIONS,

127
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,621
        SOME RED KIDNEY BEANS...
OKAY.                           

128
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,623
             OKAY, BLACK BEANS, 
               PINTO BEANS...   

129
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,825
GREEN CHILIES.                  
                   CHILI SAUCE, 
                   ONION POWDER,

                CHILI POWDER.   

131
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,429
 THEN WE DO SHOTS               
OF WORCESTERSHIRE.              

132
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,965
SOME WATER.                     
THERE WE GO.                    
                       AND STIR.

133
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,636
                   AND SOME SALT
                    AND PEPPER. 
 LET IT SIMMER                  
FOR THREE HOURS.                

134
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,437
             CHILI'S GOOD TO GO.
LOOKS GREAT.                    

135
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:08,106
             SO WE'RE GONNA ADD 
               PEANUT BUTTER,   

136
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,775
 WHICH IS THE SPECIAL INGREDIENT
          TO THE CHILI.         

137
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,443
                   STIR THAT UP.
WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS?            

138
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,579
PHEW. THIS CHILI'S READY?       
                           YEAH.

139
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,248
       I'LL JUST LADLE A LITTLE.
GOT A SPOON?                    

140
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,583
                           YEAH.
IT WORKS.                       

141
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,118
      IT'S A LOT                
OF WELL-ROUNDED FLAVOR.         

142
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,555
 I MIGHT HAVE BEEN HARD-PRESSED 
   TO PICK PEANUT BUTTER OUT.   

143
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:24,989
NO, I DIDN'T LIKE IT.           

144
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,859
SO OUR CHILI'S DONE.            
               NOW WE MAKE      
         THE TRUCKEE TRAINWRECK.

145
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,662
OKAY.                           
     START WITH THE BURGER--    
 80-20, MEYER BEEF, ALL NATURAL.

146
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,530
LITTLE SALT AND PEPPER.         
         LITTLE SALT AND PEPPER.

147
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,599
           THEN WE'RE GONNA DIP 
             OUR ONION RINGS.   

148
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,002
          WE USE TEMPURA BATTER.
NICE, SUPER ICE-COLD BATTER.    

149
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,537
WOW, IT'S THICK                 
LIKE ICE CREAM.                 
                 WE'LL LET THOSE
                      FRY UP.   

150
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,672
        AND THEN WE'LL GRIDDLE  
       OUR BUN AND A FRIED EGG. 

151
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,808
   NO FRIED EGG FOR ME,         
REALLY TRYING TO CUT DOWN.      

152
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,276
ONION RINGS DONE?               
          ONION RINGS ARE THERE.

153
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:49,013
             THAT'S GOOD-LOOKING
               TEMPURA BATTER.  
SO THIS BUN IS GRIDDLED.        

154
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,682
  ADD A LITTLE SEASONING SAUCE  
 TO THAT--WE MAKE IT IN-HOUSE-- 

155
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,950
LETTUCE, TOMATO, PICKLE.        

156
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,152
 SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE BURGER 
 OFF AND PUT IT ON THE FLATTOP. 

157
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,355
   GET SOME OF OUR TURKEY CHILI.
ON THE FLATTOP WE DO IT,        
     NOT ON THE BUN.            

158
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:58,690
                  THERE YOU GO. 
                 CHEDDAR CHEESE.

159
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,226
  WE'RE GONNA ADD THE ONION RING
          ON TOP OF THAT.       

160
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:02,761
DOME IT, LID IT, ANYTHING?      
                  CHEESE MELTER.

         WE'RE GONNA PUT THAT   
      OUT OF THERE, RIGHT THERE.

162
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,832
WE'RE JUST GONNA ADD A LITTLE   
CHILI RIGHT IN THE ONION RING.  
                   LOOK AT THAT.

163
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:10,369
         WHAT IDIOT'S GONNA BITE
           INTO THAT HOT MESS?  

164
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:13,772

             PICKLE'S IN THERE. 

167
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,445
                 BURGER'S COOKED
                 THE RIGHT WAY. 

168
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,047
         DON'T PICK UP TOO MUCH 
          OF THE PEANUT BUTTER. 

169
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,715
      THAT WOULD BE ONE I WOULD 
    DEFINITELY ORDER AGAIN. MMM.

188
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,629
   IN AN AREA KNOWN AS WALDO.   

189
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,098
  NOW IT'S ABOUT 5 MILES SOUTH  
          OF THE PLAZA,

216
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:13,425
    SURIBACHI'S VERY UNIQUE.    
IT'S TEMPURA BATTERED AND THIS  
 REALLY GOOD WASABI COLESLAW,   

217
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,093
REALLY GOOD.                    

218
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,629
       HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THIS?
FIRST WE'RE GONNA MAKE          
 THE TEMPURA BATTER.            

219
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,431
        SO THIS IS RICE FLOUR...
AND SALT.                       

220
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,867
     CAKE FLOUR AND A LITTLE BIT
         OF LEAVENING AGENT.    
TAKE SOME COLD WATER            
AND MIX IT TOGETHER             

221
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,836
LIKE A THICK PANCAKE BATTER.    
                  THE KEY       
             IS SUPER COLD WATER

222
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,572
           SO IT REALLY MAKES IT
              ADHERE TO STUFF.  
A LITTLE BIT MORE.              

223
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,840
THAT SHOULD ABOUT DO IT.        
WE'LL MAKE THE HAMBURGER.       

224
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,644
 WE DO THIS BY HAND AND KIND OF 
  PATTY IT OUT. PRESS IT DOWN.  

225
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,846
SEASON IT WITH SALT             
    AND PEPPER,                 

226
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,047
A LITTLE GRANULATED GARLIC,     
          ONION.                

227
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,848
            OKAY, SOME AQUA NET.
A LITTLE AQUA NET.              
 THROW THAT DOWN.               

228
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,452
       WE GRILL IT TO           
THE TEMPERATURE YOU WANT IT,    

229
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:41,786
THEN WE LET IT SET AND REST     

230
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,854
     SO THE JUICES              
DON'T COME FLOWING OUT.         
       FLOWING OUT OF IT, RIGHT.

231
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:46,858
NOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE WASABI 
    MAYO FOR THE COLESLAW.      

232
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,125
   TWO WHOLE EGGS,              
TABLESPOON OF GARLIC.           
                         GO BIG.

233
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,461
GO BIG. TEARING IT UP.          
               YOU'RE AN ANIMAL.
               OH, THERE YOU GO.

234
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,862
WASABI.                         
                       GENEROUS.

235
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:55,400
COME ON BY. WE'LL REPAIR THE TOP
      OF YOUR HEAD AFTER...     

236
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,537
WE GOT A RED WINE VINEGAR,      
     DIJON MUSTARD...           
     THAT'S AN EMULSIFIER THERE.

237
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,071
POWDERED SUGAR.                 
                   HOW MUCH     
             ARE YOU PUTTING IN?

238
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,674
QUITE A BIT.                    
THIS IS GETTING MORE INTERESTING
          AS WE GO ON.          

239
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:05,010
     WE TAKE SOME               
EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL.         
                      (whistles)

240
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,812
    SMELL THAT WASABI COMING OUT
         OF THERE, BIG-TIME.    

241
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,481
DO YOU WANT TO TASTE IT?        
                    REALLY GOOD.

242
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,083
              THE SUGAR'S       
       AN INTERESTING COMPONENT.

243
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,485
      THE BITE OF THE VINEGAR,  
     I CAN FEEL IT RIGHT THERE. 

244
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,488
            WE'RE GONNA MIX THAT
               WITH THE SLAW?   
YEP.                            

245
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,423
             IT'S A PRETTY THICK
                  CUT THERE.    
WE GO PRETTY RUSTIC             
   AROUND HERE.                 

246
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,292
POUR SOME IN THE SLAW.          

247
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,493
    SOME BLACK SESAME SEEDS     
AND WHITE SESAME SEEDS, TOASTED.
                         DIG IT.

248
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,629
          GREEN ONIONS,         
  AND WE'LL JUST MIX IT AROUND. 

249
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,632
      SET IT UP                 
SO IT STAYS TOGETHER.           
      STILL HAVE A LITTLE CRUNCH
            OF THE CABBAGE.     

250
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:29,434
              LOOKS GREAT.      
         CAN'T WAIT TO TRY THIS.

251
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:30,902
TAKE THE BURGER AND DIP IT      
       IN THE FLOUR.            

252
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,771
  THEN WE'LL DIP IT             
IN THE TEMPURA BATTER.          
                LITTLE FLOUR    
           TO STICK TO THE MEAT,

253
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,507
              TEMPURA BATTER    
           STICKS TO THE FLOUR. 

254
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,709
TAKE IT OVER TO THE FRYER.      
 THROW IT RIGHT IN THERE.       

255
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,511
            WHAT TEMP WE RUNNING
               THAT FRYER AT?   
350. FLIP THIS OVER.            

256
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,047
     BUTTER THE BUN AND THROW IT
        IN THE PANINI MACHINE.  
THAT'S YOUR BUN TOASTER?        

257
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:46,717
   YEAH. TAKE THE BOTTOM OF THE 
  BUN, PUT ON HOT ASIAN MUSTARD.
THAT MUCH?                      

258
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,986
         LET IT KNOW IT'S THERE.
             SRIRACHA SAUCE.    

259
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,588
                  TAKE THIS OUT.
     IS THIS UNDER              
THE "LIGHT AND HEALTHY"

                 (laughs)       
          TAKE SOME PEPPER JACK.

261

         COLESLAW, BIG HANDFUL, 
           THROW IT ON THERE.   

262
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,263
                  AND THAT'S IT.
THAT'S A LOT OF BURGER.         

263
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,932
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.            

264
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,401
              WHOA.             
I GOT THE MUSTARD ON THE BOTTOM.

265

   OOH. SLAW'S GOT              
A NICE CRUNCH TO IT.            

266
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,539
THE BURGER'S COOKED TO TEMP.    
 TEMPURA'S NICE AND CRISPY.     

267
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:10,341
 THAT'S A LOT OF FLAVOR, MAN.   
I LIKE THAT. THAT'S PACKING IT. 

268
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,543

269
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,679
                      SURIBACHI.
THE CRUNCH ON THE BATTER        
IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE.        

270
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:15,814
   IT HAS A LITTLE KICK TO IT,  

271
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:18,883
  DEFINITELY WANT TO HAVE YOUR  
 BEER HANDY OR SOME WATER HANDY.

272
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:22,353
MAKES ME DO THE FOOD DANCE.

               KENTUCKY COLONEL.

273
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:23,688
YOU DON'T COME TO A BAR         

274
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,890
AND EXPECT TO HAVE FOOD         
      LIKE THIS.                
 IT'S SO DIFFERENT AND UNIQUE.  

275
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,092
    I LIKE THE CUBAN BECAUSE    
 HE DOES IT A LITTLE DIFFERENT. 

276
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:31,096
HE SMOKES PORK SHOULDER.        
 ANYWHERE FROM 16 TO 20 HOURS,  
 DEPENDING ON THE TEMPERATURE.  

277
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:34,699

I KEEP COMING BACK TO THE PULLED
  PORK BECAUSE IT'S THAT GOOD.

00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:42,840
YEAH.

      LITTLE KISS OF SOME BACON.

317
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:06,591

         BUT GET ME IN THE CAR.

351
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:31,976
      (Adel) MY PHILOSOPHY      
     HERE IN THE RESTAURANT     

352
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:35,179
 IS TO MAKE SURE THIS FOOD IS   
THE BEST QUALITY FOR THE MONEY. 

353
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,849
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DOES DO IT

 TREATS FOOD WITH               
 A LOT OF RESPECT.

         SOME LOVE TO YOUR FOOD.

357
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,991
NO, LOVE SPICE IS WAY           
  MORE MARKETABLE.              

358
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:50,528

    AS THE BINDER,              

376
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,766
'CAUSE THE LAMB JUST DOESN'T    
      HAVE ENOUGH FAT.          
      TO HOLD IT TOGETHER, YEAH.

              WELL, I DON'T HAVE
               A BIGGER SCOOP.  

380

WE'LL MAKE THE CHICKEN          
    PIE MIX FIRST.              

482
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:32,810
   WE'LL START                  
WITH SOME BUTTER.               
                 CHICKEN BREAST.

483
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,679
CUT IN CUBES.

FOR A LITTLE BIT.               

485
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,549
   AND I'M GONNA ADD            
A LITTLE BIT OF DILL...         
                     FRESH DILL.

486
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,151
SOME CHOPPED ONIONS,            
   CHOPPED GARLIC,              

487
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:43,754
LITTLE BIT OF KOSHER SALT,      
  BLACK PEPPER, CARROTS.        
                  LOT OF CARROTS
                  IN GREEK FOOD?

488
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,690
 WE EAT A LOT OF CARROTS.       
CELERY, SOME CHICKEN BASE.      
                 COOK THIS DOWN.

489
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,759
   I LET IT SIMMER              
FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES.           

490
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,896
            AND THEN WHAT ARE   
          WE GONNA DO WITH THIS?
   STRAIN OUT                   
ANY EXTRA JUICES.               

491
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,898
            'CAUSE IF YOU GET   
        THAT PHYLLO DOUGH WET...
YEAH.                           

492
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,099
                    YOU'RE DONE.
WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE             
THE BéCHAMEL SAUCE.             

493
00:18:56,169 --> 00:19:00,237
           TRADITIONAL BéCHAMEL.
SOME MILK, BRING IT             
TO A BOILING POINT.             

494
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,639
SIT THIS BACK HERE.             

495
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:02,906
SOME BUTTER.                    
                WE'RE GONNA MAKE
                     A ROUX.    

496
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,776
WE ADD THE FLOUR                
 TO THE BUTTER.                 
                 EQUAL PARTS FAT
                    AND FLOUR.  

497
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,378
YES.                            
           OKAY, AND THEN NOW...

498
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,912
  THE MILK UP TO                
THE BOILING POINT.              

499
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:11,515
I ADD A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME.   
    IT'S ENOUGH FOR NOW.        
                    THERE WE GO.

500
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:12,850
JUST ONE EGG.                   

501
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,852
YOU SEE HOW THE EGG             
  MAKES IT LOOK?                
          THAT'S TIGHT BéCHAMEL.

502
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,454
        AND THAT'S GONNA MAKE US
                 THE...         
KOTOPITA.                       

503
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,523
                      KOTOPITA. 

504
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,791
  NOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE          
THE REST OF THE MIXTURE.        
                            YES.

505
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,460
LOOKS LIKE THE BEGINNING        
   OF CHICKEN POTPIE.           
                     HERE WE GO.

506
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,329
          PARMESAN CHEESE, FETA.
(whistles)                      

507
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:26,597
THE BéCHAMEL WE MADE,           

508
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,333
BROUGHT TO YOU BY               
SPACKLE AND SONS.               
                      SOME EGGS.

509
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,667
A LITTLE EXTRA BINDER.          

510
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,736
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET        
        INTO IT.                
                      THAT'S IT.

511
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,339
SO NOW WE GET THE PHYLLO.       
              BUTTER THE PHYLLO.

512
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,741
                BIG NICE SCOOP  
               OF KOTOPITA MIX. 

513
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:39,476
         PRESS IT DOWN A LITTLE.
              FLIP IT OVER.     
GRACIOUS WITH THE BUTTER.       

514
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,880
                  I LOVE BUTTER.
  THE WAY YOU FOLD IT, YOU HAVE 
THE EXTRA CRUST BUILT UP ON TOP.

515
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,015
 IT BUILDS A NICE,              
LIGHT, FLAKY CRUST,             

516
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,017
   KIND OF LIKE                 
A PIE SHELL CRUST.              
                   THAT'S IT,   
                NICE LITTLE PIE.

517
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:48,285
  SO WE JUST KEEP MAKING THESE, 
          BRUSH IT OUT.         

518
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,422
 AND HOW LONG ARE               
WE GONNA COOK THIS?             
        40 MINUTES, 350 DEGREES.

519
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,957
                 LOOK AT THOSE. 

520
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,093
           (cracking)           
      OH, YOU CAN JUST HEAR THAT
     PHYLLO DOUGH JUST CRACKING.

521
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,697
       AND WHY ARE WE PUTTING IT
            ON THE FLATTOP?     
JUST TO GET RID OF              
ANY EXTRA BUTTER.               

522
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,098
             THAT IT MIGHT HAVE 
              BEEN COOKING IN.  

523
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,102
    PUT IT WITH                 
A MINI GREEK SALAD.             
                 THAT THING     
            IS CRUNCH-A-LICIOUS.

524
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:06,304
MMM.                            

525
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,972
WOW, THAT'S NOT CREAMY.         

526
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:10,641
     THIS IS LIKE A PASTY       
BUT DONE WITH THE PHYLLO DOUGH. 

527
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:11,709
THE LAYERS, THAT'S CRAZY.       

528
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,444
IT WAS GREAT.                   
    THAT'S EVERYWHERE IN GREECE.

529
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:15,980
REALLY?                         
                     EVERYWHERE.

530
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:17,782
        YOU SEE IT IN THE BAKERY
            LIKE A DOUGHNUT.    
IN THE MORNING?                 

531
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,518
                           YEAH.
OH, SEE? THAT'S MY KIND         
    OF BREAKFAST.               

532
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,854
 KNOCKED IT OUT                 
WITH THE PHYLLO.                
          KOTOPITA.             

533
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:26,590
       IT'S CRUSTY, SAVORY      
         AND VERY TASTY.        

534
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,726
                 SUZUKAKIA'S UP.
  I LIKE EVERYTHING ON THE MENU.

535
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:33,263
          SPANAKOPITA.          
          NOT ONLY IS IT EXOTIC,
              IT'S DELICIOUS.   

536
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,398
        LAMB KEBAB IS UP.       

537
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,133
      YOU'RE LIVING             
THE AMERICAN DREAM, MAN.        

538
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:37,535

               IT'S COMING TRUE.
CONGRATULATIONS.

                      THANK YOU.

   SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP,  
        BUT DON'T WORRY,        

541
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:44,542
   THERE'S PLENTY MORE PLACES   
  TO FIND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. 

542
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,410

            NEXT TIME           

543

 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

544
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:50,615
  TAKE OVER THE SHOW.           
SEE YOU LATER. GOOD-BYE.        
                        (laughs)

545
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,284
PUT THE SHADES ON THE BACK      
OF THE HEAD. THERE YOU GO.      

546
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,552

I NEED YOU.
