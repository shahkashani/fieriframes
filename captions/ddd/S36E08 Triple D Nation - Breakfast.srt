1
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:02,734
      People are asking me      
    all the time, "Hey, Guy.    

2
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:04,269
         That one joint         
you checked out in that one city

3
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:06,471
 when you were doing 'Triple D,'
       how'd they do it?"       

4
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:10,542
     You know, I don't know.    
     We should check it out.    

5
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:13,412
    Over the years, I've seen   
       and tasted it all.       

6
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:15,080
       This is ridiculous, dude.

7
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:17,348
        But it turns out        
    it was only the beginning   

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,484
    'cause "Triple D" joints    
      have been blowing up.     

9
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:22,954
   And we're going back to see  
         what's cooking.        

10
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,689
       Like on this trip.       

11
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,159
  We've got a little breakfast, 
        a little lunch...       

12
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,361
                   Sister,      
             that is fantastic. 

13
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,629
  ...and a whole lot of brunch. 

14
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:32,764
       In Oklahoma City...      

15
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,165
             You make everything
                 sound good.    

16
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,635
...a grill goes gangbusters with
        their recipes...        

17
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:38,504
                            Mmm.
    ...and their restaurant.    

18
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:41,907
   This is Taj Mahal stuff, bro.
Well, thank you.                

19
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,575
 A Baltimore spot killing it... 

20
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,244
        And the crowd goes wild!

21
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:47,579
   ...with their off-the-hook   
           a.m. eats.           

22
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:48,780
               That's an adult  
                French toast.   

23
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,248
  Oh, I like that.              

24
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,985
        And a funky find        
     in downtown Los Angeles    

25
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:55,187
           dishing out          
     scratch-made pastries.     

26
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:56,721
You should limit people         
to how many of those            

27
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,989

 and more off-the-hook flavors. 

30
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,063
   This is "Triple D Nation."

 but it doesn't make any sense. 

33
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,808
   I mean, like, 10 years ago,  
       I was here in OKC,       

34
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,277
    and I went to this place    
       called Nic's Grill.      

35
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,346

    And I just brought it up,   

36
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:22,748
      and it sent me here.

 Everybody loves going to Nic's.

    When I found Nic's Grill,   

51
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,043
        there was a house       
   behind a couple apartments.  

52
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:56,047
 You're a landlord, a homeowner,
             and a restaurateur,

53
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,384
   all within, eh, I want to say
         probably about 50 feet.

54
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,253
 About like that.               
                About like that.

55
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:04,456
That's about it.                
       Welcome to Oklahoma City.

       -All right, places.      

57
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,259
                What is this?   

58
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,927
      I mean, this is a monster.

59
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,195
This is my dream space.         

60
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,996
        So, this is similar food
          to like you were doing

61
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,731
                at Nic's Grill? 
Same burgers.                   

62
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,534
   I've just added              
 some lighter fares,            

63
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:18,270
like our goat tacos,            
which I really love.            

64
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:21,406
        I don't know that I'd go
  to Oklahoma City to try tacos,

65
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,508
 but because they're your tacos,
            I'll give it a shot.

66
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,210
        So, give me the rundown.
          How do you make these?

67
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:28,012
I take a whole leg of goat.     
We roast it, then shred it.     

68
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:32,351
Then we saute some onions and   
garlic and mushrooms.           

69
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:35,821
And then we add some tomato,    
wine, and Worcestershire.       

70
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,490
We'll add some spices, basil,   
     some lime,                 

71
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,558
      cinnamon,                 
 and then our goat.             

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,161
  We let it simmer              
for about three hours.          

73
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:44,829
  We do three tacos             
      an order.                 

74
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,898
                    Mmm.        

75
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,966
   What you think?              
  Aren't them good?             

76
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,302
             Delicious. I mean, 
        That's really good goat.

77
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:52,837
I just like the fact that you're
      making something like this

78
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,506
           and you make it sound
                  so good.      

79
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,241
             You make everything
                 sound good.    

80
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:59,711
     Look at me.                
I like to eat, brother.         

81
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,847
   It's kind of sweet, juicy.   

82
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,349
   Reminds me of a mixture of,  
 like, pulled pork and brisket. 

83
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,851
    Just really good flavor.    

84
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,452
     It pulls apart so easy.    

85
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,054
       You can definitely       
       taste the cinnamon.      

86
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,922
      It's just delicious.      

87
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,191
      WOMAN: From the tacos     
         to the burgers,        

88
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,126
  it's something for everyone.  

89
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,261
               Still doing the  
             onion burger here? 

90
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:17,462
      Yes, sir.                 

91
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:18,530
             What are we doing? 

92
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,664
  Just pattying up              
 some of my burgers.            

93
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,800
It's about a half a pound,      
somewhere around there.         

94
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,535
            You just roll 'em up
                and patty it.   

95
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,203
      I try not                 
to pack 'em too tight.          

96
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,005
 No, 'cause you push all the fat
   out of 'em when you cook 'em.

97
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,139
          -Absolutely.          
         -And that's it.        

98
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,008
      Let's go cook these.      
           -All right.          

99
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,211
First, I usually put some onions
and get them sauteing.          

100
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:34,146
         -Little butter.        
         -Lot of butter.        

101
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:35,280
  Get 'em grilling              
     down good.                 

102
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,748
And put our burgers on.         

103
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,216
             You threw the ball 
              of fun on there.  

104
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,217
                  And then      
         just smash it on there.

105
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,418
      This griddle's pretty hot.

106
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,554
The hotter the grill gets,      
the grease gets to flying,      

107
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,690
and that's what glazes          
   those buns over              

108
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:45,891
and puts a little extra.        

109
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,558
        You see the way his eyes
           sparkled a little bit

110
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,094
         when he started talking
                 about that.    

111
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,562
                It scares me.   

112
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,898
  A mess of onions.             

113
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,099
                    Whoa!       

114
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,101
     All right.                 
Let's get this baby off.        

115
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,903
             And what can I get 
           with these as a side?

116
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,104
    French fries                
 or mashed potatoes.

143
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,692
   So, what else is on the menu?
One of our lighter options,     

144
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,961
   chicken salad,               
is a pretty popular little item.

145
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,762
                   This is      
   a nice little setup, brother.

146
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,632
We make it by roasting off      
a chicken that we've seasoned   

147
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,368
      with salt                 
and pepper, butter, and garlic. 

148
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,836
  Once the chicken              
 is nicely roasted,             

149
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,305
we'll pull this all apart,      

150
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:07,839
   and we'll make               
  our chicken salad             

151
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,641
by adding red onions            
  and white onions.             

152
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,242
           What do I get in here
          that's a little sweet?

153
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,178
Got a two or three different    
styles of grapes in there.      

154
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,313
 Pecans and celery.             
  Some mayonnaise.              

155
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:20,185
And we add a little Cool Whip,  
 which fluffs it up.            

156
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,187
What do you think about that?   
                 It's delicious.

157
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:26,925
              It's a nice take  
 on a Waldorf salad. It's great.

158
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,660
  The Cool Whip made it kind of 
      have a sweeter taste.     

159
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,263
    Then you also get kind of   
 a little bit of a crisp taste, 

160
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:32,798
 you know, from the grapes, from
          the lettuce.          

161
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,666
      And the walnuts give      
   a nice little crunch, also.  

162
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,868
   WOMAN: Oh, it was so good.   
   The Cool Whip added, like,   

163
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,336
 a different sort of cream, but 
         kept it lighter        

164
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,471
   than a mayonnaise normally   
             would.             

165
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:42,674
