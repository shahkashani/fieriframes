       The chipotle smoked gouda
                is the bomb.    

120
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,926
           That needs to make it
            into my repertoire. 

121
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,394
              It's hard to say  
      that you learn a new trick

122
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:23,528
        in the world of burgers.

123
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:31,002
      Letting the tomato get hot
      and cook into that burger,

124
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,406
  you have the ingredients there
            of natural ketchup. 

125
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:35,941
               I'll tell you.   

126
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,208
      Really a righteous burger.

127
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,078
           You just got your own
           history-making moment

               in "Triple D".   

129
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,748
           That's gangster, man.
Thank you very much.            

130
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,154
         I took one bite        
    and it just blew my mind.   

131
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,489
                    MAN:        
        Definitely the top five.

132
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,224
Really?                         
              Yes. It's awesome.

133
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:54,226
                        Awesome.
Did you already have one?       

134
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:55,761
      Are you allowed to buy two
         when you come in line? 

135
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,963
I tried. But that way I don't   
have to wait in line again.     

136
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,631
       How long have you waiting
               in line before?  

137
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,899
 About half an hour.            

138
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,301
 No matter how long the line is,

139
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:04,369
   they're always saying hi to  
 people in the back of the line 

140
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,237
     and they're just making    
     everybody feel at home.    

141
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,573
  We've waited like 40 minutes  
         for a hot dog,         

142
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,042
  but we smiled the whole wait. 

143
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:12,311
       It's worth the wait      
  because the food's delicious. 

144
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,780
      FIERI: Even the food      
has something to say about that.

145
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,182
It's just allowing the taco     
to speak for itself.            

146
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,249
     Yeah, see?                 
   What'd it say?

  MAN: The Korean barbecue taco 
      is a short rib taco.      

165
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,160
         It's delicious.        

166
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,561
   Honestly, I probably eat it  
       five times a week.       

167
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,231
ELI: We're gonna do some        
Korean barbecue, bulgogi.       
                        Bulgogi?

168
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,498
   Yeah.                        
           You seem very Korean.

169
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,967
             Let's get into it. 

170
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,302
     We got some                
   beef short rib.              

171
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:12,504
We've already somewhat          
trimmed it off the bone.        

172
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:16,875
  Nice thin slices.             

173
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,513
Look at that. Beautiful.        
             We got this cut up.

174
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,247
Into the bowl right here.       
                           Okay.

175
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,318
So, we're just gonna make our   
little Korean barbecue marinade.

176
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,253
We're gonna start off           
with some dark brown sugar,     

177
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,724
  fresh cut ginger,             
fresh garlic, sesame oil.       

178
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,859
                 Sesame oil.    

179
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:37,195
      A little                  
fish [High-pitched] sauce       

180
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,463
            It gets hot in here,
                 doesn't it?    

181
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:42,267
[ Normal voice ] It does.       
And a little [High-pitched] soy.

182
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,868
    Might have melted some wires
                 there, son.    

183
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,336
[ Normal voice ] Yeah,          
   I think I did.               

184
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,205
And I put this lid on it,       
and then we just hit it.        

185
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,409
           [ Boing! ]           
 Oh, oh.                        

186
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,077
             What'd you forget? 
                Green onions?   
    Oh!                         

187
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,079
                    Yeah,       
        that would kind of help.
Yeah, that does help.           

188
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,081
    There we go.                

189
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:02,454
               Into the meat.   

190
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,293
  So, there we go.              
                       Great.   

191
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,028
                Now, how long   
       do you let that marinate?

192
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,029
Just two and a half hours.      

193
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,497
      So, let's                 
make this stuff, huh?           

194
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,833
              You go in just -- 
            right with your paw?

195
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,901
 Right with my paw.             
  No measurements.              

196
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,036
So, I'm gonna cover it.         

197
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,304
                   'Cause       
            it will cook faster.

198
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:20,972
   Keeps all that               
    moisture in.                

199
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,240
  I'll look at it.              

200
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,508
  [ High-pitched ]              
Oh, look at that caramelization 

201
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,976
 on the sugar there.            

202
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,377
   Mmm, mmm, mmm,               
      mmm, mmm.                 

203
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,781
  [ Normal voice ]              
  Flip that around.             

204
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,915
I'm gonna cover it again.       

205
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,518
  I'm a happy guy.              

206
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,187
                 You want to    
        get your tortilla ready.

207
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:36,321
                 What are we    
          gonna serve this with?

208
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,389
Dry slaw consists of            
    Napa cabbage,               

209
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,392
  daikon, carrots,              
   and scallions.               

210
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:41,927
Put a little cilantro           
      in there.                 

211
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:44,663
I'm gonna put a little          
citrus soy on that right now.   
                           Okay.

212
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:49,066
    My tongs out.               
Then the Korean barbecue.       

213
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,935
Yeah, getting a little bit      
 of caramelization.             

214
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,203
                    Okay.       
           That's how she works.

215
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,905
That's how she works.           
Get a little sriracha.          

216
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,449
                  You make      
             some good bulgogi. 

217
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,023
      The key to this really is 
   the phenomenal caramelization

218
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,925
         and flavor of the meat.

219
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,696
         That griddle is so hot,

220
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:19,964
           it's just cooking on 
   that sauce -- not burning it.

221
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,500
     'Cause there's a close line
               to burning it.   
Yeah.                           

222
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,501
           But look at the juice
            coming out of this. 

223
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,736
                 Fresh made.    

224
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,306
                You got this    
             chewy, tender meat,

225
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,975
       but then you get the nice
       bright, fresh, crispiness

226
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,378
       and you get that cilantro
          coming through there. 

227
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,314
It's just allowing the taco     
to speak for itself, you know?  

228
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:39,050
It's not a whole bunch
