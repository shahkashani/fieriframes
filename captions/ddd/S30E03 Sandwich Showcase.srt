00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,574
  It's soft, but it's got enough
 texture that it stays together.

116
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:07,379
The juxtaposition of the crunchy
        of the pickle and the...

117
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:08,313
   Crunchy cheese.              

118
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,848
             ...works dynamite. 

119
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,650
What really ties it all together
 is the horseradish cream sauce.

120
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,052
                 Fantastic.     

121
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:17,855
     That's a really heavy, rich
  meatloaf with a lot of flavor.

122
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,458
                It's not dry.   

123
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,594
         If you're going to make
   a chef's meatloaf, that's it.

124
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,529
Meatloaf sandwich to 205.       

125
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:25,997
   One of the best sandwiches   
            I've had.           

126
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,399
        And the meatloaf        
          is delicious.         

127
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:30,068
   The bread is clearly baked   
           with love.           

128
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,403
   Pancakes with fried chicken  
      and sriracha butter.      

129
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,939
   How do you guys              
describe this place?            

130
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,742
    Brunch meets punk rock meets
      the best drinks in Austin.

131
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,211
         It's very witty        
          and kitschy.          

132
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,647
  -Lights everywhere, and neon. 
        -It's really fun.       

133
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:43,882
         What are we going to do
                 after this?    

134
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,550
What we call a Monte Bisco.     

135
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:46,684
               A Monte Bisco?   

136
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,220
 Which is -- ha-ha,             
   a Monte Cristo.              

137
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,622
             Just let me finish 
              what I'm having.  

138
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,823
                  Alright,      
            so we're hanging out

139
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,425
             at the Holy Roller 
              in Austin, Texas. 

140
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:55,493
             When we come back, 
it's going to be time for the --

141
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,028
             ha-ha, Monte Bisco.

142
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,363
    Monte Bisco.                

143
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,698
   MAN: It's my go-to whenever  
        I need something        

144
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,167
           to probably          
     take a nap afterwards.     

145
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,501
              See you in a bit. 

146
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,536
                Monte Bisco.    

147
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:08,940
   I'm just following your lead.
               It's your song.  

148
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,275
        I'm just singing back-up
                 right now.     

149
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:12,143
                 Doop. Doop.    

150
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,747
         [ Both laugh ]         

151
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,014
                Welcome back.   
                 "Triple D,"    

152
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,151
   hanging out in Austin, Texas,
               at Holy Roller.  

153
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,685
       You got to love the name.

154
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,220
         Pancakes, 205.         

155
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:25,690
     Imagine a bar that has     
      brunch all the time.      

156
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,026
Like, your grandma's place      
listening to rock music.        

157
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,629
  FIERI: And flipping grandma's 
     recipes on their head,     

158
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,431
     thanks to Chef Callie.     

159
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,099
   SPEER: Alright,              
  fire Monte Bisco.             

160
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,167
     The Monte Bisco brings     
         so many things         

161
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,835
        together that are       
        rally unexpected.       

162
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,571
      It's a warm, buttery,     
          soft biscuit.         

163
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,439
    Turkey, bologna, arugula.   

164
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,708
 Blackberry jam, powdered sugar.

165
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,978
 But somehow, all these flavors 
          really work.          

166
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,247
So the biscuit is going to be   
the base of the dish            

167
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:50,782
that we call the Monte Bisco,   
   which is our...              

168
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:53,251
                The Monte Bisco?
...play on a Monte Cristo.      

169
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,453
        But made with a biscuit?

170
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:55,654
But made with a biscuit.        
                       Ha-ha.   

171
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,723
            I picked up on that.
   Ah. See how clever we are.   

172
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,991
 Toss all this flour            
into this food processor        

173
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,460
with whole cubed butter.        

174
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03,795
         Gravelly is the texture
             we're looking for. 

175
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,997
   Technical term.              
You give this a floof.          

176
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,066
Buttermilk.                     
                   What is      
            this funking butter?

177
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,068
    Heavy cream.                
    Sugar, salt.                

178
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,336
               Baking powder.   

179
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,737
We're basically going           
to laminate this dough.         

180
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:13,805
                 The layers     
               we build of it.  

181
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,140
                       Okay.    
      Correct.                  

182
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:17,475
And then at this point,         
we shall roll them out.         

183
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,544
                Look at that.   
  Layer after layer after layer.

184
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,078
They'll get egg-washed          
     on the top.                

185
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,280
                In the oven.    
                 What temp?     

186
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,749
350, about 20 minutes.          
      Now we're into the turkey.

187
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,484
 We brine our turkey            
in a sweet tea brine.           

188
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,553
     Oh, I like sweet tea brine.
  Peppercorns.                  

189
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,422
The lemons, we're going         
 to squeeze in here.            

190
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:32,423
                      Coriander.
    Brown sugar.                

191
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,359
                        Honey.  
Dip this tea bag in here.       

192
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:37,362
   Salt and some thyme, and then
      hot water to steep it all.

193
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,297
And then we're going to cool it 
down before we dump it          

194
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,966
  on top of turkey              
and leave it overnight.         

195
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,501
Then we just free-roast it.     

196
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,102
      350.                      
                Where we at?    

197
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,638
So, take this biscuit, and we're
going to do open-face like that.

198
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,039
                    Okay.       

199
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,041
We're going to tatter up        
some of this bologna            

200
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,176
   and this turkey              
to get it a little bit brown.   

201
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,445
          That turkey's no joke.

202
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:54,712
      So true.                  

203
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:55,781
 Monte Bisco style.             

204
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,114
                   Hit it       
        with the powdered sugar.

205
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,450
Blackberry thyme jam.           

206
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,318
                 You make that? 
       We do.                   

207
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
           Oh, the thyme in that
                  is money!     

208
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,722
 Turkey, bologna.               
             Nice small portion 
               you made there.  

209
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,190
This is the best part           
 of the whole thing.            

210
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,460
It's just kind of like aerated  
 Swiss cheese sauce.            

211
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:09,795
          You're making your own
             Swiss cheese sauce?

212
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:11,329
      Correct.                  

213
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,397
A little arugula salad,         
and then a little lemon zest.   

214
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,733
Normally, this gets an egg.     

215
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,735
  -Does it get a big egg on it? 
      -Right on top of it.      

216
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,269
Not today...                    
                I hate eggs.    

217
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,940
...which makes me so sad.       

218
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,609
              There's a saying  
               on "Triple D,"   

219
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,813
      and that's "If it's funky,
               I'll find it."   

220
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,481
     The tea brine of the turkey
                is delicious.   

221
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,883
         The turkey's fantastic.

222
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:35,487
           The biscuit itself --
       just flaky, just perfect.

223
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:38,156
    You tattered up the bologna,
       throw it on the flat-top.

224
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:41,860
      Then you made this aerated
             Swiss cheese sauce,

225
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,028
                 you give me    
         a blackberry thyme jam,

226
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,898
               powdered sugar,  
               baby arugula...  

227

   The Pasco Police Department  
      came and raised funds     

564
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,936
     to keep his doors open.    

565
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,137
We put the word of mouth out    

566
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,805
  and we bought him             
a couple more months,           

567
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,473
   and here we are              
  four years later.             

568
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,407
     FIERI: What's your favorite
             thing on the menu? 

569
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,609
     The Vinny's                
  chicken sandwich.             

570
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,944
             -Legit.            
             -Legit.            

571
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,078
   Got Vinny's chicken sandwich.

572
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,546
  MAN: Vinny knows his chicken. 

573
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,081
   Put it in that fresh bread,  
     and it's just perfect.     

574
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,616
            What are we going to
                    next?       

575
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,551
Wait, Hunter, you're not        
going to wait for your dad?     

576
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:41,818
                   Oh, no.      
      See, you don't understand.

577
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,221
           There's a new rooster
              in the hen-house. 

578
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:44,822
              -Oh.              
         -Hey, hey, hey.        

579
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,490
         Alright, Vinny,        
     watch out for this kid.    

580
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,359
 This is what's going to happen.
      You and I are asleep,     

581
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,027
    and you're coming to take   
      over the whole thing.     

582
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,329
    Give me a rundown, Chef.    
          What's next?          

583
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,899
              Okay.             
              A little marinade.

584
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,501
              Oil.              
Orange juice.                   

585
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:57,635
      Salt, and the garlic.     

586
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,969
            -Paprika.           
            -Pepper.            

587
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,304
          And a little          
         of the cumino.         

588
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,705
           What's the next step?
Marinate the chicken.           

589
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,840
CHARLIE: And it'll stay in there
    for 12 hours.               

590
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:04,842
      Now, how are we going     
          to cook them?         

591
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,310
   On a flat-top.               

592
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,645
 Grilled zucchinis.             

593
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,912
       Grilled zucchini in      
       a chicken sandwich?      

594
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,514
            -Oh, yes.           
       -This I got to see.      

595
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,249
      Do you like zucchini?     
                I love zucchini.

596
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,918
           Since when?          

597
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,786
We're going to do the spicy mayo
  for the sandwich.             

598
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,721
             Great.             
     For the Zucchini Twins.    

599
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,457
Mayo down with some paprika.    

600
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:20,924
     Your dad loves paprika.    

601
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,994
 Sun-dried tomatoes,            
and the kicker -- the chipotle. 

602
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,930
  So, the spicy mayo, the bread 
    that we baked ourselves,    

603
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:31,002
        and the zucchini,       
and the chicken, fresh tomatoes,

604
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,204
    red onion, in the panini.   

605
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,805
       This is the Vinny.       
       -This is the Vinny.      

606
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,073
              Okay.             

607
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:43,681
                     ♪♪         

608
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,749
       Are you not eating       
           at school?           

609
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:47,084
              What's going on?  

610
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:50,555
   Guys, that is a phenomenal   
        chicken sandwich.       

611
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:52,689
      The bread, of course,     
         is outstanding.        

612
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,958
   The flavors are in balance.  

613
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,028
     What do you think makes    
    the sandwich so dynamite?   

614
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,829
            HUNTER: The zucchini
              and the tomatoes. 

615
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,299
                 I like it.     

616
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:03,301
      We know you like it,      
             Hunter.            

617
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:04,568
       The zucchini melts.      

618
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,304
        It is so creamy.        

619
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:09,306
        That's a special        
        chicken sandwich.       

620
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,841
   SERVER: The Vinny's chicken  
        sandwich for you.

00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:13,177
           -Thank you.          
  -It's something very unique.  

622
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:14,177
                The zucchini.   

623
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,980
   Yeah, zucchini.              

624
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:17,914
You can't beat it.              
         Mariachi fries!        

625
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,850
   Vinny's is the place to be.  

626
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:22,453
  MAN: There's nowhere that has 
   this combination of flavors  

627
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,722
       along with the warm      
     and welcoming feeling.     

628
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:25,990
 -You guys should be very proud.
           -Thank you.          

629
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:28,125
        Congratulations.        
      I'll leave these two.     

630
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,727
   Okay.                        
              Okay?             

631
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,994
         Come on, Vinny.        
         We'll take off.        

632
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,263
    We'll see you next week.    
           "Triple D."          

633
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,999
        Good luck, guys.        
          Clean it up.          

634
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,534
   So that's it for this trip.  

635
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:38,201
        But don't worry,        
 there's plenty more "Triple D" 

636
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,137
  joints all over the country.  

637

     I'll be looking for you    
            next week           

638
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,908
 on "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

639
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,411
    Good afternoon, officer.    
  What seems to be the concern? 

640
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,279
                 Well, Chef,    
             I know who you are.

641
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,882
                   Hunter,      
     I know who you are as well.

642
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:55,086
              Christmas Rabbit, 
          I need to see some ID.

643
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,087
     Where did he come from?    

644
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,688
    What the...?
