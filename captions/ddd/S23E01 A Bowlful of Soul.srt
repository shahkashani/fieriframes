00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:01,800
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,268
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,671
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,806
          This trip...          

5
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,742
        Yeah!                   
   ...it's crazy characters...  

6
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:11,276
                I don't know    
          to take him seriously.

7
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:12,811
   ...dishing out hot bowls...  

8
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:14,813
    <i> Hot</i> is hot!                

9
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,081
        ...and cool soul.

00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,351
  In Los Angeles, California... 

12
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,886
      Yee-haw!                  

13
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:22,554
   ...an extreme chili joint.   

14
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:25,157
        He does not miss a beat.

15
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:27,492
   Suit me up for a wild ride.  

16
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,228
            Well, I'll tell you,
                  partner.      

17
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,896
          In Charlotte,         
        North Carolina...       

18
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:32,364
                 Here we go.    
           Let's get after this.

19
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,099
         ...a down-home         
        Southern spot...        

20
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,233
         I'm a grit-eating fool.

21
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,502
          ...launching          
    a full-flavor explosion.    

22
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,372
             This is a soul-food
                missile pop.    

23
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,774
   And in Las Vegas, Nevada...  

24
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:43,642
    Oh, brother.                
    ...over-the-top crepes...   

25
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,711
     That's like                
  liquid apple pie.             

26
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,046
           ...put out           
     by one surprising chef.    

27
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,647
     Crepe guy.                 
 You're kidding me.

29
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,317
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

30
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,720

           and Dives."          

31
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,068
    I'm here in Culver City,    
           California,          

32
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,804
      right down the street     
       from Sony Pictures,      

33
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:13,738
     and I know these parts     
          pretty well.          

34
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,740
         I used to shoot        
   "Guy's Big Bite" down here,  

35
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,942
    "Rachael vs. Guy: Kids,"    

36
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:19,011
     and I got to tell you,     
    I wish I would have known   

37
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:20,679
        about this joint        
       I'm about to visit.      

38
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:24,550
 I hear they're serving up eight
 different types of chili a day.

39
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:25,817
    That's my kind of joint.    

40
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,287
    This is Tub's Fine Chili    
        & Fancy Fixin's.        

41

 Cowhand Casserole.             

42
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,960
            Tub's is            
      a really unique spot.

     known as Rancher Rick.

      Yee-haw.                  

48
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,506
      Where'd you learn to cook?

49
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,309
 I just like to eat,            
so I learned to cook.           

50
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,844
          And in 2009,          
    he and his wife, Margie,    

51
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,980
           or BossMama          
      around these parts...     

52
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,448
 Chuck Wagon Grind,             
      no beans.                 

53
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,917
      ...turned that hobby      
    into a booming business.    

54
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,852
 Turkey Drive Chili             
   in a bread tub.              

55
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,454
     It has so much flavor.     

56
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,189
              MAN:              
It's one of the best ones, baby,

57
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,456
      'cause it's been here     
          the longest.          

58
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,860
Well, what we're gonna do is    
make our Turkey Drive Chili.    

59
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:09,861
                Turkey Drive.   
      So, we have ground turkey.

60
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,664
 We're gonna mix it             
with a little seasoning in here.

61
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,666
          A little chicken base?
      Yes, sir.                 

62
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,436
And what we want to do          
is get that all mixed in.       

63
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,607
             Onto a sheet tray? 
     Sheet tray.                

64
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:24,476
And then we're gonna score it   
into little squares.            

65
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,144
          You have too much time
               on your hands.   

66
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,345
    This is fun.                

67
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,815
Then it goes into the oven.     
        Roast that off how long?

68
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,017
About 40 minutes, 350.          
                    Okay.       

69
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:35,220
 Take some olive oil            
and a little onions.            

70
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:38,356
     He looks like he should run
      a chuck wagon, doesn't he?

71
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,291
        Yep.                    
We're gonna add our garlic.     

72
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:44,095
 Next thing going in            
is our roasted ground turkey.   

73
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,830
 Now can I dump some ingredients
                 in for you?    

74
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,966
     Please do.                 
Apple cider vinegar.            

75
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,636
   Okay. And a tremendous amount
              of chili powder.  

76
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:51,769
  It is good stuff.             

77
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,104
   That's paprika.              
                    Okay.       

78
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,840
All our chilies are tasty       
without being spicy.            

79
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,776
              So if people want 
       to spice it up, they can.

80
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,578
Tub's-Nitro-Tonic --            
     our T-N-T.                 

81
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,313
             Tub's-Nitro-Tonic. 

82
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,181
Next is Worcestershire.         

83
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,349
                  Oregano.      
  Mexican oregano.              

84
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,185
              Mexican oregano.  
 Mexican oregano.               

85
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,720
We got steak seasoning.         
      Sounds like a rattlesnake.

86
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:09,922
  Cajun seasoning.              

87
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:11,123
                  <i> Cumino.</i>      

88
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,125
             Uh... [ Whistles ] 
That's a Mexican beer.          

89
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:15,661
                That's a big    
                Mexican beer.   

90
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:17,596
   Yellow mustard.              
                    Okay.       

91
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,332
Get some tomato sauce           
      in there.                 

92
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:21,866
                Salsa fresca.   

93
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,536
     Yeah, it's                 
a Mexican tomato sauce.         

94
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,071
   Chicken stock.               

95
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:27,739
                That's a lot    
              of chicken stock. 

96
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,407
  We let it simmer              
  about half-hour,              

97
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,209
     then we add                
these green bell peppers.       

98
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,144
                    Okay.       
        And this is our oatmeal.

99
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,747
     That's our                 
 steel-cut oatmeal.             

100
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,549
     Next is...                 
       One of my favorite beans.

101
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,884
                Now, how long   
             is this gonna cook?

102
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,620
About 40 more minutes.          

103
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:42,688
               Now what's up?   

104
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,289
We're gonna make you            
    a bread tub.                

105
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,359
 Take our flatbread,            
drop it down for 50 seconds,    

106
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,894
and a bread tub comes out.      
Hence the name Tub's.           

107
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,098
     So the whole thing of Tub's
           comes from this idea?

108
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,099
    Pretty much.                

109
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,301
  All right. Chili.             

110
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,237
Help yourself to some fixin's.  

111
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,104
                    Okay.       
           I'm a sour cream guy.

112
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,173
        Good.                   

113
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:02,708
               Little cheese.

                 Here we go.    

343
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,314
                     Oh.        
       Right?                   

344
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,117
 That carne asada and that salsa
              with the guac --  

345
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,252
   Is there a Mexican restaurant
               in this village  

346
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,787
             that you're running
                out of town?    

347
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,189
                'Cause that's   
          what that tastes like.

348
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:05,456
       Dig it.                  

349
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,925
         The crepe -- fantastic.
              Nice and tender.  

350
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,195
           Little bit of cheese,
                lots of meat.   

351
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:11,663

352
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:14,199
  That citrus in the carne asada
                is fantastic.   

353
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:15,867
     Awesome fire-roasted salsa.

354
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,068
                    Mmm.        

355
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,403
               Well done, man.  
  Thanks, brother.              

356
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,004
        Table 22, Sonora.       

357
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,873
    It's the best carne asada   
         I've ever had.         

358
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,741
   It's real-deal.              
               It's real-deal.  

359

  You watch them put it together
           from start to finish.

  you got it -- the crepe cam.  

361
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:32,883
Having the camera and the lively
   atmosphere is really cool.   

362
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:36,688
   It is always fun, you know?  
There is constant communication.

363
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,023
             Empty crepe plates 
      make no money. Let's roll.

364
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,158
     They're entertaining us    
        the entire time.        

365
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,294
 Meanwhile, they're pumping out 
         all this food.         

366
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,163
     Table 16, William Tell.    

367
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:48,098
  It is like caramel apple pie  
           in a crepe.          

368
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,968
 Just the right amount of sweet.
 Fresh, homemade whipped cream. 

369
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,636
        It is delicious.        

370
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,372
       So, we go from the savory
                to the sweet?   

371
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,907
Savory to the sweet. Gonna start
with fresh-made caramel.        

372
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,176
                    Okay.       
  Granulated sugar.             

373
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:01,312
We got to get this down         
to a liquefied sugar.           

374
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,514
 Add a vanilla bean.            

375
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:03,648
                   Got it.      

376
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,383
  And cubed butter.             

377
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:08,853
Stir this in until the butter   
is completely melted.           

378
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,789
             I like how that is 
              so screaming hot. 

379
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,124
  Then a little bit             
 of vanilla extract.            

380
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,192
                    Okay.       

381
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,394
And we're gonna drizzle in      
  our heavy cream.              

382
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:19,597
 As this cools off,             
 it will thicken up.            

383
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,866
  At the very end,              
a touch of kosher salt.         

384
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,068
We cool it overnight,           
put it in a squeeze bottle,     

385
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,270
   and away we go.              
                    Nice.       

386
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,405
Down with the apples now.       

387
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,606
Fresh salted butter.            

388
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,875
Whole, peeled, sliced           
Granny Smith apples.            

389
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:34,212
Little bit of sugar,            
vanilla bean, ground cinnamon,  

390
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:35,813
little bit of vanilla extract,  

391
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,684
and some fresh lemon juice just 
to brighten up those flavors.   

392
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,753
    So just let them get tender?
About halfway cooked.           

393
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,421
       Then you're gonna pull it
                and cool it?    

394
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:44,689
Pull it and cool it.            
                   Got it.      

395
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:48,158
     Here we go -- crepe batter,
           along with the apples

396
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,361
        that we just cooked down
                 so lovely.     

397
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,629
     The homemade caramel sauce.

398

   or a car show,

              What kind of food 
         do you guys serve here?

457
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,458
Low Country and Southern.       
                And Southern.   

458
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,061
I think it tastes like something
that my grandma would cook.     

459
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,262
         Soul Rolls up.         

460
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,265
       The Soul Rolls are       
   everything you'd ever want   

461
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,199
        out of the South.       

462
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:11,469
Goodness wrapped and deep-fried.

463
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,137
                 Soul Rolls.    

464
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,473
Got to have a Soul Roll.        
   All right, well, get into it.

465
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,675
  Collard greens --             
    cut them up.                

466
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:23,614
             Garlic, olive oil, 
               onions, adobo.   

467
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,082
       Adobo?                   
                   Adobo.       

468
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,418
             Vinegar and water. 

469
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,219
And how long we gonna           
  let this go for?              

470
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,221
                    Hour.       

471
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,956
All right, what are we          
   into now, boss?              

472
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,958
   Well, we gonna               
  fry the chicken.              

473
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,627
I sprinkle our chicken          
     with adobo.                

474
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,729
           And then just regular
             all-purpose flour? 

475
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,098
All-purpose flour --            
       simple.                  

476
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,032
                    Okay.       

477
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:43,233
    Let me put it               
  in the fryer now.             

478
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,769
                 Here we go.    
           Let's get after this.

479
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,704
And what we do, we're gonna mix 
  it all together.              

480
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,773
          So, we got the greens.
       We got the fried chicken.

481
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,841
 This seasoned rice             
  that's delicious.             

482
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,711
  Black-eyed peas.              

483
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,247
Okay, what we're gonna do       
is put a wrapper down,          

484
00:16:56,249 --> 00:17:00,051
take a little bit here,         
   and we roll up,              

485
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:03,054
 and we top it with             
a little egg wash to seal it.   

486
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:06,123
     We take these to the fryer,
             cook them off, 350.

487
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,860
Then we just take them,         
  and we cut them.              

488
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,865
Drizzle a little spicy          
   honey-mustard.               

489
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,200
Then we do a little bit         
more garnish on them.           

490
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,335
               So, most folks   
         can't make it to Mert's

491
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,537
     without having a Soul Roll?

492
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,306
We try not to let them leave    
without having a Soul Roll.     

493
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,743
                    Mmm.        
     That's astronaut soul food.

494
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,012
     [ Laughs ]                 

495
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:30,148
          You know how they send
       the astronauts their food

496
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,083
   all prepared and ready to go?
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.             

497
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,951
             This is a soul-food
                missile pop.    

498
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,686
               This comes with  
             everything combined

499
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,221
        in one easy-to-eat bite.

500
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,689
I got to tell Vanessa           
     about that.                

501
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,691
     [ Laughs ]                 

502
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:43,428
              That's delicious. 

503
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,496
You guys ready to eat?          
              Yeah.             

504
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,698
       The Soul Roll's got      
       everything I like.       

505
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,034
        It's phenomenal.        
  It just pops when you eat it. 

506
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,303
      Where'd you learn to cook?
      Home Ec.                  

507
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,638
A friend of mine told me        
I could take Home Ec,           

508
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,240
meet girls, and eat.            
      I did it.                 

509
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,708
           I did the same thing.

510
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,444
              No, I'm serious.  
   I believe you.               

511
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,044
             FIERI:             
    And from the looks of it,   

512
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,648
  Chef James must have ended up 
        with an "A"-plus.       

513
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,916
        Barbecue ribs up.       

514
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,785
     Oh, so good. Everything    
  you order is just wonderful.  

515
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,254
    You get down-home cooking   
         fit for a king.        

516
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,589
  Shrimp and grits up, please.  

517
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,725
      James does a perfect      
   Southern shrimp and grits.   

518
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:17,728
   Brown gravy on top of it --  
             unreal.            

519
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,063
              What are we gonna 
                 make next?     

520
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:21,398
One of my other favorites,      
  shrimp and grits.             

521
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,733
     You understand something --

522
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,602
              my mom was raised 
             in North Carolina. 

523
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,603
 I didn't know that.            

524
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,405
                  Oh, yeah.     
         I'm a grit-eating fool.

525
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:30,208
I start with cold water,        
     margarine,                 

526
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,478
and my favorite grits are these 
yellow, organic, stone grits.   

527
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,945
               Whisk them in.   
      Yes, sir.                 

528
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,280
And the thing about grits --    

529
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,217
you got to keep stirring them   
so they do not stick together.  

530
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,418
              I got you there.  

531
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,822
 Some salt, cream --            
just makes it taste so good.    

532
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:47,624
   All right, so this takes care
             of the grits side. 

533
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,893
       So, what are we into now?

534
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:51,495
Well, we're gonna make          
 our gravy or sauce.            

535
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,496
                   Sauce.       

536
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:56,100
Oil, flour -- get that going.   

537
00:18:56,102 --> 00:19:00,170
Add water, garlic, beef base.   

538
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,907
     You look like you condensed
          a whole cow into that.

539
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:04,108
   Oh, not quite.               

540
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,510
 Add onions, garlic,            
     and adobo.                 

541
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,979
That's my middle name.          

542
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,246
        That's your middle name?

543
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,382
 Yes, sir. And then             
we're gonna make some shrimp.   

544
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:12,516
                Come on, now.   

545
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:13,985
  Add a little oil.             

546
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:17,254
I do about four, five,          
     six shrimp.                

547
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:21,258
Now we add a little brown gravy,
    green onions.               

548
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,128
My favorite -- you know that.   
                   I know.      
        That's your middle name.

549
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,930
    And tomatoes.               

550
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,865
             Let that cook down?
        Yeah.                   

551
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,000
       Okay, let's hit it, boss.

552
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,803
  Man, these grits              
  are looking good.             

553
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,071
    Here you go.                

554
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:38,342
I top it off with just          
a little bit more green.        

555
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,476
Now, this focaccia bread,       

556
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,545
we got a local baker            
that makes it for us.           

557
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:42,547
   It's delicious.              

558
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,552
                    Mmm.        
                That's tasty.   

559
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,086
Thank you, thank you.           

560
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:52,623
              This gravy's got  
      a nice, little tang to it.

561
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,758
             The grits got to be
             a little toothsome.

562
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,094
             Can't be too soggy.
         No.                    

563
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:59,029
                 Got to have    
          a little bite to them.

564
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,832
       Mmm. You're gonna have to
        pry this out of my hand.

565
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:02,967
                    Mmm.        

566
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,234
      Shrimp and grits on.      

567
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,303
   This is one of my favorite   
       things on the menu.      

568
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,439
 WOMAN: I do try to duplicate it
        when I get home,        

569

               Did you grow up  
       eating this type of food?

571
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,844
Yes. My grandmother's           
from South Carolina.            

572
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:15,445
     Did she put her foot in it?

573
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:19,383
She put her foot and love in it.
And this obviously has both.

   Everybody from out of town

    down-home country place.

    that invest so much in this.

579
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,864
             I mean, you embrace
              each little step  

580
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,666
                  like it's     
        the most critical piece.

581
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,335
               It's fantastic.

      but don't you worry.

   There's plenty more joints   
     all over this country!     

586
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,945

    [ As Christopher Walken ]   
 I come here for the ice cream. 

589
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,021

          in my pocket!
