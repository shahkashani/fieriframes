   the simplicity.

   We let the duck              
  speak for itself.             

331
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,930
            Well, it's not doing
              much of that now. 

332
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,199
  It's not quacking             
       at all.                  

333
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:15,800
                  Not what      
          it's quacked up to be.

334
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,335
  Nope. We're gonna             
 wrap it with foil.             

335
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,936
         And we're gonna do this
              in the wood oven? 

336
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,138
A minimum of five hours.        

337
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,406
                Pull it out,    
               shred the meat.  

338
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,074
       Then you use the leftover
         rendered skin and bones

339
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,210
   -to make your next confit.   
           -Yes, sir.           

340
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,279
             A nicely rolled out
             piece of flatbread.

341
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,281
We're gonna put a little bit    
of mozzarella cheese.           

342
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,416
             -Okay.             
    -We got duck confit next.   

343
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,885
Nice little bit of duck         
   in every bite.               

344
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,353
  Pickled shallots.             

345
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,154
      -Our barbecue sauce?      
   -House beer barbecue sauce.  

346
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,424
              Got it. How long  
             is this gonna take?

347
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,226
 Two minutes is what            
 we're shooting for.            

348
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:43,227
               Oven's running   
                 about 650?     

349
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,429
              -Yep.

350
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,498

351
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,502
  So, duck confit.              

352
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,907
Some fried shallots.            
A little fresh chives.          

353
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,375
            More barbecue sauce?

354
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,077
Just to set the flavor off.     

355
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,583
               You know what?   

356
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:09,654
        If I didn't know better,
 with the richness and tanginess

357
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,789
              and the saltiness 
           of what you're doing,

358
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,325
   you might be inspiring people
             to drink more beer.

359
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,726
        I'm going out on a limb,

360

      if you've thought of this.

361
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,730
It's a side thought.            

362
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:21,132
               It's delicious.  

363
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,267
                   The way      
            you make your dough,

364
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,602

        together, it's dynamite.

365
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:26,737
               The confit duck  
               is just enough.  

366
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:27,872

367

            That is outstanding!

545
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,769
          It's not so spicy that
     you don't taste everything.

546
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,972
             That right there is
       one of the best empanadas

     -Oh, this is addicting.    

549
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:14,645
   -This is illegal actually.   
   -I don't want to see that!

   with the chimichurri sauce.  

554
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,455
      That rush and flavor      
       just comes at you.       

555
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:25,989
              Got a little bit  
                  of heat?      

556
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,792
    Yeah, when you got hair like
that, though, it doesn't matter.

557

          You could do anything.

           Fantastic.           
        It's just great.

560
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,196
              and it comes out  
              in the empanada.  

561
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:36,266
         And you are the maestro
             of the crazy band.

             You are fantastic. 
    Watch out for this guy, huh?
