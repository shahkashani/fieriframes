1
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:03,135
   You know, people are asking  
          all the time,         

2
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:04,736
  "Hey, Guy, that one joint you 
  checked out in that one city  

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,938
       when you were doing      
  'Triple D,' how they doing?"  

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,574
    "You know, I don't know.    
    We should check it out."    

5
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:13,612
    Over the years, I've seen   
       and tasted it all.       

6
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,414
       This is ridiculous, dude.

7
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,615
  But it turns out it was only  
          the beginning         

8
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,752
       because "Triple D"       
  joints have been blowing up,  

9
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:23,155
   and we're going back to see  
         what's cooking,

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,358

12

Oh!

17
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,170

     your mother's cooking.     

18
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:40,372

30
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,266
 So I'm hanging out             
 with my buddy Shane            

31
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:08,200
from Hodad's Burgers.           

32
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:11,136
Now, Shane, let's see,          
    back in 2013,               

33
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,138
  your dad took me              
 to OB Noodle House,            

34
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,606
which is, what, like,           
seven blocks that way?          

35
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,008
              -Yep.             
       -All right, Hodad.       

36
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,976
             This is the joint. 
               How's the food?  

37
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:20,546
  Food is amazing,              
and the story is even better.   

38
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:21,980
        That's my kind of joint.

39
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:25,550
FIERI: The Bossman, Mike Hardin,
 was a local Ocean Beach legend 

40
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:29,421
    who owned Hodad's, one of   
     "Triple D's" OG joints     

41
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:34,693
       until unfortunately      
     he passed away in 2015.    

42
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,828
   So since then,               
 you've taken over.             

43
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,330
You're running Hodad's,         

44
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,031
   and these guys               
have opened up a new joint.     

45
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,099
 Have you been here?            

46
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,235
       Oh, yeah, OB Noodle House
                  Bar 1502?     

47
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:44,369
       Legit?                   
                       Oh, yeah.

48
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,038
      Let's go.                 

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,640
        Wagyu short ribs,       
           bar three.           

50
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:51,643
 They have a lot of Asian fusion
  things, some Vietnamese food. 

51
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,846
  They have some Korean wings,  
      really, really cool.      

52
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:56,048
   And I got the pork belly taco
                 right here.    

53
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,717
  Once they were on "Triple D," 
      it blew up even more.     

54
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,452
         Everybody knows        
       the Yeng brothers.       

55
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,588
They do so much for Ocean Beach.

56
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,123
 FIERI: He's talking about Steve
          and Kyle Yeng         

57
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,725
  of Ocean Beach in San Diego.  

58
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:07,926
           Wait, what?          
       Who's the new one?       

59
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:09,994
 Who's the new one?             
Oh, he's my younger brother.    

60
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,396
        Yeah, but he was        
         in high school.        

61
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,131
He was in high school.          

62
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,000
     I first met these guys     
          back in 2013          

63
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:20,739
 when they were a lone location 
  a few blocks from the beach.  

64
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,074
 How did this place come about? 

65
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:24,343
     "Triple D"                 
is just a phenomenon.           

66
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:26,878
The wait got up to be           
  about 3, 4 hours,             

67
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,614
     and, like,                 
   "What do we do?              

68
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:31,583
Let's open 7 blocks away,"      
so here it is, Bar 1502.        

69
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,885
   Is it still some of the OB   
  Noodle House favorites here?  

70
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:34,820
        Yep.                    
        Yeah.                   

71
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,087
          You still get         
       the real-deal pho?       

72
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,422
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.               
        Pho-get about it.       

73
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:38,890
           I love pho.          

74
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,892
FIERI: This is what goes        
   into your pho?               

75
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,027
Oh, I got to see this.          

76
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,495
           -All right.          
           -All right.          

77
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,830
So start it off, first thing up,
loading up the bones.           

78
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,831
                         Uh-huh.
Now we go with oxtails.         

79
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,433
          Next, we got briskets.

80
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:49,835
There's a ton of meat.          

81
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,637
              Yeah, and here is 
                 drop loin,     

82
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,506
   tendons, salt and rock sugar,
              shallots, ginger. 

83
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,708
        We let this go for about
             another 45 minutes.

84
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,643
All this work and effort        

85
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,044
  makes 20 gallons              
   worth of broth.              

86
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:00,245
          Of concentrated broth.

87
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,247
Wow, what a process,            
     every day?                 

88
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,248

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,649

00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:05,850

                meat in here.   

91

This is how much meat           
you put in this bowl?           

92
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,789
           That's why we call it
         the number-one special.

93
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,191
      Just like that, it's done.

00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,414
            they add            
   something new to the menu.   

230
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,015
  So what else is on the menu,  
              guys?             

231
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,150
   It's San Diego,              

232
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,019
and so we have to come up       
with a Taco Tuesday,            

233
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,155
     so we added                
the pork belly taco.            

234
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,490
    KYLE: And the first thing   
     we're going to make --     

235
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,024
   the pork belly taco sauce.   

236
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,960
     We use the bone marrow     
          from our pho          

237
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:18,029
    and scoop the bone marrow   
       out the beef bones.      

238
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:21,299
 Now we're gonna puree this and 
 add it to our pork belly sauce,

239
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,767
   mayo, homemade satay sauce,  

240
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:26,171
   homemade sweet chili sauce,  
   and last, our bone marrow.   

241
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,505
 Now we can make our marinades. 

242
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,574
    This is the same marinade   
     we used for our Korean     

243
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:32,577
   short ribs, but this time,   
 we add a little pineapple juice

244
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,679
      to add a little tang      
       and a little acid.       

245
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:39,184
    To make our pickle salad,   
     we'll sweat the cabbage    

246
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,652
           and carrot           
    to draw out the moisture.   

247
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,988
    Add our pork to our steam   
       bun, pickle salad.       

248
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,990
 Add our taco sauce that we made
    with bone marrow earlier,   

249
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,059
       top with cilantro.       

250
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,995
  Pork belly tacos, bar three.  

251
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,531
     It's really good, man,     
          really good.          

252
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,867
             Try it?            

253
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,869
              Hey.

  No, I don't want it back now! 

256
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:05,544
 There's this really sweet sauce
          that's in it,         

257
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,746
     and it goes really well    
 with the caramelized pork belly

258
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,148
     and pickled vegetables,    
         just all good.

260

        a ton of flavor.

00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,409
   That award-winning barbecue  
       is now rolling out.      

347
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,279
         [ Horn honks ]         

348
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,480
We opened a food truck.         

349
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,881
      Such a fun addition.      

350
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,150
      You don't have to go      
       to the restaurant.       

351
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:34,418
  You can find the food truck.  
      I think it's amazing.     

352
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,820
  Jalapeño loin up!             

353
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,089
      FIERI: And everything     
 on the menu is road-trip ready 

354
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,158
     like the smoked Philly.    

355
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,959
    DARREN: Every time I went   
        to New York City,       

356
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,094
        I ended up eating       
     this roast pork Philly,    

357
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,229
     and it was really good.    

358
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,965
     We decided to bring it     
          back to Iowa          

359
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:50,235
   and put our own spin in it   
by using a smoked pork shoulder.

360
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,436
        We're gonna apply       
 some of our Smokey D's BBQ rub.

361
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,840
 It's got salt, sugar, paprika, 
     a little chili powder.     

362
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,241
      We're gonna put them      
         in the smoker.         

363
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:00,911
    Cook these at 200 degrees   
       for about 12 hours.      

364
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,114
          We're making          
      our garlic au jus --      

365
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,315
      onion, fresh garlic,      

366
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:07,785
   Worcestershire, water, beef  
        paste, red wine,        

367
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,521
          fresh thyme,          
   fresh oregano, fresh basil.  

368
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,123
    Let this simmer 2 hours.    

369
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:16,461
 Start with a really nice white 
crispy roll, peppers and onions.

370
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,728
  Take our smoked pork shoulder 

371
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,265
      and then dip it down      
      in that garlic au jus     

372
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:21,666
     and off to the flattop,    

373
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:25,536
   peppers and onions on there  
     with provolone cheese.     

374
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,805
     Pork Philly for Jason.     

375
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,606
                 Right here.    

376
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,676
Tender meat, first thing you hit
  is the peppers and the onions 

377
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:34,212
   and then slow-smoked pork.   
         It's very good.        

378
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,548
     The pork just gives it     
      a nice mellow flavor.     

379
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,016
     The au jus is amazing.     

380
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:40,951
 It just gives it a whole nother
   level of flavor complexity,  

381
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,221
         and if I could,        
 I would drink it with a straw. 

382
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,892
  FIERI: And he's added another 
     meal to the menu, too.     

383
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:50,628
 Nothing like a little barbecue 
           in the a.m.          

384
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,163
 You wouldn't think of barbecue 
         for breakfast,         

385
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,198
   but it's my favorite thing.  

386
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,434
FIERI: Like the walking biscuits
           and gravy.           

387
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,302
     We've got fresh ground     
         pork trimmings.        

388
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,837
         We're gonna add        
       two of my favorite       

389
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,305
   competition barbecue rubs.   

390
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,041
        Add a little salt       
        and pepper to it,       

391
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,308
    and then we get our sage.   

392
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,443
      We mix that by hand.      

393
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,979
    Now we're gonna brown off   
          the sausage.          

394
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,114
   We're gonna make our roux.   

395
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:14,051
   We're gonna add some flour,  
  heavy cream, salt and pepper. 

396
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,052
          Let it cook.          

397
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,654
       Scoop of this gravy      
         in the bottom,         

398
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,189
   and then we're gonna cut up  
  one of our homemade biscuits, 

399
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,125
   gonna put that in the cup,   
 a little more gravy on the top,

400
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,393
     top it with some bacon.    

401
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:23,794
     Everybody likes bacon.     

402
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,530
 Our walking biscuits and gravy.

403
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,465
         Order for Tom!         
                    Thanks, sir.

404
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:28,866
     MAN #3: It's contained.    

405
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,269
     It doesn't get all over    
  my shirt, creamy, delicious.  

406
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,204
    The biscuits weren't dry,   
            awesome.            

407
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,274
 The best part is there's bacon 
     on the top, delicious.     

408
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:39,210
 God knows there's no calories, 
        so that's great.        

409
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,878
             I heard everything 
               is calorie-free  

410
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,481
             as long as you stay
    in the specially atmospheric

411
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,417
             pressure zone here 
          of the Pork Colosseum,

412
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:49,287
             but when you leave,
             you're on your own.

413
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:54,158
         The food is legit, man.
          You are the real deal.

414
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,226
     Thank you.                 
                      Thank you.

415
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,561
              No wonder you win 
                all the time.   

416
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,228
                Take a break!   
               Go on vacation!  

417
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,898
       Take, like, 10 years off.

418
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,701
        Actually, don't.        

419
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,970
        The nation needs        
      that killer barbecue.     

420
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,640
      Maybe just bring your     
    "A" game down to a B-plus   

421
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:11,041
to give everybody else a chance?

422
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,443
 And coming up in New Orleans...

423
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,845
    This is what                
 the show is about.             

424
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,713
       ...a place that got      
         a second chance        

425
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,782
      and came back better      
           than ever.           

426
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,183
  Look what you got             
   going now, man.              

427
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,794
      FIERI: Back in 2010,      

428
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,195
      I went to this joint      
         in New Orleans         

429
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,664
      about 3 miles outside     
     of the French Quarter.     

430
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,199
   Now, Katrina had hit hard,   

431
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,869
     and it took him almost     
       5 years to reopen,       

432
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:40,805
 but they got down to business, 
 and they're still going strong.

433
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,406
       One Legend in the window.

434
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,042
        This is Katie's.        

435
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,814
      Since I'm from here,      
   I know where good food is.   

436
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,615
        I can say this is       
        one of the best.        

437
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,684
    I think "Triple D" showed   
            the world           

438
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,753
   what Katie's was capable of  

439
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:58,822
      and what New Orleans      
  was capable of after Katrina. 

440
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,825
     FIERI: After the storm,    
        owner Scot Craig        

441
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,426
  had his work cut out for him. 

442
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,228
What happened?                  
                7 feet of water.

443
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,030
As high as the doorjambs?       

444
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:07,231
                    Yeah.       

445
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,033
   SCOT: You reopen a business  
         after something        

446
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,701
  as big as Hurricane Katrina.  

447
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,370
  Then "Triple D" comes along,  

448
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,705
    and it literally changed    
       my life overnight.       

449
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:18,442
   We had a line of people out  
   the door the very next day.  

450
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,078
   It's just an amazing thing.  

451
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,378
     How do you                 
  explain the food?             

452
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,047
                 We call it     
           neighborhood cuisine.

453
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,215
 What are we making?            

454
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,918
           Our crawfish beignet.
             Here is our dough. 

455
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,920
               We're gonna put  
      our buttercream reduction,

456
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:32,856
          whole milk mozzarella,
  Provel cheese, cheddar cheese,

457
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,326
             Louisiana crawfish 
          and pickled jalapeños.

458
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,195
  You're making me              
     a calzone!                 

459
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,597
            If it was a calzone,
    it would go in a pizza oven.

460
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:43,801
     Guy and I did not agree    
     that it was a beignet.     

461
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,736
  You're gonna call             
   that a beignet?              

462
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,272
       Because I can do anything
                I want to do!   

463
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:52,143
 Any fried dough, no matter what
fried dough it is, is a beignet.

464
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,411
       Cuckoo.

       an oyster margarine      

474

    because butter will burn.

   white pepper, black pepper   

476
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:20,037
   and then Italian seasoning,  
a little bit of Parmesan cheese.

477

 We were having the chargrilled 
 oysters one night, and he said,

482
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,782
       "Dude, these really      
         need a sauce,"         

483
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:35,719
 so I came back here, and I made
     a creamy cheese sauce.     

484
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,989
 It's almost like you're making 
           an Alfredo,          

485
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:41,659
  heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, 
     Provel cheese, spinach.    

486
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:44,595
  Now I'm gonna put some shrimp 
    in it, house-made bacon.    

487
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,197
     We're letting the sauce    
    just kind of simmer here,

    to Coach Mark Slessinger.

            to Scot,            

490
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,673
        and he came back        
     with an incredible mix     

491
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,476
           of Provel,           
        spinach, shrimp.        

492
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,144
 It's a whole meal unto itself. 

493
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,346
        These oysters are       
       absolutely amazing,      

494
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,548

         the cheesiness.        

495
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,150
   There's also shrimp on top.  

496
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,052
         You get, like,         
      double the goodness.      

497
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,022
All right. What are we doing    
 to this pork butt?             

498
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,824
It looks like you're making     
a nice little dry rub for it.   

499
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,960
                   We got       
          a little onion powder.
Okay.                           

500
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,695

      pepper, some white pepper,

00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,766
            salt, cumin, paprika
         and then the old secret

503
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,901
            ingredient over here
             that if I tell you,

        I got to kill you, so...

505

  Cajun seasoning.              

506
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:27,705
    He busted me on that one.   

507
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:28,973
             We just stir it up.

Very nice.                      

510
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,111
                 And I come     
          with a little parsley,

511
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,580
                 then hit it    
           with a little garlic.

512
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:36,780

              when I was a kid.
