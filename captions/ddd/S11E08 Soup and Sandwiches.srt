        IT COOKS DOWN.          

276
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,969

                  THAT'S FREAKY.
YEAH.                           

349
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,683
      THIS IS ALL EDIBLE TURTLE?

350
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,818
ABSOLUTELY. THIS IS WHERE MOST  
 OF THE MEAT COMES FROM HERE,   

351
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,555
IN THE SHOULDERS AND THE LEGS.  
NOW WE'LL LOWER IN THE TURTLE.  

352
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,691
NOT A SCENE THAT YOU SEE        
EVERY DAY ON TRIPLE "D."        

353
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,226
NOW THE TEA.                    
                  AND NOW WATER.

354
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,629
     NOW IT COOKS FOR 45 MINUTES
             TO AN HOUR,        

355
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:27,097
            GET THAT TURTLE MEAT
              NICE AND TENDER.  

356
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:31,703
IT'S... READY?                  
              COOKED AND COOLED,
               RIGHT IN THE PAN.

357
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:35,440
  I'M AFRAID TO ASK,            
WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?           
     WE'RE GONNA PICK THE TURTLE
          OUT OF THE SHELL.     

358
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,508
                     LET'S GO IN
                     UNDERNEATH.

359
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,643
WHOA, YEAH!                     
                    SHELL'S OFF.

360
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,080
IT'S LIKE HE TORE OFF THE ROOF  
        OF A MINIVAN.           

361
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,715
LOOK AT THAT.                   
                  THIS IS       
           THE BREASTPLATE HERE.

362
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,251
                      COMES OFF.
WOW, IT'S LIKE RUBBER.          

363
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,053
AND YOU WANT TO TRY AND LEAVE IT
     AS CHUNKY AS POSSIBLE,     

364
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,522
    'CAUSE WE CAN ALWAYS MAKE IT
       SMALLER LATER, BUT, UH,  

365
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:54,726
                 RUSTIC IS WHAT 
               YOU'RE GOING FOR.
   MM-HMM.                      
WHERE WE AT?                    

366
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:55,993
      PUTTING THE SOUP TOGETHER.

367
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,862
          WE'RE GONNA START     
     WITH SOME BUTTER, 2 POUNDS,

368
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,530
              CARROTS, CELERY...
CELERY.                         

369

                        ONION...
ONIONS.                         

370
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,935
      A LITTLE MIREPOIX. SWEAT  
    THE VEGETABLES A LITTLE BIT,

371
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:07,338
            AND THEN WE'RE GONNA
                MAKE A ROUX.    
GO TO THE FLOUR.                

372
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,008
 WE'LL ADD IN THE SNAPPER STOCK,
    TOMATO JUICE, DRY SHERRY,   

373
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,744
         AND YOU WANT TO GIVE IT
            A NICE HARD WHISK.  

374
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,746
                 NOW WE'RE GONNA
                   ADD WATER... 
WORCESTERSHIRE.                 

375

377
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,886
AND THIS?                       
                KITCHEN BOUQUET.

378
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:24,689
           NOW WE'LL BRING IT UP
                TO A SIMMER.    
ADD THE...                      
(whistles)                      

379
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,624
        IN GOES THE TURTLE MEAT.
CHICKEN OF THE SWAMP.           

380
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,893
        WE'RE GONNA START WITH  
      THE PADDLE, NOT THE WHISK,

381
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:32,163
  BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO BREAK
       UP THE MEAT TOO MUCH.    
NO, WE DON'T.                   

382
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,631
        SO WE'LL JUST BRING THAT
          BACK UP TO A SIMMER,  

383
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:36,167
         AND THEN WE TURN IT OFF
              AND SERVE IT.     
IT'S TURTLE TIME.               

384
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,769
          COUPLE DASHES OF THAT.
WHAT IS THIS?                   

385
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,904

VERY NICE.                      

386
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:42,840
                         CHUNKY.
CHUNKY.                         

387
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:45,043
  MMM. THE TURTLE'S             
A LITTLE CHEWY FOR ME,          

388
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:48,913
  BUT COME ON, IT'S A TURTLE.   
GOT A NICE GRAVY TEXTURE TO IT. 

389
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:52,183
    I LOVE THE ALLSPICE.        
I LOVE THE TEA THAT WAS MADE.   

390
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,651
THAT'S THE BACKBONE,            
AND I GOTTA TELL YOU,           

391
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,453
I WALKED INTO THIS              
A LITTLE FEARFUL,               

392
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,988
   BUT I WILL BE                
VERY TRUE WITH YOU--            

393
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,990

  IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO TRY

DIFFERENT, WITHOUT QUESTION,

396

      IT'S AWESOME FLAVOR.

            CREAMY, CHOWDER-Y,  

398
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,935

       EVERYTHING THEY'RE

00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:08,119
   <i> FROM A FAMILY RECIPE...</i>     
                   HALF RAVIOLI.

445
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,987
      THEY WERE BROUGHT OVER BY 
     MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER CLARA.

446
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:12,456
     <i> AND DECADES LATER...</i>      
                    RAVIOLI, UP.

447
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,858
 <i> GREAT-GRANDSON DREW ABRUZZESE</i> 
 <i> IS THE ONE CRANKIN' 'EM OUT.</i>  

448
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,862
SO WE'RE SET WITH THE MEAT      
  FILLING FOR THE RAVS.         
                            YEP.

449
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:20,531
NOW WAS THIS HAMMERED OUT       
     BY PAUL REVERE?            

450
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,733
    WE FOUND IT IN THE BASEMENT,
         SO YOU NEVER KNOW.     
NO, YOU DON'T.                  

451
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:25,802
INTO THE PIPING BAG.            
      AND THE DOUGH IS AS SIMPLE
            AS SIMPLE GETS.     

452
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:28,472
            IT'S FLOUR AND EGGS.
IT'S LIKE MUSIC                 
  TO MY EARS.                   

453
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:29,941
                 WE'LL MIX IT   
              FOR THREE MINUTES.
THAT'S IT?                      

454
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,810
                      THAT'S IT.
OKAY, SO THE DOUGH'S            
HAD A CHANCE TO REST,           

455
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,346
AND NOW WE'LL SHEET THE PASTA,  
      MAKE THE RAVIOLIS.        
                     ABSOLUTELY.

456
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,348
ALL SO SIMPLE.                  

457
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,816
               GET THAT STARTED.

458
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,684
            AND THE THICKNESS   
        ON THIS HAPPENS TO BE 7.

459
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,554
      SO LOTS OF FLOUR          
SO IT DOESN'T STICK AND BIND.   

460
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,756
            WE'LL GO AGAIN,     
       DROP IT DOWN ONE SETTING.

461
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,825
NOW THIS WILL BE                
   THE TRIPLE?                  
                  THIS WILL BE  
                THE TRIPLE HERE.

462
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,628
     DOING THE TRIPLE           
TO GET IT TO THE RIGHT SIZE     

463
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,964
SO IT'LL GO THROUGH.            
        HIT IT WITH A LITTLE BIT
               MORE FLOUR,      

464
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,798
         ONE SETTING LESS AGAIN.
               NUMBER 3, 2,     

465
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,167
          WE'RE GOING DOWN TO 1.
LOOK AT THAT.                   

466
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,570
THAT'S CRAZY.                   
                   FILLING'S    
              IN THE PIPING BAG,

467
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,572
           STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN.
               ROLL IT OVER.    

468
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,107
           NOW THE OTHER HALF.  
         STRAIGHT WITH THE LEFT,

469
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,776
             CUP WITH THE RIGHT.
WHAT IS THIS,                   
"KARATE KID"?                   

470
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:08,378
WHAT DO YOU THINK?              
                    LOOKS GREAT.

471
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,448
THIS...                         

472
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,383
      OKAY, CUT THEM, SEAL THEM,

473
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,784
                  AND FOR THAT, 
                WE USE OUR FORK.

474
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:16,653
THAT, WITHOUT QUESTION,         

475
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,589
IS THE ULTIMATE                 
 RAVIOLI TOOL.                  

476
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:22,193
                 WE HAD ONE MADE
                     FOR YOU.   
DUDE!                           

477
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:25,529
             JUST PRESS TO SEAL,
               AND THAT'S IT.   
WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP,           
        BOSS?                   

478
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:29,133
           GET 'EM IN THE WATER.
    NOW WE'RE JUST WAITING      
TO COOK THE PASTA DOUGH ITSELF. 

479
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:31,135
SO GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN          
   ON THE MARINARA.             
                IT'S VERY BASIC.

480
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:34,539
   OLIVE OIL, GARLIC, AND CANNED
       ITALIAN PLUM TOMATOES.   

481
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,540
SAN MARZANO?                    
                    SAN MARZANO.

482
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,409
MMM.                            
                    AND RIGHT ON
                   TO THE PLATE.

483
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:41,946
LOOK AT THAT.                   
       TOUCH IT UP WITH A LITTLE
         FRESH CHOPPED PARSLEY, 

484
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:43,614
                AND SOME GRATED 
               LOCATELLI ROMANO.

485
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,617
NOW THAT'S A FORK.              

486
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,154
MMM. THAT IS ALL THRILLA,       
        NO FILLA.               

487
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,956
 YOU'VE GOT THE BALANCE--       
EXACT AMOUNT OF CREAMINESS.     

488
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,493
YOU TASTE THE TEXTURE           
IN THE RICOTTA STILL,           

489
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:56,960
THEN YOU GET THE TEXTURE        
      IN THE MEAT,              

490
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,962
   AND THE FLAVOR'S             
RIGHT ON POINT WITH IT.         

491
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,567
THE MARINARA ADDS THAT ACID,    
 A LITTLE BIT OF THAT STING     

492
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,568
FROM SOME OF THAT CHEESE        
  RIGHT ON TOP OF IT.           

493
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,437
HERE, YOU WANT                  
 TO TRY SOME?                   

494
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:09,040
OH, I'M SORRY.                  
                (woman) HOMEMADE
                 CHEESE RAVIOLI.

495
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,976
 IT'S SO NICE AND THIN AND FRESH
     AND DELICIOUS AND LIGHT.   

496
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,378
      THAT'S HOW YOU REALLY TELL
     THAT IT'S HOMEMADE RAVIOLI.

497
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,380
     (man) CHEESE RAVIOLI.      
                   AND THE SAUCE
                  IS PERFECTION.

498
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:20,117
 (woman) MUSSELS AND LINGUINI.  
  THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT  
  PEOPLE TAKE PRIDE IN DOING,   

499
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,788
    AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT    
         EXTRA SPECIAL.         
               IT'S A LITTLE BIT
                   LIKE HOME.   

500
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,991
         HOW'S EVERYONE         
        ENJOYING THINGS?        
          YOU GET THAT FEELING  
         AS SOON AS YOU WALK IN.

501
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:29,860
            HUGS AND KISSES,    
        AND THEY KNOW RIGHT AWAY

502
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:32,930
               TO BRING MY GLASS
                    OF WINE.    
       I DIDN'T--               
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT--        

503
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,533
I GOT NO HUG, NO KISS,          
     AND NO WINE.               

504
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,068
I HAD TO CLEAN                  
 THE TURTLE.                    

505
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,471
SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS EDITION OF
 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES."

510
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,749

     LANDMARK, SACRAMENTO,      

511

    YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT,    
    AND THE STEAK SANDWICHES    

512
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:58,356
