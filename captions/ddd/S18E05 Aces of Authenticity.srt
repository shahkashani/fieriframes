 Hey, everybody, I'm Guy Fieri, 
      and we're rolling out

          This trip...

 Too legit to quit.

    ...with food's big three.

 Mexican, Italian, and Chinese. 

10
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:20,352
Is it the real deal?

That's how I keep my peppers.

      into the noodle king.     

30
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,454
       Like a rocket ship       
      in Flavortown, baby.

          So, I'm here          
    in Santa Fe, New Mexico,    

36
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:18,877
   the desert high country --

       one of the greatest      
      chili-growing regions

     in the United States --    

39
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,415
    and I'm here to check out   
          a restaurant.         

40
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,217
        Now, get this --        
 The owner was born in the house

41
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,620
 that turned in the restaurant, 
 and he's named the restaurant  

42
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,489
      after the small town      
        that he lived in        

43
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:32,024
    that grows great chilies.   

44
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:33,225
    Does that make any sense?   

45
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:34,960
         Doesn't matter,        
   'cause the food's the bomb.  

46
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:37,629
             This is            
    Casa Chimayo Restaurante.   

47
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,198
    GUZMAN: Chicken burrito,    
        Christmas sauce.        

48
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,633
                Really great,   
     authentic New Mexican food.

         at the window.         

50

        This is it. You're here.
              You have arrived. 

51
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:49,440
       A lot like walking       
  into your grandmother's house 

52
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,709
       or your mom's home.      

53

     FIERI: Or in this case,    

54
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,312
        Roberto Cordova's       
          mom's house.          

55
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:54,579
    You were born in this house?
 Yes.                           

56
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,048
       And you were raised in...
  Chimayo.                      

57
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,384
        The chili capital       
     just north of Santa Fe.    

58
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,653
       And after a career       
         in government,         

59
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,456
 his appetite for Mom's cooking 
    led him right back home.    

60
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,992
She says, "Why don't you        
just open up a restaurant,      

61
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:09,127
  "hire some cooks,             

62
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,195
 and I'll teach them            
how to cook our way?"           

63
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:12,130
  That's exactly what they did. 

64
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:16,201
    In 2011, they brought in    
 self-taught chef Ernesto Guzman

65
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:17,803
 to pick up where Mama left off.

66
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,405
It's the food of our ancestors. 
We cook very simple.            

67
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:23,342
     It's home-cooked beans     
         and enchiladas.        

68
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:25,277
             FIERI:             
   Served six different ways,   

69
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,945
     including this classic.    

70
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,347
   GUZMAN: Chicken enchilada,   
        red-chili sauce.        

71
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,083
So, what are we gonna make?     
           Chicken enchiladas.  

72
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:32,351
       Andale.                  

73
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:33,619
             And we'll go ahead 
         and do a chicken stock,

74
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:36,355
           adding water, celery,
              carrots, onions.  

75
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:38,123
            Then we'll go ahead 
  and toss this chicken in here.

76
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,693
                   Garlic.      

77
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,928
Okay. So, let this simmer.      

78
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,898
        These chilies right here
          come from our farmer. 

79
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,165
  That's how I keep             
     my peppers.                

80
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,566
           You guys already feel

81
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,636
        the [Sniffs] hot pepper 
    in your nose and everything?

82
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:51,836
So, when you see them           
    in the store,               

83
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,639
you'll see it under the name    
of New Mexico-style chilies.    

84
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:55,908
                  Exactly.      
             And we deseed them.

85
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,376
                 We actually    
             break the tips off.

86
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:58,843
    The real heat               
is here in the vein.            

87
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,379
      Is in the vein right here.
            These are very hot. 

88
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:02,247
 How many of these              
 you want me to do?             
                    That's good.

89
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,515
We steep them in hot water.     

90
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,117
Once we get them steeped,       
   we blend them.               

91
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:07,719
              This is gonna be  
         our Chile Caribe sauce.

92
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:12,390
          Pour some of this hot,
              steeping liquid.  

93
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,926
     I got some onions in there,

94
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:15,126
              I got some garlic 
I'm gonna add in there, as well.

95
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,930
Everybody in the pool?          

96
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,934
              And there it is.  

97
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,602
                   This --      
          You go ahead and pour.
 I'll do the pouring.           

98
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,405
               Strain this out  
            as much as possible.

99
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:29,808
 Really just getting            
the beautiful, silky --         

100
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,942
  just this rich --             
                Velvety texture.

101
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,077
Velvety. We'll use that.        

102
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,679
        That's done right there.

103
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,147
    Now, how long               
we gonna cook this down?        

104
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:37,215
    Oh, it's just a few minutes.

105
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,483
            See how hot that is.

106
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,620
      No, this is how you do it.
  Yeah.                         

107
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,021
  Oh, I didn't know             
that's how you [Babbles]

          [ Laughter ]          

111
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,296
But that's nice. I mean,        
it's got a good, little heat.   

112
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,698
Not overwhelmingly hot --       
   full-mouth hot.              

113
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,367
      Okay, so,                 
now what are we gonna do?       

114
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,602
        Since we've already had 
    our chicken stock boiled up,

115
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,905
    this is what we're gonna use
              for our stuffing. 

116
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,510
          And this is what we do
                  by hand.      

117
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:08,046
          Let's go ahead and add
                  some oil.     

118
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,716
      Heat that up a little bit.
               Onions. Celery.  

119
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,650
          Garlic. Just sweat it,
              basically, yeah.  

120
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,952
     And then add some tomatoes.

121
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,054
               We're gonna add  
          this shredded chicken.

122
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:18,257
        Basically, sauté that up
             a little bit more. 

123
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,859
            Then we're gonna add
            some chicken stock. 

124
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,460
      Gonna take three of these.
   Okay.                        

125
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,262
                So, these are   
         my blue-corn tortillas.

126
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,064
             I really just want 
             to soften them up. 

127
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,268
           Then we're gonna take
           our shredded chicken 

128
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,071
   that we just finished making.

129
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,573
                  Gonna add     
             some cheese inside.

130
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:39,544
 This is that Chile Caribe sauce
                that we made.   

131
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,079
                Look at that.   

132
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,014
        We're gonna layer these 
     right on top of each other,

133
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,415
               bring it over    
               to the middle.   

134
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,017
  Gonna throw this right on top.

135
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,285
             A little bit more. 

136
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,021
             Throw some cheese, 
               chopped onions.  

137
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,622
                  Toss this     
              in the salamander 

138
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,426
           'cause we really want
                to melt this.   

139
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:57,229
               Take this out.   
             Nice melted cheese.

140
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:59,398
                I'm gonna add   
     some delicious pinto beans,

141
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,899
              some of the rice. 

142
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,968
                   Dig in.      

143
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,104
    Look at that.               

144
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,039
This is hitting the spot.       

145
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,908
You can taste the flavors,      
especially the chili.           

146
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,480
  Not super-salty,              
  not really hot.               

147
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,317
   Velvety sauce,               
good texture to the chicken.    

148
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,886
The depth of flavor is huge.    
This is all just real deal.     

149
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,056
       Simple,                  
but super-flavorful.            
                        Exactly.

150
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,190
 Excellent job.                 
              Thank you so much.

a whole bunch of flavors,       

154
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,732

   This restaurant              
  really represents             

156
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,602
traditional, local food.        

157
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,538
      It blends                 
a lot of different cultures.

  It's a whole lot of goodness.

160

            Great chef you have.

163
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,614
              Food's delicious.

00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,949
            This has really been

165
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,150
            and just the respect

166
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,618
             and the admiration 
               for the chilies  

167
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,087
     and what a role the chilies
      play in it, it's amazing. 

168
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,255
You got it.                     
             Thank you, brother.

For everybody at home,

175
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,203

    Rustic Northern Italian.    

176
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:22,114
      FIERI: So, here I am,     
    about 20 miles northeast    

177
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:24,282
    of downtown Albuquerque,    
           New Mexico.          

178
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,650
  Now, this area right here --  

179
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,320
  kind of like a business park, 
    lots of office buildings.

00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:29,454
          And I'm here          
      to check out a joint      

181
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,122
    that is about as European   
          as they come.         

182
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,924

   The wife, she's from Italy.  

183
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,860
      The chef and husband,     
     well, he's from France.    

184
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:37,329
  And the food is off the hook. 

185

    This is Torinos' @ Home.

     If I could, I'd be here    
   every day and every night.   

187
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,075
 It's like going back to Italy,

 opened this joint back in 2010,

190
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,816
   they modeled it after those  
  little family joints in Italy

       called trattorias.

              to be expensive.  

193
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,021
                We don't want   
            to be a fine dining.

194

            at an honest price.

       dyed with a squirt       
       of cuttlefish ink.

               Okay. Andiamo!   

203
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,310
MAXIME: All right, so we start  
with semolina flour.            

204
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,445
     00 flour --                
It's a very fine flour          

205
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,113
     that we use                
for pastries, pasta.            

206
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,982
It makes a harder, drier,       
  thinner product.              

207
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:34,119
                   Right.       
Salt. Eggs.                     

208
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:37,255
    A little bit                
of squid ink, of course.        

209
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,124
Careful. It stains a lot.       

210
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,725
             If you ever wanted 
       to put permanent eyeliner

211

like you're a football player --
   you know, the shade control. 

212
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:43,929
   You'll be good.              

213
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:45,997
 Just a little dash             
of olive oil in there.          

214
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,469
     Low speed.                 

215
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,337
And stir water gently           
      in there.                 

216
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,605
                And how long    
      are we gonna let this mix?

217
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:54,673
Oh, a few minutes --            

218
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,007
     just until                 
they bind all together.         

219
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,610
I'm gonna speed it up           
      a little.                 

220
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,945
So, now we put the dough        
    on the table,               

221
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,247
work it a little bit            
      by hand.                  

222
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,820
        You see how black it is?

223
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:09,955
      Gorgeous.                 

224
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,357
          And then we'll roll it
           in the pasta roller. 

225
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:16,160
           So, you roll it down 
       about by 1/16 of an inch,

226
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,030
           and you keep rolling.

227
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,099
Look at the color on that.      

228
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,367
       I mean,                  
that looks like asphalt.        

229
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,169
              Nice shine to it. 

230
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,637
           And then we pass them
           back on the machine. 

231
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,440
   But this time,               
 through the cutter.            

232
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,842
      Gorgeous.                 
    Look at that.               

233
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:33,444
     And now we're gonna prepare
                 the sauce.     

234
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,247
                 So, we have    
               a hot pan here.  

235
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,250
            We're gonna squeeze 
      a little bit of olive oil.

236
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:40,585
              We're gonna grab  
             a couple calamari. 

237
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,921
And we're gonna slice our tubes,
        a few of the tentacles. 

238
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,656
        [ Oil sizzling ]        

239
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,658
         And we make some noise.

240
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,860
   So, we're gonna let that sear
                  a little.     

241
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,528
        Okay.                   
Shallots and garlic.            

242
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,263
  So, we let that sweat in there
                a little bit.   

243
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,531
            Heirloom tomatoes --

244
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,066
              Those are coming  
   from right around the corner.

245
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,801
      And at this point, I think
      we can start seasoning -- 

246
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,603
           a little bit of salt.

247
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,606
Fresh-cracked black.            

248
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,274
      And we need to be patient.
                Let it sing.    

249
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,143
    Let it sing?                
                    [ Hisses ]  

250
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,278
               Once it sings,   
               we're gonna add  

251
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,880
          a little bit of pastis
                  in there.     

252
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,014
       Pastis?                  

253
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,217
            Pastis is a liqueur 
       from the south of France.

254
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,753
      It's made with star anise.

255
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:18,557
 I think that's like            
 liquid fennel. Mmm!            

256
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,691
Oh, that's awesome.             
                     Yeah? Okay.

257
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,426
                 Clam broth.    

258
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:23,695
               Get a good hand  
                  of pasta.     

259
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,437
                 All right.     
          So, we sauté all that.
   Ah!                          

260
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,042
       So, a little pinch chive,
             a little tarragon, 

261
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,577
             bell-pepper flakes.

262
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,712
             We're ready to eat.

263
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:44,649
    Look at that.               

264
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:45,850
      The sauce                 
  has all combined              

265
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,519
around that beautiful,          
  squid-ink pasta.              

266
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,257
   Mother, father,              
    that's good.                
                     It's good? 

267
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,194
The calamari is so tender.      

268
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,462
    All of these                
 little components,             

269
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:58,796
just that little bit            
of chili flake at the end --    

270
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,266
The tarragon, the parsley,      
the chive coming in.            

271
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,071
             What do you think? 

272
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,272
  That's fantastic.             
       You like that? Very good.

273
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,742
Fantastic, my friend.           
      Nice job.                 

274

    con calamari.               

275
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,014
         It's wonderful.        

276
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:20,151
  I love the squid ink because  
 it's different, for one thing. 

277
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:23,421
  FIERI: And when we come back, 
        more different...       

278
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:24,489
               We're gonna do   
         a beef cheek manicotti.

279

      ...with a deeper look     

280
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,326
     into the French-Italian    
            playbook.           
    Sacré bleu.                 

281
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,800
             FIERI:             
    We're at Torinos' @ Home,   

282
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,601
where Maxime and Daniela Bouneuo

283
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,672
    are serving up authentic,   
     northern Italian dishes    

284
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:43,007
  you'd find in New York City,  
         San Francisco,         

285
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,275
       maybe even Chicago,      

286
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:47,078
       but not necessarily      
    Albuquerque, New Mexico.    

287
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,279
       People come, and they're,
        "Where's your meatball? 

288
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,280
         "Where's your Alfredo?"

289
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,348
               And some people  
              would just leave, 

290
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,616
                  say, "No,     
            you're not Italian."

291
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,552
             WOMAN:             
  To have the food from Italy,  

292
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,287
     where I've never been,     
            is nice,            

293
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,489
because I feel like I'm actually
       getting to enjoy it      

294
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,691
    and enjoy the atmosphere    
        and the ambiance.       

295
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,493
             FIERI:             
   And some down-home recipes   

296
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,763
  you'd be hard-pressed to find 
   anywhere outside of Italy.   

297
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,165
  We have a beef cheek manicotti
                 right here.    

298
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,900
             WOMAN:             
   It's absolutely scrumptious  

299
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,235
  and just melts in your mouth. 

300
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:11,969
What are we into now?           

301
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,171
              So, we're searing 
                beef cheeks.    

302
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,505
               We're gonna do   
         a beef cheek manicotti.

303
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,240
             Butter in the pan. 

304
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,909
             Everything's better
                with butter.    

305
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,110
This is the French part         
     coming out.                

306
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,579
                    Beef cheeks.
Beef cheeks are the bomb!       

307
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,650
                Little salt,    
               little pepper.   

308
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:29,053
      So they're nice and seared
           on both sides, okay? 

309
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:32,790
                  Lay them      
            in our braising pan.

310
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,793
      Gorgeous.                 

311
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:37,262
  Next step is deglazing our pan
               with red wine.   

312
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,130
  Get all that fat              
off the bottom of it.           

313
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,265
      Gonna reduce the wine down
                a little bit.   

314
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,600
              In the meantime,  

315
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:44,202
      we're gonna start sautéing
      our vegetable over there. 

316
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,271
           Starting with onions,
               little garlic,   

317
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,807
        carrots, and the celery,

318
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,542
          just to sweat all that
            a little bit, okay? 

319
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,143
               Gonna put that   
           on top of our cheeks.

320
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,410
      Gorgeous.                 

321
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,281
   And add a little tomato paste
               here and there.  

322
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,482
      We're gonna add our flour.

323
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,352
              All that red wine 
               goes in there.   

324
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:02,554
                  Cover it      
             with a veal stock. 

325
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,556
             Veal stock is done 
               from veal bone.  

326
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,624
      We use femur and knuckles.
Roast them?                     

327
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,893
Okay. Wrap it in foil,          
and how long in the oven?       

328
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,295
                  5 hours.      
     At?                        

329
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:11,730
                500 degrees.    

330
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,033
So, this is out of the oven.    

331
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:17,035
Cools down a little bit         
so you can handle it.           

332
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,436
          So, we're gonna shred.

333
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,705
  See? Just like you would shred
    for a pulled-pork sandwich. 

334
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,110
             So, we're gonna add
                  ricotta.      

335
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,645
   Sprinkle some Parmesan cheese
                  in there.     

336
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:30,381
     Bring a little bit of salt,
                some pepper.    

337
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:34,852
            Now we're gonna make
              some more pasta.  

338
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,655
Again with the semolina,        
 again with the 00.             

339
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:40,425
We're just not gonna add        
   the squid ink.               
                        Exactly.

340
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,861
            We rolled our pasta.
  Okay.                         

341
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,865
   And now we're gonna blanch it
          in our boiling water. 

342
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,801
Do you see the level
