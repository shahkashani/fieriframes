LIKE I'M FULL CALI,             

285
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:55,980
     MY MOM WAS

  SO A LITTLE                   
PORK LOIN HERE.                 

297
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,679
         TAKE THE CAP OFF OF IT.

298
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:30,080
    THEN PUT IT IN THE MARINADE.
AND THE SWEET TEA--             

299
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,749
THIS IS LIKE SWEET TEA          
      YOU DRINK?                
            SWEET TEA YOU DRINK.

300
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,751
 HOW LONG DO WE                 
LET IT MARINATE?                
                  6 TO 12 HOURS,

301
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,753
    SO WE COULD DO IT OVERNIGHT,
       AND IT WOULD BE BETTER.  

302
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,755
              WE'RE GONNA MAKE  
            THE SEASONED BREADER

303
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,225

               AND SOME THYME.  

306
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,164
           AND WE'LL TAKE IT    
      THROUGH THE PROCESS HERE--

307
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,834
            ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR...
INTO THE BUTTERMILK,            

308
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:53,304
THEN INTO THE DREDGE,           
  INTO THE FRYER...             
                 INTO THE FRYER.

309
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:56,508
AND THEN WE BUILD               
  THE SANDWICH.                 
            WE DO. TOAST THE BUN
             FOR THE PORK CHOP,

311
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,445
       AND A GOOD HELPING OF IT,

00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,513
                        LETTUCE.
ALL RIGHT, SOUNDS LIKE          
   THE PORK'S DONE.             

313
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,049
                 YEP. PORK CHOP.

314
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,384
                         TOMATO.
WHAT'S IT CALLED?               

315
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,753
          SWEET TEA-MARINATED   
       FRIED PORK CHOP SANDWICH.

316
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,925
THE PORK--COOKED PERFECTLY.     

317
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:16,194
       NOT SWEET--              
IT'S NOT SWEET IN ANY WAY.      
                          RIGHT.

318
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,263
I GOTTA SAY THE RED-EYE GRAVY   
   MAYONNAISE IS THE BOMB.      

319
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,497
 IT DOESN'T TASTE               
A TON LIKE COFFEE.              

320
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,067
YOU GET THE FATTINESS           
    OF THE MAYO.

IT'S GOT RICH FLAVOR.           

322
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,671

ABOUT IT IS YOU'RE NOT A CHEF.  

323

         OF MANHATTAN.

SO THIS MIXTURE'S TOGETHER.     

473
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:38,309
     DON'T WANT                 
TO WORK IT TOO MUCH.            

474
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,911
  DON'T WANT TO BREAK DOWN      
THE BUTTER. NOW WE LOOK GOOD.   

475
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,447
  NOW WE PULL OUT THE PEACHES   
THAT HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO COOK, 

476
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:46,383
CARAMELIZE THOSE DOWN           
    A LITTLE BIT.               

477
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,519
AND THEN JUST THROW ON          
    SOME GLOBULES.              

478
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,521
                       GLOBULES.

479
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,523
YOU JUST CAN'T PUT IT           
     ALL ON TOP.                

480
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,525
OTHERWISE, YOU GOT TOO MUCH     
   STEAM COMING THROUGH,        

481
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,527
AND THESE WON'T CRISP UP        
   THE WAY YOU WANT.            

482
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,529
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF MOISTURE    
    COMING OUT OF THERE,        

483
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,264
 SO YOU GOTTA JUST              
GIVE IT SOME PATCHES            

484
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,732
SO YOU CAN RELEASE              
    THE STEAM.                  
                   THAT'S RIGHT.

485
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:04,135
WHAT'S THE SEASON               
     ON THIS?                   
      CINNAMON. LITTLE SPRINKLE.

486
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,670
BACK IN THE OVEN,               
    HOW LONG?                   
               ABOUT 15 MINUTES.

487
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,739
ALL RIGHT, CHEF, WE READY?      
                    WE'RE READY.

LOOKS AWESOME.                  

489
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,277
SERVE IT UP.

RIGHT UP TOP.                   

491
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,820
 THOSE PEACHES...               
STILL HAVE TEXTURE.             

492
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:25,223
STILL A LITTLE BITE TO 'EM.     
      NOT OVERSWEET.            

493
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:28,893
STILL TASTE THE PEACH. KEY.     

494
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,229
NICE LIGHT CRUST.               

495
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,564
MAN, WHAT A NICE                
 SOUTHERN TREAT                 

496
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,566
   ALL THE WAY OUT HERE ON      
THE EAST VILLAGE OF MANHATTAN.  

497
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,369
YOU DELIVERED ON THE NAME.      
     NICE JOB, CHEF.            

498
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,371
         LITTLE PIECE OF HEAVEN.
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.             

499
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,373
  SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP,   
      BUT DON'T YOU WORRY,      

500
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,841
      THERE'S FUNKY JOINTS      
     ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY.     

501
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,712
I'LL LOOK FOR YOU NEXT TIME ON  
 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

502
