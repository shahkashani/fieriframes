1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,266
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:06,733
I'm Guy Fieri,
and we're rolling out

3
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:09,600
looking for America's greatest
diners, drive‐ins, and dives.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,566
This trip...

5
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:11,866
Ho!

6
00:00:11,866 --> 00:00:14,633
...we're digging into everything
from pretzels and pork...

7
00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:16,400
This is next level.

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,833
...to prime‐time paella.

9
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,100
Gorgeous.

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,233
Like in Little Rock...

11
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:21,333
I'm in heaven.

12
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,933
...where things
are getting twisted...

13
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:25,600
Does somebody on the team
have octopus arms?

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,033
...along with
some international flair.

15
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:29,900
Look at that!

16
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,166
Plus farm‐to‐table in Montana...

17
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,933
Come to Bozeman,
that's outstanding.

18
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,700
...that's worth waking up to.

19
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,500
That's one of the best
breakfast dishes

20
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,533
I've had on "Triple D."

21
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:39,700
I mean, wow!

22
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,633
That's all right here,
right now,

23
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:44,033
on "Diners, Drive‐ins
&amp; Dives."

24
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:50,300
♪♪♪♪

25
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,566
♪♪♪♪

26
00:00:56,566 --> 00:00:58,000
So I'm here in Bozeman, Montana,

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,066
right across the street
from Montana State University.

28
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:02,073
Now, we've all heard the term
"farm‐to‐table," right?

29
00:01:02,073 --> 00:01:03,240
Well, I'm here to check
out a joint

30
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,706
where a husband and wife team ‐‐

31
00:01:04,706 --> 00:01:06,406
well, they're taking it
to a whole nother level.

32
00:01:06,406 --> 00:01:09,506
You see, because they own the
farm and they have the tables.

33
00:01:09,506 --> 00:01:11,573
This is Storm Castle Cafe.

34
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:16,106
Grandma's enchilada, waffle,
please, in the window!

35
00:01:16,106 --> 00:01:17,773
This is the best breakfast
in Bozeman.

36
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:19,406
I have
the Monte Cristo for you.

37
00:01:19,406 --> 00:01:20,740
WOMAN: Thank you.

38
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,740
FIERI: This isn't your average
breakfast‐and‐lunch

39
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,873
kind of joint, this is
a little [whistles]

40
00:01:24,873 --> 00:01:26,073
‐Yeah.
‐...over the top.

41
00:01:26,073 --> 00:01:28,706
It's always packed in here.
Everyone's always here.

42
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:31,673
FIERI: Maybe because Bozeman
native Chef Scott Peterson

43
00:01:31,673 --> 00:01:34,273
is serving up a spot
that feels like home.

44
00:01:34,273 --> 00:01:36,240
This area's changed a lot
in the last 10 years.

45
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,940
Right.
And so, we just wanted
to create

46
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,606
an experience
that was an authentic

47
00:01:39,606 --> 00:01:41,340
Montana experience
that you might have got

48
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,773
sometime in the past.

49
00:01:42,773 --> 00:01:45,540
And while wife, Nicole, heads up
the front of the house,

50
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,673
her Mexican heritage mixes in
to the kitchen, as well.

51
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:50,140
I have the pocampo.

52
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,073
I think this is Scott's version
of the chimichanga.

53
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:53,906
I've never had anything
like it anywhere. It's great.

54
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,040
So our first thing

55
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,373
that we're gonna make
is gonna be our pocampo,

56
00:01:56,373 --> 00:01:57,840
which starts out
with our homemade carnitas.

57
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,540
We use either pork loin
or pork shoulder depending

58
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,513
on what we have in‐house.
‐What you have available.

59
00:02:01,513 --> 00:02:03,446
You want to dice it up
in some fairly large cubes.

60
00:02:03,446 --> 00:02:05,346
It gives it an opportunity
to be more succulent.

61
00:02:05,346 --> 00:02:06,913
‐Okay.
‐We get a pan with the bacon fat

62
00:02:06,913 --> 00:02:09,013
that's already hot.
Season it with salt and pepper.

63
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:10,580
That's all gonna go
till it's tender?

64
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,213
Not till
it's fall‐apart tender

65
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:13,546
'cause we're gonna do
another braise on it after this.

66
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:14,380
‐Got it.
‐So we have cumin here...

67
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,446
Okay.

68
00:02:15,446 --> 00:02:17,013
...granulated garlic,
dried cilantro...

69
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:18,079
Chili powder.

70
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,013
...oregano that's dried,
a touch of cinnamon.

71
00:02:20,013 --> 00:02:22,213
‐A little paprika.
‐This is paprika, for color.

72
00:02:22,213 --> 00:02:23,980
Now, this is where it gets
interesting ‐‐

73
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,613
orange juice and milk?
‐Yeah.

74
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,146
There's some lactic acids
in the milk

75
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:28,546
that are gonna help break
down our pork a little bit,

76
00:02:28,546 --> 00:02:30,046
and then it's gonna be
the citric acids

77
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:31,813
as well that are gonna
offer up a bit of sweetness.

78
00:02:31,813 --> 00:02:33,080
How long's
this gonna cook?

79
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,746
It takes another 45 minutes
to an hour.

80
00:02:34,746 --> 00:02:35,980
Next up?

81
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,380
We call it a fire‐roasted
salsa here,

82
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,546
but we're actually doing it
on the flat top.
Okay.

83
00:02:39,546 --> 00:02:41,280
Green onions that we're
gonna char off, jalapeños,

84
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,046
fire‐roasted tomatoes,
onions.

85
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:45,513
‐Garlic go down?
‐Yeah. Garlic goes here.

86
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:46,980
As soon as they're charred,
we hit them in the pot,

87
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,446
we let that simmer until
the veggies are broken down.

88
00:02:48,446 --> 00:02:49,680
And then just when
they're finished?

89
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,380
A little salt.
‐Yeah, and cilantro.

90
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,213
Immersion blender.

91
00:02:54,213 --> 00:02:55,380
Next up is our queso.

92
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,480
Queso, you gonna
make it or not?

93
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,413
Yeah.

94
00:02:57,413 --> 00:03:01,086
'Kay, so
you gonna make it?

95
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:02,553
So we start off with
a little bit of bacon fat.

96
00:03:02,553 --> 00:03:04,020
For some reason, it seems
like you have bacon fat

97
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,520
running in your veins.
‐It's a pretty common theme.

98
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,853
We're gonna add
our flour to it

99
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,186
to create a little bit
of a roux.

100
00:03:08,186 --> 00:03:09,553
This is our pico de gallo
that we make in‐house.

101
00:03:09,553 --> 00:03:11,020
We're gonna add
a little bit of beer.

102
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,253
‐Come on!
‐So we're gonna let

103
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:13,386
this simmer
so it starts to come out.

104
00:03:13,386 --> 00:03:14,586
Add a little bit
of our milk.

105
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:15,953
So what we got here is
the cheese that melts.

106
00:03:15,953 --> 00:03:17,786
Yeah!
And a little American?

107
00:03:17,786 --> 00:03:19,220
A little bit of American,
just for body.

108
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,086
Just give it a whisk,
let it melt until it's smooth.

109
00:03:21,086 --> 00:03:21,986
Done.
‐Okay.

110
00:03:21,986 --> 00:03:23,486
Make it happen, Cap'n.

111
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:24,486
We're just gonna egg‐wash
this whole tortilla.

112
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:25,753
Jack cheese,
cheddar blend.

113
00:03:25,753 --> 00:03:27,420
And then we have some potatoes,
season them,

114
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,520
sear them off
with peppers, onions.

115
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,886
Those are dynamite!

116
00:03:30,886 --> 00:03:32,586
And then our carnitas
pork mixture.

117
00:03:32,586 --> 00:03:34,286
Fold it over.
We roll it tight.

118
00:03:34,286 --> 00:03:35,453
And then after we get
to this point...

119
00:03:35,453 --> 00:03:36,920
‐Fry them for service?
‐Correct.

120
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,353
Let's put it together, man.
I'm hungry.

121
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:40,220
Here's what we do now
to finish this.

122
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,153
These are our signature
cowboy beans, we call them.

123
00:03:44,153 --> 00:03:46,020
Pinto beans cooked off
with a lot of bacon fat,

124
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,053
onions, jalapeños.

125
00:03:47,053 --> 00:03:49,020
A little bit
of cotija cheese.

126
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,320
People like that breakfast
for dinner.

127
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,053
This is a meal.

128
00:03:54,153 --> 00:03:56,153
This is ‐‐ I mean,
it's outstanding.

129
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,520
All that delicious pork.

130
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,353
Not over‐fried,
not greasy.

131
00:03:59,353 --> 00:04:02,093
♪♪♪♪

132
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:05,193
Wow!

133
00:04:05,193 --> 00:04:08,493
Those beans
are banging, dude.

134
00:04:08,493 --> 00:04:09,626
Thank you.

135
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:10,960
You're putting more attention
and detail

136
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,160
to a breakfast item

137
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,626
than most people put
into a dinner item.

138
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:16,660
I don't care where anybody
is right now,

139
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,760
if you're within
200 miles of Bozeman,

140
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,260
I'd make a pilgrimage
for this.

141
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,960
I will come back
for this.

142
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,793
That's one of the best
breakfast dishes

143
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:24,793
I've had on "Triple D."

144
00:04:24,793 --> 00:04:25,960
Thank you very much.

145
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,926
One of the best,
without question. Wow!

146
00:04:27,926 --> 00:04:29,793
‐Pocampo for you.
‐Thank you.

147
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:31,826
The beans, the cheese sauce,
the pork,

148
00:04:31,826 --> 00:04:34,126
Scott knows
how to pull it all together.

149
00:04:34,126 --> 00:04:35,559
Picking up!
Storm Castle Burger.

150
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:38,459
The whole farm‐to‐table aspect
comes together so well.

151
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,226
FIERI:
'Cause much of the ingredients

152
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:41,393
are coming from the farm

153
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:43,493
Scott and his parents have run
since the 1970s.

154
00:04:43,493 --> 00:04:44,860
We raise the majority
of the pork.

155
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,293
‐Okay.
‐We have a herd of red Angus.

156
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:47,760
We have a garden ‐‐
zucchini,

157
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,160
cucumbers, squash,
all that kind of stuff.

158
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,860
But occasionally, his
do‐it‐yourself attitude leads

159
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,693
to should‐have‐paid‐someone‐
else‐to‐do‐it results.

160
00:04:55,693 --> 00:04:57,893
I farrow pigs, right,
which means that these sows

161
00:04:57,893 --> 00:04:59,493
are gonna have babies.
‐Right.

162
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:02,600
So 250, 300 covers yesterday,
working on the line,

163
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,966
I find out
I'm having pigs.

164
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:06,066
I cruise out to the farm,
we deliver 16 pigs.

165
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:07,333
I get done at 10:00
last night,

166
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,566
when I decided
to cut my hair.

167
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:10,833
Except, you see this
little streak right here?

168
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,133
That's where I missed.
‐You cut yourself?!

169
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:14,900
Cut myself with a pair
of clippers

170
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,900
at 10:30 last night.
‐You're an animal.

171
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,166
I thought you were running
a faux‐hawk.

172
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,400
I like it.
‐We're picking up a chili

I'm gonna tell you, bro.

186
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:47,033
I haven't been to Bozeman,
Montana, before,

187
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:49,166
but if this is what
the food scene is like,

188
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,166
I'm gonna be back for more.

189
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,600

as they can,

they raise
on their own farm,

00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,666

as fresh as possible.

So what are we gonna make?
‐To be honest,

197
00:06:01,473 --> 00:06:02,973
what we called it was,
"Our Farm" in the beginning.

198
00:06:02,973 --> 00:06:04,340
Most of the products
come from our farm.

199
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,673
‐Our Farm didn't sell.
‐Didn't sell.

My wife's printing
the menu up,

00:06:07,273 --> 00:06:08,706
why don't we just
change the name ‐‐

202
00:06:08,706 --> 00:06:10,806
Monte Cristo.
‐Now it sells out the door.

203
00:06:10,806 --> 00:06:12,773
Alright, I've got
the Monte Cristo.

204
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:15,173
The perfect combination
of sweet and savory.

205
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:18,140
You've really got quite a meal
here. It's great.

206
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,540
It's not quite a classic
Monte Cristo,

207
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,940
we don't serve it with jam,
we serve it

208
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,073
with a strawberry‐rhubarb syrup
or a seasonal syrup.

209
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:25,640
We put them in a pot.

210
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,873
Sugar, vanilla...

211
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:29,473
‐So your standard compote.
‐Yeah.

212
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,806
...and maple syrup.

213
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:32,440
Cooks down,
we're gonna puree this?
Yeah.

214
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,073
And this is the beginning
of the Monte Cristo?

215
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:35,473
This is the beginning.

216
00:06:35,473 --> 00:06:36,640
What we do to it
that's a little bit different,

217
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,140
is that we make
a French toast batter.

218
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,540
We take our eggs, sugar,

219
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,473
we get that
mixed up real good,

220
00:06:41,473 --> 00:06:42,573
then we're gonna add
our vanilla,

221
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:43,906
not a lot of milk
to be honest.

222
00:06:43,906 --> 00:06:45,440
‐Got it.
‐It's just a light dunk.

223
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,173
‐Boom, boom.
‐And then we let it crisp up.

224
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,206
And then as it cools down,
that sugar that was caramelized

225
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:51,373
on the outside crunches
like a crème brûlée.

226
00:06:51,373 --> 00:06:53,706
Then we're gonna add
our Swiss cheese.

227
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:54,773
This is your ham?

228
00:06:54,773 --> 00:06:56,973

Little Rock, Arkansas,

just about a half mile
from the downtown area

291
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:07,893
to check out a joint.

00:09:07,893 --> 00:09:09,493
Well, it's these two buddies
that met in college.

293

One was a stay‐at‐home dad

294
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:12,660
and the other became
a high school teacher,

295
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,960
and they decided,
"Hey, let's open up

296
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,526
a brewery and serve pretzels."

297
00:09:15,526 --> 00:09:16,826

this chef that said,

298
00:09:16,826 --> 00:09:18,126
"Let's expand the menu."

299
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:19,960

goes on from there.

00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:38,026
It's your go‐to brewery

know their beers.

00:09:42,493 --> 00:09:43,760
FIERI: How many different
beers you guys making?

311
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,526
Over 50 year‐round.

312
00:09:45,526 --> 00:09:46,726
And you make the root beer
as well?

313
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:47,860
Yeah.

314
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,893
Don't want to get
those kegs mixed up.

315

Yeah, exactly right.

Chef Gina Jones
to spice up their menu.

318
00:09:55,393 --> 00:09:58,026
We were looking for someone
that maybe could bring in some

319
00:09:58,026 --> 00:10:00,466
Southern food that could mix
with some soul foods

320
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,266
and some Cajun
and some Creole.

321
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:05,166
FIERI: But first, she needed
to master the O. G. recipe

322
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,500
the boys first paired up
with their pints.

323
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,200
Here is the pretzel tree.

of options

325
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,633
with the different salts
and sauces you can have.

326
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:16,200
It's almost like ordering
10 different meals in one.

327
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,700
Alright, so what are we
gonna make first, Chef?

328
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,366
We're gonna make
the pretzel.

329
00:10:19,366 --> 00:10:20,933
Just so you know,
I used to sell pretzels

330
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:21,900
when I was a little kid.

331
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,933
I had the awesome
pretzel cart.

332
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:24,366
I'm a pretzel junkie.

333
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:26,566
We'll pour all‐purpose flour.
Get it all in there.

334
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:27,800
Don't you think they
would have come up

335
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,000
with an easier way
to get the flour in?
I know.

336
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,766
We all dump it right there
on the side.

337
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:32,733
Keep going.
Keep going.

338
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:33,766
You got it.
Okay.

339
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,300
Salt, sugar, yeast.

340
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,566
So, we mix all the dry
ingredients first.

341
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:40,333
And then slowly put
your water in there.

342
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,766
And how many pretzels are you
guys making in a week?

343
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:45,233
Anywhere from 600
to 700 pretzels a week.

344
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:48,833
Does somebody on the team

345
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,200
Now my butter.

346
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,466
It's gonna take us
about a good 30 minutes

347
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:53,000
to get it all
mixed together.

348
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,266
Then we let it rest
for how long?

349
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:55,533
An hour or so.

350
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:57,700
Roll it out.
Wrap it around.

351
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,633
And we make one type
of pretzel dough,

352
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:01,206
but we do a lot
of different sauces

353
00:11:01,206 --> 00:11:03,073
and a lot of different salts.
‐Yes.

354
00:11:03,073 --> 00:11:04,440
Alright, we're gonna go
to a water bath

355
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,173
with a little baking soda.
‐Yes, sir.

356
00:11:06,173 --> 00:11:08,906
We'll cook them
for about 15 minutes.

357
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:10,573
While those are cooking,
we're making sauces.

358
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:13,006
We're first gonna make
our hickory mustard.

359
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,840
Mustard, ketchup,
brown sugar,

360
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,773
"watch your sister" ‐‐
Worcestershire...

361
00:11:17,773 --> 00:11:19,306
"Watch your sister"
sauce.

362
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:21,640
...apple cider,
chili powder, garlic powder.

363
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,440
‐Okay.
‐Liquid smoke goes on there.

364
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,873
This will cook for like
10 minutes.

365
00:11:24,873 --> 00:11:26,373
Next one we're making is, what?
The honey mustard?

366
00:11:26,373 --> 00:11:28,573
Yes, sir, and this goes
with our Migrate pretzel.

367
00:11:28,573 --> 00:11:29,540
"Migraine"?

368
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,073
Not "migraine"
like a headache.

369
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:32,273
"Migrate" like a bird.

370
00:11:32,273 --> 00:11:33,673
‐Okay, Migrate pretzel.
‐Yes.

371
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:35,040
Got it.
Got it.

372
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,206
‐So you got mustard here...
‐With the mayonnaise.

373
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:37,506
...apple cider again,

374
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:39,473
garlic powder,
put salt in there,

375
00:11:39,473 --> 00:11:41,506
the honey that make it
sweet and delicious.

376
00:11:41,506 --> 00:11:42,906
And that one we don't
have to cook.

377
00:11:42,906 --> 00:11:45,273
Just stir and go.

378
00:11:45,273 --> 00:11:46,640
FIERI: That's
a nice‐looking pretzel.

379
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
We butter them up.

380
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,973
Boy, you look nice,
pretzel.

381
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:51,373
Oh, a different
buttering up.

382
00:11:51,373 --> 00:11:52,840
And then this is gonna be
the which one?

383
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,240
This is the Free Range.

384
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,140
This is
the bacon salt here.

385
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,973
So, you grind up bacon
with salt?

386
00:11:57,973 --> 00:11:59,073
Yes.

387
00:11:59,073 --> 00:12:02,446
This goes with
the hickory mustard.

388
00:12:02,446 --> 00:12:03,846
My favorite.

389
00:12:03,846 --> 00:12:05,346
So, you get the bacon
of the pretzel,

390
00:12:05,346 --> 00:12:07,546
and then you get the smoke
from the liquid smoke,

391
00:12:07,546 --> 00:12:09,346
so it's like
a smoky mustard sauce.

392
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:12,146
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐That works for sure.

393
00:12:12,146 --> 00:12:13,280
Mm. Alright,
what's the next one?

394
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,080
Migrate.
This is lavender salt.

395
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,180
This comes with
our honey mustard.

396
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,680
I'm in heaven.

397
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,280
Much more on
the traditional style.

398
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,980
Both of them are screaming,
"Drink more beer."

399
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,346
I think that's kind
of the idea.

400
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:29,013
But I do have to say
that the bacon salt

401
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:30,346
with the hickory sauce ‐‐

402
00:12:30,346 --> 00:12:31,780
I think that's going
to be my favorite.

403
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,113
But why don't we try
all the rest of them, too,

404
00:12:33,113 --> 00:12:34,446
just so I can be sure.

405
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:35,813
We can do that.

406
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:38,313
I like the way you roll.

407
00:12:38,313 --> 00:12:39,580
Migrate pretzel.

408

unique flavors ‐‐

409
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,980
it's excellent.

410
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,713
It's hot. It comes out fresh,
and you can really taste that.

411
00:12:45,713 --> 00:12:47,480
‐Have you always been a cook?
‐No.

412
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,113
Someone say, "Well,
you enjoy cooking,

413
00:12:49,113 --> 00:12:51,213
but you would have to go
to Kentucky to go to school."

414
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:52,813
And I was like,
"I'm here in Arkansas."

415
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,080
And sure enough, they finally
opened up a school

416
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,413
for us here in Arkansas.

417
00:12:56,413 --> 00:12:57,413
So, how long did you go
to culinary school?

418
00:12:57,413 --> 00:12:58,746
I went to school
for 2 years,

419
00:12:58,746 --> 00:13:01,386
and I'm going back
to get my bachelor's.

420
00:13:01,386 --> 00:13:03,286

you get it done.

they were offering.

422

What's your favorite thing
on the menu?

424

‐Gumbo fries.
‐Gumbo cheese fries.

I've had in New Orleans.

426

WOMAN #4: And it's all with
this big steak fry.

427
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:19,986

JONES: So, this is how I start
my roux ‐‐ oil and flour.

431
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:28,253
This takes anywhere from,
like, 20 to 30 minutes.

432
00:13:28,253 --> 00:13:30,086
Okay, so roux
goes in the back.

...pour it over in there,
chicken stock.

437
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:40,386
‐Chili flake.
‐Greek seasoning.

00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,020

‐Yes, sir.

439

Yes.

‐A little hot sauce.

441
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:47,986

442
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:49,553
Cajun salt there.

443
00:13:49,553 --> 00:13:50,820
Cheese.

444
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,520
Put them in the oven
for about two minutes.

445
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,620
Then the gumbo
goes on top?

446
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,820
‐Yes, sir.
‐Got it.

447
