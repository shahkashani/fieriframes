      like complete meals.      

116
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,025
         WOMAN: It's got        
    some southern kick to it,   

117
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,827
         and it makes it        
        totally awesome.        

118
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,161
 Bacon cheeseburger.            

119
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,964
Is this a typical type          
of Atlanta restaurant?          

120
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,232
              I'd say it's fun  

121
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,034
          because it's very much
     a part of the neighborhood.

122
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,436
        WOMAN: It brings        
    a lot of people together,   

123
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:58,703
       a lot of neighbors       
          that we know.         

124
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,239
        The natural light       
      makes it really warm      

125
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:05,444
 and the old signs just make you
     feel kind of nostalgic.    

126
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:07,312
      What's your favorite thing
                on the menu?    

127
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,513
The pulled-pork sandwich.       

128
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,716
  Bad to the bone in the window,
                  table 24.     

129
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,917
It's not your typical           
pulled-pork sandwich.           

130
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,920
It really is just something     
 uniquely different.            

131
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,120
What are we onto now,           
      brother?                  

132
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,723
                 All right,     
        we've got our pork butt.

133
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:20,525
            We do a simple brine
 of brown sugar and kosher salt.

134
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:23,662
 One of my favorite             
Rolling Stones songs.           

135
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,263
                There you go.   
  "Kosher Salt."                

136
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,665
                A little bit    
             of lukewarm water, 

137
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,467
         just enough to dissolve
             the sugar and salt.

138
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:29,668
      And then                  
so you don't poach it,          

139
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,002
 you're gonna hit it            
with a little bit of ice.       

140
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:31,937
                 That's it.     
          And it's a fast brine.

141
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:34,739
               We let this sit  
                 overnight.     

142
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,142
Okay, so we have brined         
      the butt.                 

143
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,277
        And then we're gonna rub
             our dry rub on it. 

144
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,146
               Massage it in.   

145
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,950
How long are we gonna go?       
                     12 hours.  

146
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,752
  12 hours at 250.              
                       Yep.     

147
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,020
Now what are we making?         

148
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:50,022
         All right, we're making
        our date barbecue sauce.
    Date?                       

149
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,489
       I had some dates one day,
               and I was like,  

150
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,291
     You know, I'm gonna thicken
       a barbecue sauce with it,

151
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,426
                   make it      
        a little bit different."

152
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:55,560
               I'm telling you  
                 it's good.     

153
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,162
This is when the funky          
of the folk come out.           

154
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,563
                Dried dates.    

155
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:01,299
            Dry guajillo peppers
  with a little bit of the heat.

156
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,433
        Big old chuck of garlic.

157
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,302
                Chili powder.   

158
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,037
             Brown sugar, cumin.

159
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,706
             Rice wine vinegar. 

160
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,175
            Little bit of water.

161
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:13,978
   Cook it for about 10 minutes,
till it comes up to a nice boil.

162
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,180
         Throw it in our blender
              and blend it up.  

163
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,382
        Okay.                   

164
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,118
         Take our big old slices
               of white bread.  

165
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,722
      Take our pork straight off
            in nice, big chunks.

166
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,323
        Piece of Gruyere cheese.

167
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,925
         Few caramelized onions.

168
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,192
                 And this is    
        our date barbecue sauce,

169
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,394
                which you're    
             very interested in.

170
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,363
Date barbecue sauce.            

171
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,270
 Little bit of our collard-green
         coleslaw goes on there.

172
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,472
               And we top it.   

173
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,441
Another petit diet sandwich.    

174
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:50,014
Just like the meatball burger   
had its own unique identity,    

175
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,650
   the same thing               
 with this sandwich.            

176
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:58,022
You get the tang coming out     
of the raw onion and the slaw.  

177
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,692
The pork's got its own,         
you know, barbecuey flavor,     

178
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,227
a little bit of that smoky      
   coming through,              

179
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,495
and a little bit of sweet,      

180
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,197
but not as much sweet           
 as I anticipated...            

181
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,099
  ...with the date.             

182
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,834
      It's got                  
  so much going on.             

183
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,770
It's a great sandwich, man.     
               Sweet, thank you.

184
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:12,971
                    MAN:        
        And the bad to the bone.

185
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,840
       Nice, tangy sauce.       

186
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,308
    There's some heat in it.    

187
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,575
     It's creamy, it's rich.    

188
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,844
It's really something different.

189
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,512
        Pork verde -- table two.
              Let's pick it up. 

190
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:22,847
       The food's perfect       
       when you come here.      

191
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,916
       Just a great place       
       all the way around.      

192
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,785
Fantastic and unique.           
                   Thank you.   

193
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:28,220
 Well done, brother.            
                  Thanks, Guy.  

194
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,457
        FIERI: Coming up,       
     in Denver, Colorado...     

195
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,792
             That is outrageous.

196
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,326
      ...a place cooking up     
         killer curry...        

197
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,661
                   This is      
         tikka masala gone wild.

198
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:37,996
            ...served           
      with a side of heat.      

199
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:39,231
                A little fire   
                in the belly.   

200
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,269
                     ♪♪         

201
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,840
    So, I'm here in the Rhino   
  district of Denver, Colorado, 

202
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:51,643
     just a few blocks away     
  from where the Rockies play.  

203
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,311
      Now, I have everybody     
        and their mother        

204
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,046
   sending me recommendations   
         for "Triple D,"        

205
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,714
 but when my buddy Frank Matson,

206
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,783
        who happens to be       
 the owner of Citizen Pictures, 

207
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,653
    the executive producer of   
 "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives,"

208
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:04,656
  ay, "Hey, Guy, I got a place  
    you've got to check out,"   

209
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,057
       well, enough said.       

210
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,659
             This is            
    Biju's Little Curry Shop.   

211
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,194
Coconut curry chicken           
       it is.                   

212
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,329
The freshest Indian food        
   I've ever had.               

213
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,931
 Beef with biriyani,            
that sounds excellent.          

214
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,133
   It's a completely different  
   cuisine that you're used to  

215
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,401
         when you think         
         of India food.         

216
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:17,802
       FIERI:                   
This is Frank Matson.           

217
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,137
Frank and I have been buddies   
  for a long time,              

218
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,972
and he said this is a joint     
   you got to see.              

219
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,340
What makes it so special?       

220
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:25,209
             Biju is just making
       really great-tasting food

221
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,611
               that's healthy   
                for you, too.   

222
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,681
   The kind of food the owner   
   Biju Thomas specializes in,  

223
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,416
       as a personal chef       
        for pro athletes,       

224
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,551
    and now he's bringing it    
         to the masses.         

225
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,486
             Is this fast food? 
                 Is this...     

226
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,488
Fast casual. So, people         
come through the line here.     

227
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,890
    We walk them                
 through every step.            

228
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:39,891
Everything's in a bowl.         

229
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,426
Everything's either rice        
   or as a salad.               

230
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,495
You've got chicken, beef,       
or vegetarian combo.            

231
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:44,829
 That's pretty much             
     everything.                
                     That's it. 

232
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,198
 They have so many options here.

233
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,633
    The spicy beef over rice.   

234
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,369
 I usually get the biriyani rice
   with the vindaloo chicken.   

235
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,304
      The chicken vindaloo      
         over the yucca.        

236
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,705
   If you look at               
 south Indian food,             

237
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,574
  every dish starts             
 exactly the same --            

238
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:57,909
with a fresh curry base,        

239
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,844
mustard seeds, ginger,          
  garlic, chilies.              

240
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,379
                      Really?   
Fresh curry leaves.             

241
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:02,781
This goes into everything.      

242
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,649
   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
             Fresh curry leaves?

243
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,451
     I don't know that I've ever
           smelled curry leaves.

244
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,320
Yeah, this is the --            
      It's like pandas eat this.

245
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,154
  Basically --                  
          [ Laughter ]          

246
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,589
 I mean, it's bitter            
   on the palate,               

247
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,191
    but it's got                
  an awesome smell.             
                       Yeah.    

248
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,392
     We're gonna                
  chop all this up.             

249
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,394
We got some red onions.         
Little bit of garlic.           

250
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:18,730
    Some ginger.                
Serranos and jalapeños.         

251
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:21,466
Wow, there's a little Latin spin
              coming out there. 

252
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:24,135
Grab some fresh curry leaves    
 and fresh cilantro.            

253
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:30,141
We can start basically any      
of our sauces we want.          

254
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,876
         This is the foundation?
   Yes, sir.                    

255
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,211
 And then from that,            
  we can take that              

256
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,146
into any different direction    
with the beef or the chicken -- 

257
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,882
anything at all we              
  want to go to.                
                  Okay, next up?

258
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,751
This is our basic dry spice mix 
    for vindaloo.               

259
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:41,486
     Vindaloo is                
   a spicy curry.               

260
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:42,920
 Toasted coriander.             

261
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,623
Coriander is the base           
for a lot of the curries.       

262
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,357
It's kind of neutral,           
it's not too peppery.           

263
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,558
          A little bit of lemon.

264
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,494
    Then we have                
some toasted fennel.            

265
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:50,562
 Black peppercorns.             

266
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:51,763
              Big peppercorns.  

267
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,831
    Curry leaves.               
  The dry version.              

268
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,433
    Cumin seeds.                
                       Mmm.     

269
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:56,701
These are not toasted.          

270
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,102
Black mustard seeds.            

271
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,237
   Sweet paprika.               

272
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,504
   So, we go with               
a ton of that in there.         

273
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,973
      Turmeric.                 
   Also for color.              

274
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,442
    Turmeric is one of the heavy
 colors in Indian food, correct?

275
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:07,378
Yeah. We finish with some       
extra-hot Indian ground pepper. 

276
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,113
                    All of that?
Yeah, we want it                
   to be hot.                   

277
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,749
     All right,                 
 so now we grind it.            

278
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,919
That's it. Now we're gonna      
  cook the chicken.             

279
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,253
 I always work with             
   chicken thigh.               

280
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,122
 It has a little bit            
   more substance.              

281
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,591
              The chicken thigh 
                  is done.      

282
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:20,992
A little oil in the pan.        
                         Right. 

283
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,460
    Some chicken.               

284
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:23,795
We got a little salt            
     and pepper.                

285
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:26,998
While that's happening, I'm     
gonna start our vindaloo sauce. 

286
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,999
    A little oil.               

287
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,534
             Let me taste this, 
                 by the way.    

288
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,336
             Is it gonna be hot?
Gonna be a little peppery.      

289
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:32,536
   Not too crazy.               
    Good, right?                

290
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:33,471
             Mmm. It's awesome. 

291
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:34,872
     Spice mix.                 

292
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,273
            That's for one dish?

293
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,475
That's the one dish.            

294
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,944
You know, when you get          
curry mix powder at home,       

295
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,413
     people use                 
  like a teaspoon.              

296
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,682
Nobody uses a teaspoon.         
That doesn't do anything.       

297
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,684
Our chopped curry base.         

298
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:46,684
Smells good, though, right?     

299
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,885
            It smells fantastic.

300
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,688
Okay, tamarind paste.           
                         Okay.  

301
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,223
   Nice sweetness,              
a little of that tang.          

302
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,624
Give it another stir.           

303
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,893
Some fresh lemon juice.         

304
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,094
                    Wow.        

305
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,162
       That's                   
fresh-squeezed lemon.           

306
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,697
  Regular distilled             
   white vinegar.               

307
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:00,965
               This is crazy.   

308
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,567
       Give it                  
a nice sprinkle of salt.        

309
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,102
Gorgeous -- look at that.       

310
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,370
You've done this before.        

311
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:06,504
             And a little<i> agua?</i> 

312
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:08,039
   A little water               
to give it a little sauce.      

313
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,441
                    That good?  
Beautiful, yeah.                

314
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,042
              And you let that  
                 tighten up.    

315
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,310
                 Is this now    
             where we should be?

316
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,578
        Yeah.                   

317
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,712
                     Oh.        

318
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,514
       Okay, so the chicken gets
              nice and tender.  

319
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:19,050
Yeah, so this gets combined,    
then we have the curry.         

320
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,451
I'm gonna plate it up.          

321
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,786
    So, normally,               
we'd come off the line,         

322
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,987
             so I'll just do it.

323
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,255
               I'm gonna start  
     with some chicken vindaloo.

324
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:25,456
   That's how much              
      you get?                  

325
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,058
                Yeah, you get   
              chicken vindaloo. 

326
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,925
             You add some yucca.

327
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,427
                 <i> Yucca</i> put     
                too much on.    

328
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,995
           THOMAS: I'm gonna put
   a little bit of slaw in here.

329
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,931
          And then I'm gonna put
           some of our Ardicheri

330
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,933
     because you wanted it to be
                 extra hot.     

331
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,401
  I didn't say that             
       at all.                  

332
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:39,137
That little nugget of death     
    right there.                

333
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:44,609
             Are you kidding me,
                    dude?       

334
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:45,744
              Oh, that's good.  

335
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,678
        Fantastic flavor, right?

336
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,481
           Nice tang, nice acid.

337
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,216
               There's tons of  
    different textures going on.

338
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,953
                   This is

          of a sweat brow going.

              You see the sweat 
                 coming on?     

342
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,694
             I mean,            
     I just want more of it.

      my boy Frank sent me here.

00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,034
  Chicken vindaloo

349
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,575
         Not too saucy.

        some spice to it

   feel like that much spice,

00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,519
       I can tone it down.

         You can always         
       kick it up a notch

       It's really unique.

369
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,712
                I've finished   
            my bowl of vindaloo.

370
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,049
I had a small nap, and now we're
    into another fantastic dish.

371
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,451
  FIERI: something Biju Thomas  
       has a knack for --       

372
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,319
           Indian food

      he used to cook for.      

374
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,390
In the last 10 years,           

375
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,725
 I've focused mostly            
in the cycling and sports world.

                 right here?    

379
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:16,801
     Yeah, Levi.

  this guy. Is he the real deal?

 He sort of straddles that line 
     between gourmet cooking

 and fuel for getting out there

                 than that.

    This food is so different   
     from other Indian food.

          It's layers of flavor.
          It's real ingredients.

       I think the curried beef.

390
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,357
     It's a cinnamon garlic     
          brazed beef.          

391
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,759
           Awesome curried beef.
            That's what this is.

392
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,361
    I'm gonna put               
a little oil in the pan.        

393
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:44,762
   This is chuck.

    As in Norris.               

395
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,031
A bit of salt and pepper.       

396

            So you're just gonna
       sear that off. Next step?

397
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,435
Just like with the vindaloo,    
we have our beef curry mix.     

398
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,837
  And that goes in.             

399
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,039
I just cannot believe the amount
     of spice that goes into it.

400
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,307
  That's what makes             
   the difference.              

401
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,108
The spicier we make it,         
the more people love it.        

402
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,844
         This is our curry base.
And this, too, you know,        

403
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,446
you're not shy about            
how much you put in there.      

404
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,514
        That,                   
roast them together.            

405
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,049
    I'm gonna add               
a little bit of water           

406
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,318
 and let this simmer            
for about 90 minutes.           

407
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,387
At the very end, we have        
a little bit of ground cinnamon,

408
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,856
 some ground anise,             
     coriander.                 

409
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,458
                    Okay.

00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,393
Now we're gonna make            
    the Samandhi.               

411
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,863
Samandhi is our roasted coconut

415
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,536
          outweigh all the other
        ingredients nine to one.

00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,737
      Exactly.                  
                     Okay.

420
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,210
a little bit of coconut oil     
 and mustard seeds.             

421
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,146
Fresh curry leaves --           
   your favorite.               

422
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,550
A little bit of minced garlic,  
ginger, a little tamarind.      

423
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:40,084
          Smells awesome so far.

424
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,953
       Onions.                  
                       Okay.    

425
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,421
  Fresh coconut --              
  comes from India.             

426
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,022
   So then we add               
    our chilies.

00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,224

           Go for it. Do it all.
                There you go.   

430
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,562
So, we roast that off,          

431
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,297
toast it till the peppers       
start to burn a little bit.     

432
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,300
    There it is.                
                      Crazy.    

433
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:56,734
   And we're ready              
  for the blender.              

434
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,571
Adding a little bit of water    
      and salt.                 

435
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,441
That's our Samandhi base.       

436
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:04,775
            Wow, that looks hot.

437
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,712
  So we start with our biriyani,
      which is a fruit nut rice.

438
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:10,047
               Lentils, beef.   

439
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,116
We got a little bit of slaw.    
Got some Thai chilies.          

440
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,118
The radishes and jalapeños.     

441
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,519
    A little bit                
   of lemon juice.              

442
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,754
      And salt.                 

443
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,790
So, that's our slaw.            
Indians don't do that.          

444
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,392
 So, this is not an Indian side,
               doing the slaw?  

445
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:22,727
That's totally something        
     I borrowed.                

446
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:25,196
This is the ground-coconut      
Samandhi that we just made.     

447
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,202
   I'll have a bowl of Samandhi,
                   please.      

448
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,736
         Dude, it would be great
                on anything.    

449
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:33,838
             That is outrageous.

450
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:37,274
              Not too much heat 
                by any means.

of the sweetness of the coconut,

453
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,547
              and then you get  
       the richness of the beef.

454
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,416
              A little acidity

573
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,765
        There might be something
        you didn't put in there.

574
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,300
Almost the kitchen sink.

     Three days.                

582
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,444
       Then we're gonna cook it?

of butter and shallots

               where to start.  

611

                 The pork is    
             incredibly tender. 

612
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:11,108

615
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,415
          That apricot marmalade
         really carries a punch.

616
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:21,785
        Shrimp is an extra kiss.
   Plantains are nice and sweet.

       together, nice job, Chef.

this road trip, but don't worry,

 to find all over this country.

         What else do you watch?

631
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,556
                  Nothing.      
  Just "Triple D," all the time.
