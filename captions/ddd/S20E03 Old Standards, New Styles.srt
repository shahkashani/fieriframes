        and a little bit        
         of spice, too.         

347
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,097
What is the pretzel             
  actually called?              
               Parmesan pretzel.

348
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:21,632
   We put a little bit of decent
      parmesan cheese in there. 

349
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,968
Well, get after this            
before I eat all the cheese.    

350
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,304
          So, we take our yeast,
                 put it in.     

351
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,306
                And then just   
          a little bit of flour.

352
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,440
         Just sits for a minute.

353
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,509
       The fresh yeast activates
               with the water.  

354
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:35,045
All right, so it sat up.        
                            Yep.

355
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,780
            Now we put the rest 
          of the ingredients in.

356
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,049
                   We got       
            the parmesan cheese.

357
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,318
                 Olive oil.     

358
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,686
                  And then      
           we add the sugar now.

359
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:44,589
                 Little bit     
              of iodized salt.  

360
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,025
              And then the rest 
                of the flour.   

361
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:49,894
                 Pull it up.    

362
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,399
All right, so how long          
is this gonna knead?            

363
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:55,667
                 6 to 8 minutes.
Really? Okay.                   

364
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:56,734
            It'll form together.

365
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,105
     You ready?                 

366
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,543
 18 ounces of this.             
                       Yep.     

367
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,412
              I kind of pull it 
              into a rectangle  

368
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,547
        and just kind of roll in
                 and pinch.     

369
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,815
                  Push down     
              with your thumbs. 

370
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:13,350
All right, so usually I start   
and stretch it a little bit.    

371
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,486
 All right, and then            
 you make a big "U."            

372
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:20,091
Twist, twist, pull down,        
and you push pretty hard.       

373
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,559
And you got your pretzel.       

374
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:22,493
       And that's all she wrote.

375
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,761
          Let it proof how long?

376
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,362
 About five minutes.            

377
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,366
             Then we'll drop it 
       into the simmering water.

378
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,101
              With a little bit 
               of baking soda,  

379
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,569
          and that's what builds
               the crust on it  

380
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:32,904
           that everybody loves.

381
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:35,607
Yeah, you get that nice brown,  
little bit of chew to it.       

382
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:40,979
The pretzel's gonna float.      

383
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,781
    There we go.                
 Starting to float.             

384
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,250
  So, I have the...             
                         Doctor.

385
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:47,585
...super-technical --           
               Of course you do.

386
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,687
  Yeah, definitely.             

387
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,524
    Brush it with               
a little garlic butter.         

388
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,193
        Sprinkle with some salt.

389
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,994
Little pretzel salt on there.   
 You're good to go.             

390
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,262
       The oven is at what temp?

391
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,664
        350.                    
                   For how long?

392
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,332
About 6 minutes, spin,          
 another 6 minutes.             

393
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,101
Want to make sure you get       
a nice, even, brown coat.       

394
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,471
              All right, chef,  
             pretzel's cooking. 

395
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:08,605
                 Let's make     
             some cheese sauce. 

396
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:09,540
Little bit of butter.           

397
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,776
Little A.P. flour here.         

398
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,347
Have Korean chili flake.        

399
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,481
Got a little black pepper.      

400
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,482
            Little salt, doctor.

401
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,017
        Salt.                   

402
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,151
                  Mustard.      

403
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,487
             Hot sauce, doctor. 

404
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,221
       Doctor.                  
                  Doctor doctor.

405
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:27,091
          Any kind of particular
                 hot sauce?     

406
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,560
It's a little Sriracha          
 and Tabasco mixed.             

407
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,129
Worcestershire sauce.           

408
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,566
   And then we got              
 a good Belgian ale.            

409
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:38,236
                 I like it.     

410
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:39,503
 A little veg stock.            

411
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,771
             You make yourself, 
                 of course.     

412
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,040
        Yeah,                   
we make the veg stock.          

413
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,375
 Got a little cream.            

414
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,010
Little cheddar cheese.          

415
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:00,591
                Look at that.   
              It's redonkulous. 

416
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,326
        All right, cheese sauce.

417
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,328
    Cheese sauce.               

418
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:12,937
    You hate it.                
    I can tell.                 

419
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:15,205
You're not enjoying that        
       at all.                  

420
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:18,476
 Every bite is five more minutes
             on the elliptical.

                 It's delicious.

422
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,016
               Not super heavy  
                 and dense.     

423
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:27,085
         The garlic-butter touch
               on the outside,  

424
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,186
             that's outrageous.

427
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,292
        Amazing pretzel.        

428
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,761
     It's a little bit crisp    
         on the bottom,         

429
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:39,230
  but it sits perfect with that 
   nice, soft, doughy inside.

                on the menu?    
This is my favorite.            

432
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,970
Better than New York.

A short rib grilled cheese.     

436
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,512
        It's very tender,       
          very cheesy.          

437
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,847

 a supercharged grilled cheese. 

446

It's got the crusted parmesan on
the outside, which is delicious.

00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:54,605
and you want to have the flavor 
in the bottom of the pan.       

460
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:59,510
    Little onion.               

461
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,512
       Celery.                  

462
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:02,713
      Carrots.                  

463
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:04,782
Little tomato paste.            

464
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:05,850
               Cook that out.   

465
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:07,585
  Little red wine.              
  Deglaze the pan.              

466
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,520
It's gonna pull that love       
   off the bottom.              

467
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,589
                Pull the love   
               off the bottom.  

468
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,424
 Little veal stock.             

469
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:16,460
And a little fresh thyme.       

470
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,362
      Bay leaf.                 

471
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,797
            Okay, so this is all
                cooked down.    

472
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:20,731
             Short ribs back in.

473
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:21,932
        Yep.                    
Throw these in there.           

474
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,000
Put the bone side up            

475
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:24,935
so you get the meat nice        
    in the juice.               

476
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,871
Throw a little foil on there    
and we'll get them in the oven. 

477
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,071
               How long we go   
              in the oven for?  

478
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,473
   About 3½ hours.              

479
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,976
   Till they're just pull-apart 
  tender, but not falling apart.

480
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,880
              All right, chef,  
            short ribs are done.

481
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:36,947
Short ribs are done.            

482
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,683
  We got our bread.             

483
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:41,419
   We toasted it                
   on the flattop               

484
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,421
with just a little bit          
    of provolone.               

485
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:46,457
            That's not a skirt. 
       That's a full prom dress.

486
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,360
       We got                   
oven-roasted tomatoes.          

487
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,364
 Got our short rib.             

488
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,699
Pickled Fresno chili.           

489
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,635
       Arugula                  
and citrus vinaigrette.         

490
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,770
Nice local goat cheese.         

491
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:00,805
             This is ridiculous.

492
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,441
Couple extra chilies in case    
you want it for later.          

493
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:07,311
        In case you're just not 
    completely out of your mind.

494
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,947
    Cut into it.                

495
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,918
Got a little bit of clam chowder
   going on here.               

496
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,985
   Oyster cracker.              

497
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,721
Little chiffonade parsley.      

498
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:19,290
 And then sandwich,             
kind of lay it in there.        

499
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,331
    Got in there.               

500
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,799
        [ Mumbles indistinctly ]

501
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,667
     [ Laughs ]                 

502
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,738
                  Starting      
     at the cheese prom dress --

503
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,207
          crunchy, tear it off, 
      bite it like fried cheese.

504
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,741
        Toasted bread perfectly.

505
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,143
                  Short rib     
              is just unctuous. 

506
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:40,545
      Awesome.                  

507
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:43,547
 Cut of fat as soon as you bring
     that pickled Fresno chili. 

508
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,949
                 Little tang    
           from the goat cheese.

509
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:47,218
     I mean, you're just hitting
             level after level. 

510
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,552
               You're bouncing  
        like a pinball in there.

511
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,422
                 Every bite     
              is exactly right. 

512
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:53,624
        And then the chowder -- 
        you guys also make this?

513
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:54,625
        Yep.                    

514
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,931
                 This is...     
              without question, 

515
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,566
   one of the best clam chowders
               I've ever had.   

516
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,101
             Outstanding, chef. 
Thank you.                      

517
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:05,903
                I understand    
      why Dave and Rob have you.

518
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,905
  That means a lot.             
Thank you very much.            

519
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,974
Short rib grilled cheese,       
  clam chowder up!              

520
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,909
     WOMAN: Really crunchy,     
     crispy on the outside,     

521
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,311
     and the inside has just    
         so much flavor.        

522
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:16,514
    It's an amazing sandwich.   
      It's sandwich-tastic.     

523
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:17,848
         MAN: It's really unique

524
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,051
         because there's, like, 
        a parmesan tuile almost,

525
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,986
          like a parmesan crust.
Tuile?                          

526
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:24,054
     That's a --                
the tuile is this big.          

527
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,589
    That is like                
  a parmesan wheel.             

528
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,857
               It's a blanket.  
Yes, it is.                     

529
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,926
 WOMAN: They do a fantastic job 
       with the menu here,      

530
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:29,926
      and they really care      
         about the food.        

531
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,996
   There's really nothing else  
            like it.            

532
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,731
Nicely done.                    
                Thanks, brother.

533
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:39,337
        So, that's it for       
   this Flavortown road trip,   

534
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,537
      but don't you worry.      

535
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,940
   There's plenty more joints   
      all over the country!     

536
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,875
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

537
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,877
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

538
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:48,545
         Do I have any on there?

539
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:49,546
       No, no.                  
    You're good.                

540
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,149
     Yeah. Here.                
              But right in here.

541
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,950
       No, no.                  
   It looks good.               

542
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,353
               I'm all right?   
You're good.                    

543
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:57,287
    You have buddies like that, 
   I mean, who can you count on?

544
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,523
             Like a crime scene.
