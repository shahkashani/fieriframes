    ONCE IT COMES TO A BOIL,    
WE'RE JUST GONNA ADD OUR VANILLA

97
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,497
              AND LET OUR BUTTER
                 JUST MELT IN.  

98
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:54,499
WE'LL LET THAT COOL DOWN, AND   
IT'LL BE READY TO SERVE IT UP?  

99
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,368

00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,237
SLICE OUR BANANA WITH A DOLLOP  
OF WHIPPED CREAM IN THE CENTER. 

101
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:01,640
       SO IT'LL STICK LIKE THIS.
LINE THE CRUST WITH BANANA.     

102
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:03,508
 PUT A NICE SCOOP               
OF VANILLA PUDDING.             

103
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,110
       THAT'S A VERY NICE       
 PRESENTATION--LABOR-INTENSIVE. 

104
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,112
    YOU GOTTA DO                
POWDERED SUGAR FIRST            

105
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,515
SO THE CARAMEL SITS ON TOP,     
      AND THAT IS IT.           

106
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:12,584
 THEN YOU JUST HAVE TO BREAK IT 
           INTO PIECES          

107
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,520
AND DESTROY IT.                 
                  OKAY.         
         THAT'S PRETTY DYNAMITE.

108
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,390
     THE CRUST IS UP THERE WITH 
     "MADE BY SOME OF THE BEST."

109
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,859
       SUPER-FLAKY, BUT IT'S GOT
           SOME BODY TO IT.     

110
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,861
              THE VANILLA CREAM 
             IS NOT SUPERSWEET. 

111
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,730
    YOU KNOW WHAT THE KICKER IS?
            THE EGG WASH.       

112
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:27,332
 AND THEN THAT SUGAR IS KIND OF 
 REMINISCENT OF A SUGAR COOKIE. 

113
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:29,334
       I DON'T THINK I COULD EAT
           THE WHOLE THING.     

114
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,337
     I'M DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB
         OF IT, THOUGH. MMM!

MAKING VEGETARIAN,              

121
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,620
 AND THEN I HAD CUSTOMERS ASKING
  ME IF I COULD DO GLUTEN-FREE. 

122
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:52,024
   GLUTEN-FREE TURKEY BURGER.   
      WE LIKE NEW THINGS.       
        WE LIKE ORGANIC.        

123

 WE LET THIS MARINATE FOR ABOUT 
    FIVE HOURS TO OVERNIGHT.    

145
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,276
WE'RE GONNA ADD ABOUT 1/2 GALLON
         OF WATER HERE.         

146
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:45,811
  JUST SO IT COVERS A LITTLE BIT
           ON THE SIDES.        

147
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:48,213
 THEN WE'LL WRAP IT IN FOIL, AND
  IT'S READY TO GO IN THE OVEN.

149
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,552
IT SHOULD BE DONE. WE'LL TAKE   
  THE ROAST OUT OF THE PAN      

150
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,755
AND STRAIN THE LIQUID           
   FOR THE GRAVY.               
           SO WE'VE STRAINED IT.

 THE BISON HAS JUST RESTED LONG 
  ENOUGH NOW FOR US TO CUT IT.  

157
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,239
       IT'S GOT                 
A CRISPY OUTSIDE CRUST,

WITH THE VEGETABLES.

       I LIKE THE WAY YOU ROLL.

        REALLY NICE TEXTURE,    

162
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,986
      NOT ONLY REALLY TENDER,   
   BUT IT HAS A REAL BEEF FLAVOR

163
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,855
      FROM THE MEAT ITSELF,     
 AND THE GRAVY IS JUST ON POINT.

164

THE GREAT APPLE PIE?            
                IT TASTES GREAT.

481
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,636
IT'S GREAT?                     
                 BUT IT'S GRAPE.

482
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,171
G-R-A-P-E?                      
                          GRAPE.

483
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:29,173
                  IT'S A GREAT  
                GRAPE APPLE PIE.
GREAT--GREAT GRAPE              
    APPLE PIE?                  

484
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,442
                            YEP.
THAT'S WHAT THE NAME SHOULD BE--
     GREAT GRAPE APPLE PIE.     

485
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,377
GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN.            
              BUTTER CHOPPED UP.

486
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,313
 THIS IS GONNA MAKE IT          
SO IT'S NICE AND FLAKY.         
                            YEP.

487
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,914
                   FLOUR, SUGAR,
                   SOME VANILLA.
CINNAMON.                       

488
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,517
    THEN WE GET 'EM INCORPORATED
            A LITTLE BIT.       

489
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,319
            A LITTLE BIT        
     OF HALF-AND-HALF IN THERE. 

490
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,254
                 THEN YOU       
           JUST PULL IT ON OUT. 

491
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:46,056
                 DO THAT.       
          A LITTLE BIT OF FLOUR.
FAST, QUICK, AND EASY DOUGH.    

492
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,925
                 YEP. PUT IT    
            IN THE PLASTIC WRAP.

493
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,860
                REFRIGERATE IT  
              FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.
LET IT REST.                    

494
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,662
              UNWRAP THIS.      
         A LITTLE BIT OF FLOUR. 

495
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,464
                 AND THEN       
           I JUST PRESS IT OUT. 

496
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,332
                THEN WE GET     
          THE OLD ALUMINUM FOIL.

497
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:58,869
      WE USE ALUMINUM FOIL HERE.
BY PUTTING THE BEANS ON IT      
      WITH THE FOIL,            

498
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:00,738
   IT'S GONNA KEEP FROM         
BUBBLING UP AND PUFFING UP.     

499
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,808
           AND ALSO FALLING DOWN
                 THE SIDE.      
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO USE       
    THE BEANS AGAIN.            

500
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,810
PUT THAT IN,                    
BAKE IT OFF.                    
                     45 MINUTES.

501
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,812
NOW WE'RE READY TO GO           
   ON THE FILLING               

502
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,814
FOR THE GREAT GRAPE APPLE PIE.  
      THE GREAT GRAPE APPLE PIE.

503
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,549
DICE SOME APPLES,               

504
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,483
AND THEN I JUST CUT GRAPES      
         IN HALF.               
                         GOT IT.

505
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,485
HEAT UP THE PAN.                
GET SOME BUTTER.                

506
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:17,288
           TECHNICAL FORM       
    OF RIPPING IT WITH YOUR PAW.
YEAH.                           

507
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,356
         PUT IN                 
THE APPLE-GRAPE MIXTURE,        

508
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,891
SOME SUGAR, CINNAMON,           

509
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,760
A SPLASH OF VANILLA.            
     PRECISE MEASUREMENTS AGAIN.

510
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:25,296
EXACTLY.                        
   (clicks tongue) LET THIS COOK
    DOWN TO SOFTEN EVERYBODY UP.

511
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:26,964
       THERE'S THE CRUST. OKAY. 

512
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,567
                       SO NOW...
  FILL THAT UP                  
WITH THE MIXTURE.               

513
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,369
         TOP IT                 
WITH MY LITTLE TOPPING--        

514
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,304
BUTTER, FLOUR, SUGAR,           
CINNAMON, AND VANILLA.          

515
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,306
       THIS WILL MAKE           
THE NICE LITTLE CRUST ON TOP.   

516
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:39,509
AND THEN 350, MAYBE AN HOUR,    
        45 MINUTES.             
           THAT'LL TAKE AN HOUR 
         AND 45 MINUTES, REALLY?

517
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:41,045
IT TAKES A WHILE, YEAH.         

518
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,381
ARE YOU READY?

          WATCH OUT. IT'S HOT.  

519
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,983
     DON'T DO THIS AT HOME.     
YOU'LL BURN YOUR LITTLE FINGERS.

520
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:48,919
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?             
          I'M TAKING THE PIE RIM
               OFF OF HERE.     

521
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:51,722
OH, NICE! LOOK AT THAT. SEE?

522
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,524
               AND THEN GO AHEAD
                  AND CUT IT,   

523
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,327
         SERVE IT ON A PLATE    
     WITH HOMEMADE WHIPPED CREAM

524
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,729
         WITH A BIT OF CARDAMOM 
              AND VANILLA.      

525
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,965

THE CRUST IS NICE AND LIGHT.    

526
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,933
APPLES KIND OF ROUND OUT        
      A LITTLE BIT,             

527
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,735
TAKE ON THE CINNAMON            
     REAL WELL.                 

528
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,737
THE FLAVOR OF THE GRAPE...      
  OPENS UP THE PROFILE--        

529
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,272
THE EFFERVESCENCE, YOU KNOW,    

530
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,074
KIND OF THE SHARPNESS           
    OF THE GRAPE.               

531
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,975
       IT'S GOT                 
A LOT OF GREAT FLAVOR.          

532
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:14,478

536
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:22,953
           IT'S GRAPY.          
      THE CRUST IS CRUNCHY.     

537
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,155

             TO EAT.            

540
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,562
