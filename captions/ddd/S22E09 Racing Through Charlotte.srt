00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,604
You're attacking this thing.    

117
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,740
 It's like a coyote             
  got ahold of it.              

118
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:35,741
                 [ Laughs ]     

119
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:36,941
WOMAN: Triple "G," sir.         

120
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,277
    MAN: It's a sloppy piece    
          of equipment,         

121
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,877
 but it's delicious and filling.

122
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,947
              Shrimp tacos up.  

123
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,148
        Just great food,        
        great atmosphere.       

124
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,883
And it's just a wonderful energy
          that's here.          

125
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:49,421
Mmm.                            
  WOMAN: Greg brings up things  
 that you would think, "What?!" 

126
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,956
     And when you taste it,     
      it's just fantastic.      

127
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,425
             Corn dog shrimp up.

128
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:54,826
  Corn dog shrimp is delicious. 

129
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,962
             WOMAN:             
  The corn dog batter is sweet, 

130
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,698
 and then the shrimp tend to be 
       a little bit salty.      

131
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,166
         It's just good.        

132
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,434
                FIERI: Okay,    
        what are we making next?

133
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:05,036
        We are making the batter
        for the corn dog shrimp.

134
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,105
         Dipsy Dog corn dog mix.

135
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,973
That's very old school.         

136
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,042
     A lot of fairs and circuses
     and stuff like that use it.

137
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,644
              We're gonna go in 
               with the water.  

138
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,379
     Then we're gonna jump on it
                with a whisk.   

139
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,848
 All right, so, you see how nice
       and creamy that is?      

140
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,650
      So it'll really coat      
         to that shrimp.        

141
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,584
     Here we go.                

142
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,455
          21-25 shrimp.         

143
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,123
          Grab them by the tail.
  By the tail.                  

144
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,524
                   Dunk them in.
              Okay.             

145
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,126
    Got to set them in there    
         nice and easy.         

146
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:29,194
        Float them a bit.       
Set it in.                      

147
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,395
               And let it got.  

148
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,464
      That's so it doesn't      
    just sink to the bottom.    

149
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:33,465
        Bam!                    

150
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:34,799
                There you go.   

151
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:35,867
        Whaa!                   

152
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,736
               Corn dog shrimp  
              are ready to go.  

153
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,070
Perfect them babies are.        

154
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,139
    Pretty proud of yourself    
      on these, aren't you?     

155
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,206
        Yes.                    

156
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,275
        Get in after it.        

157
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:44,809
      Oh, yeah.                 

158
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,210
  They're so good.              

159
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,481
  It tastes like a corn dog --  
     sweet, crunchy batter.     

160
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,616
Straight from the fair.         
     Straight from the fair.    

161
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,285
 Straight from the fair.        
           Not salty.           

162
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,487
 The corn dog shrimp            
is something I've never had,    

163
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:59,691
and I'll be back to Pinky's     
weekly because they're so good. 

164
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,159
     WOMAN: Corn dog shrimp.    

165
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,027
 The breading they use on there 
     with the shrimp inside,    

166
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,095
        it's extra sweet.       

167
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,698
    It's always fresh shrimp.   
        It's great stuff.       

168
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,099
             FIERI:             
        So, here we are.        

169
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,835
  We're hanging out at Pinky's  
  in Charlotte, North Carolina. 

170
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,636
     So, when we come back,     
     we're gonna make --        
     What are we making?        

171
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,704
          The Asian pork burger.

172
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,640
   It was the perfect burger.   
       It was just right.       

173
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:18,543
       Asian pork burger.       
    See you in a little bit.    

174
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,452
    Welcome back.               
  We're at Pinky's.             

175
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,988
             FIERI:             
  My good buddy Greg -- You saw 
  him at the Penguin years ago, 

176
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,789
         and, of course,        
 you know this cat Clint Bowyer.

177
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,925
     We've already dug into     
       the triple-decker,       

178
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:37,061
   and now we're ready to roll  
with a different kind of burger.

179
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,797
           Asian pork burger up.

180
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:42,133
 The Asian pork burger is sweet,
     tangy. It's delicious.     

181
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,403
       What are we making?      
         Korean barbecue sauce  
      for the Asian pork burger.

182
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,472
               We're going in   
               with soy sauce.  

183
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,073
                 Sesame oil.    

184
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,075
           Sesame oil.          
You have that in the South.     

185
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,344
                Black pepper.   
                Fresh garlic.   

186
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,480
             Rice wine vinegar. 
                Fresh ginger.   

187
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:56,882
         One Granny Smith apple.

188
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,082
         That's the key         
          right there.          

189
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,150
               Sriracha sauce.  

190
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,952
    I don't know.               
That could be it right there.   

191
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,821
                Brown sugar.    

192
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,623
     Then we're gonna thicken it
       with a cornstarch slurry.

193
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,957
      So, this cooks down.      

194
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,291
   You hold that as the sauce   
    that goes to the burger?    

195
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,426
                   Mm-hmm.      

196
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,829
       And now we're into       
     the pork burger itself.    

197
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:14,098
          Yep. We're gonna go in
         with fresh ground pork.

198
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,636
       We have cilantro, garlic,
                green onions,   

199
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:20,572
             rice wine vinegar, 
             five-spice powder, 

200
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:24,843
         sesame oil, dried mint,
               Sriracha sauce.  

201
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,644
Big on Sriracha.                
   Sriracha's good stuff, man.  

202
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:27,712
       Great.                   

203
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,916
             Sambal chili paste.
              Red curry paste.  

204
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,784
We basically have everything but
  the kitchen sink in this one. 

205
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,918
                    Yes.        

206
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,321
                Fresh ginger.   
                 Fish sauce.    

207
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,122
That's actually an adjustment   
on a racecar. You know that?    

208
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,658
        What? Fish sauce?       
 No, no. Everything             
but the kitchen sink.           

209
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,260
It means --                     
     You're all over the tracks.

210
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,529
 See? He knows.                 
                  Chili flakes. 

211
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:48,400
                Curry powder.   
 Lime juice and mirin rice wine.

212
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:51,203
                 All right.     
      We're just going hands in.

213
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:53,538
  All right. Let these cook up, 
put a nice little crust on them.

214
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,307
                    Yep.        

215
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,477
        Little bit of the glaze.

216
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,545
          A cilantro honey slaw.

217
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:01,813
              Okay.             

218
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,248
Look how good it is!            

219
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:08,086
  I just want to show you guys  
          something --          

220
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,021
          my first bite         
    and Bowyer's first bite.    

221
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,824
Look at his fuel tank           
    versus mine.                

222
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,025
You know, you always wonder     

223
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,827
how these restaurants           
  get on this show.             

224
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,896
You don't wonder anymore        
  if you try that.              

225
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,697
   The balance of the flavors,  

226
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,033
       crunch of the slaw,      
  really nice bun, by the way.  

227
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,635
When the sauce kicks in,        
  that's the best.              

228
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,303
         Real deal, man.        
 Damn right.                    

229
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,638
           Well done.           
 I'll take another one of those.

230
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,574
             Asian pork burger. 

231
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:32,110
    It's a nice blend of pork   
      with a hint of spice,     

232
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,645
    and it's nice and juicy.    

233
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,715
This is Cassi and Marcus Smith, 
and my buddy Marcus here        

234
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:39,284
  is the president              
of Charlotte Motor Speedway.    

235
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:42,921
  We love Pinky's, and, I mean, 
  this burger is unbelievable.  

236
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,322
        Did you feel the flavor?

237
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,057
               Oh!              
                     I mean,    
             this is Flavortown.

238
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,158
          I love this.          

239
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,662
           Ding Dong Chicken up.

240
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:51,796
    All the food is right on.   

241
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,132
        It's, all around,       
       a good experience.       

242
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:58,536
  I have a cousin named Pinky,  
   and his real name is Greg,   

243
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,939
        so Pinky, Greg --       
  I mean, this was meant to be. 

244
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,875
           All right.           
 I'm driving to the next place. 

245
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,209
You're not driving.             
          I'm driving.          

246
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,011
 You're not driving.            

247
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,014
          Coming up...          
                      Wow.      

248
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,349
        ...we're cruising       
   to a food-and-fun combo...   

249
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,084
           That's just          
      what I was thinking.      

250
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,753
...where Clint's trying his hand
        in the kitchen...       

251
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:15,953
           I got it. Let me know
           if you need anything.

252
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,690
      ...and I have to race     
         against a pro.         

253
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,024
        I treat you good        
         in the kitchen.        

254
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,226
     You don't go sending me    
          in the wall.          

255
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,201
So, I've come all the way       
to Charlotte, North Carolina,   

256
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:33,137
to visit you, and you bring me  
to an indoor go-kart track?     

257
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,106
                That's right.   
           We race in Charlotte.

258
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,676
Is this the "drive" part of     
"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives"? 

259
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,078
          Oh, we're gonna drive,
                 all right,     

260
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,479
             but let me tell you
                 something.     

261
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,081
             It ain't just about
               go-karts here.   

262
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,216
   This is some of the best eats
                in Charlotte,   

263
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:48,219
             and it's right here
    at the Pit Road Bar & Grill.

264
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,154
              Moon Pie sliders. 

265
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,557
      The menu at Pit Road      
      is out of this world.     

266
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,292
      Pimento cheeseburger.     

267
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,227
     You wouldn't expect to     
     find a place like this     
     inside a go-kart track.    

268
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,029
      The food is amazing.      

269
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,497
               Dry-rub wings.   

270
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,703
This is a perfect situation     
for us to be in in Charlotte.   

271
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,438
             FIERI:             
 Fueled by co-owners and in-laws

272

   Fred Ogrim, Clay Robinson,   
        and Ed Bradford,        

273
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,710
       who wanted to build      
       a high-octane menu.      

274
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:14,245
       We wanted good food      
  for people to come and enjoy. 

275
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,914
                 Real deal.     

276
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,715
     Not just coming to race    
      but come here to eat.     

277
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:21,653
       FIERI: So in 2013,       
 they signed up Charlotte native

278
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,854
    and long-time kitchen vet   
         Donnie Simmons.        

279
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,991
   Redneck taters -- table 22.  

280
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:29,394
      They are risk-takers      
       with their flavors.      
             WOMAN: The Concord.

281
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,262
   There really isn't another   
   place in Charlotte           
   to get this sandwich.        

282
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:34,065
 MAN: It's a fillet. They've got
    a fig paste of some sort    

283
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,599
     they put on the bottom.    
          It's magical.         

284
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,667
           All right.           
     You get after it, Chef.    

285
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:37,868
        You like fillet?        

286
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,404
      Oh, yeah.                 
Who doesn't like the fillet?    

287
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,139
So, what's in the marinade here,
              boss?             

288
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,340
              SIMMONS: Marsala. 

289
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,342
    Marsala -- Not something    
I expect to find at a racetrack.

290
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:47,078
              Oil. Kosher salt. 
            Ground black pepper.

291
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,147
              Okay.             
       Whisk it up a little bit.

292
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,348
    So, we're gonna let this    
    marinade go for how long?   

293
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,616
                  24 hours.     

294
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,552
   All right. We're gonna make  
      this fig compote jam?     

295
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:55,753
               Fig preserves.   

296
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,555
       This I got to see.       
    Do you eat a lot of figs?   

297
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:58,489
 No.                            
          Try it. Good.         

298
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,458
 Really?                        
          Good for you.         

299
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,693
 Man, they<i> are</i> good.            

300
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,161
      Let's get into this.      
            Apple cider vinegar.

301
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,229
           Little acid          
     to cut all that sweet.     

302
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,531
                    H2O.        

303
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,566
                 A little sugar.
         A<i> little</i> sugar?        

304
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,434
That's the race fuel.           
                Cayenne pepper. 

305
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,503
             Coriander, ground. 
                Kosher salt.    

306
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,572
     Okay. How long we gonna    
       let this cook down?      

307
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:15,707
                Three hours.

     You want to have Clint

  just sit here and watch that  
        for three hours?        

310
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,311
                    Sure.       
    I got it.

if you need anything.

313
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,116
   All right. Where are we at?  

314
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,452
   We use the immersion blender,
                 mix it up.     

315
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,187
      Oh, yeah.

00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,723

        Nice.                   

317
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,791
           All right.           
    Let's make the sandwich.    
                  Little garlic.

Fire is key.                    
                 Let it cook    
          for about six minutes.

       Grill our ciabatta bread.

322
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,667
                  Little of     
        the North Carolina figs.

327
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:50,742
             Little blue cheese.

328
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:51,809
     Now to the pizza oven?     

329
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,877
                 Two minutes

331
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,884
The fig is something            
   I've never had.              

332
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,686
The fillet is phenomenal.

The cheese is the ultimate.

335
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:06,024
   You really put some crunch   
             to it.             

336
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:07,892
 I'm a big fan of this contrast 

337
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,761
      between that fig jam      
      and that blue cheese.     

338
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:11,962
  It's money.                   
                  Concord.      

339
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,698
       It's really a blend      
       of all the flavors.      

340
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,966

the celery root slaw.

521
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,543
  Israeli couscous.             
So, this will be the base.      

522
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:33,611
       Kind of like pasta balls.

523

        here.                   

524
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,483
  Smoked tomatoes.              
Little bit of apricots here.    

525
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,485
              The Medjool date. 
  Exactly.                      

526
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:43,687
      Cilantro.                 
Fresh-squeezed lemon juice.     

527
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,124
Then we're just gonna           
  mix this here up.             

528
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,892
So, next, we're gonna do        
  the chana masala.             

529
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:49,160
              The chana masala. 

530
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:51,362
  We're gonna start             
   with olive oil.              

531
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,165
      Onions --                 
This is traditional mirepoix.   

532
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,967
 Carrots and celery,            
      as well.                  

533
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,402
So, this is about as traditional
                as it comes.    

534
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:01,105
Exactly. A little garlic.       
     Smelling good already.

00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:04,241
   Coriander next,              
    curry powder.               

536
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,509
Now let that toast up           
    a little bit.               

537
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,977
Go in with our chickpeas.

        Not the best bean       
          in the world.

00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,185
             He just chucked it 
                out the door.   

542
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:16,254
 Coconut milk first.            

543
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:17,988
             Gonna get some lime
                  in there.     

544
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,590
 And then we'll just            
    mix that up.                

545
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,325
 We're gonna hit it             
with a little salt and pepper   

546
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,660
     and let it                 
 all come together.             

547
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,595
             So, let this reduce
         about 20 or 30 minutes,

548
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,129
     and then we eat some tacos.
 Exactly.                       

549
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:29,466
Just get a little bit of this   
couscous down in the base.      

550
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,935
  That chana masala             
 right over the top.            

551
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,603
              Right on the top? 
Yes, sir.                       

552
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:33,871
 We're gonna give it            
this little goat cheese         

553
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,740
      and then                  
a little bit of scallions.      

554
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,876
        I'm telling you,        
   you've done your homework,   

555
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,412
      and this is awesome.      

556
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,080
 I'm getting a lot of that great
      rich flavor coming through

557
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,815
          from the coconut milk,
           and, all of a sudden,

558
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,683
         I just got a little bit
         of the slivered almond,

559
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,485
and then I just got a little bit
      of the tang of the apricot

560
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:49,553
                come through.   

561
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,688
         This is really,        
          really good.          

562
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,824
Well, I'm glad you like it.     
  That's for sure.              

563
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,426
                             Oh!
    Do you need another one?    

564
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:57,161
                 [ Muffled ]    
              I didn't like it. 

565
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:58,229
          [ Laughter ]          

566
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:00,164
             Two chana masalas. 

567
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,634
  This just has the right touch 
    of curry seasoning in it.   

568
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,836
      MAN: All the flavors      
       just come together.      

569
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,972
     They never miss a beat.    

570
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:10,974
This variety that I've had today
         is pretty wild.        

571
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,043
            Honestly,           
  I would have never tried this 

572
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,713
   had I not been on this show  
    and had this opportunity.   

573
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,848
    You find The Tin Kitchen,   
   you're on the right track.   

574
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,583
       You'll find Clint Bowyer.

575
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,985
   MAN: Some of the best food   
      you'll have anywhere,     

576
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:22,186
   whether it's out of a truck  

577
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,055
            or out of           
 a brick-and-mortar restaurant. 

578
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,723
  Hands down, the best in town. 

579
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,658
          So, that's it         
    for this special edition    

580
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,393

           and Dives"           

581
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,261
       here in Charlotte,       
         North Carolina,        

582
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,396
      but don't you worry.      

583
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,398
      There's funky joints      
     all over this country.     

584
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,133
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

585
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:38,002
     on "Diners, Drive-Ins,     
           and Dives."          

586
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,603
      Hey, Guy!                 

587
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,206
              Guy! Clint Bowyer 
     just stole The Tin Kitchen!

588
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,342
It's happened to me.            
Don't worry about it.           
He won't bring it back.         

589
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,944
       You got to coach me here,
                   buddy.       

590
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,013
You're doing great.             
    You're doing good. Sure.    

591
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:52,617
   He will walk us off the cliff
               if you let him.  

592
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,755
                Oh, that's --   
              that's hilarious. 

593
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,023
            It's not funny, Guy!

594
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,258
        Caution on the speedway.
