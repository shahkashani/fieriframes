220
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,138
      I HONESTLY HAVE BEEN      
ANTICIPATING THE FLAVORS OF THIS

221
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,008
                  SINCE I HEARD 
                ABOUT THE PLACE.

222
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,010
          YOU SHOULD HAVE A GRIN
              LIKE THAT. HMM.   
IT'S GOOD STUFF. YEAH.          

223
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,612

                IT'S THIN.      

224
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,614
          IT'S GOT GOOD TEXTURE.
            IT'S GOT GOOD CHEW. 

225
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,148
         I AM TELLING YOU WHAT--

226
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,486
      THIS WILL BE AN EXPERIENCE

227
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:16,221

THANK YOU, BROTHER.             

228
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,357
           IN THE BURGER WORLD, 
         THIS IS burgerbomb.com.

229
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,693
(chuckles)                      

230
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,295
TASTE OF SWEETNESS IN THE BURGER
     BUT WITH THE SPICINESS     

231
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,230
         OF THE AIOLI--         
     IT'S REALLY DELICIOUS.     

232
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,900
    IT'S ALMOST KIND OF LIKE    
      DIM SUM IN A BURGER.      

233
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,039
<i>THAT'S 'CAUSE THEY'RE HIS TAKE</i>  
 <i> ON THE FOOD HE ATE AS A KID.</i>  

234
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,708
 I GREW UP IN HAWAII. WE HAD    
A LOT OF LOCAL BURGER PLACES.   

235
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,844
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM WHAT
 THEY DO HERE ON THE MAINLAND.  

236
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,247
EVERYTHING IS ASIAN-INSPIRED--  
  FLAVORS FROM PACIFIC RIM,     

237
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,183
FLAVORS FROM JAPAN, CHINA,      
    THAILAND, VIETNAM.          

238
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:48,586
  <i> BUT HE'S PUTTING ASIAN SPIN</i>  
<i> ON MORE THAN JUST THE BURGERS.</i> 

239
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,455
    PORK BELLY STEAMED BUNS.    

240
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,390
    WE'RE GONNA START           
WITH THE WHOLE PORK BELLY.      
                           OKAY.

241
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,925
WE CUT THIS IN HALF.            

242
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,127
GOT IT PORTIONED OUT.           
  SALT AND PEPPER.              

243
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,396
GET THE PAN NICE AND HOT.       

244
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,931
SOME VEGETABLE OIL.             

245
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,333
SEAR OFF THAT FAT.              

246
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,335
YOU GET A NICE BROWN CRUST      
     ON THE OUTSIDE.            

247
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:05,337
             ALL THE WAY AROUND?
ALL THE WAY AROUND.             

248
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,339
           SO WE'RE GONNA SEAR  
         ALL FOUR SIDES OF THIS.

249
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:09,341
WE PUT THIS IN THE PAN          
    FOR BRAISING.               
                           OKAY.

250
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,276
    WE'VE GOT SOME              
SHAOXING COOKING WINE,          

251
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,544
JUST ENOUGH TO COVER            
   THE PORK BELLY.              
           THIS IS CHINESE WINE?

252
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,347
THIS IS SIMILAR TO SHERRY.      
                           OKAY.

253
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:16,815
NOW CHOPPED GARLIC,             

254
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,616
OUR SLICED GINGER,              

255
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,218
STAR ANISE.                     

256
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,753
                            MMM.

257
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,955
LICORICE FLAVOR.                
              I LOVE THAT SMELL.

258
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,290
               NEXT UP--OHH,    
          THESE ARE MY FAVORITE.
     THIS IS OUR                
SZECHUAN PEPPERCORNS.           

259
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,494
       AND THESE                
ARE THE DRIED SHALLOTS.         

260
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,630
GREEN ONIONS STEMS              
WE ADD FOR FLAVOR.              
                           OKAY.

261
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:34,432
AND THEN CILANTRO STEMS.        
  HOW DOES THIS LOOK?           
             IT LOOKS FANTASTIC.

262
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,234
               JUST ENOUGH WATER
                  TO COVER IT.  
YEAH.                           

263
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,236
       AND ARE WE GONNA USE THIS
         BRAISING LIQUID LATER  

264
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:41,306
                   FOR ANYTHING?
 WE USE THAT AS THE BASE FOR    
OUR SAUCE FOR OUR PORK BELLY.   

265
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,174
WE'RE GONNA COVER IT            
 WITH SOME TINFOIL.             

266
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:46,778
ABOUT 450 DEGREES               
  FOR 5 HOURS.                  

267
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,114
        IT'S GONNA COME OUT     
   JUST BARELY HOLDING TOGETHER.

268
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,985
COOL IT OVERNIGHT.              
                 LET IT CONGEAL.

269
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,786
YEAH.                           

270
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,856
           AND THEN WE SLICE IT.
YEAH.                           

271
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:00,525
WE HAVE OUR PORK BELLY.         
  IT'S PORTIONED OUT.           

272
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,927
WE'RE GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BIT   
OF SALT AND PEPPER, SEASON IT.  

273
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,462
SO THIS POTATO STARCH.          

274
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,464
WE'RE JUST GONNA DREDGE THIS    
   IS THE POTATO STARCH.        

275
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,199
WE'RE GONNA GO INSIDE           
   THE DEEP FRYER               

276
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,735
FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS.           

277
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,604
                        NEXT UP.
AND WE'RE GONNA FINISH          
    OUR PORK BELLY              

278
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:15,005
IN THE BRAISING LIQUID.         
               THAT WE STRAINED.

279
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,574
        IT GOES                 
INTO OUR HOT SAUTé PAN.         

280
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,679
IT REDUCES AND FORMS A GLAZE    
   AROUND THE PORK BELLY.       
                          RIGHT.

281
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,481
         WE WANT                
THAT NICE LACQUERED LOOK.       

282
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,483
SO AS THE PORK IS COOKING,      
 WE'RE STEAMING OUR BUNS.       

283
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,686
PUT THEM IN THE STEAMER         
FOR ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES.        
                      FANTASTIC.

284
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:31,222
                OKAY, LET'S MAKE
                  A SANDWICH.   
STICK THE PORK INSIDE           

285
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:32,757
JUST LIKE THAT.                 
                            OHH.

286
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,892
WE GOT SOME BOILED EGG HERE,

287
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,427

AND SOME CILANTRO,              

288
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,696
  ASIAN-STYLE MIXED GREENS,     
THE CHINESE BLACK VINAIGRETTE.  

289
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,165

                  GOING ON      

291
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,570
          THAT IT LOOKS TOO GOOD
          TO ACTUALLY BITE INTO.

292
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,105
              BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

293
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,574
  I GOT TO INTRODUCE YOU THE CAT

00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,515
      YEAH, PRETTY CLOSE.       
              THIS IS NO BURGER.

298
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,517
              NO.               
                  BUT THIS IS   
               THE KIND OF FOOD?

  I HAVE IT SET TO LET ME KNOW  
 WHEN SHAWARMA IS APPROACHING.  

407
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,896
 SHAWARMA, SHAWARMA, SHAWARMA!  
        <i> (alarm blaring)</i>        

408
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:40,697
  SO HERE I AM IN RICHARDSON,   

409
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,433
            12 MILES            
   OUTSIDE OF DALLAS, TEXAS,

00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,036
TO CHECK OUT A JOINT THAT I HEAR
    IS ROCKIN' THE SHAWARMA.    

411
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:47,205

         USED TO MAKE.          

417
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,257
  IT'S ALWAYS DELICIOUS.        

418
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,793
 I HAVE TO COME HERE AT LEAST   
    ONCE A WEEK OR I'LL DIE.    

419
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,263
                            DIE?
        YEAH, I'LL JUST         
        STRAIGHT-UP DIE.        

420
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:15,400
      <i> I LOVE THE PASSION</i>       
    <i> FOR A FAMILY-RUN JOINT</i>     

421
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,535
 <i> THAT STARTED AS A PASTRY SHOP</i> 
            <i> IN '01.</i>            

422
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,871
   <i> BUT THE ELHORR BROTHERS,</i>    
  <i> THEY DECIDED TO GO BIGGER.</i>   

423
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,673
THERE WAS A BIG DEMAND          
       FOR FOOD                 

424
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,675
WHEN WE STARTED OPENING         
   AS A SWEET SHOP.             

425
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:28,412
SO GRADUALLY, WE STARTED ADDING 
  LITTLE ITEMS HERE AND THERE   

426
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,214
FROM MY MOM'S RECIPE.

              WITH HUMMUS READY.

428
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,885
VERY UNIQUE FOOD. YOU KNOW, YOU 
 DON'T SEE IT ON EVERY CORNER.  

429
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,289
      WELL, THAT'S WHY I HAVE IT
        PROGRAMMED IN MY G.P.S. 
                FALAFEL IS READY
                   FOR PICKUP.

                    TEXAS, DUDE.

431
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,826
AND YOU'RE EATING IN            

432
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:44,896
    A MIDDLE EASTERN            
MEDITERRANEAN RESTAURANT.       
             AND I LOVE IT, MAN.

00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,163
       CHICKEN SHAWARMA.        

434
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,165
     I DO GET THE SHAWARMA      
       EVERY TIME I COME.       

435
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,167
           IT'S JUST            
     SO EXTREMELY FLAVORFUL     

436
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:54,505
      THAT EVERY MOUTHFUL       
     IS JUST AN EXPERIENCE.     

437
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:57,775
WE'RE GONNA MAKE                
CHICKEN SHAWARMA.               
        WHAT DOES SHAWARMA MEAN?

438
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,178
IT'S A TURKISH WORD,            
     SHAWARMA.                  

439
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,380
THIS IS WHAT SHAWARMA IS--      
      IT'S THE MEAT             

440
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,715
ON A--STACKED ON TOP            
   OF EACH OTHER.               

441
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,784
      WE HAVE                   
THE SHAWARMA SPICES.            

442
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,320
                 WHAT IS IN     
            THE SHAWARMA SPICES?

443
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,923
CAYENNE, PAPRIKA.               
                 AND IT'S CALLED
                SHAWARMA SPICES?

444
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,324
      IT'S CALLED               
CHICKEN SHAWARMA SPICES.        

445
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,326
  IF ANYBODY WANTS TO MAKE      
CHICKEN SHAWARMA WITH SPICES,   

446
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,394
HE GOES WITH THIS ONE.          
             YOU DON'T USE THIS?

447
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,598
YOU DON'T HAVE SHAWARMA.        
YOU DON'T HAVE SHAWARMA.        
        YOU DON'T HAVE SHAWARMA.
                 OKAY.          

448
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,734
   WE HAVE CITRIC ACID          
TO GIVE IT A LEMONY TASTE,      

449
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:27,004
SALT, GROUND CORIANDER,         
     TOMATO SAUCE,              

450
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:29,140
OLIVE OIL--100%--               

451
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:32,476
AND THE REST IS WATER.          

452
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,880
WE HAVE A MIX OF ONIONS,        
GARLIC, CORIANDER--FRESH.       

453
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,882
                  AND THAT GOES 
                 ON THE CHICKEN?

454
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:40,484
THAT GOES ON THE CHICKEN.       
      HOW LONG WILL IT MARINATE?

455
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,087
AT LEAST 12 TO 24 HOURS.        
                 12 TO 24 HOURS.

456
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,624
SO HOW BIG OF A PLATFORM--      

457
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,626
IT'S NOT GONNA COME             
 ALL THE WAY OUT?               

458
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,428
IT'S GONNA BE--                 
         IT'S STILL GONNA COME--

459
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,630
        I'M STILL GONNA SHAPE IT
              LIKE A CONE.      

460
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,031
CHICKEN SHAWARMA                
  FLAVOR CONE.                  
                            YES.

461
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,100
WHY DOESN'T IT SAY THAT         
   ON THE BILLBOARD?            
                      (chuckles)

462
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,569
 SO JUST KEEP                   
STACKING IT UP.                 
            KEEP STACKING IT UP.

463
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,571
PRESSING IT DOWN.               
                   NOW I'M GONNA
                  PRESS IT DOWN.

464
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,640
THAT'S THE MANHOLE COVER        
         PRESS?                 

465
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,242
       AND NOW WE'RE GONNA START
             SHAPING IT UP.     

466
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,444
  WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH     
THOSE EXTRA CHUNKS OF CHICKEN?  

467
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,847
              THEY GO BACK HERE.
    YOU'RE GONNA                
STACK THEM ON THERE.            

468
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,917
              STACK IT IN THERE.
   AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA USE    
THAT MEAT TO HOLD THAT ON THERE.

469
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,252
                          RIGHT.

470
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,522
OKAY.                           

471
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,259
SO NOW WE GOT IT ON.            
 THIGH MEAT ON TOP.             
                           OKAY.

472
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:24,228
FAT, AND WE'RE READY            
  TO GO TO THE...               
                WELL, WE NEED   
            TO GARNISH IT FIRST.

473
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,333
 AND HOW MUCH WEIGHT            
DO YOU THINK THAT IS?           

474
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,335
     THAT'S ABOUT 65, 70 POUNDS.

475
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,704
LIFT WITH YOUR LEGS,            
NOT WITH YOUR BACK.             

476
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,408
   AND HOW LONG WILL            
IT GO ON THE ROTISSERIE         

477
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,743
BEFORE WE START EATING IT?      

478
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,678
               20 TO 25 MINUTES.

479
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,748
   ALL RIGHT, SO NICE AND BROWN.
        NOW IT'S GOOD TO GO?    
VERY THIN.                      

480
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,415
YOU HAVE TO MIX IT              
   WITH THE...                  

481
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,018
     SOME OF THE BASTING JUICES.
EXACTLY.                        

482
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,019
          THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD.

483
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,888
            AND THAT'S THE DEAL.

484
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,357
MMM.                            

485
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,626
IT'S TENDER.                    
IT'S JUICY.                     

486
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:58,228
IT'S SUPER FLAVORFUL--          

487
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,198
NOT OVERSEASONED,               
 NOT OVERSPICED.                

488
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,701
     LOOK AT THAT.              
LOOK AT ALL THAT CRUST.         

489
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,704
  KIND OF LIKE EVERY PIECE      
HAS A CRUNCH EXTERIOR TO IT,    

490
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,640
   AND THEN YOU SEE HERE,       
AS SOON AS MINE GOT CUT OFF,    

491
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:11,642
IT'S STARTING TO BROWN AGAIN,   
     SO THE NEXT ORDER,         

492
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:14,578
WHEN THEY COME AND TAKE IT OFF, 
 IT'S GONNA BE THE BOMB AGAIN.  

493
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,181
           MMM.                 
THAT'S THE REAL DEAL, MAN.      

494
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,950
           THAT'S THE REAL DEAL.
            THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

495
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,187
       CHICKEN SHAWARMA.        

496
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:25,189
       THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST
        SHAWARMA I'VE EVER HAD. 

497
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:26,724
IT'S ROCKIN' SHAWARMA.          
                   IT'S AWESOME.

498
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,527
     I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO     
A SHAWARMA COMA IN A LITTLE BIT.

499
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,795
     I LIKE HOW HE WEARS HIS HAT
            LIKE A COWBOY.      

500
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,330
(laughs) YEAH, WELL...          

501
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,065
          HE'S LIKE THE LEBANESE
                JOHN WAYNE.     

502
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,867
  (together) I'LL TELL YOU.     

503
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,537
                 (as John Wayne)
                   YA PILGRIM.  

504
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,473
          SO THAT'S IT          
FOR THIS FLAVOR TOWN ROAD TRIP, 

505
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,007
      BUT DON'T YOU WORRY.      

506
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,009
   THERE'S PLENTY MORE JOINTS
