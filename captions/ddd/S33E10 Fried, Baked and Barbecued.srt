of John Leonard's, the chef now.

219
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,837
 LEONARD: What we're making here
 is a house-made chimichurri -- 

220
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,407
    cilantro, dried oregano,    
         smoked paprika,        

221
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:59,477
    garlic, red-chili flake,    
   salt and pepper, olive oil.  

222
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:03,748
     Now, we're butterflying    
         our tenderloin.        

223
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,817
        What we have here       
      is my chipotle cream.     

224
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,285
   It's chipotle, lemon juice,  

225
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:11,222
       garlic, sour cream,      
        salt and pepper.        

226
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:15,827
  Chimichurri, pickled onions,  
          wild arugula.         

227
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:19,497
      Gaucho steak sandwich     
           coming out.          

228
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,766
Tastes like a Argentinean       
     steak sandwich.            

229
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,101
                There you go.   

230
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,438
I'm not a fillet fan            
because it has no flavor.       
              Sure.             

231
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:27,705
 But if you're going            
to give a chimichurri           

232
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,441
with it and arugula...          
              Yeah.             

233
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,375
...in a nice crusty bread,      
      then I'm a fan.           

234
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:34,579
This is how you should          
    serve a fillet.             

235
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,047
   Great sandwich.              

236
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,916
              Man:              
     Very tender and spicy,     

237
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,918
      which is what I like      
   in sandwiches, especially.   

238
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:43,054
   The chimichurri sauce, it's  
  sort of like a Latin flavor,  

239
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,456
    so it really complements    
         the whole dish.        

240
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:46,591
I'm really glad you're          
      still here                

241
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,859
because you were one            
of the founding fathers.        

242
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,662
You're one of the O.G.s         
    of "Triple D."              

243
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:51,929
                   I know.      

244
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,866
You come, and you light up      
the diner world in San Diego    

245
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,935
where no one would expect       
    to find a diner.            

246
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,336
You offer a service.            

247
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:01,606
You offer a great environment,  
and people will come back to it.

248
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,208
   See, that's why              
 you're still here.             

249
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,143
 We're lucky to have            
   guys like you.               
                      Thank you.

250
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,678
    I'll see you                
  before 12 years.              
               I hope so.       

251
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,747
I'm going to see you next week  
 is when I'm going to see you.  

252
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,082
  I'm coming back.              

253
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,951
           Stu has got          
   a pretty sweet setup there   

254
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,686
           helping out          
      the country's finest      

255
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:17,222
      and serving real-deal     
         diner classics.        

256
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,891
  Now, to me, that's a win-win. 

257
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,825
        Now, coming up...       

258
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,627
    Oh, you think               
  it's popular now.             

259
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,564
    ...another winning combo    
  when a French-trained chef... 

260
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:26,831
     Lamb ribs.                 
                      Yeah.     

261
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,166
             ...hits            
      the barbecue circuit.     

262
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:32,270
        You're doing some crazy,
             crazy barbecue.    

263
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:39,110
      Back in 2010, I drove     
      all over Kansas City      

264
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,113
      searching for some of     
 the best barbecue I could find.

265
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,983
I'm going to take you to some of
 the places you'd drive right by

266
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:47,852
       if you didn't have       
  the "Triple D" inside track.  

267
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,921
 And one place south of the city
       in Mission, Kansas,      

268
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,523
    checked all those boxes.    

269
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,792
                 Burnt ends.    

270
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:56,060
    They got killer barbecue,   
      off the beaten path,      

271
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,529
           and a chef           
      doing things his way.     

272
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:03,067
       We got to check out      
       R.J.'s Bob-Be-Que.       

273
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,869
Denver lamb ribs up.            

274
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,805
     "Triple D" coming here     
 confirmed what I already knew, 

275
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:10,875
      that this is the best     
 barbecue joint in Kansas City. 

276
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,611
   I love the atmosphere here.  
     The food is wonderful.     

277
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:17,282
    They offer a wide variety   
     of items on their menu.    

278
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,084
   I've been coming here five,  
        six times a week        

279
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,620
       and have something       
      different every time.     

280
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,087
      It's just fantastic.      

281

 GUY: That's all thanks to owner
     and French-trained chef

    Bob Palmgren, who decided   
   to make his barbecue hobby   

283
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:33,230
         a full-time gig        
          back in 2003.         

284
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,766
             So, you do 25 years
        of high-end restaurants.
  Uh-huh.                       

285
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,902
 When did you have this epiphany
          to just say,          

286
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,637
  "That's it. I'm going to go do
         my own barbecue joint"?

287
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:40,905
I mean, I've don't it           
    all already.

   a little bored,              

289
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,975

   Lamb ribs?                   

295

I don't know that I see lamb    
ribs on many barbecue menus.

        in the world do.

                    Oh, yeah.   

308
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,747
       It really does have      
   like 35 ingredients in it.   

309
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,017
           We let these set

        in for how long?

        After "Triple D,"       
          it was crazy.         

546
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,428
    This is like                
  a food hurricane.             

547
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,231
    We had a line all the way   
        down the street.        

548
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,632
         It was amazing.        

549
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,301
     Hopefully, it'll go on     
        for decades more.       

550
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:05,502
        It's remarkable.        

551
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,571
      It's probably one of      
       the neatest places       

552
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:09,173
         that we've shot        
 on "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

 Everyone sure does miss Frank.

00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:19,249
He'll always be an unforgettable

         That was crazy.

       that's just the tip      
         of the iceberg.

We got plenty more places to hit
 next time on "Triple D Nation."
