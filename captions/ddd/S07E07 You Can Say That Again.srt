    THIS IS REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

11
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,824

   RIGHT HERE.                  

28
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:11,069

     AND I'D SAY, "TAP TAP,     

29
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,205
   "WHAT IS IT,                 
   MAYBE A TAPAS RESTAURANT?"   

30
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:16,007
    TAP TAP,                    
    NO, A DINNER DANCE JOINT.   

31
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:19,077
    TAP TAP, MAYBE IT'S BEERS   
    FROM AROUND THE WORLD.      

32
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,281

 IT'S THE ROCKIN' HAITIAN FOOD.

GRILLED CONCH.

 WHEN I HAVE IT HERE,           
 IT ALWAYS REMINDS ME OF HAITI. 

36
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:32,024
I HAVE NEVER HAD HAITIAN FOOD.  

37
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:33,826
       YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL 
       TO HAITI TO GET IT.      

38
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:35,894

GRILLED GOAT.                   
    IT'S REALLY WONDERFUL.      

42
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:45,037
WHAT INSPIRED YOU

    (Guy)                       
    THAT OWNER KATHERINE KEAN   
    FELL IN LOVE WITH           

45
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:51,844
      WHEN SHE LIVED THERE      
      AS A FILMMAKER.           

46
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,246
      SO 15 YEARS AGO,          
      SHE OPENED THIS JOINT     

47
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:57,249
    AND HIRED HAITIAN-RAISED    
    GARY SANON-JULES.           

48
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,318
   HE USED TO WORK AS A BUSBOY. 

49
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,187
(Guy)                           
NOW HE'S RUNNIN' THE PLACE      
AND SERVIN' UP HAITIAN CLASSICS.

50
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,656
            I'VE NEVER HAD      
            ANYTHING LIKE THIS. 

51
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,725
WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE           
HAITIAN FOOD?                   

52
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,393
                    IT'S GRIOT. 
GRIOT.                          

53
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,662
                     IT'S PORK. 
DELICIOUS, IT'S AMAZING.        

54
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:12,598
SO WE GOT A PORK SHOULDER,      
BONE OUT...                     

55
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
        NOT ONLY JUST ANY PORK, 
        JUST THIS KUROBUTA.     

56
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:16,602
THE KOBE OF PIG,                
THAT'S PRIME PIG.               

57
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,803
        THIS IS THE REAL STUFF. 

58
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:22,540
        TRIM THE FAT OFF OF IT, 
        CUT IT INTO CHUNKS.     

59
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:26,011
OKAY, CAN I GET A MILK CRATE,   
THIS IS JUST NOT GONNA WORK.    

60
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,946
I ALREADY GOT A SORE NECK.      

61
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,948
  THROW SOME HOT WATER IN HERE. 

62
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,018
IS THIS DONE WITH ALL MEAT?     
              SLIGHT VARIATIONS 
 BUT PRETTY MUCH WITH ALL MEAT. 

63
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,221
 SOUR ORANGE PULP               
 AND ALSO THE SKINS.            

64
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,157
A LOT OF SOUR ORANGE            
USED IN HAITIAN FOOD.           

65
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:40,159
          SOUR ORANGES IS LIKE  
          ALMOST IN EVERYTHING. 

66
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,293
                   SALT ACTION. 
AND SOME VINEGAR,               
WE ARE PREPARING THIS.          

67
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,229
WE'RE PREPARING IT.             

68
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:46,498
NOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO         
IS WE'RE GONNA BEGIN            
MARINATING THE MEAT.            

69
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,568
WHAT'S IN THE MARINADE?         
              SHALLOTS, GARLIC, 
          SCOTCH BONNET PEPPER, 

70
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,771
   FRESH PARSLEY, SALT,         
   SOUR ORANGE JUICE, OLIVE OIL.

71
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,774
THE GRIOT MARINADE              
FOR THE KUROBUTA PORK.          

72
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,709
SO ALL OF THOSE INGREDIENTS     
GO IN.                          

73
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,378
HOW LONG WILL IT MARINATE?      
                      OVERNIGHT 
     FOR THE FLAVOR TO SEEP IN. 

74
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:03,448
      WE'RE GONNA COOK IT       
      IN A STOCK POT, AND WE'LL 
      TOP IT WITH SOME OIL.     

75
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,383
            WE'RE GONNA COOK IT 
            FOR TWO HOURS.      

76
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,252
AND THEN THIS IS WHAT WE GET,   
BUT IT'S COOLED DOWN.           

77
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,187
THEY REALLY DO                  
ALL THIS COOKING?               
             WE REALLY DO THIS, 
        I MEAN, THIS IS AN ART. 

78
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,189
THIS IS MORE STEPS              
THAN A FRENCH SAUCE.            

79
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:13,325
    FOR THE LONGEST TIME,       
    THIS WAS PASSED DOWN TO US. 

80
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,994
THE PORK GOES DOWN?             
            THIS IS THE BAPTISM 
                   OF THE PORK. 

81
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,930
INTO HOT OIL?                   
            IT COMES OUT GRIOT. 

82
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,667
NOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE SAUCE. 

83
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,602
             OIL, A LOT OF OIL. 

84
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,604
THROW SOME GARLIC, ONIONS,      
LET 'EM COOK DOWN.              

85
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,406
ADD SOME CREOLE SAUCE,          
TOMATO-BASED SAUCE.             

86
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,973
IT'S GOT HERBS AND SPICES.      

87
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,343
  CREOLE IN THIS INSTANCE       
  DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN HOT. 

88
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:33,145
            READY FOR THE PORK? 
YEP.                            

89
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,146
HAITIAN CARNITAS.               

90
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,015
          OKAY, SO YOU LET THIS 
           REDUCE A LITTLE BIT? 
THAT'S CORRECT.                 

91
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,950
AND THEN WE HIT IT              
WITH A LITTLE SALT.             
      TASTES PRETTY GOOD TO ME. 

92
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,952
SO WHAT DO WE PLATE IT UP WITH? 
A LITTLE RICE AND BEANS,        
ADD THE GRIOT IN.               

93
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:42,754
THE SAUCE GOES ON TOP           
OF THE TWO.                     

94
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,823
THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE,          
MMM, THAT'S GOOD.               

95
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,693
FANTASTIC DISH, BROUGHT THE     
FLAVOR ALL THE WAY THROUGH.     

96
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,162
CRUNCH OF THE PORK              
ON THE OUTSIDE.                 

97
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:52,097
SUPER JUICY, MORE STEPS         
THAN MOST PEOPLE WANNA TAKE,    

98
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,634
EXTREMELY WORTH THE EFFORT,     
YEAH, IT'S GREAT.               

99
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,836
MMM, YOU WOULD LOVE THIS,       

100
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,771
DON'T ANYBODY TOUCH THAT,       
I WANT THAT TO GO.              

101
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,907
          EVERY BITE JUST MELTS 
                 IN YOUR MOUTH. 
BY FAR THE BEST ON THE BEACH.   

102
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,843
                   BON APPETIT! 

103
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,711
     EVERYTHING ON THE MENU,    
     VERY GOOD FOOD.            

104
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,647
     REALLY AUTHENTIC STUFF,    
     IT'S REALLY DIFFERENT.     

105
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,582
 (Guy)                          
 LIKE ACCRA, A FRITTER MADE     
 WITH A CARIBBEAN ROOT VEGETABLE

106
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,584
         CALLED MALANGA.        

107
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,320
      TASTES KINDA LIKE A CROSS 
      BETWEEN A HUSHPUPPY       
      AND A FRIED SQUASH.       

108
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:17,189
  IT'S PREPARED WITH THE SAUCE  
  ON THE SIDE.                  

109
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:19,190
    NOTHING LIKE I'VE TASTED    
    ANY PLACE ELSE.             

110
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:22,126
  (Guy)                         
  BUT GET THIS! YOU WON'T FIND  
  THIS SAUCE IN HAITI.          

111
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:25,197
OUR WATERCRESS PUREE,           
THAT'S SORT OF OUR              
NOUVEAU TAP TAP.                

112
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,065
       THIS IS KIND OF TAP TAP. 

113
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,069
  WHAT DO WE DO WITH WATERCRESS 
  IN THE 21st CENTURY?          

114
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,940
     THERE YOU GO, TRY IT WITH  
     A LITTLE BIT OF THE ACCRA. 

115
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,475
I'VE HAD SIDE SAUCES            
EVERY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM.      

116
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,012
THAT'S GOTTA BE                 
UP IN THE TOP FIVE EVER.        

117
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:43,014
 WHEN I GO BACK TO HAITI,       
 I'M LIKE, "WHERE IS THE SAUCE?"

118
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,618
  (Guy)                         
  BUT IT'S ABOUT THE ONLY THING 
  HERE YOU CAN'T GET IN HAITI.  

119
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,553
  IT'S A KIND OF A NOSTALGIC    
  TRIP FOR ME WHEN I COME HERE. 

120
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,622
YOU GUYS KEEP ENJOYING          
THE MEAL.                       

121
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,557
    ALL OF THE RECIPES          
    FROM THE DIFFERENT PARTS    

122
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,426
       OF THE COUNTRY           
       ARE REFLECTED HERE.      

123
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,427
         (Guy)                  
         LIKE THIS ONE.         

124
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,997
 (Guy)                          
 A CENTRAL HAITIAN FISH CLASSIC 
 SERVED POACHED, GRILLED,       
 OR FRIED.                      

125
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,032
    THE YELLOWTAIL, THE WAY     
    THAT THEY'VE PREPARED IT,   

126
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:02,901
          SO FLAVORFUL.         

127
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,103
   SO WE HAVE A BASE MARINADE,  
   OLIVE OIL, VINEGAR,          

128
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,706
      BOUILLON BASE, MUSTARD,   
      SHALLOTS, GARLIC, ONIONS. 

129
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,574
START ADDING IN THE RED PEPPER. 

130
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,977
         SCOTCH BONNET PEPPERS, 
         SCALLIONS, PARSLEY,    

131
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,779
       AND FRESH GROUND PEPPER. 

132
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,780
THEN YOU FORTIFY IT             
FOR OTHER PROTEINS?             

133
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,050
           FOR FISH, LIME JUICE 
           AND SALT.            

134
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,585
OUR SNAPPER HAS BEEN CLEANED    
AND MARINATED.                  

135
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,788
NOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE BROTH  
THAT WE'RE COOKIN' IT IN.       
                THAT'S CORRECT. 

136
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,724
    SO WE START WITH THE CELERY.

137
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,859
   RED PEPPER IN THERE,         
   SOME SCALLIONS, SOME ONIONS, 

138
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:31,530
          SCOTCH BONNET PEPPER, 
          WE'LL THROW A BLOCK   
          OF BUTTER IN THERE.   

139
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,532
A BLOCK?                        
                 A BLOCK, BABY, 
     FRESH SQUEEZED LIME JUICE. 

140
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,467
     A LITTLE OLIVE OIL.        

141
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,737
     PUT A LITTLE SALT IN THERE,
     IT'S GONNA COME TO A BOIL. 

142
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,805
                      WE HAVE A 
       YELLOWTAIL SNAPPER HERE. 
BOIL POACH.                     

143
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,807
SO THAT'S GONNA BE IN THERE     
FOR EIGHT TO TEN MINUTES.       

144
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,742
NOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE            
THE SCOTCH BONNET LIME SAUCE.   

145
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,078
   OKAY, THAT DOESN'T SCARE ME, 
   SCOTCH BONNET.               

146
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,947
SOME OIL, GARLIC, SOME ONIONS,  
RED BELL PEPPERS,               

147
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,817
SQUEEZE SOME LIME IN THERE      
AND BUTTER.                     

148
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,752
NOW WE'LL TAKE SOME WATER       
FROM THE STOCK.                 

149
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,754
           OH, YOU ARE GRABBING 
           A SCOTCH BONNET,     
           I'M GETTIN' NERVOUS. 

150
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,688
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET HEAT       
FROM IT,                        

151
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,558
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T PUNCTURE      
THE SCOTCH BONNET PEPPER.       

152
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,626
YOU DO GET A LITTLE BIT         
OF THE FLAVOR,                  

153
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,495
BUT NONE OF THE HEAT            
UNTIL YOU OPEN IT UP            
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,        

154
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:05,430
BUT WE LEAVE THAT               
UP TO THE CUSTOMER.             

155
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:07,298
A LITTLE BIT OF SALT.           
                   FISH IS DONE 
          IN THE HOT TUB SAUNA. 

156
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,768
   NOW WE'RE GONNA TAKE         
   OUR SCOTCH BONNET LIME SAUCE 

157
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,903
            AND THEN WE'LL JUST 
          TOP THE FISH WITH IT. 
BEAUTIFUL.                      

158
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,106
REALLY, YOU'VE GOT A LOT        
OF COLORS TO IT.                

159
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,040
THE LIME, JUST GO AHEAD         
AND SQUEEZE IT RIGHT ON.        

160
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,043
WHERE DO YOU LIKE               
TO START EATING AT?             

161
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,845
I LIKE THE KNEE.                
              I LIKE THE ELBOW. 

162
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,846
              SUBMERGE IT       
              IN A LITTLE SAUCE.

163
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,182
              MMM, AH MAN, WOW! 

164
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:27,452
   I CREDIT YOU                 
   FOR IT HAVING MASSIVE FLAVOR.

165
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,387
THE FISH IS UNBELIEVABLY TENDER.

166
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,389
             THE SAUCE THAT GOES
             ALONG WITH IT,     

167
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:34,058
IT ALMOST HAS A FRENCH          
INFLUENCE TO IT.                
                OH, ABSOLUTELY. 

168
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:36,928
        MMM, I WANNA EAT IT ALL,
        LISTEN TO ME RIGHT NOW. 

169
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,930
            YOU HAVE GOT TO COME
            TRY THIS FISH,      

170
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,732
    EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE FISH.

171
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:45,136
         IT IS SO LEGIT,        
         IT'S TOO LEGIT TO FISH.

172
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:48,139
  TO DIE FOR,                   
  THIS IS REALLY, REALLY GOOD.  

173
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:50,609
      "TAP TAP" IS AN ICON.     

174
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,411
    IT'S FANTASTIC, ORIGINAL,   
    IT'S BEAUTIFUL.             

175
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,479
I'M MOVIN' IN, EARLIER I WAS    
JUST GONNA COME AND STAY        
FOR AWHILE.                     

176
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:57,082
NOW I'M MOVIN' IN.              
        OH, BEAUTIFUL, WELCOME. 

177
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,150
    CAN I PUT MY STUFF UP THERE?

178
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:01,219
   (Guy)                        
   UP NEXT,                     
   WE'RE HEADIN' TO HOUSTON...  

179
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,154
      ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS      
      THIS IS GREAT.            

180
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:05,156
     (Guy)                      
     FOR A TASTE OF GREECE.     

181
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:07,025
  DEAD ON, THE FOOD'S AWESOME.  

182
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,860
    LAMB SHANK WITH POTATO.     
MMM, THOSE ARE DELICIOUS.       

183
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,999
I'M HERE IN THE MONTROSE AREA   
OF HOUSTON, TEXAS,              

184
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,301
AT A JOINT THAT'S               
CENTRALLY LOCATED               

185
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,537
TO RICE UNIVERSITY,             
THE DOWNTOWN AREA,              

186
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,473
AND THE GALLERIA MALL.          

187
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,341
NOW THIS PLACE                  
IS SMOKIN' BUSY ALL THE TIME.   

188
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,144
THE QUESTION IS, IS IT BECAUSE  
OF THE LOCATION OR THE FOOD?    

189
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:30,148
WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT         
AS WE VISIT "NIKO NIKO'S."      

190
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,150
THE FOOD, IT'S FANTASTIC.       

191
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,485
IT IS JUST OUTSTANDING.         

192
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,688
IT'S THE CLOSEST THING YOU CAN  
COME TO EATING IN GREECE.       

193
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,623
ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.           

194
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,758
I ENJOY IT SO MUCH              
THAT I KEEP ON COMING BACK      

195
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,761
SINCE 1977 WHEN THEY            
FIRST OPENED THE DOORS.         

196
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,897
I ACTUALLY USED TO WALK UP      
AND ORDER HERE.                 

197
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,833
(Guy)                           
BACK WHEN                       
DIMITRI FETOKAKIS' PARENTS      
FIRST OPENED THE PLACE.         

198
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,768
I'VE BEEN WORKING IN HERE       
SINCE I WAS FIVE.               

199
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,971
THIS PART OF THE RESTAURANT     
WAS OUR HOUSE.                  

200
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,841
THIS WAS ACTUALLY               
WHERE YOU LIVED?                
            THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH. 

201
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,775
HAD A GYRO MACHINE              
AND A GRILL                     

202
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,711
AND THEN NIKO NIKO'S STARTED.   

203
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,713
    WE WERE DOING THE BASICS,   
    AND THEN WE KINDA WANTED    

204
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,648
       TO UPSCALE OUR MENU      
       A LITTLE BIT.            

205
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,584
     (Guy)                      
     USING THE                  
     WHOLE FAMILY COOKBOOK,     

206
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,519
      FROM GREEK MEATBALLS      
      TO THIS CLASSIC...        

207
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,455
  MOUSSAKA WHICH IS MY FAVORITE 

208
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,257
    (Guy)                       
    TO THIS FAMILY FAVORITE.    

209
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,325
   THE LAMB SHANK WITH POTATO.  

210
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,327
WHOSE LAMB SHANK RECIPE         
IS THIS?                        
                      MY POP'S. 

211
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:18,262
               SO FIRST WE TRIM 
               SOME OF THE FAT. 

212
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,198
BIG SELLER HERE?                
               VERY BIG SELLER. 

213
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:22,133
              NOW WE'RE GONNA DO
              OUR MARINADE.     

214
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,068
          SO WE GOT LEMON JUICE,
          GREEK OREGANO.        

215
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,070
       THIS IS FROM OUR ORCHARD 
                     IN GREECE. 
THIS IS BLOOMIN', MAN.          

216
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,005
BLACK PEPPER, SEASON ALL.       

217
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,007
A LITTLE SEASONED SALT,         
FRESH GARLIC.                   

218
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,410
FRESH GARLIC, SALT,             
AND OLIVE OIL, GREEK OLIVE OIL. 

219
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:35,347
SO THIS IS A PRETTY             
TRADITIONAL MARINADE.           
                        SIMPLE. 

220
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,348
AND HOW LONG                    
WILL WE MARINATE THOSE SHANKS?  

221
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,417
        WE USED TO MARINATE 'EM 
        24 HOURS.               

222
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,687
BUT WE GOT A MARINATING MACHINE 
TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS.        

223
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,623
SERIOUSLY?                      
                           YEAH.

224
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,491
OH, I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS.   
               YEAH, IT'S COOL. 

225
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,559
     THIS IS A TUMBLER, WHICH WE
     TOSS IN OUR LAMB SHANKS    

226
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,562
     AND JUST POUR OUR MARINADE.

227
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,631
         CAP IT OFF WITH A HOSE.

228
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,432
SO NOW IT'S GONNA START         
SUCKING THE AIR OUT.            
                         RIGHT. 

229
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:57,102
SO WHEN THE VACUUM GETS TO 20,  
YOU TURN IT OFF,                
LAY IT ON ITS SIDE.             

230
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,170
   AND THEN WE'LL LET IT DO ITS 
   WORK FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES.   

231
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:02,106
MAKES IT SO IT'S EASIER FOR     
THE MOISTURE TO PENETRATE IN.   
                        UH-HUH. 

232
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,375
I WANT ONE OF THESE FOR HOME.   

233
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,311
         THEN WE'LL JUST PUT IT 
         IN THE PAN.            

234
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,246
THE SHANKS ARE LINED UP,        
GET A LITTLE WATER ON TOP.      

235
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,248
IT'S TIME TO COVER 'EM          
AND GO IN THE OVEN.             

236
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,183
HOW LONG IS IT GONNA            
GO IN THE OVEN?                 

237
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,119
   TWO HOURS AND THEN           
   WHAT WE'LL DO IS UNCOVER IT, 

238
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,987
     FLIP THE LAMB SHANKS,      
     AND THEN FOR ANOTHER HOUR. 

239
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,922
LOOK AT THAT,                   
USUALLY TWO PEOPLE.             

240
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,158
I'LL GET THE DOORS.             
                     THANK YOU. 

241
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,594
   WOW, THOSE BAD BOYS          
   JUST COOKED DOWN ALL THE FAT.

242
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,129
IT'S CRAZY,                     
HOW MANY YOU GOT?               
                            TWO.

243
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,065
              AND WHAT'S THIS   
              BEING SERVED WITH?

244
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,067
           THAT COMES WITH      
           A SMALL GREEK SALAD, 

245
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,069
    THE ROASTED POTATOES,       
    PITA BREAD, TZATZIKI SAUCE, 
    AND LEMON.                  

246
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:34,072
MMM, THAT'S GREAT,              
THAT'S A REALLY NICE MARINADE   

247
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,007
WITH THE LEMON JUICE.           

248
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,477
PROBABLY ONE OF THE MORE        
LEMON FORWARD LAMB SHANKS       
I'VE EVER HAD.                  

249
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,346
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE               
TO TAKE THIS AWAY, GREAT.       

250
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,548
                     THANK YOU. 

251
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,685
I WASN'T SERIOUS.               
                             NO?

252
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,619
 IT'S GOT A GREAT FLAVOR ON IT. 

253
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,488
   GOOD ALL AROUND GREEK FOOD.  

254
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,824
     THERE'S ALWAYS A CROWD,    
     THERE'S ALWAYS A LINE.     

255
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:55,293
 NEXT IN LINE, PLEASE BE READY. 

256
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,228
          I CAN HEAR THIS PLACE 
          GOING A MILLION MILES 
          AN HOUR OUT THERE?    

257
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,230
        DOES IT EVER SLOW DOWN? 
I'M GLAD TO SAY NO.             

258
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,099
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.            

259
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:05,370
HOW MANY PITAS YOU GUYS         
GO THROUGH IN A WEEK?           
               TWELVE THOUSAND. 

260
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,705
AND THOSE BIG HUNKS             
OF GYRO?                        
                 FIFTEEN A DAY. 

261
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,975
OF THOSE?                       
                        UH-HUH. 

262
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,043
(Guy)                           
AND A DOZEN SCRATCH MADE        
DESSERTS FROM CLASSIC BAKLAVA...

263
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,845
   VERY FLAKY AND IT'S FRESH.   

264
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,047
     (Guy)                      
     TO SOMETHING MOST FOLKS    
     HAVE NEVER HEARD OF.       

265
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,182
                   LOUKOUMADES. 
LOUKOUMADES.                    

266
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,318
NOW THAT I CAN SAY IT,          
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT IT IS?     

267
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,454
             GREEK HONEY BALLS. 
GREEK HONEY BALLS.              

268
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:26,124
  GREEK HONEY BALLS, THAT'S IT, 
  THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW.  

269
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,659
  SO WE GOT OUR FLOUR, SUGAR... 
NOT VERY MUCH OF THAT.          

270
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,528
NOT MUCH, SALT, VANILLA.        

271
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:32,463
JUST A TOUCH, AND YEAST.        

272
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,799
      YEAST, WATER, 80 DEGREES. 

273
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,734
EIGHTY DEGREES TO MAKE          
THE CORRECT LOUKOUMADES.        

274
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,736
SO WE PUT IT                    
ON LOW SPEED FIRST.             
                 I'M OVER HERE. 

275
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,671
 IT LOOKS LIKE DOUGHNUT BATTER. 

276
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,540
WELL, WE GOTTA LET IT RISE      
FOR A WHILE, ABOUT 30 MINUTES.  

277
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,475
YOU GOTTA LET THAT YEAST        
ACTIVATE.                       

278
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,411
    A BUNCH OF SIMMERING WATER. 

279
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,412
WE'RE GONNA DO OUR SAUCE        
FOR THE LOUKOUMADES.            

280
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:51,750
WE CAN ALSO USE THIS            
FOR THE BAKLAVA AND THE KATAIFI,

281
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:55,820
AND THE OTHER PASTRIES          
THAT WE MAKE.                   

282
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,423
  YOU SURE THAT'S ENOUGH SUGAR? 
I DON'T KNOW, WE'LL SEE.        

283
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,758
THEN WE TAKE SOME LEMON JUICE   
AND CINNAMON STICK.             

284
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,693
LET THAT COOK FOR ABOUT         
1 1/2 HOURS.                    

285
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,562
AFTER THAT'S DONE,              
THEN WE'RE GONNA ADD OUR HONEY. 

286
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:06,564
      SO YOU LET IT REDUCE DOWN 
      A LITTLE BIT MORE         

287
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,833
        AND THEN RIGHT BEFORE   
        YOU'RE READY TO TAKE IT 
        OFF THE HEAT,           

288
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:11,368
  YOU'LL HIT IT WITH THE HONEY? 
WITH THE HONEY, THAT'S IT.      

289
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:14,506
HONEY, SUGAR, CINNAMON, LEMON,  
WATER, SYRUP, AND THAT'S IT.    

290
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,641
WE GOT OUR DOUGH TO RISE.       

291
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:19,177
NOW IT GOES INTO THIS BAD BOY,  
WHAT IS THIS?                   

292
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,512
              THIS IS A BELSHAW 
              DOUGHNUT MACHINE. 

293
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,715
YOU JUST CRANK IT AND IT JUST   
POPS OUT LITTLE DOUGHNUTS?      

294
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:26,717
       WE'LL COOK 'EM           
       FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES,  
       WE'LL SEPARATE 'EM HERE. 

295
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,787
LOOK AT THE WAY                 
THEY PUFFED UP SO QUICKLY.      

296
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:31,189
THIS LITTLE APPARATUS           
IS JUST TO MAKE LOUKOUMADES?    

297
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,926
I WANT THAT ON THE BACK         
OF THE '67.                     

298
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,861
      SO WE'RE DONE WITH THESE, 
      WE'RE GONNA TAKE 'EM      

299
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,797
      AND PUT 'EM IN THE HONEY. 
OH, THEY JUST GO RIGHT IN...    

300
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,200
                     THAT'S IT. 
DON'T MESS WITH 'EM?            

301
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,269
NO, NO ABSOLUTELY NOT,          
I WANT YOU TO MESS WITH 'EM.    

302
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:46,671
MESS WITH 'EM,                  
DON'T MESS WITH 'EM.            
                 MESS WITH 'EM. 

303
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,606
AND THESE AREN'T GONNA          
GET SOGGY?                      

304
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:50,475
THEY'RE STILL FLOATING.         

305
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,544
 NO, THAT'S FINE, WE WANT       
 ALL THE HONEY TO GET IN THERE. 

306
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,478
THOSE ARE CULINARY BUOYS        
IN THE SHIPYARD OF FLAVOR TOWN. 

307
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:58,149
   THEN TO TOP IT OFF, WE USE   
   POWDERED SUGAR AND CINNAMON. 

308
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:02,287
WOW, DUDE, WATCH THIS,          
IT JUST COMES RIGHT OUT.        

309
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:05,022
THESE ARE CRAZY.                

310
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,826
MMM, THEY FILL UP               
WITH THAT JUICE INSIDE.         

311
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,894
YOU BITE INTO THEM              
AND THEY ALMOST POP.            

312
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,430
                           GOOD?
GOOD, THOSE ARE NOT EVEN GOOD,  
THOSE ARE GREAT.                

313
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,232
I'VE NEVER SEEN THESE           
IN MY LIFE.                     

314
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,267
THIS ISN'T OVERLY SWEET,        
THE LEMON IS THE FIRST THING    
I RECOGNIZE.                    

315
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,170
                         YEAH.  

316
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:23,040
THOSE ARE YOURS.                

317
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,909
     YOU REALLY NEED TO COME    
     TO NIKO NIKO'S.            

318
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,178
 NO SURPRISES, IT'S ALWAYS JUST 
 DEAD-ON, THE FOOD'S AWESOME.   

319
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,115
      IT HAS A LOT OF HEART     
      AND PERSONALITY.          

320
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:34,052
  IT'S EXCELLENT,               
  THIS IS AS GOOD AS MY MOM'S.  

321
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,854
   IT'S ONE OF MY               
   FAVORITE PLACES OF ALL TIME. 

322
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,855
GOOD JOB, BROTHER.              
                    THANKS MAN. 

323

      THAT'S REALLY TASTY.      

326
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,131
     (Guy)                      
     WITH THE FAVORITES         
     THIS DUDE BROUGHT BACK

      FROM SOUTHEAST ASIA.      

328
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,269
   WE ALSO LIKE THE PORK BELLY  
   AND THE PRAWNS.              

329
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:54,706
     MMM, WOW, THAT'S CRAZY,    
     EXCELLENT DISH, THANK YOU. 

330
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,944
  I'M HERE IN PORTLAND, OREGON, 
  WHERE YOU CAN ALWAYS EXPECT   

331
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,947
     A LITTLE RAIN AND A LOT    
     OF GREAT FOOD.             

332
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,883
      I'M HERE TO CHECK OUT     
      THIS JOINT.               

333
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,751
      IT'S CALLED POK POK       
      WHERE THEY DON'T LET      

334
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,153
     A LITTLE RAIN KEEP THEM    
     FROM MAKING SOME           
     KILLER THAI FOOD.          

335
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,089
    I THINK WE'RE GONNA START   
    CALLIN' THE SHOW,           

336
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:14,092
       "DINERS, DRIVE-INS,      
       AND WALK-UPS."           

337
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,293
     I'VE NEVER HAD FOOD        
     LIKE THIS BEFORE,          
     BUT IT'S REALLY TASTY.     

338
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,829
     IT'S REALLY AUTHENTIC.     

339
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,697
     EVERYTHING ON THE MENU     
     HAS BEEN SOMETHING         

340
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,699
I'VE EITHER EATEN               
OR EATEN AND COOKED             

341
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,634
IN ANOTHER COUNTRY              
AND THEN BROUGHT IT BACK HERE.  

342
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,038
 (Guy)                          
 TO SERVE UP TO ANDY RICKER'S   
 GROWING CROWD OF PORTLAND FANS.

343
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,974
   WE OPENED AS JUST THIS SHACK 
   RIGHT HERE AND FROM THERE,   
   IT JUST GREW.                

344
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,910
 (Guy)                          
 INTO THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR       
 AND A BARBECUE PIT IN THE BACK.

345
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,845
        TO KEEP THAT FIRE HOT,  
        I'VE BEEN DOING MY BEST 

346
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,849
   TO GET PEOPLE TO TRY         
   SOMETHING NEW AND DIFFERENT. 

347
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:41,853
   (Guy)                        
   YEP, BOAR MEAT, MARINATED,   
   GRILLED, SERVED WITH         
   CHILE LIME GARLIC SAUCE.     

348
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,787
 THEY SAID IT WAS               
 THE SPICIEST THING ON THE MENU,

349
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,790
       AND IT'S DELICIOUS.      

350
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,259
WE'RE MAKING MUU PAA KHAM WAAN, 
WHICH IS BOAR COLLAR,           

351
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,328
THE NECK MEAT FROM THE BOAR.    
                  WHY THE NECK? 

352
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,197
      IT'S GOT A LOT OF FLAVOR, 
      AND THE THAI PEOPLE REALLY
      LIKE IT AS A CUT.         

353
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,999
      WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE PASTE
      THAT YOU RUB IT WITH.     

354
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,402
    THIS MORTAR AND PESTLE, THIS
    GRANITE COMES FROM THAILAND.

355
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:00,538
     WE'RE DOING CILANTRO ROOT, 
     GARLIC, LITTLE BIT OF SALT,

356
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,340
              SOME BLACK PEPPER.

357
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,742
  NOW WHY NOT A FOOD PROCESSOR? 
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS  
WHEN YOU POUND IT               

358
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:06,611
THAN IF YOU CUT IT.             

359
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:09,347
IT'S REALLY THE TRADITIONAL WAY 
OF DOING THINGS IN THAILAND.    

360
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,149
NOW WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE    
THIS PASTE                      

361
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,217
AND JUST KINDA WORK IT          
INTO THE MEAT.                  

362
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,086
THEN WE'RE JUST GONNA TAKE      
A LITTLE SEASONING SAUCE        

363
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,755
WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY            
SOY SAUCE.                      
                   BUT LIGHTER. 

364
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:19,757
   THEN WE'RE GONNA ADD A LITTLE
   BIT OF SUPER FINE SUGAR.     

365
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,692
            BREAKS DOWN QUICKLY 
            AND EVENLY.         

366
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,162
TYPICALLY, WE LET IT            
MARINATE FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS  
BEFORE WE GRILL IT.             

367
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:25,964
           NOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE 
           THE SAUCE.           

368
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,899
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA             
TAKE THE CHILES, GARLIC,        

369
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,834
DUMP 'EM IN THE ROBOT COUPE,    
KINDA SET UP A LITTLE BIT.      

370
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,969
SO IT'S NOT COMPLETELY          
BROKEN DOWN, BUT WE GOT THOSE   
FLAVORS COMBINING.              

371
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:34,105
THEN THE LIME JUICE.            

372
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,107
A LITTLE BIT OF ORANGE JUICE,   
FISH SAUCE, AND THE SUGAR.      

373
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,109
     THIS IS TO COUNTERBALANCE? 
IT BALANCES OUT                 
SOUR AND SALTY.                 

374
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,044
FINALLY, THE CILANTRO.          

375
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:44,048
SO THIS HAS ALL THE THAI        
HOT, SOUR, SALTY, SWEET.        
                       AWESOME. 

376
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,983
 NOW IT'S GONNA GO ON THE GRILL.

377
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,253
          REGULAR OLD CHARCOAL? 
NATURAL HARDWOOD CHARCOAL.      

378
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,988
 WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN IT         
 RAINS HEAVY OUT HERE, GET WET? 

379
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,324
WE JUST GET WET,                
IT'S OREGON, MAN.               

380
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,393
                HOW WE LOOKIN'? 
WE SHOULD BE AROUND MEDIUM,     
MEDIUM RARE THERE.              

381
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:57,328
PULL THAT OFF.                  

382
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,197
THEN WE'RE JUST GONNA           
SLICE IT UP,                    

383
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,232
PILE IT ON THE PLATE,           
AND WE'RE GONNA HIT IT          

384
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,200
WITH THE SAUCE,                 
A LITTLE BIT OF CILANTRO FOR IT.

385
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,136
THEN WE GOT THE ICED            
MUSTARD GREENS.                 

386
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,938
YOU TAKE A LITTLE STICKY RICE,  
AND THEN YOU CAN USE THAT       

387
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,674
TO PICK UP SOME OF THE MEAT     
AND THE SAUCE AND POP THAT      
IN YOUR MOUTH.                  

388
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,676
JUST TAKE A LITTLE NICE CRISPY  
YU CHOY TO EAT WITH IT.         

389
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,611
  THIS IS RIDICULOUSLY GOOD,    
  CRUNCHY, SPICY, SUGAR, SALTY. 

390
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,547
  NORTHERN THAI DRINKING FOOD.  

391
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,550
               LOOKS GOOD, HUH, 
               HUNGRY CAMERA?   

392
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:23,621
               NOPE, NOT TODAY. 

393
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,823
    IT'S REALLY, REALLY GOOD.   

394
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:29,626
      SALTY, SPICY, JUST RIGHT. 

395
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,696
SUPER AUTHENTIC, NOTHING THAT   
YOU WOULD JUST FIND ANYWHERE.   

396
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:37,502
    O.T., ORIGINAL THAILAND.    

397
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,437
   (Guy)                        
   RIGHT DOWN TO THE HARDWARE.  

398
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,439
  THIS IS A COCONUT MILK PRESS  
  THAT I BROUGHT BACK           
  FROM THAILAND.                

399
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,640
    WE'RE PUTTING IN            
    THE FRESH GRATED COCONUT,   
    MIXING WITH WARM WATER.     

400
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:46,444
  THERE'S A FILTER AND IT       
  PRESSES OUT THE COCONUT MILK. 

401
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:50,515
     (Guy)                      
     ALL FOR ONLY ONE DISH,     
     THE COCONUT CURRY SOUP.    

402
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:52,450
    TOTALLY AUTHENTIC,          
    THAT'S THE WAY WE HAD IT    

403
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:54,385
      IN THE NORTHERN PART      
      OF THAILAND.              

404
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,387
      WE ALSO LIKE              
      THE KUUNG OP WUN SEN,     

405
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,322
 THE PORK BELLY AND THE PRAWNS. 

406
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,191
HE'S GOING RIGHT                
FOR THE PORK BELLY.             

407
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,259
         WELL, I MEAN, COME ON, 
         THAT'S CRAZY.          

408
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:05,396
     THE FLAVORS ARE SO INTENSE 
                 BUT NOT SPICY. 
NOT ALL THAI FOOD IS SPICY.     

409
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,331
     EXCELLENT DISH, THANK YOU. 

410
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,267
THANK YOU.                      

411
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:12,202
      THE FOOD'S DEFINITELY     
      DELICIOUS.                

412
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,205
     IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT      
     TO GET IN HERE TONIGHT.    

413
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,142
     (Guy)                      
     OR YOU COULD JUST HEAD     
     TO THE TAKE-OUT WINDOW.    

414
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,144
   WE STARTED OUT WITH JUST     
   THIS MENU THAT'S RIGHT HERE. 

415
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,947
THAT WAS IT,                    
A HANDFUL OF ITEMS,             

416
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,216

             OR PAPAYA POK POK. 

418
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,887
    POK POK'S AN ONOMATOPOEIA   
    THIS NOISE RIGHT HERE.      

419
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:31,889

        A LITTLE BIT OF GARLIC,

             YOU LIKE IT SPICY? 
I'LL TAKE MINE SPICY.           

421
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,494

NICE BIG SCOOP OF PALM SUGAR.   

422
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,429
THEN WE'RE GONNA START          
POUNDIN' THAT DOWN.             

423
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,431

                THAT'S POK POK. 

424
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,433
        NEXT WILL BE FRESH LIMES
        WITH THE SKIN AND JUICE.

425
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,702
GARLIC, LIME,                   
AND CHILE MOJITO GOING.         
         THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT. 

426
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,238
      DRIED SHRIMP,             
      THEN I'M GONNA FOLLOW THAT
      WITH SOME LONG BEANS.     

427
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,842
         THEN SOME LIME JUICE,  
         UBIQUITOUS FISH SAUCE. 

428
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,711
         THIS IS TAMARIND WATER 
         THAT HAS A NICE SOUR,  
         FRUITY FLAVOR TO IT.   

429
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,646
         NOW THE GREEN PAPAYA.  

430
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,715
IT'S ALL GRATED FRESH           
EACH TIME?                      
                  GRATED FRESH. 

431
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,650
   WE'RE GONNA START POUNDING IT
   ALL TOGETHER HERE.           

432
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,652
   THE DRESSING GETS KINDA      
   PUSHED INTO THE GREEN PAPAYA,

433
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,588
         BUT THE GREEN PAPAYA   
         STAYS NICE AND CRUNCHY.

434
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,790
 NICE HANDFUL OF CHERRY TOMATOES
 AND ADD SOME PEANUTS.          

435
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,592
AND EACH TIME                   
THIS IS THE ROUTINE?            
       THIS IS THE WAY WE DO IT 
                    EVERY TIME. 

436
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,595
MAN, SOMEONE'S GONNA BE         
WORKIN' HARD IN THIS JOB.       

437
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,397
        THE NEXT THING WE'LL DO 
        IS PLATE IT UP.         

438
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,365
        THEN YOU GOTTA EAT THIS 
        WITH STICKY RICE.       

439
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:17,602
   MMM, WOW, YOU GET            
   ALL THE FLAVORS, THE CRUNCH, 
   THE PRESENTATION.            

440
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,671
EVERYBODY'S PLAYING NICE-NICE,  
THERE'S NO LEAD GUITAR IN THIS. 

441
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,407
     THIS EMBODIES THE IDEA     
     OF HOT, SOUR, SALTY, SWEET 
     MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.   

442
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,943

REALLY AWESOME.                 

443
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:29,347
IT'S A REALLY GREAT BLEND       
OF SPICY AND SOUR.              

444
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,549
IT'S REALLY TANGY.              

445
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:34,351
  THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE    
  DISHES, IT'S REAL EXQUISITE.  

446
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,487
       EVERYTHING IS SO         
       UNIQUELY DIFFERENT.      

447
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,622
 IT'S NOT JUST FROM ONE REGION. 

448
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,557
         OR ONE COUNTRY.        

449
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:43,294
  (Guy)                         
  THE BIGGEST HIT ON THIS MENU  
  IS VIETNAMESE.                

450
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,096
    VIETNAMESE CHICKEN WINGS.   

451
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,598
   MY FRIENDS AND I             
   LIKE TO CALL IT MEAT CANDY.  

452
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,567
      THIS IS THE WING COCKPIT. 

453
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,435
       THIS IS THE WING COCKPIT 
       AT POK POK.              

454
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,371
    WHEN WE GET BACK,           
    YOU GET TO SEE THESE WINGS. 

455
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,039
   I HEAR THEY'RE OFF THE HOOK! 

456
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,111
       AT POK POK IN            
       PORTLAND, OREGON...      

457
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,180
    ANDY RICKER'S COOKING UP    
    FAVORITES HE BROUGHT HOME

00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,115
  FROM HIS TRAVELS ACROSS ASIA. 

459
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:08,051
      UNIQUE FOOD               
      THAT'S REALLY TASTY.      

460
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,121
     ECLECTIC BLEND OF THAI,    
     VIETNAMESE,                
     AND THINGS LIKE THAT.      

461
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,123
       (Guy)                    
       LIKE NORTHERN THAI       
       CURRY NOODLE SOUP.       

462
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,925
  THE FLAVORS ARE JUST AMAZING. 

463
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,860
    (Guy)                       
    CHINESE WHOLE FRIED FISH.   

464
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,862
    IT SEALS ALL THE FLAVORS,   
    AND IT'S VERY TENDER.       

465
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:19,664
        (Guy)                   
        AND CHICKEN WINGS       
        FROM VIETNAM.           

466
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,999
    THESE WINGS ARE AMAZING,    
    SPICY IS THE WAY            
    I LIVE MY LIFE.             

467
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,934
            IT AIN'T A THING    
            BUT A CHICKEN WING. 

468
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,803
THAT'S RIGHT, WE'VE GOT         
SOME CHOPPED GARLIC,            

469
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,872
   SOME SALT,                   
   KINDA MASSAGE THAT TOGETHER  

470
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:29,674
AND PULL THE LIQUID             
OUT OF THE GARLIC.              

471
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,675
ADD SOME WATER TO IT.           

472
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,544
WE'RE GONNA USE CHEESECLOTH,    
POUR THAT IN THERE              
AND SQUEEZE IT.                 

473
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,880
THAT'LL FLAVOR THE WINGS        
WITHOUT PUTTING GARLIC          
ON THE WINGS.                   

474
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:38,149
          BECAUSE IT'LL BURN... 
IT'LL BURN WHEN YOU FRY IT.     

475
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,617
TO THIS WE'RE GONNA ADD SUGAR...
                    SUPER FINE. 

476
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,553
                 AND FISH SAUCE.

477
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,421
       THEN WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD
       AND MIX THAT ALL.        

478
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:46,357
           THEN WE'RE JUST GONNA
           THROW THAT MARINADE  
           ON THE CHICKEN WINGS,

479
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,292
     GIVE IT A DARN GOOD MIXING.

480
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,294
            YOU GOT NOT JUST    
            A MARINATION GOING, 

481
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,096
YOU GOT A LITTLE OSMOSIS GOING. 
WE GOT A BRINE GOING.           

482
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,097
  HOW LONG WILL THESE MARINATE? 
OVERNIGHT.                      

483
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,966
          THEN WE DEEP FRY 'EM? 
YEAH, AND THEN WE'RE GONNA      
TOSS 'EM IN THE WING CARAMEL    

484
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,902
WHICH IS FISH SAUCE             
AND GOOD CLEAN OREGON           
TAP WATER                       

485
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:59,837
AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF SUGAR,     
REAL SIMPLE.                    

486
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,906
   ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ALL MIXED. 

487
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,774
       NOW, WINGS, DRAINED 'EM, 
       DRIED 'EM.               

488
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,110
NOW WE'RE GONNA MIX             
THE WING DUST WE CALL IT.       

489
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,045
PLAIN OLD THAI                  
JASMINE RICE FLOUR.             

490
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:11,248
THE RICE FLOUR IS SO SUPER FINE 
THAT IT DOESN'T CLUMP UP ON IT. 

491
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,350
THAT'S RIGHT, AND THEN          
WE GOT TEMPURA MIX.             

492
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:15,186
WE'RE GONNA GET SOME WINGS      
IN THERE AND MIX THAT           
ALL TOGETHER.                   

493
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,187
      THIS IS FUNNY,            
      BECAUSE I'M NOT TYPICALLY 

494
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:19,123
     A FAN OF THE DREDGED WING, 
     BUT SINCE IT'S SUCH        

495
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:21,592
     A FINE FLOUR, I'LL TRY IT. 

496
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,527
THEN WE'RE GONNA DROP IT        
RIGHT IN THE DEEP FRYER.        

497
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,997
      WE'RE GONNA START HEATING 
      THAT CARAMEL BASE.        

498
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,965
        WHEN IT STARTS BUBBLING 
        WHEN IT'S SPICY...      

499
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,867
YEAH, THROW A LITTLE HEAT       
ON IT.

00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,606
PULL THOSE WINGS OUT            
AND YOU TOSS IT RIGHT IN THERE. 

503

           A LITTLE TRICK HERE.

       PULLS THE STUFF          
       OFF THE SIDE OF THE PAN. 

508

AH, THAT'S LEGIT, DUDE!         

531
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,938
    WOW, WAS THAT A ROAD TRIP   
    OR WHAT?
