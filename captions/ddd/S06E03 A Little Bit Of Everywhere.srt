CORRECT.                        

99
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:47,558
                            MMM.
TAKE 'EM OFF.                   

100
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:49,560
              HOLY FLAT, BATMAN.
RIGHT.                          

101
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:52,230
                       OW, WHOA.
IT'S HOT. I'M SORRY.            

102
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,299
                     NO PLATES? 

103
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,301
         WHAT, YOU JUST GIVE IT 
         PEOPLE OUT THE WINDOW? 

104
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,870

YEAH.                           

105
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,575
             MMM. OH, A NAPKIN, 
                 THANK YOU.     

106
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,577
               THAT'S DYNAMITE. 

107
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,580
    MOZZARELLA HAS A GOOD AMOUNT
           OF SALT TO IT.       
YEAH.                           

108
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,582
       SO I THINK THAT FORTIFIES
          WITH A LITTLE SALT.   

109
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:13,051
               THE CRUNCH       
         ON THE BREAD IS LIKE-- 

110
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,986
               CAN YOU HEAR IT? 

111
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:18,023
         THE ONLY THING THAT    
     I THINK THE SANDWICH MISSES

112
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,126
                    IS THE TANG 
                   OF THE SWISS.

113
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:23,795
WHY--                           
       THE PULLED PORK MAKES IT.

114
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,198
               THIS HAS GOTTA BE
                IN THE TOP FIVE.
THANK YOU.                      

115
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,666
                REALLY GOOD JOB.
THANKS.                         

116
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,067
     THE TASTE IS EXCELLENT.    

117
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,269
THE MEAT'S NICE AND SAVORY.     
   THE CHEESE IS CREAMY.        

118
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:34,138
    PICKLES AND EVERYTHING,     
         IT'S PERFECT.          
FOOD IS DEFINITELY              
    AN A-PLUS.                  

119
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,274
NO, STOP IT.                    

120
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,610
      IT'S VERY LAID BACK,      
       BEACH ATMOSPHERE,        
                  LIKE SOMEWHERE
                 IN PUERTO RICO.

121
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:42,681
    ENJOY A CIGAR, A LITTLE     
  GLASS OF WINE AND GOOD FOOD.  
OKAY, ROCK 'N' ROLL.            

122
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,683
      EVERY TIME I TRAVEL,      
     I'M THE TYPE OF PERSON     

123
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,718
           THAT EATS            
      RIGHT OFF THE CARTS.      
                          CHIPS.

124
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,887
      <i> AND NOW THEY ARE.</i>

        BEEF EMPANADAS.

        THE FISH TACOS.         

127

                   LOOK AT THAT.
       <i> THAT'S A PICTURE</i>        
         <i> RIGHT THERE.</i>

00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,432
       <i> AND THE NEWEST HIT</i>      
          <i> ON THE MENU,</i>

        <i> CHRISSY'S TAKE</i>         
 <i> ON A PUERTO RICAN FAVORITE.</i>   
                THIS IS PIONONO.

131
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,771
           OH, YO YO.           
I TRIED IT IN PUERTO RICO       
  OFF A STREET VENDOR.          

132
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,174
    <i> DOWN THERE, IT'S USUALLY</i>   
  <i> A FRIED, STUFFED PLANTAIN...</i> 

133
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:12,778
                        PIONONO.
    <i> BUT CHRISSY'S TURNED IT</i>    
  <i> INTO SOMETHING ALL HER OWN.</i>  

134
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,114
  IT'S KIND OF LIKE A LASAGNA,  
       SHEPHERD'S PIE...        
                        EXACTLY.

135
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,983
    SO HOW                      
DO WE START IT?                 
                DO A QUICK SAUTé
                ON THE VEG OIL--

136
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,120
          WHITE ONIONS,         
  MIXED BELL PEPPERS, TOMATOES. 

137
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:25,123
I LIKE THE WAY                  
THIS IS GOING.                  
                    A LITTLE BIT
                     OF GARLIC. 

138
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:28,593
SO BASICALLY WHAT WE'D CALL     
 THAT IS A LITTLE SOFRITO.      
                           YEAH.

139
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:31,329
                JUST GONNA COOK 
              THIS FOR A SECOND.

140
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:33,331
               THEN WE'RE GONNA 
                TAKE THE BEEF.  

141
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,266
   LET IT SIT THERE             
AND SIMMER DOWN, OKAY.          

142
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:38,002
            MM-HMM AND ADD SALT,
                 VINEGAR...     
   VINEGAR,                     
TOMATO PASTE.                   

143
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:41,272
                   TOMATO PASTE,
                      RAISINS.  
THERE'S A REASON                
  FOR RAISINS.                  

144
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,475
             GREEN OLIVES,      
      A LITTLE RED CHILI PEPPER,

145
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,477
             GIVE A LITTLE KICK.
WOW, PEPPER.                    

146
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:48,880
                   BLACK PEPPER.
       ACHIOTE PASTE--          
COMING FROM THE ANNATTO SEED.   

147
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,882
           MM-HMM, IT'S A REALLY
            NICE EARTHY FLAVOR. 

148
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:53,284
       ONCE THIS IS ALL COOKED, 
       WE LAYER IT IN A PAN WITH

149
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,286
 A MIXTURE OF YELLOW PLANTAINS, 
      ADD A LITTLE BUTTER,      

150
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:57,422
                  SQUISH 'EM UP 
                  A LITTLE BIT. 

151
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,424
                  AND A LITTLE  
                PASTEURIZED EGG.
JUST A LITTLE.                  

152
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,828
              HOLDS IT TOGETHER,
                   I DIG YA.    
MM-HMM. I'VE GOT, YOU KNOW,     
   1/4-INCH OF PLANTAIN         

153
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,963
 AND THEN DUMP                  
THE MEAT ON IT.                 
                      FANTASTIC.

154
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,165
 IT'S ALMOST LIKE               
BUILDING A LASAGNA.             

155
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,167
WE'RE GONNA SPRINKLE            
   THE TOP OF THIS              

156
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,035
WITH SOME GRATED                
PARMESAN CHEESE.                

157
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:14,239
   IT'S TWO BEEF LAYERS         
AND THREE PLANTAIN LAYERS.      

158
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,908
MORE EGG ON TOP, MAKE SURE      
   TO PULL IT TOGETHER.         

159
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,311
   POP IT IN THE OVEN FOR LIKE  
 35 MINUTES, ABOUT 300 DEGREES. 

160
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:23,648
           OH, I CAN'T WAIT     
       TO TRY THIS. WHOA, THAT--

161
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,650
WE GET NINE SERVINGS            
  OUT OF THIS PAN,              

162
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,919
 SO THEY'RE PRETTY              
DECENT-SIZED PIECES.            
                   YEAH, YOU DO.

163
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,655
                 WOW. YOU KNOW  
               HOW GOOD THAT IS?

164
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,325
              THAT BEEF MIXTURE 
              IS JUST ON POINT. 

165
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,327
   THE SWEETNESS OF THE PLANTAIN
          TIES RIGHT IN.        

166
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:38,597
            IT'S CREAMY, SALTY, 
          A LITTLE BIT OF SPICE.

167
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,333
     IT'S GOT ALL OF THE FLAVOR 
      COMPONENTS THAT YOU WANT. 

168
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:43,935

                OH, THAT'S GOOD.

169
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,736
                 IT'S DELICIOUS.
TERRIFIC, VERY SPICY.           

170
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:48,005

 SOMETHING UNIQUE.

 THEY'LL SERVE YOU A GREAT MEAL.

172
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,811
             EATING OUTSIDE'S   
         LIKE MY FAVORITE THING.
THE ATMOSPHERE

THEN STIR.                      
 THEN WE'RE GONNA PUT THE SHRIMP
ON TOP OF THE COLD LENTIL SALAD.

297
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:04,422

   VINAIGRETTE COATS IT NICELY. 

301
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,968

   FROM FLAVORS AND TEXTURES.   

302
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:20,171
        THE HERBES DE PROVENCE  
       TAKE A VERY FLORAL NOTE.
