1
00:00:00,801 --> 00:00:01,867
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:03,335
I'm Guy Fieri,
  and we're rolling out

3
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:06,705
looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:07,873
This trip...

5
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,842
Yeah!
 ...it's crazy characters...

6
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:11,343
I don't know
   to take him seriously.

7
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,845
...dishing out hot bowls...

8
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,847
<i> Hot</i> is hot!

9
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,081
...and cool soul.

10
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,816
Soul Rolls.

11
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,451
In Los Angeles, California...

12
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:20,953
Yee-haw!

13
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:22,588
...an extreme chili joint.

14
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,224
He does not miss a beat.

15
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:27,526
Suit me up for a wild ride.

16
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,328
Well, I'll tell you,
     partner.

17
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,896
In Charlotte,
  North Carolina...

18
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:32,431
Here we go.
   Let's get after this.

19
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,133
...a down-home
  Southern spot...

20
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:35,300
I'm a grit-eating fool.

21
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:37,569
...launching
 a full-flavor explosion.

22
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:40,472
This is a soul-food
    missile pop.

23
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:41,907
And in Las Vegas, Nevada...

24
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,776
Oh, brother.
 ...over-the-top crepes...

25
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:45,744
That's like
 liquid apple pie.

26
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:48,113
...put out
  by one surprising chef.

27
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:49,715
Crepe guy.
 You're kidding me.

28
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,451
That's all right here,
   right now,

29
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:54,820
on "Diners, Drive-ins,
   and Dives."

30
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,102
I'm here in Culver City,
   California,

31
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:11,904
right down the street
  from Sony Pictures,

32
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:13,806
and I know these parts
   pretty well.

33
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:15,808
I used to shoot
 "Guy's Big Bite" down here,

34
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,009
Kids,"

35
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:19,111
and I got to tell you,
 I wish I would have known

36
00:01:19,113 --> 00:01:20,746
about this joint
  I'm about to visit.

37
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:24,550
I hear they're serving up eight
 different types of chili a day.

38
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:25,851
That's my kind of joint.

39
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:28,353
This is Tub's Fine Chili
  & Fancy Fixin's.

40
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,626
Cowhand Casserole.

41
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:35,994
Tub's is
  a really unique spot.

42
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:38,230
Outlaw Taco Grande steak.

43
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:40,799
If you want to, like, get crazy
 with your chili, you come here.

44
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,401
Where you'll be in good hands

45
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:45,337
with the off-the-wall owner,
  known as Rancher Rick.

46
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:47,239
You got it, right here.
  Yee-haw.

47
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:48,574
Where'd you learn to cook?

48
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,342
I just like to eat,
so I learned to cook.

49
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,878
And in 2009,
 he and his wife, Margie,

50
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,013
or BossMama
  around these parts...

51
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:56,548
Chuck Wagon Grind,
  no beans.

52
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,984
...turned that hobby
 into a booming business.

53
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,886
Turkey Drive Chili
 in a bread tub.

54
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,488
It has so much flavor.

55
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,156
It's one of the best ones, baby,

56
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:05,457
'cause it's been here
   the longest.

57
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,926
Well, what we're gonna do is
make our Turkey Drive Chili.

58
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:09,862
Turkey Drive.
  So, we have ground turkey.

59
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:12,731
We're gonna mix it
with a little seasoning in here.

60
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,766
A little chicken base?
  Yes, sir.

61
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,503
And what we want to do
is get that all mixed in.

62
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:21,707
Onto a sheet tray?
  Sheet tray.

63
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:24,543
And then we're gonna score it
into little squares.

64
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,178
You have too much time
    on your hands.

65
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,379
This is fun.

66
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,815
Then it goes into the oven.
  Roast that off how long?

67
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,117
About 40 minutes, 350.
     Okay.

68
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:35,320
Take some olive oil
and a little onions.

69
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,423
He looks like he should run
  a chuck wagon, doesn't he?

70
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,325
Yep.
We're gonna add our garlic.

71
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:44,163
Next thing going in
is our roasted ground turkey.

72
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,898
Now can I dump some ingredients
     in for you?

73
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,000
Please do.
Apple cider vinegar.

74
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:50,669
Okay. And a tremendous amount
    of chili powder.

75
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,837
It is good stuff.

76
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,172
That's paprika.
     Okay.

77
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:55,941
All our chilies are tasty
without being spicy.

78
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:57,910
So if people want
  to spice it up, they can.

79
00:02:57,912 --> 00:02:59,678
Tub's-Nitro-Tonic --
  our T-N-T.

80
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,346
Tub's-Nitro-Tonic.

81
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,148
Next is Worcestershire.

82
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,383
Oregano.
 Mexican oregano.

83
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,251
Mexican oregano.
 Mexican oregano.

84
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:08,787
We got steak seasoning.
  Sounds like a rattlesnake.

85
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:09,988
Cajun seasoning.

86
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,190
<i> Cumino.</i>

87
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:13,192
Uh...
That's a Mexican beer.

88
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:15,727
That's a big
    Mexican beer.

89
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,629
Yellow mustard.
     Okay.

90
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:20,432
Get some tomato sauce
  in there.

91
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,934
Salsa fresca.

92
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:24,603
Yeah, it's
a Mexican tomato sauce.

93
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,171
Chicken stock.

94
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,806
That's a lot
    of chicken stock.

95
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,441
We let it simmer
 about half-hour,

96
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,276
then we add
these green bell peppers.

97
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,178
Okay.
  And this is our oatmeal.

98
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,747
That's our
 steel-cut oatmeal.

99
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,649
Next is...
  One of my favorite beans.

100
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:38,984
Now, how long
    is this gonna cook?

101
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:41,687
About 40 more minutes.

102
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:42,688
Now what's up?

103
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,289
We're gonna make you
 a bread tub.

104
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,426
Take our flatbread,
drop it down for 50 seconds,

105
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:49,962
and a bread tub comes out.
Hence the name Tub's.

106
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:53,165
So the whole thing of Tub's
   comes from this idea?

107
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:54,233
Pretty much.

108
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:56,335
All right. Chili.

109
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,370
Help yourself to some fixin's.

110
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,172
Okay.
   I'm a sour cream guy.

111
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:01,240
Good.

112
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:02,674
Little cheese.

113
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,643
I'm definitely
    a lot-of-onion guy.

114
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,011
And a little cilantro.

115
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,779
Oh, and I got to have
    some corn nuts.

116
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,147
I've never seen that.

117
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,952
That's good chili.

118
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:17,122
You can make it
   the way you want it.

119
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,991
I like the little
  corn-nut crunch in there.

120
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:20,759
I love the tub.
  Goes along with it great.

121
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,227
You have a personality
     about it.

122
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,563
I mean, it's worth coming down
  just to see the road show.

123
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,465
This is what makes
  coming to L.A. beautiful.

124
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,500
You can have funky, little
   joints just like this

125
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,402
doing rockin' business.

126
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,404
Dynamite.
    Dynamite chili.

127
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:33,905
Turkey Drive over bread tub.

128
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:36,808
The texture of it and the
 flavor, it's just delicious.

129
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,211
For those that need a fix
in the middle of the night,

130
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:41,313
we have frozen boil bags.

131
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,982
He does not miss a beat.

132
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,652
You always know it's gonna be
  fun coming in the door.

133
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,587
The number-one thing
 for chili --

134
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:49,988
go ahead and grab that.

135
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,361
Now you can make
 Tub's chili.

136
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,863
Well, I'll tell you,
     partner.

137
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,331
And next on the menu...

138
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,034
I'm gonna make you
a Double-Barrel Dingo Dog.

139
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,535
I don't know
   to take him seriously.

140
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:04,970
Is there such a thing?
  Oh, yeah.

141
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,339
Double-Barrel Dingo Dog
 fully loaded!

142
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:09,741
That right there says
  gym membership, doesn't it?

143
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,243
When we come back.

144
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:20,285
"Triple D" has rustled up
  some culinary gold

145
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:22,120
in Culver City, California...

146
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,489
Yee-haw!

147
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,023
...at Tub's Fine Chili

148
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,242
s n
  Yby Rancherk.

149
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,277
with your buffalo chips.

150
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,879
How would you explain this
  to people?

151
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:32,848
It's, like, the best.
  Chili any way you want it.

152
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,116
With a rep like that,

153
00:05:34,118 --> 00:05:36,451
you know they've got to have
  a killer chili dog.

154
00:05:36,453 --> 00:05:38,820
Double-Barrel Dingo Dog.
  Yee-haw.

155
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:40,455
It is amazing.

156
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:42,424
Rancher Rick,
   what are we up to now?

157
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:46,294
We're making the buns
for our Double-Barrel Dingo Dog.

158
00:05:46,296 --> 00:05:47,729
Double-Barrel Dingo Dog.

159
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:49,231
Right.
  So, we're making cornbread?

160
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:50,565
Cornbread.
     Got it.

161
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:53,235
Wet our bowl with some soda
water. Keeps it nice and light.

162
00:05:53,237 --> 00:05:55,470
Then we use
 some cornmeal,

163
00:05:55,472 --> 00:05:56,972
pancake mix.

164
00:05:56,974 --> 00:05:58,607
There's some leavening
     in that.

165
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,810
Sugar, salt,
little Cayenne pepper,

166
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:05,480
granulated garlic,
and a light canola oil.

167
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:06,548
How about I'll pour?

168
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,650
All right. Pour slow.
It's gonna bubble up.

169
00:06:10,854 --> 00:06:12,821
Man, it looks like the goo
    from "Double Dare."

170
00:06:12,823 --> 00:06:14,589
What, is Marc Summers
    gonna show up next?

171
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:17,125
You never know
 who shows up.

172
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:21,663
Only in L.A.

173
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:23,065
Was that Marc Summers?

174
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:24,399
Okay, now, this...

175
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:27,569
It's another little jig we make
for our cornbread buns.

176
00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:28,603
Here we go.

177
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:30,138
All right, so,
    drop that on there?

178
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,139
Yes, sir.

179
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,843
In the oven
for about 20 minutes.

180
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:36,478
That's it.
    Look at that.

181
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,879
You pull the jiggy off it.

182
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:39,815
Gettin' jiggy with it.
    I had to say it.

183
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,116
We're gonna freeze them off,

184
00:06:41,118 --> 00:06:43,151
and then we're gonna
flash-fry them 30 seconds,

185
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,820
and they're ready to roll.
     Word.

186
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:46,288
Okay, next, we make the dogs.

187
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,657
All-beef jumbo dog --
got to start with that.

188
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:49,825
Okay.

189
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:52,160
Give it a little spiral cut
 all the way down.

190
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,696
Throw that in the fryer
about 10, 15 seconds.

191
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:56,064
So it kind of expands.

192
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:57,866
Then it goes on
 the char broiler.

193
00:06:57,868 --> 00:07:01,203
All right.
 Cornbread bun,

194
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:03,338
spiral-cut dog.

195
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,140
I do like
   your spiral-cut idea.

196
00:07:05,142 --> 00:07:07,008
It's good.
 What chili are you giving me?

197
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,479
You're gonna have
my Chuck Wagon Grind.

198
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:13,748
Definitely got to
have cheese on there.

199
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,251
Tub's Mojave Mash Mustard.

200
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:17,486
When I think chili dog,

201
00:07:17,488 --> 00:07:19,221
this is what I think
   it should look like.

202
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:20,889
Few tomatoes on there.

203
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:22,424
Some onions
   and some green onions.

204
00:07:22,426 --> 00:07:23,458
Onions.

205
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,061
Little of that
 to calm it down.

206
00:07:26,063 --> 00:07:28,396
Chopped cil-an-tro.
     Cil-an-tro?

207
00:07:28,398 --> 00:07:29,931
So fresh it'll slap you.

208
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:31,733
You like a few jalapeños?
    I can do them.

209
00:07:31,735 --> 00:07:33,335
You got to have
 your corn-nut fix.

210
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:34,903
You didn't have enough
  last meal.

211
00:07:34,905 --> 00:07:36,905
That right there
  should be on a calendar.

212
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:39,875
I don't know a calendar of what,
 but it should be on a calendar.

213
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,310
Look at that.

214
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:44,479
Mmm.

215
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:45,947
The cornbread's outstanding.

216
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:47,983
It's sweet,
  got a nice little crunch.

217
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:50,452
The dog...

218
00:07:50,454 --> 00:07:51,786
little snap to it.

219
00:07:51,788 --> 00:07:53,555
The mustard's outrageous.

220
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,624
And then you're just attacked

221
00:07:55,626 --> 00:08:00,729
with this onslaught of chili
 and cheese and onions and...

222
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,531
cilantro and corn nuts
     and crunch.

223
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:04,232
Nicely done, my brother.
 Thank you, Guy.

224
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,067
Two Double-Barrel Dingo Dogs are
    up.

225
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,402
Just tastes so good.

226
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,037
With the chili
  and all the fixin's,

227
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,205
makes you feel warm inside.

228
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:12,641
Steak Town Chili
 over brown rice.

229
00:08:12,643 --> 00:08:16,178
Sitting here with two faces that
 you know really well from TV.

230
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,280
Hey, that really<i> was</i>
   Marc Summers

231
00:08:18,282 --> 00:08:19,915
from "Double Dare"
  and "Unwrapped."

232
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,883
And Dann Florek
  from "Law & Order."

233
00:08:21,885 --> 00:08:23,518
Chili with cucumbers in it?

234
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,321
The way I see it, this is
the closest he comes to a salad.

235
00:08:27,624 --> 00:08:29,991
If Christopher Walken
 was eating this chili, Dann,

236
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:31,293
what would he say?

237
00:08:31,295 --> 00:08:33,562
He would say, "You know,

238
00:08:33,564 --> 00:08:35,463
<i> hot</i> is hot,

239
00:08:35,465 --> 00:08:37,232
but this!

240
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:41,920
This is hot."

241
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,755
You're making it real-deal.

242
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,057
Crazy place.

243
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,626
Coming up,
  in Las Vegas, Nevada...

244
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:48,960
Wow.

245
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,496
...a funky spot rolling out
  the sweet and savory...

246
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:52,931
You will love this place.

247
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,633
...into some killer crepes.

248
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:57,302
You take on each crepe
like it's a five-course meal.

249
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,444
So, I'm here on the southeast
 side of Las Vegas, Nevada,

250
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,213
right on the border
  of Henderson, Nevada.

251
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,081
And I tell you,
 when I went to school here,

252
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,417
they didn't have any shopping
 centers like this out here.

253
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,452
No way. Look at this place.
  It's got everything.

254
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:16,521
It's got a cooking school,
  it's got a pet bakery,

255
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,356
and it's got a -- wait for it.
   Wait for it.

256
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,559
Exactly -- a crepe shop.
   A crepe shop?

257
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,093
This is Crepe Expectations.

258
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,929
Greek in the window.
    Get it out of here.

259
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,964
You will find nothing else
  like this place.

260
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,667
Table 21, bananas Foster.
     Blackjack.

261
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,101
The menu just blew me away.

262
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,670
Reuben, table 12.
     Sell that.

263
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:34,906
They have such a great variety
 of creative interpretations.

264
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,609
And then, of course,
   what you'd expect --

265
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,311
a crepe restaurant
    from ZZ Top. Yeah.

266
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:41,813
Doesn't everybody that looks
like me have a crepe shop?

267
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:46,318
The rock star fronting this gig
 since 2011 is Lou Remillard...

268
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,286
Two in one bowl, wife.
    Two in one bowl.

269
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,888
...along with his wife, Jenn.

270
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,124
We actually bought this
as an existing crepe restaurant,

271
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,327
revamped it, and made
everything from scratch.

272
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:56,928
I need another
    lemon curd, please.

273
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,063
Lemon curd, heard.

274
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,931
In your opinion,
   what makes great crepe?

275
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,068
Being not afraid to put anything
in the world inside of it.

276
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,469
We have the Sonora here. Enjoy.

277
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:05,870
It's like a Mexican dish
     in a crepe.

278
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,639
Homemade salsa,
  homemade guacamole.

279
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:09,741
You've never had carne asada

280
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,343
until you've eaten it
   out of a crepe.

281
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:12,410
Let's get into this, boss.

282
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,145
Dude, we're making
our crepe batter here.

283
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,480
Liquid chicken.
    Do you know --

284
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:16,681
Your favorite?

285
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,550
No, let<i> me</i> lick the bowl.
  Yeah? Yeah!

286
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:20,385
Water, whole milk.
     Salt.

287
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,220
Just get a little froth to it.
     Okay.

288
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,855
All-purpose flour.
 We're gonna drizzle

289
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,757
a little bit of whole
melted salted butter in.

290
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,792
I know that normal people
don't use salted butter.

291
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,194
Well, we know
    you're not normal.

292
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:30,829
All right,
  what are we gonna make now?

293
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:31,963
Teres Major.
     Okay.

294
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,264
Shoulder cut.
     Fantastic.

295
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,333
It gets very tender.
    Teres Major's down.

296
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,735
Fresh LJ.
    Lemon juice?

297
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:38,169
Lemon juice.
     Fantastic.

298
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:41,239
Fresh garlic, garlic powder,
kosher salt, onion powder.

299
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,174
This is actually
carne asada seasoning.

300
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,209
Gotcha, gotcha.

301
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:46,344
And then a whole orange and
  lemon.

302
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,380
Carne asada you'll cook down...
  15 minutes.

303
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:50,915
Salsa time.
Start off with a bold serrano.

304
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,617
Black pepper.
     Okay.

305
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:53,952
Touch of salt in here.

306
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,520
Fire-roasted plum tomatoes.
     Got it.

307
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,888
More salt.
     Okay.

308
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,490
Garlic powder, fresh cumin.

309
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,625
And cilantro.
  Cilantro.

310
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,927
Last thing --
toasted chile de arbol.

311
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,829
Got a chile de arbol tattoo
    right there.

312
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,864
I dig it.

313
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,068
All right.
Fresh onions, diced tomatoes.

314
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,204
I like a little texture
    inside of here.

315
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,806
Oh, I like the smoky in that.
  Dig it.

316
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:15,940
That's gonna be good.

317
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,275
We'll make the crepe.

318
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,743
Make the crepe.
     Crepe.

319
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,412
This is
the batter we made earlier.

320
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:21,446
Sets overnight.

321
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,248
Look at that.
 That is ridiculous.

322
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,417
You've only done that
 a billion times.

323
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,118
Oh, so, now you're making
 a quesadilla.

324
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,320
That's exactly right.
Just a little bit of guac, huh?

325
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,755
You can't have
    too much of that.

326
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,257
Carne asada we just made.

327
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,324
Nice portions.

328
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,460
And some of that
    fire-roasted salsa.

329
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:36,995
Salsa's the bomb.

330
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:38,296
One more on that side.

331
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,865
Into thirds.
    Onto the plate.

332
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:41,966
Here we go.

333
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:46,337
Oh.
  Right?

334
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,140
That carne asada and that salsa
    with the guac --

335
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,209
Is there a Mexican restaurant
    in this village

336
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,644
that you're running
    out of town?

337
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:54,179
'Cause that's
   what that tastes like.

338
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,313
Dig it.

339
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,816
The crepe -- fantastic.
    Nice and tender.

340
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:00,151
Little bit of cheese,
    lots of meat.

341
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,619
Dig it.

342
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:04,189
That citrus in the carne asada
    is fantastic.

343
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:05,757
Awesome fire-roasted salsa.

344
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,025
Mmm.

345
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,293
Well done, man.
 Thanks, brother.

346
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:09,894
Table 22, Sonora.

347
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,830
It's the best carne asada
   I've ever had.

348
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,698
It's real-deal.
    It's real-deal.

349
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,800
You watch them put it together
   from start to finish.

350
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:18,536
Which includes --
 you got it -- the crepe cam.

351
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:22,807
Having the camera and the lively
 atmosphere is really cool.

352
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:26,578
It is always fun, you know?
There is constant communication.

353
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,947
Empty crepe plates
  make no money. Let's roll.

354
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,116
They're entertaining us
  the entire time.

355
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:33,284
Meanwhile, they're pumping out
   all this food.

356
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,153
Table 16, William Tell.

357
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:38,089
It is like caramel apple pie
   in a crepe.

358
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,992
Just the right amount of sweet.
 Fresh, homemade whipped cream.

359
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,627
It is delicious.

360
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,429
So, we go from the savory
    to the sweet?

361
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,898
Savory to the sweet. Gonna start
with fresh-made caramel.

362
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,133
Okay.
 Granulated sugar.

363
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:51,236
We got to get this down
to a liquefied sugar.

364
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,504
Add a vanilla bean.

365
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:53,538
Got it.

366
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,273
And cubed butter.

367
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,743
Stir this in until the butter
is completely melted.

368
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,779
I like how that is
    so screaming hot.

369
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,047
Then a little bit
 of vanilla extract.

370
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,149
Okay.

371
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:06,384
And we're gonna drizzle in
 our heavy cream.

372
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,587
As this cools off,
 it will thicken up.

373
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,890
At the very end,
a touch of kosher salt.

374
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,992
We cool it overnight,
put it in a squeeze bottle,

375
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,193
and away we go.
     Nice.

376
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:17,328
Down with the apples now.

377
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,596
Fresh salted butter.

378
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:20,799
Whole, peeled, sliced
Granny Smith apples.

379
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:24,135
Little bit of sugar,
vanilla bean, ground cinnamon,

380
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,804
little bit of vanilla extract,

381
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:29,607
and some fresh lemon juice just
to brighten up those flavors.

382
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,776
So just let them get tender?
About halfway cooked.

383
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,411
Then you're gonna pull it
    and cool it?

384
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:34,712
Pull it and cool it.
     Got it.

385
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:38,116
Here we go -- crepe batter,
   along with the apples

386
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:40,285
that we just cooked down
     so lovely.

387
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:41,653
The homemade caramel sauce.

388
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,889
You're sitting at a ball game
 or a car show,

389
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:47,525
and you see this cat and you go,
"So, dude, what do you do?"

390
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,727
"Well, I got a crepe shop."

391
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:50,762
Yeah.

392
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:52,197
Okay.
     Whoo!

393
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,532
Little bit
  of homemade whipped cream.

394
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:55,867
Look at that.
     Voilà.

395
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:03,474
That's like
 liquid apple pie.

396
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:04,843
Mm-hmm.

397
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,011
Wow.

398
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,280
You cooked the apples
 so perfectly.

399
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,516
I mean, they are --
     Still got
   a little bite to them.

400
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,451
Oh, brother.
With a nice little bit of tang.

401
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,253
There we go.

402
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,956
My little guy, Ryder -- Ryder,
this is your joint, buddy.

403
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,591
You will love this place.

404
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:21,326
This is for you, buddy.

405
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:22,961
Okay, I have
   a William Tell.

406
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,462
It's better than apple pie.

407
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,331
The flavors of the apples
  are just so perfect.

408
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,333
It's crisp. It's spot-on.

409
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:29,467
Frisco, up.

410
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,336
This place is not
  easily forgettable.

411
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:32,837
On the fly. Get it out.

412
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:37,175
You take on each crepe
like it's a five-course meal.

413
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,477
Dig it.
 Dude, it's awesome.

414
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,212
Crepe guy.
 You're kidding me.

415
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,883
Up next, in North Carolina...

416
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,150
What are we
    into now, boss?

417
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:47,485
...real-deal
  country cooking...

418
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,053
You embrace
    each little step

419
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,321
like it's
  the most critical piece.

420
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,890
...right in the heart
  of downtown Charlotte.

421
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,458
You're gonna have to
  pry this out of my hand.

422
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,967
Now, I do not like
  to be too predictable

423
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,669
here on "Diners,
  Drive-Ins, & Dives,"

424
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,204
but when you go
  to San Francisco,

425
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:07,605
you got to try some cioppino.

426
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,874
When you go to Texas, well,
 you got to try some brisket.

427
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,776
Go to New York City,
  got to try some pizza.

428
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,012
So when you come
 to Charlotte, North Carolina,

429
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,915
you got to try some Low Country,
 and I hear this is the joint.

430
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,716
This is Mert's Heart and Soul.

431
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,421
It's definitely comfort food.

432
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,522
Two Creoles all day.

433
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:25,890
It's like eating at home,

434
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,759
or better than what
  I can get at home.

435
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,528
Just like my mama cooks.
 She just put her foot in it.

436
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,965
But Dad's the one
 doing the cooking here --

437
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,800
chef and owner James Bazzelle,

438
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:40,104
who's been bringing down-home
  to downtown since 1998.

439
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,407
It's like a treasure chest

440
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,142
in the middle
  of the asphalt jungle.

441
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:45,777
That's what's so special
   about it.

442
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,445
You wouldn't
  expect this downtown.

443
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,347
What kind of food
   do you guys serve here?

444
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,215
Low Country and Southern.
    And Southern.

445
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,851
I think it tastes like something
that my grandma would cook.

446
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,053
Soul Rolls up.

447
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:56,988
The Soul Rolls are
 everything you'd ever want

448
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,022
out of the South.

449
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:01,326
Goodness wrapped and deep-fried.

450
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:02,961
Soul Rolls.

451
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,330
Got to have a Soul Roll.
 All right, well, get into it.

452
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:08,466
Collard greens --
 cut them up.

453
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:13,471
Garlic, olive oil,
    onions, adobo.

454
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,872
Adobo?
     Adobo.

455
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:17,175
Vinegar and water.

456
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,010
And how long we gonna
 let this go for?

457
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,044
Hour.

458
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,713
All right, what are we
 into now, boss?

459
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:23,715
Well, we gonna
 fry the chicken.

460
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:26,384
I sprinkle our chicken
  with adobo.

461
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,519
And then just regular
    all-purpose flour?

462
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:29,854
All-purpose flour --
  simple.

463
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:30,888
Okay.

464
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,057
Let me put it
 in the fryer now.

465
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:34,559
Here we go.
   Let's get after this.

466
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,594
And what we do, we're gonna mix
 it all together.

467
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,629
So, we got the greens.
  We got the fried chicken.

468
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,665
This seasoned rice
 that's delicious.

469
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,501
Black-eyed peas.

470
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,037
Okay, what we're gonna do
is put a wrapper down,

471
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:49,941
take a little bit here,
 and we roll up,

472
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:52,844
and we top it with
a little egg wash to seal it.

473
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,913
We take these to the fryer,
    cook them off, 350.

474
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,649
Then we just take them,
 and we cut them.

475
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,588
Drizzle a little spicy
 honey-mustard.

476
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,990
Then we do a little bit
more garnish on them.

477
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,126
So, most folks
   can't make it to Mert's

478
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,394
without having a Soul Roll?

479
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:12,130
We try not to let them leave
without having a Soul Roll.

480
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,567
Mmm.
  That's astronaut soul food.

481
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,904
You know how they send
  the astronauts their food

482
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:21,939
all prepared and ready to go?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

483
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:23,741
This is a soul-food
    missile pop.

484
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,476
This comes with
    everything combined

485
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:26,978
in one easy-to-eat bite.

486
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,513
I got to tell Vanessa
  about that.

487
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:33,284
That's delicious.

488
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,253
You guys ready to eat?
    Yeah.

489
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,522
The Soul Roll's got
  everything I like.

490
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,891
It's phenomenal.
 It just pops when you eat it.

491
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,160
Where'd you learn to cook?
  Home Ec.

492
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:44,462
A friend of mine told me
I could take Home Ec,

493
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,130
meet girls, and eat.
  I did it.

494
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,532
I did the same thing.

495
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,333
No, I'm serious.
 I believe you.

496
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,868
And from the looks of it,

497
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,404
Chef James must have ended up
  with an "A"-plus.

498
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,739
Barbecue ribs up.

499
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,575
Oh, so good. Everything
 you order is just wonderful.

500
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,011
You get down-home cooking
   fit for a king.

501
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:01,412
Shrimp and grits up, please.

502
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,449
James does a perfect
 Southern shrimp and grits.

503
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:07,552
Brown gravy on top of it --
    unreal.

504
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:08,886
What are we gonna
     make next?

505
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,222
One of my other favorites,
 shrimp and grits.

506
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:12,557
You understand something --

507
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,425
my mom was raised
    in North Carolina.

508
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,460
I didn't know that.

509
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,161
Oh, yeah.
   I'm a grit-eating fool.

510
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,964
I start with cold water,
  margarine,

511
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:23,334
and my favorite grits are these
yellow, organic, stone grits.

512
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,735
Whisk them in.
  Yes, sir.

513
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,137
And the thing about grits --

514
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:29,073
you got to keep stirring them
so they do not stick together.

515
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,274
I got you there.

516
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:34,679
Some salt, cream --
just makes it taste so good.

517
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,415
All right, so this takes care
    of the grits side.

518
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:38,716
So, what are we into now?

519
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:41,285
Well, we're gonna make
 our gravy or sauce.

520
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,320
Sauce.

521
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:45,957
Oil, flour -- get that going.

522
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:49,994
Add water, garlic, beef base.

523
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,697
You look like you condensed
   a whole cow into that.

524
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:53,898
Oh, not quite.

525
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,234
Add onions, garlic,
  and adobo.

526
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:57,702
That's my middle name.

527
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:59,003
That's your middle name?

528
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,205
Yes, sir. And then
we're gonna make some shrimp.

529
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,240
Come on, now.

530
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,708
Add a little oil.

531
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,011
I do about four, five,
  six shrimp.

532
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:11,015
Now we add a little brown gravy,
 green onions.

533
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:13,918
My favorite -- you know that.
     I know.
  That's your middle name.

534
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,753
And tomatoes.

535
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,622
Let that cook down?
  Yeah.

536
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,824
Okay, let's hit it, boss.

537
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,560
Man, these grits
 are looking good.

538
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:23,895
Here you go.

539
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:28,132
I top it off with just
a little bit more green.

540
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,300
Now, this focaccia bread,

541
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:31,335
we got a local baker
that makes it for us.

542
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,370
It's delicious.

543
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,408
Mmm.
    That's tasty.

544
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,843
Thank you, thank you.

545
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:42,413
This gravy's got
  a nice, little tang to it.

546
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,549
The grits got to be
    a little toothsome.

547
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,851
Can't be too soggy.
   No.

548
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,819
Got to have
   a little bite to them.

549
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,722
Mmm. You're gonna have to
  pry this out of my hand.

550
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:52,757
Mmm.

551
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,058
Shrimp and grits on.

552
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,160
This is one of my favorite
  things on the menu.

553
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:59,096
I do try to duplicate it
  when I get home,

554
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:01,032
Ye My grandmother's
from South Carolina.

555
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,567
Did she put her foot in it?

556
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:06,537
She put her foot and love in it.
And this obviously has both.

557
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,440
Everybody from out of town
   I bring here.

558
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:13,377
This is a straight
 down-home country place.

559
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,180
The piece that people love about
 "Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives"

560
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:17,848
is meeting characters
    like yourself

561
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,283
that invest so much in this.

562
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,052
I mean, you embrace
    each little step

563
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,853
like it's
  the most critical piece.

564
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,555
It's fantastic.

565
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,658
Nicely done, my friend.
 Thank you, sir.

566
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,961
So, that's it for
 this Flavortown road trip,

567
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:31,229
but don't you worry.

568
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,631
There's plenty more joints
  all over this country!

569
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,132
I'll be looking for you
   next time

570
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:37,468
on "Diners, Drive-ins,
   and Dives."

571
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,272
I come here for the ice cream.

572
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:44,141
I like to put it
   in my pocket!

573
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,776
That's cold.

574
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:46,944
Rancher Rick.
