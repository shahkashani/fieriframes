121
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,235

          is the gangster, dude.

122
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,169

130
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,451
     Wonderful.                 
Been here lots of times.

137
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:25,263

 And a food truck.              

138
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,799

140

146
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,281
We got chili powder,            
brown sugar, black pepper,      

147
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,217

148

      Cinnamon.                 

150
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,689
 Chinese five-spice.            
                  Garlic powder.

151
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:51,823
                   Cumin?       

152
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,358
Cumin, dried oregano...         
                       Okay.    

153
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,960
...celery salt, Kosher salt.    

154
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,361
   Okay, and then               
 we just mixy-mixy.             

155
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,430
            So, you're liberally
              dry rubbing this. 

156
00:04:58,432 --> 00:04:59,765
We're gonna mix a little bit    
  with the butter,              

157
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,299
and then we're gonna            
put some under the skin.        

158
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,233
                    Okay.       

159
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,969
  And then a beer.              

160
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,103
             I've been waiting. 

161
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,237
               I was wondering  
      when this was gonna start.

162
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,572
        -You can have it.       
              -Oh.              

163
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,108
  We got more.                  
           It's for the chicken,
                  probably.     

164
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,977
And so then, we pour            
a little bit in the pan,        

165
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,846
and then uno, dos, tres.        

166
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,715
  And are we serving this whole,
          are we serving a half?

167
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:17,782
      We serve                  
a whole half chicken.           

168
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,917
                  You serve     
           a whole-half chicken?

169
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,251
 Whole-half chicken.            
                Come on down!   

170
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,321
     You're gonna get all of it,
            and half of it, too.

00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,725
    300 degrees,                
hour and 20 minutes.            

173
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,127
  Halfway through,              
you get an orange hoisin glaze. 

174
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,528
               What's up next?  

175
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,730
 Our bacon wok-fried            
glazed Brussels sprouts.        
                           Okay.

178
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,337

 That one has nice seasoning --

    little treat on its side.   

362
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,310
Before we do the catfish,       
walk me through this mushy peas.

363
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,712
    It's more popular in England

364
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:21,980
           than it is in Ireland
                and Scotland.   

365
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,114
     All right.                 
    Let's see it.               

366
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,049
     -So we use sweet peas.     
             -Okay.             

367
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,252
          They usually make them
             with steeped peas, 

368
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,120
               which are like   
              marrow fat peas,  

369
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,322
        but they taste terrible,
        so I use the sweet peas.

370
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,857
  -But your mom would approve?  
        -She loves them.        

371

               Fresh basil --   
             not so traditional.

372
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,328
            A little lemon zest,
        copious amounts of salt,

373
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,064
          enough water to cover.

374
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,265
               You put them on  
         just to soften them up,

375
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,935
           and then you blitz it
               in the blender.  

376
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,670

      Texas-style barbecue.     

451
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,821
             FIERI:             
   Central Texas, to be exact,  

452
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,757
       'cause that's where      
        chef Anthony Chin       

453
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,226
       got his first taste      
       of the good stuff.       

454
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,361
  -How'd you get into barbecue? 
     -It was always a hobby.    

455
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,497
    It got real because I was   
     in the music business,     

456
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:27,598
     and I'd go                 
to South by Southwest.          

457
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,699
             Oh, that's exactly 
                 what it is.    

458
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,301
             The music business 
             leads to barbecue. 

459
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,769
             -Yeah.             
       -You go down there,      

460
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,438
              you get addicted  
                in Austin...?   

461
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,306
And then decided to go          
 to culinary school             

462
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,241
at night while I was working,   
and then the barbecue hobby     

463
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,509
     turned into                
real serious business.          

464
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,778
  And the food here is no joke  

465
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,382
    whether it's classic 'cue   
    or a down-home favorite.    

466
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,583
     Fried chicken sandwich.    

467
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,118
 MAN: The fried chicken sandwich
           is amazing.          

468
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,055
  It's juicy, but then you get  
 that nice crunch from the fry, 

469
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,191
    and then the slaw that's    
  on top of it is just awesome. 

470
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,593
     What's on the rundown here?

471
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,195
     We're gonna                
start off marinating            

472
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,196
our boneless skin-on            
  chicken thighs.               
                           Okay.

473
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,399
Buttermilk, hot sauce,          

474
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,800
  and then this is              
 our prepared dredge            

475
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,401
that we're gonna dredge         
the chicken in after.           

476
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,602
     -Just to tighten it up?    
              -Yep.             

477
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:06,871
                 All right,     
 how long's this gonna marinate?

478
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,006
     Overnight.                 

479
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,407
       So, while that marinates,
            we'll make the slaw.

480
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,808
           -All right.          
            -Dig it.            

481
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,209
       -Rice wine vinegar.      
       -Rice wine vinegar.      

482
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,277
       Honey.                   

483
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,478
               That was honey?  
  That was honey.               

484
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,213
      How runny is your honey...

485
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,215
                  that your     
           honey goes like that?

486
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:18,816
   We warmed it up              
   so it's faster.              

487
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,084
          You're a honey heater.

488
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,953
    Honey heater.               
Not a hater, heater.            

489
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,955
   Yellow mustard.              
  Give this a mix.              

490
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:27,825
Shredded cabbage, red onion,    
parsley, salt, pepper.          

491
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,026
    -You grind that yourself?   
              -Yep.             

492
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,361
     You gonna do real barbecue,

493
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,030
              you got to grind  
          your own black pepper.

494
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:33,297
                    Key.        

495
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,099
Okay, now we're gonna           
 dredge the chicken.            

496
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,634
         Don't shake it too much
              so it'll pick up. 

497
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,704
                 And 350...     
About 14 minutes.               

498
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:42,240
   Now we're ready              
 to toast our buns.             

499
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:45,710
Mayo each side of the bun,      
honey mustard slaw here,        

500
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,246
  picked jalapeño,              
fried chicken thigh,            

501
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:49,981
    a little more               
  picked jalapeño.              

502
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,048
       And that's all she wrote.

503
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,182
     That's it.                 

504
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,052
                     ♪♪         

505
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:55,586
              That's a dynamite 
         fried chicken sandwich.

506
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:56,921
     Thank you.                 

507
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:59,057
 The chicken cooked perfectly --
            not overly seasoned,

508
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,457
             not under seasoned,

509
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,860
                 simple bun     
            that stays together.

510
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:06,130
               But the key is   
 the rice wine vinegar and honey

511
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,432
              and the jalapeño. 

512
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,003
          So you get this sweet,

513
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:15,272
            hot vinegar going on
              with the chicken, 

514
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,607
          all tying it together.

515
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,142
                That's a bomb   
              chicken sandwich. 

516
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,810
            Gonna be a line down
   the street on that one, baby.

517
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,812
     Thank you.                 

518
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,349
 WOMAN: The attention to detail 
  on the fried chicken sandwich 

519
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:25,750
     is what sets it apart.     

520
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,885
           Little kick          
        of the jalapeño.        

521
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,420
     It's perfectly dressed.    

522
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,622
     The juice factor, man.     
       It's just so moist.      

523
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,023
         It's one of my         
      favorite things here.     

524
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,026
  I just know that if I'm going 
        to have barbecue,       

525
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:36,894
   it's gonna be Horse Thief.   

526
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:37,962
   How you doing?               

527
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,363
             FIERI:             
 Which is just one of the spots 

528
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,631
      tucked right outside      

529
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:43,033
       this downtown L.A.       
       food market Mecca.       

530
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,969
This joint, I don't know        
  how I missed it.              

531
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:46,503
Maybe 'cause I'm always         
  inside the market             

532
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,705
and not on the outside,         

533
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,573
but this is worth it            
  to come outside.              

534
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,242
    A great place to come up    
     and get some good food     

535
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:52,443
      and some good drinks.     

536
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,178
          The courtyard out here
                 looks like     

537
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,447
                it's your own   
             private restaurant.

538
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,449
We share it with the market,    
 but we designed it.            

539
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,718
               You deigned it,  
 it's connected directly to you.

540
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,053
               You have a gate  
       that shuts everybody out,

541
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,854
       so it basically is yours.
  Pretty much.                  

542
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,224
         I kind of like         
    small owner type places,    

543
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,794
     and this fills the bill    
        on every aspect.        

544
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,195
          So, here's the deal --

545
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,063
   We're at Grand Central Market
               in Los Angeles.  

546
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,133
          We're at a funky joint
         called the Horse Thief.

547
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,934
                 We come back...
       Smoked pork belly.       

548
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,669
   The smoked pork belly here   
           is up there          

549
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,137
 with some of the best I've had.

550
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,339
             FIERI:             
    And it's coming your way    
     right after the break.     

551
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,975
         And I'll have the fried
    chicken sandwich on the way.
    All right.                  

552
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:29,480
                     ♪♪         

553
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,416
          Welcome back.         

554
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,584
         I'm hanging out        
       at the Horse Thief       

555
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,286
here at the Grand Central Market
         in Los Angeles         

556
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,688
        and just happened       
    to be touring the Market    

557
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,023
     during the commercial,     

558
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,824
           and I find           
    one of my favorite chefs,   

559
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,760
          dominates on          
     "Guy's Grocery Games,"     

560
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:45,096
            my buddy            
   Chef Philip Frankland Lee.   

561
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:46,898
  So, I know you wouldn't mind  

562
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,368
 that I bring this big-shot L.A.

  everybody gets down with it.  

564
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,439
CHIN: Smoked pork belly         
with apple-fennel slaw.         

565
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,308
  I love the smoked pork belly. 

566
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,643
    It's cooked so perfectly.   

567
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,111
      It's super delicious.     

568
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,846
  -Let's get in the pork belly. 
  -First, we're gonna brine it. 

569
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:05,449
You got water, brown sugar,     
    Kosher salt.                

570
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,450
    Drop this in.               

571
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,585
         -And how long?         
           -Overnight.          

572
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,719
         A simple brine.        

573
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,187
          This is about honoring
               the ingredient,  

574
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,189
 really bringing out the flavors
        of the pork belly, yeah?

575
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,524
    Yep, and not                
overpowering the wood.          

576
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:14,925
     What, do you guys have     
  pork belly club or something? 

577
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,193
          Am I not in?          

578
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,862
      I'm not welcome to be     
     in the pork belly club?    

579
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:19,864
      The pork belly's down     
        in the marinade.        

580
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,932
      We'll do the dry rub      
       when it comes out.       

581
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,734
        In the meantime,        
       apple-fennel slaw.       

582
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,537
We're gonna start off with apple
cider vinegar, fennel honey.    

583
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,872
I toast fennel, pour honey      
over it to let it steep.        

584
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:32,342
Napa cabbage, green apple,      
   basil, mint...               

585
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,477
 Love a little mint in my slaw. 

586
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,479
  ...fennel, salt,              

587
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,681
fresh cracked pepper.           

588
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,749
            You know            
     that's my expectation.     

589
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,484
     I think we should have     
   a couple tasting utensils,   

590
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,420
       and unfortunately,       
     there's just one fork.     

591
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,355
          That's mine.          

592
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:45,556
            I eat with my hands.

593
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,825
           Fantastic.           
             We'll just dive in.

594
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,027
    -I love the black pepper.   
       -I love the basil.       

595
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,161
    I'll take a side of that    
            for sure.           

596
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,563
     All right.                 
     Dry rub --                 

597
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:55,099
    Brown sugar,                
sweet paprika, onion,           

598
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,701
chili powder, dried mustard.    

599
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:58,569
       So, maybe following

 Correct.                       

601
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:03,774
 Granulated garlic,

  That's what we're doing next. 

611
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:19,390
So, we're gonna plate           
our apple-fennel slaw.          

612
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,724

   That's a lot of bark, huh?   

619
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:31,202
It's gonna go right on top      
of our slaw, spicy mayo.

Great smoke, not too much smoke.
