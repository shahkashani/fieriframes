00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,712
    Pulled pork.                

115
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:09,047
All right, now I'm gonna drop   
the noodles in the water.       

116
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,383
       It's like real-deal ramen
              right there, man. 

117
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,651
     Pork belly.                

118
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:15,787
The other side of the bowl      
is gonna be the pork shoulder.  

119
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:19,057
Fresh basil, cilantro,          
     fresh mint,                

120
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,259
little pickled daikon.          

121
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,794
    Ramen broth.                

122
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,396
This guy in the middle.         

123
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,069
             It is pha-nomenal. 
          It's outrageous, brah.

124
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,472
     Thank you.                 
   Appreciate it.               
                         Mmm.   

125
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:35,273
    The fact that you go through
       all this time and energy 

126
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,009
            to make every aspect
                of the dish.    

127
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,945
   You got salty, you got sweet.
       It is just so well done. 

128
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,481
             Mmm. You can tell  
             I don't like this. 

129
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:44,015
    [ Chuckles ]                

130
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,150
     It's really delicious.     

131
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,152
             WOMAN:             
   Love the pork belly in it.   

132
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,287
          So to be able         
  to throw it into a ramen bowl 

133
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,022
    like this is really nice.   

134
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,824
        I love pig. We love pig.
I love pig, yeah.               

135
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,360
    FIERI: But it looks like    
 my love's about to be tested...

136
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:56,761
                   Pork neck.   
  Pork neck?                    

137
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,431
                         Yeah.  
   I always enjoy               
  a good pork neck.             

138
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,199
      ...when we come back.     

139
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,239
       FIERI:                   
All right, so here we are.      

140
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,575
     We're back                 
in Jackson Hole, Wyoming,       

141
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,911
and we are hanging out          
 at Café Genevieve.             

142
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,713
  We just got done              
having the bomb ramen.          

143
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:17,648
   Now we are onto              
     pork necks.                

144
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,718
This looks not that --          
That does -- No, not good.      

145
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,052
                 Not appetizing?
 Not so much.                   

146
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,054
                    Well,       
       it's gonna be appetizing.

147
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:24,256
                    We rub it   
      and make it into a ragout.

148
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:26,524
        So, we got black pepper,
                kosher salt,    

149
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,060
               smoked paprika,  
               ground fennel.   

150
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,662
     Ooh.                       
                Garlic powder,  

151
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,730
               mustard powder.  

152
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,267
Chili powder.                   
      Chili powder, dried thyme.

153
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:42,006
      Now we're gonna roast them
          at 325 for two hours. 

154
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,408
So, the necks are back.         

155
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,676
                    Yep,        
and now we're gonna braise them.

156
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,877
         So, what we're gonna do
              is we do mirepoix 

157
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,078
            on the bottom again.

158
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,214
              Onions, carrots,  
    roasted romas, whole garlic,

159
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,150
               pork neck bones  
                go right in.    

160
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,618
  Fresh thyme.                  
                  Thyme sprigs. 

161
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,320
   And...                       
                 Chicken stock. 

162
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:58,890
Now what temp, how long?        

163
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,625
                   225...       

164
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,160
                    overnight.  
    Seriously?                  

165
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,495
             Yeah. Slow and low.
Why so long?                    

166
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,230
               The gelatinous   
   that comes off that pork neck

167
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,164
               is incredible.   

168
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:11,736
  Now we've pulled              
    all the meat.               

169
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,505
                  We're now     
              gonna build this. 
   Yes.                         

170
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:16,574
         What is our sauce here?
That is the braising liquid     
  pureed, strained.             

171
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,843
                      Fantastic.
   And here we go.              
     Olive oil.                 

172
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,645
Start with the pancetta.        
You want to render that down.   

173
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:21,913
     And you add                
the carrots and the onions.     

174
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:24,116
  This is really gonna cook down
                 to nothing.    

175
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:25,850
Yeah. Gonna tighten up.         
                           Okay.

176
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,385
Sweat that down, add your garlic
   towards the end              

177
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,387
because you don't want to       
      burn it.                  

178
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,789
            Lots of garlic, too.
Add your pulled pork.           

179
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,724
                 This is all    
          that pulled neck meat,

180
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,592
               all that deep,   
              rich pork flavor. 

181
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,194
So, this is some white wine,    
   to deglaze it.               

182
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,864
 I'm gonna let that             
     come down.                 

183
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:41,533
      And then we're hitting it 
with this fantastic, rich stock.

184
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,134
        Yeah.                   
   Cook this down.              

185
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,470
Finish it with a little thyme,  
fresh thyme, chopped up.        

186
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,005
           And a little parsley.
     Parsley.                   

187
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,406
                 How long's     
           this gonna cook down?

188
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,675
  About 45 minutes              
     to an hour.                

189
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,210
             What are we serving
                 this with?     

190
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,678
      Homemade                  
 pappardelle pasta.             

191
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,213
            Do you buy anything?

192
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,349
Medium-high sauté pan.          
                           Okay.

193
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:59,484
       Butter.                  

194
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:00,419
                Look at this.   

195
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:02,687
                Send me home    
          with a gallon of that.

196
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,422
                        Oh!     
    Fresh thyme.                

197
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,557
      Parsley.                  

198
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,627
        Let those noodles finish
               in that ragout.  

199
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:15,300
A little fresh ricotta          
 that we make here.             
               Of course you do.

200
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,035
     Throw that                 
 in the salamander.             

201
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,370
     Finish with                
a little breadcrumbs.           

202
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:19,437
     Here we go.                

203
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,172
                Here we are.    

204
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,808
  Home-cooked food.             

205
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,780
             Tender, flavorful, 
      deep, balanced, all of it.

206
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,516
   Are there Italian restaurants
                in this town?   

207
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:32,451
        Two?                    

208
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:33,919
       This is not fair to them.

209
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:35,587
  You're not supposed to come in
                and do this.    

210
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,289
              It's like playing 
               all the sports.  

211
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:40,992
                    Well,       
               your restaurant  

212
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,593
          is like the Bo Jackson
               of restaurants.  

213
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,397
            Making your noodles,
             making your pasta, 

214
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,599
                cooking down    
               the pork necks.  

215
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,401
          I mean, you rocked it.
              Oh, that's good!  

216
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:50,936
              Pork neck ragout. 

217
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:52,871
      All right. Thank you.     
    Just a really good dish.    

218
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,739
    And the pork                
is just out of this world.      

219
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,275
   The pasta's cooked perfectly.
        It's so full of flavor. 

220
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,409
            It's my buddy Johnny
              from California.  

221
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,144
                Johnny and I    
   were flambé captains together

222
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,746
               at the Red Lion  
                 Motor Inn.     

223
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:05,816
              What do you think?
Delicious, great place,         
     great food.                

224
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,552
  It's just part of what you do 
    when you come to Jackson.   

225
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:08,886
     FIERI: This is awesome.    

226
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,222
   People come for the skiing,  
    come for the wilderness,    

227
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:12,057
    come back for this joint.   

228
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,494
            Coming up           
   in Boston, Massachusetts...  

229
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,964
           That is over the top.
 ...a spot hitting the sauce... 

230
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,232
Dare I say "Flavortown"?        
                  Brother,      
  this drove through Flavortown.

231
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,234
   ...and jazzing up the Joe.   

232
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,303
       Was that jazz hands flair
              you just gave me? 
These are jazz hands, yeah.     

233
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,615
     So, I'm here in Boston     

234
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:39,884
      in one of the busiest     
   tourist areas in the city.   

235
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:43,154
   I'm right by the aquarium,   
  Faneuil Hall, and Haymarket.  

236
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,490
  Now, there are so many places 
             to eat,            

237
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:49,160
  but I hear a joint you got to 
check out is right here at Saus.

238
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,365
         Crispy chicken.        

239
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,300
     You can't go wrong with    
 pretty much anything you order.

240
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,101
       The Sloppy Jacques.      

241
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,371
Been here before?               
             About 20, 50 times.

242
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,572
 This week?                     
           [ Laughs ]           

243
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:02,374
       FIERI: And the guy       
    keeping them coming back    

244
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,843
 is co-owner and chef Chin Kuo, 

245
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:08,246
 who opened this joint with some
  college buddies back in 2011. 

246
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,047
      So, why is it called Saus?

247
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,316
It's "sauce" in Dutch.          

248
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,184
     Inspired by                
  Dutch Greek food.             

249
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,919
   We're all about              
   the condiments.              

250
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:18,055
      Yep, all 20 of them,      
  ranging from savory to sweet. 

251
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,891
 All of the sauces are amazing. 

252
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,194
 What dipping sauces            
    do you enjoy?               

253
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:26,063
         I like Samurai,        
     I like Vampire Slayer.     

254
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,198
Sounds like a comic book.       
           [ Laughs ]           

255
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,000
           You can use          
  a lot of the different sauces 

256
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:31,002
    on all of the sandwiches.   

257
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,670
  KUO: Chicken saté pocket up.  

258
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,406
          I really love         
       the chicken pocket.      

259
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,740
   MAN: You got some crunch,    
   and there are some carrots   

260
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,274
         and some onions        
        and some chicken.       

261
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,276
      It all comes together     
     in a really great bite.    

262
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,679
          What are we gonna make
                   today?       

263
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,414
The Lemongrass Chicken          
    Saté pocket.                

264
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,481
                    Okay.       

265
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:46,951
Here we have boneless skinless  
chicken thighs.                 

266
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,687
                       Next up? 
  We're gonna make              
    the marinade.               

267
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:51,156
Regular granulated sugar,       
   dark soy sauce,              

268
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,625
   garlic powder,               
 lot of lemongrass,             

269
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,360
and then we also have           
 some ground ginger.            

270
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:56,828
And I'm just gonna go ahead     
   and mix it up.               

271
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:00,165
    How long will this marinate?
                 For a day?     
Exactly.                        

272
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,565
            And then how are we 
      gonna prepare it to serve?

273
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:02,500
I'm gonna deep-dry it.          

274
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,035
          To go into the pocket?
That's right.                   

275
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,503
      And it's a pocket of what?
Pita pocket.                    

276
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:06,771
                Pita pocket!    

277
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,575
So, here we're gonna make       
   the pindasaus.               

278
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,310
               The pindasaus?   
   Yes.                         

279
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,779
    It translates               
to "peanut sauce" in Dutch.     

280
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,114
                   Got it.      

281
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,249
It starts with just             
regular creamy peanut butter.   
                           Okay.

282
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,918
Next, we're gonna add           
   the saté sauce.              

283
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,054
It's a very savory mix          
    of goodness.                

284
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:26,324
Some dark soy sauce,            
    chili paste,                

285
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,661
little bit of lemon juice,      
     sesame oil,                

286
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:32,597
   garlic powder,               
 and ginger powder.             

287
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,931
   Just gonna add               
a little bit of water.          

288
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,800
      And you're gonna hit this 
      with an immersion blender?

289
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,335
   That's correct.              

290
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,608
Gonna add some greens,          
fresh chopped onions,           

291
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,143
parsley vinaigrette.            

292
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,746
I'm gonna add this chicken      
that's out of the fryer.        

293
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,481
   So, we're just               
gonna slice this pita bread     

294
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,883
down the middle here.           

295
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,685
Add this peanut sauce.          

296
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,153
Gonna add the chicken           
and the greens, the vinaigrette,

297
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,488
and then just gonna drizzle     

298
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,823
    a little bit                
more peanut sauce on top.       

299
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,458
       And that's all she wrote.

300
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,631
            Great sandwich, man.

301
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:09,100
                Peanut sauce    
     isn't overdone with peanut.

302
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,436
       Chicken's nice and tender
                and crunchy.    

303
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,505
             Outrageous texture.

304
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,974
     Nice, big, hearty sandwich,
               lot of flavors.  

305
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:17,375
                 Very good.     
               Nice job, man.   

306
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:18,442
  Thanks very much.             

307
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,311
              KUO:              
     Chicken saté pocket up.    

308
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,447
          The pindasaus         
   has Asian-style flavors --   

309
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:25,049
    salty but a little sweet.   

310
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,118
                 Do you have    
          a culinary background?
  I do not.                     

311
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,655
  [ Laughs ] Okay.              
This is what happened.          

312
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,392
We moved off campus,            
so I had to start cooking,      

313
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,694
    and there was               
  the Food Network.             

314
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,929
                     I'm done!  
That's a secret.                

315
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,597
               My job is over!  
           Thank you. Very nice.

316
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,468
          All the food          
      is really great here.     

317
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,736
     They got little bites,     

318
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,003
     they've got, you know,     
           big meals.           

319
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,872
   Sloppy Jacques,              
     here we go!                

320
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,341
       The Sloppy Jacques       
   is one of those sandwiches   

321
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,077
  that just kind of remind you  
          of childhood.         

322
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,146
   It's braised beef and bacon  
    served on a brioche bun.    

323
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,281
              Why is it called  
                 "Jacques"?     

324
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,550
 I guess you can say            
 it's the sloppy Joe            

325
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,552
  with some flair,              
    some Jacques.               

326
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,087
       Was that jazz hands flair
              you just gave me? 

327
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,155
These are jazz hands,           
        yeah.                   

328
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,156
Shhhh!                          
             Yeah, there we go. 

329
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,424
                    First thing 
         we're gonna start with.

330
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,227
Applewood-smoked bacon          
and also pork belly scraps.     

331
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,496
So, I'm just gonna take this    
and give it a good stir         

332
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:14,098
   and render down              
      the fat.                  

333
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,134
       Onions.                  

334
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,103
     All right,                 
next up we have the ground beef.

335
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,038
                    Okay.       
            I'll spot you, okay?

336
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,040
   Help me out.                 
                    Here you go.

337
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:28,112
       So, ground beef's cooked,
            onions are sweated. 

338
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,248
   Next up we have              
just a cornstarch slurry.       

339
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,252
 House-made ketchup,            

340
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,720
   Worcestershire,              

341
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:37,188
   Dijon mustard,               

342
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,056
    lots of salt                
and lots of black pepper.       

343
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,925
Last thing we're gonna add --   
     milk stout.                

344
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,060
It's gonna add some --          

345
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:43,461
             A nice, big, deep, 
                 rich stout.    

346
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:44,996
                And how long    
    we gonna let this cook down?

347
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,198
      You know,                 
15, 20 minutes or so.           

348
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,534
All right, so I'm gonna plate   
the Sloppy Jacques now.         

349
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:53,004
First I'm gonna start           
with a brioche roll,            

350
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:54,872
some of this ketchup,           
   cheddar cheese,              

351
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,408
 quite a lot of this            
    right on top.               

352
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,342
                   Hey-o!       

353
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,745
     Little bit                 
of pickled red onion.           

354
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,583
   That's for you.              

355
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,357
                Really rich.    

356
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,294
             That is big flavor.

357
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:21,032
    If you like the sloppy Joes,
          that is over the top.

    [ Chuckles ]                

359
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,568
        You're getting the beer,

360
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,469
             you definitely get 
               the seasoning.   

361
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,038
    It's really got a sweet note
                that's coming   

362
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,506
    from the house-made ketchup,
                  I think.      

363
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,040
             Don't buy one beer 
             when you have this.

364
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,042
                Buy like 10.    

365
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,448
       I love the savory,       
      sweet kind of balance     

366
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,918
   of the bacon and the stout.  

367
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,187
  It's a little bit of a mess   
  to eat, but a glorious mess.

  You get some of the tourists.

      In Cincinnati, Ohio,

      You're rocking the house.

00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:34,538
          So, I'm here          
      at Cincinnati, Ohio,      

389
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,074
       on Hamilton Avenue,      
 about five miles from downtown 

390
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,209
   right over by the colleges.  

391
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,612
    Now, when I say Cincinnati, 
        what do you think?      

392
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:42,213
   Well, you definitely think   
      the Cincinnati Reds,      

393
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,214
   but you got to think about   
           the chili,           

394
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,216
           'cause here          
    they do chilis three-way,   

395
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,952
    they do chili four ways,    
          and five-way.         

396

407
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,382
      where the vegetarian

00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:33,998
          It looks like         
   a regular Cincinnati 3-way.  

414
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,802
     I was really surprised     
to learn that it was vegetarian.

416
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,472

    with some oil

the chili seasonings.           

422
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,952

00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,033
We're going to just splash      

431
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,901
a little red-wine vinegar       
      in there.

   And we sprinkle              
 with white cheddar.

447
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,077
  I like sriracha.              

448
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,412
     May I?                     
                     Oh, yeah.  

449
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,414
All right. Here we go.          

450
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,552
                I don't think   
          anybody could tell you

451
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,354
       there's not meat in that.
[ Chuckles ] Thank you.         

452
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,756
               Yeah, I like it  
        because it's real chili.

453
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:06,557
                 You can see    
             what you're eating.

454
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,826
              It's not a bunch  
       of pureed-out meat sauce.

455
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:12,430
          The beans are tender. 
    The TVP is perfect in there.

456
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:18,102
 You're not only pulling it off.
      You're rocking the house. 

457

     Thank you.

460
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:25,309
 The chili, it's like I used to 
 get over at my grandma's house.

461
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,577
    It's so rich and hearty.    

462
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,112
 It's got so much flavor to it. 

463
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,114
   So, if you come              
   to Cincinnati,               

464
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:32,450
you got to go to a Reds game,   
and you got to try chili.       

465
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,585
I've got a buddy of mine        
who plays ball for the Reds,    

466
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,722
     number 48,                 
outfielder Ryan Ludwick.        

467
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,323
   Ryan, you think              
if we took this to the clubhouse

468
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:40,524
and let some of the guys        
       try it?                  

469
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,926
                   I think      
   if this was in the clubhouse,

470
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,594
         you'd find nothing left
                on this plate   

471
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:44,995
                when the guys   
             were done with it. 

472
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,865
   When you love what you do,   
     it shows in your food.     

473
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,434
             I guess            
     you get a little love.     

474
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,205
               What pushed you  
         to open your own joint?

475
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,741
So, there was nowhere really    
  to go to get food             

476
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,211
that was free of food coloring, 
   preservatives,

       barbecue sandwich.

  the Yeehaw without giving a --

We're about to prep the chicken.

00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:24,434
       Pepper.                  

489
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,903
    Kosher salt,                

490
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,137
    onion powder,               

491
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,539
   garlic powder.               

492
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:31,709
    Sprinkle that               
  over the chicken.             

493
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,246
   We're gonna add              
 the sherry and oil             

494
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:37,381
and just add a little bit       
of water to cover it.           

495
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:40,384
    And this will get popped in 
the oven at what temp, how long?

496
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,720
350 for about 25 minutes.       

497
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,988
              Now we're making

 Yes.                           

498
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,192
We are gonna start off with     
our house-made ketchup base.    

499
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:52,263
 We're going to add             
    the molasses                

500
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:54,932
   and some minced              
 pickled jalapeños,             

501
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,400
     hot sauce,                 

502
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,736
     little bit                 
more brown sugar here,          

503
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,004
      allspice,                 

504
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,807
   canned chipotle              
   in adobo sauce,              

505
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,142
 extra strong Dijon,            

506
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,277
and some corn starch.           

507
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,847
We're just gonna blend          
everything into the ketchup.    

508
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,351
     All right.                 
I just let that cool.           

509
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,552
Let's build the sandwich.       

510
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,689
   We're going to               
split the hoagie in half        

511
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:21,425
and add the chicken.            

512
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:24,161
 Pico on this side.             

513
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,564
 Lay some tomatoes.             

514
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,066
   Barbecue sauce.              

515
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,169
Lay the smoked mozzarella       
       on top.                  

516
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,504
               Into the oven?   

517
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,106
Takes about three minutes,      
        500.                    

518
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,175
     Here we go.                

519
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,378
   So, we have...               

520
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,613
                   Ta-da.       

521
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:52,189
              That's a lot more 
       than a barbecue sandwich.

522
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,058
            The pico is the key.

523
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,393
            That's what takes it
               the next step.   

524
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,931
             The barbecue sauce 
             is "legit" legit.  

525
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,399
                Chicken's got   
           its own great flavor.

526
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,335
     That's a dangerous balance.

     It's sweet, it's tangy.
