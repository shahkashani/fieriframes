   DIP THIS IN SOME WATER, MAKE 
   SURE ALL THE SCALES ARE OFF. 

419
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,561

LIKE A SURGEON                  
WITH A MACHETE.                 

420
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,763

IT'S ALL GOOD TO GO.            

424
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:49,040

        WE GOT SOME WATER HERE, 

425
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,908
    LEMON JUICE, GROUND GARLIC.

                   NOW WE USE   
               SOME CUMIN, SALT.

428
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,116
        MIX IT UP A LITTLE BIT. 

429
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,518
                AND NOW WE'RE   
             AT ABOUT 3 GALLONS.

430
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,486
AND THEN IT MARINATES           
    FOR HOW LONG?               
               TWO, THREE HOURS.

431
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,388
      THEN IT GETS PUT          
IN THE CRACKER MEAL--DIG IT.    

432
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:07,058

              OUR GOLDEN BATTER.

433
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:11,062

        USE SOME WATER, FLOUR,  
     ONE SPOON OF BAKING POWDER.

434
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:13,998
               NOW I'M GONNA ADD
                SOME EGG...     
OKAY, BUDDY,                    
LET'S SEE IT.                   

435
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,534
           THE TAIL DOESN'T GET 
           GOLDEN BA--GUESS NOT.

436
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,669
 PRETTY QUICK WITH THAT ANSWER. 
  SO WHAT'S THIS GET SERVED ON? 

437
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,871
WE SERVE THIS ON A CUBAN BUN    
WITH SOME ONIONS AND KETCHUP.   

438
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:23,274
          BREAD COMES FROM      
    THE CUBAN BAKERY, I TAKE IT?
YES.

           AND WE'RE GONNA LEAVE
           THE TAIL ON FOR THIS.
  WE'RE GONNA LEAVE

440
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:28,412
    ADD SOME ONIONS, KETCHUP,   
 AND THAT'S OUR MINUTA SANDWICH.

441
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:31,015
                      THAT'S IT?
THAT'S IT.                      

442
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,283
             WOW, THAT'S CRAZY, 

443
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,686
            BUT IT WORKS.       
     FISH BY ITSELF IS ON POINT.

444
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,688
                THAT MARINADE   
            REALLY WORKED ON IT.

445
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:39,757
       THE KETCHUP, A LITTLE BIT
           OF THE SWEETNESS     

446
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,759
        OFFSET WITH SOME        
 OF THE SHARPNESS OF THE ONION--

447
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:44,228
 SO YOU HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT
  CONTRASTING FLAVORS GOING ON. 

448
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,230
             NICE JOB. NO WONDER
              IT'S SO POPULAR.  

449
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,966

         THE TAIL THING'S WEIRD.

450

TAKE ALL THE BLACK EYES,        
TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE DRY,       

481
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,218
      WE'RE GONNA LEAVE 'EM     
 FOR PROBABLY EIGHT HOURS OR SO.

482
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,420
 AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKIN' 
   ABOUT--THE BLACK-EYED PEAS   

483
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,356
  ALL GROUND UP, RECONSTITUTED, 
 AND NOW WE'RE GONNA GRIND 'EM. 

484
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,892
EXACTLY.                        
                  GIVE ME       
           THE RUNDOWN, BROTHER.

485
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,894
WE'RE GONNA MIX THIS UP--       
SALT WITH GROUND PEPPER.        

486
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:26,363
START THIS UP.                  
         HEY, YOU WANT ME TO BE 
        THE GARLIC AND SALT GUY?

487
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,365
YEAH, THAT'LL BE GREAT.         
              WHEN'S THAT GARLIC
               START GOIN' DOWN?

488
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:31,969
DO THAT NOW, ABOUT TWO          
AT A TIME. THERE WE GO.         
                       TEAMWORK.

489
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:35,239
              A LOT OF WORK     
         JUST TO MAKE A FRITTER.
YEAH.                           

490
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:38,109
         DIFFERENT THAN A LOT   
      OF HUSH PUPPIES I'VE SEEN.
NOW WE'LL MIX IT UP.            

491
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:39,977
             AND THEN WE FRY IT.
EXACTLY.                        

492
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,113
      HOW MANY COME IN AN ORDER?
TEN.                            

493
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:45,049
             WILL THEY ROLL OVER
                ON THEMSELVES?  
      THEY'LL ROLL OVER.        
YOU CAN HAVE 'EM WITH KETCHUP.  

494
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,184
      YOU CAN HAVE 'EM          
WITH TARTAR SAUCE, SOME LIME.   

495
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,754
  I LIKE YOUR HERDING TECHNIQUE,
    IN THE CORNER FOR YOU. YAH. 

496
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,922
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT              
SOME HUSH PUPPIES.              

497
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,724
 HOW DO THEY SWELL UP LIKE THAT?

498
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,327
THERE'S NO BAKING SODA          
  IN 'EM, NO FLOUR.             
                  JUST THE BEAN.

499
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:58,528
    DOES THAT LOOK              
LIKE JUST BEAN TO YOU?          

500
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:01,065
THOSE ARE ROCKIN'.              
                        AWESOME.

501
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,534
  I GET A LITTLE BIT            
OF THE GARLIC IN THERE,         

502
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:05,736
       BUT I GET                
A REAL DISTINCT FLAVOR.         

503
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,738
   I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,           
THEY HAVE GOT MORE FLAVOR       

504
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,408
AND MORE SEASONING TO 'EM--     
    I DON'T GET STUMPED         

505
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,343
       ON MANY FOOD ITEMS.      
 THIS ONE REALLY DOES STUMP ME. 

506
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,012
THESE ARE KILLER.               
                        AWESOME.

507
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,614
CHEERS, MAN. NICE JOB.          

508
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:19,150
NO, IT IS REALLY GOOD.          
                  IF I HADN'T   
               SEEN HIM MAKE IT,

509
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:21,619
    I WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT
         IN A MILLION YEARS.    
NOT AT ALL.                     

510
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,954
IT'S SIMPLE, BUT KIND OF GOES   
     BACK TO THE ROOTS.         

511
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:27,425
          (man speaking Spanish)
CUBAN FOOD IS THE BEST FOOD I'VE
 EVER HAD, AND I'M A SPANIARD.  

512
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,493
        PAN CON MINUTA?         
                WE WANT SEAFOOD,
                 WE COME HERE.  

513
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,296
  EVERY TIME I COME, I-I GOTTA  
 SQUEEZE INTO SOMEBODY'S PLACE. 

514
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,665
I WANT TO GET MY COUNTER SPOT   
   WITH MY NAME ON THERE.       

515
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,768
               WE'LL MAKE SURE  
             WE MARK IT FOR YOU.
I'M COMIN' BACK.                

516
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,705
    WOW, WAS THAT A ROAD TRIP   
    OR WHAT? BUT DON'T WORRY,   

517
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,574
   THERE'S PLENTY MORE PLACES   
  TO FIND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. 

518
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,843
         I'LL BE LOOKIN'        
      FOR YOU NEXT TIME ON      

519
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,845
 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

520
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,447
  I'M GONNA PUT IT IN THE OVEN. 
 WE'RE GONNA BAKE IT TO A RARE. 

521
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:52,182
WE'RE GONNA BAKE IT             
  TO A "RAY-ER."                

522
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:54,251
I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT.          
                YOU'VE GOTTA ADD
                   THE "ER."    

523
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,520
     OH, I KNOW.                
I--YOU TOOK ME THERE.           

524
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,856
WE'LL TAKE IT                   
TO A "RAY-ER."                  
                       "RAY-ER."
