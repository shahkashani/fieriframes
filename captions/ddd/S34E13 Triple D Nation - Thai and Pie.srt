   If it's fried, get double.   

370
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:32,677

   of water, butter, and salt   

371

 and then flour to make a roux.

   the dough into a pastry bag

00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,358

[ Laughs ] Right.

         Salt, parsley,         
     fresh-grated Parmesan.     

381
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,504
    Give them a little toss.    

382
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,972
   And everybody likes to have  
    a dip for them, as well,

00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,175
       so we're gonna make      
       our farmhouse dip.       

384
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,178
     Start off with copious     
     amounts of mayonnaise,     

385
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,781
     sour cream, buttermilk,    
         garlic powder,         

386
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:13,651
  onion powder, salt, oregano,  
 fresh-chopped Italian parsley, 

387
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,653
         a little dill,         
     some red-wine vinegar.     

388
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,121
      Now we're just gonna      
          whisk it up.

00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:20,057

     with our farmhouse dip.

      great crunch to them

       but a lot of cheese      
         on the inside.

    [Laughing] the first one.   

394
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,070

   takes it to the next level.

 have, like, bacon toothpaste...
