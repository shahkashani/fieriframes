1
00:00:02,136 --> 00:00:03,602
I'm Guy Fieri,
  and we're rolling out

2
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:06,405
looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.

3
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:08,107
This trip...
    Wow!

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,075
It's a first-course feast.

5
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:12,177
This is like
  an eclectic funk menu.

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,114
On this full hour of
  amazing appetizers.

7
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:17,116
I'm gonna have to go back for
 another round of hot yoga.

8
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,218
We've got tasty Denver tots.

9
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,253
That's the most tot-alistic.

10
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:23,122
Smoked Kansas poppers.

11
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:24,623
Brother, that's wicked.

12
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,492
And in Oklahoma,
   how about some

13
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:28,460
good, old Rocky Mountain
   oysters?

14
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,129
You got to be right in my face
  with this, don't you?

15
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:32,431
Then we're wrapping cheese in
   Atlanta.

16
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:33,465
I've never seen it done
   this way.

17
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,200
Stuffing grape leaves
   in Maryland.

18
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,535
Do you put magic in there, too?

19
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,637
Eating escargot in Miami.

20
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:39,905
That's pretty well done, huh?

21
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:42,708
And in Queens, atomic fireballs?

22
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,176
These things are banging, dude.

23
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:46,612
Plus, all kinds of wings.

24
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:47,946
Oh, oh, oh!

25
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:50,249
Made with some
  unexpected things.

26
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:53,485
Probably gonna get kicked out of
 the national wing-eating club.

27
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,888
So, get ready to share...
I can get in trouble with these.

28
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,724
As we start this
  appetizer-palooza.

29
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,493
Are you guys excited at home?

30
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,796
That's all right here,
   right now,

31
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:05,597
on "Triple D."

32
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,282
I'm here in
 the Highlands neighborhood,

33
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:25,784
about a mile from downtown
  Denver, Colorado,

34
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,619
and about a mile away
  from Citizen Pictures,

35
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:30,189
the folks that happen to produce
 "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives,"

36
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:31,890
but don't let those details
   confuse you.

37
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:34,460
I'm here to check out
  a joint that I hear

38
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:36,261
has the most real-deal,
   off-the-hook,

39
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,130
outrageous bar food
   you can find.

40
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:40,065
This is Highland Tavern.

41
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:46,271
Stupid Burger
 in the window.

42
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,074
Much more upscale than what
 you would consider a local bar.

43
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:50,843
Not a Philly.

44
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:52,911
The attention to having
  higher-end ingredients

45
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,480
in a dive-bar feel.

46
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,587
Just when owners
 Brian Sommatino and Andy Stutz

47
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:03,989
had in mind
when they bought this old joint.

48
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,859
The building we're in is
 an old Coors Brewing building?

49
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:08,760
Yeah, built in 1901
  by Coors.

50
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:12,631
It's been a bar pretty much
 from 1901 till now,

51
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,199
minus prohibition.

52
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,938
So, they kept the suds flowing

53
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,808
and hired fine-dining chef
   Jeremy McMinn

54
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,510
to build up the menu.

55
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:27,412
Every dish has a little
something added to it

56
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,081
that just makes you
 remember it.

57
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:32,184
Like a pork shank
  braised in ancho chili,

58
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,653
spare ribs
  glazed with Dr Pepper,

59
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,288
and house-made pastrami

60
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,590
he's dropping
 on<i> this</i> killer sandwich.

61
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,058
Bombshell up.

62
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,261
It is just marvelous.

63
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:44,730
And if you're looking for
something at the table to share,

64
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:46,698
they're rocking out
   their version

65
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,066
of a bar food
   favorite...

66
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,301
Tavern Tots.

67
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,637
...the homemade tater tot.

68
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,105
By far, the best things

69
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:54,640
I've ever found
  in my entire life.

70
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:57,976
Do I need
    to freeze-dry them?

71
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,378
Do I need
    to dehydrate them?

72
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,679
What exactly --

73
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,948
Eventually I just gave up
and we made up our own thing.

74
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,716
All right.
 Well, let's see how you do it.

75
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,085
We're gonna cook
 the potatoes.

76
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:09,121
Cold water.

77
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:12,791
We're gonna bring these up
to just barely a simmer.

78
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:13,792
Okay.

79
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,460
And then even
 the heat out on it,

80
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,762
and just let them sit.

81
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:19,131
It usually takes about 40
minutes until they're al dente.

82
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,265
Al dente -- No, okay.

83
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,434
Yeah, that's probably
a pretty good description.

84
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,203
So, do you have a timer
     on this?
 No.

85
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:25,304
Awesome.
   No.

86
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:27,673
So, there's a variable
     here.
  Yeah.

87
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,242
All right.

88
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,644
So, we got our partially
    cooked potato

89
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:36,148
that's just cooked enough
 that it'll still make shreds.

90
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,783
Yeah.
    So, hash brown-ish.

91
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:40,152
Hash brown-ish, yeah.
     There you go.

92
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:45,591
Ooh!
  It's like a snow blower.

93
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:47,326
So, if you're
    a breakfast house,

94
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:51,363
you would die to have
  hash coming out like that.

95
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,764
A little bit of grit
     to it,

96
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,234
so it's not completely finished,
 and this is the foundation.

97
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:56,335
That's it.
     I love it.

98
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,136
Now what's the process?

99
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,205
Then we got to mix in
our dry ingredients.

100
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,740
Salt?
  Salt.

101
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,242
Granulated garlic.

102
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,610
Granulated onion.

103
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,845
Cayenne pepper.
      Nice.

104
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,880
The key is there's a lot
   of nooks and crannies

105
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:09,948
to all that --

106
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,151
All those different pieces
     of potato,

107
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:16,388
so the more evenly
  you can distribute this...

108
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,290
Okay.

109
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:20,359
We're gonna add tamari
 to our eggs.

110
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:21,927
Really?
   Yeah.

111
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,363
So, that little bit of egg's
   gonna help bind it.

112
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:25,530
Yeah.
     I'm excited.

113
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,566
Are you guys excited
     at home?

114
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,335
Now, we got to form these,
    freeze them,

115
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,403
form them, set them up.

116
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:32,638
Form them
 and drop them.

117
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,039
Like it's hot?

118
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:38,176
They will be hot
once we've dropped them.

119
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,478
Okay. What size tot
    do you make?

120
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,813
It's about an ounce
 and a quarter.
       Okay.

121
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,950
Cook them on 350?
  375.

122
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,551
375.
 Till they're GBD.

123
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,687
That's golden brown
 and delicious.
     I pick it up.

124
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:51,623
A little salt on these.

125
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,592
There it is.
Small order of tots.

126
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,527
This is the moment.

127
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,267
Good separation.
   Looking good so far.

128
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,902
That's what you're looking for
  in a tot.

129
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:12,277
Out of all the house-made tots
     I've had...

130
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,645
mine included...

131
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,881
that's the most
    tot-alistic.

132
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,818
This is ridiculous.
   Way to hammer that out.

133
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,819
Thanks.

134
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,387
In the world
    of "Triple D,"

135
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,824
that's probably one of the best,
  if not<i> the</i> best rendition

136
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,326
of a homemade tot.

137
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,327
Thanks.

138
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,661
Nice job.
  Thanks.

139
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:30,929
And great seasoning.

140
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,366
Watch out
    for this guy.

141
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,303
I like to think of them
 as, like, tots redefined.

142
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:41,239
This will ruin tots
  for everywhere else

143
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,108
because they are really
   just the best.

144
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,843
Good people, really good food.

145
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,011
Just a wonderful place to be.

146
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,779
It's almost like
  having a party at home.

147
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,916
Everybody knows everybody.
 Everybody knows the bartenders.

148
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:53,218
In fact, the place is<i> so</i> local,

149
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,888
owners Brian and Andy
 plucked Jeremy from a barstool.

150
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,224
He was a regular.
He lived about a block away.

151
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,094
Came here after work
to have his beer to go home,

152
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:04,229
and I asked him to be the chef
 and he said yes.

153
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,998
That was like
   hitting the lottery.
 Yes.

154
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,303
Okay, so, this has been pretty
  much a ridiculous visit.

155
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:13,772
We have declassified
     the tots.

156
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,307
And now we will venture
     into --

157
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:17,509
'Cause there's nothing
  that this guy won't touch.

158
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:18,543
What are we doing now?

159
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,745
We're gonna make
 our pork rinds.

160
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:22,147
Pork rinds
 in the window.

161
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:23,181
Crazy.
   Yeah.

162
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,316
Okay.
   Give me the rundown.

163
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:25,617
Got some raw pigskins.

164
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,486
Now, these are pigskins
     from the --

165
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:28,787
Belly skin.

166
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,022
Belly skin, primarily,
is what you want to use in this?

167
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:32,391
This is where the bacon
   has been taken out,

168
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:33,492
just to give you
    some reference,

169
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:35,060
and you are now
     going to...

170
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,629
We're gonna drop this
in some boiling water.

171
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:40,031
Drop it.
  Drop it
 like it's skin.

172
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,900
We're gonGreat. That's a little
i"Silence of the Lamb"-y for me.

173
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,668
So, you got to cook this
     through.

174
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,170
Got four hours
 at a full-on boil.

175
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:46,505
Salted?
  No salt.

176
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,409
All right.

177
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,578
Wow.
    That is funky, man.

178
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,381
Now you'll cut them into chunks,
    pieces, strips?

179
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,483
Little strips.
      Okay.

180
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,222
So, this little
    munchkin dehydrator

181
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,690
is gonna do
    all the work.

182
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:06,858
It's gonna do
 all the work.

183
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,059
How long
    are these gonna go?

184
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:11,663
Set it and forget it
for about 26 1/2 hours.

185
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:12,731
Not 27?

186
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:13,832
Not 27.

187
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:14,900
Not 25.

188
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:15,901
Not 26.
     26.

189
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,803
26 and a...
      Half.

190
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,704
When you dehydrate it
 and take all that moisture out,

191
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,606
that's what gives them
 the chance to really puff up?

192
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,108
Yeah.
     All right.

193
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,476
Load 'em up,
    shut 'em down.

194
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,211
26 1/2 hours,
    and here we go.

195
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,747
That's it.
      Genius.

196
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,116
Okay.

197
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,884
They're ready
 to come out.

198
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,854
Dehydrated pig skin.

199
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:36,855
Really?

200
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,357
Yeah.
 Like, hard plastic.

201
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,092
So, now we're gonna go
    to the fryer.

202
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,894
Let's go.

203
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:48,567
Whoa!

204
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,970
It's amazing every single time
 you do it, too --

205
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,004
doesn't get old.

206
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,706
That is --
    I'm telling you,

207
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,175
I have seen some cool things
    on "Triple D."

208
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,478
That might be
   in the top 10 coolest.

209
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,580
Bring over
   those mouth killers.

210
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,615
Wow. Hot!

211
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:06,151
Okay. Next.

212
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,486
We're gonna make
the chili lime-salt mix.

213
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:09,087
We got our lime salt.

214
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,188
Korean chili flake.

215
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,357
Chili powder.
 A little mix.

216
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,359
Season 'em.

217
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,428
That's ridiculous.

218
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,462
There you go.

219
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:18,497
Look at that.

220
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,632
That's a lot of work,
     buddy.

221
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:28,974
Dude, you kill this.
  Thanks.

222
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,244
This is how they were
    to be appreciated.

223
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:36,147
Fresh, crispy, light,
     not dense.

224
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,716
The flavor jets
    just turned on.

225
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,150
They're trying
    to shut down

226
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,052
that flavor fire
    I got in my mouth.

227
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,287
You want another one?

228
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,456
Maybe a little Tebow.
   Hang on a second.

229
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,857
That is ridiculous.

230
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,225
I don't say this often,

231
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,895
but that's the best chicharrone
    I've ever had.

232
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,329
Thanks.
 I appreciate it.

233
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:52,864
I'm really taken back,
     man.

234
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,966
I love the pork rinds.

235
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,202
I think they should be
 prescribed to me by my doctor.

236
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,303
Magic in the mouth.

237
00:08:58,305 --> 00:08:59,304
These are great.

238
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,505
Pretty ridiculous.
      Yes.

239
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,507
Just keep talking. I'm gonna
just keep eating these.

240
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:05,744
One of the best "Triple D"
   experiences I've had.

241
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,779
And I've seen a lot.

242
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,514
Okay?
     There we go.
  Thanks, man.

243
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,220
Up next in Miami...

244
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,555
Legit, legit.

245
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,290
...a funky little strip mall
   tavern...

246
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,091
I don't know that I've
   seen this.

247
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,327
...getting fits with
   the fixings.

248
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,829
Hands down, the first time we've
 ever seen escargot on a menu.

249
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,203
I'm here in Miami where,
   20 years ago,

250
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,005
a flight attendant
   and a carpenter

251
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,874
took a chance to open
   a restaurant.

252
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,242
Now, it didn't look like much.

253
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,011
It's here in a strip mall,
  but they had a plan.

254
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,880
All right, guys.

255
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:44,015
People would call it
   a sports bar.

256
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,283
You're having the escargot?

257
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,451
And you're serving escargot?

258
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:47,786
Yep.
   It's fabulous.

259
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,822
Mussels Provençal,
  blackened mahi mahi.

260
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,190
It's got a nice kick to it.

261
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:53,258
Chicken Francaise.

262
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,260
The seared tuna.
    It's incredible.

263
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,861
10 wings, Buffalo style.

264
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,430
Even the bar food's
   over the top.

265
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,631
Gourmet wings.

266
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,399
It's like chicken piccata
   on a stick.

267
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,635
What you don't expect,
  you'll get here.

268
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,737
I do this food because I worked
  in a French restaurant.

269
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,472
You got guys in chef coats.

270
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,341
Dude, you're legit.

271
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:12,243
Chris Hirsh started working in
 the restaurant biz at 14.

272
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,278
Rock and roll.

273
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,013
Got out at 26
 to go into construction.

274
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,748
You're supposed to be
    ordering a cake.

275
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,150
Then his wife, Cass,
  won a kind of lottery

276
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:22,387
the state of Florida runs to
 hand out some liquor licenses.

277
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:25,790
So I said, "Look, you can
 build bars, you're a chef."

278
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,259
Had either of you managed or
owned a restaurant before this?
      No.

279
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:31,363
But they weren't gonna do it
 the standard way, anyway.

280
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:32,864
Pickup.

281
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:36,034
Chris introduced different
  things to these people,

282
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,770
and they just learned to love
   his cuisine.

283
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,438
What does Chris do?
   I don't know,

284
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,340
but it's melt in your mouth
   delicious.

285
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,109
Everything is fresh.

286
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,677
Home cooked, from scratch.

287
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,612
- Peppercorn dressing.
- Makes it himself?

288
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:48,747
He should bottle it, oh, yeah.

289
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,715
Homemade croutons
  from leftover bread.

290
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,050
Wow, those are good croutons.

291
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,119
And look at all the different
  sauces being held.

292
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:55,887
That tartar sauce is legit.

293
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:59,424
That scampi butter with
  shallots, garlic.

294
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,893
I put my juices in, which is
  white wine and lemon juice.

295
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,561
Mm, it's tasty already.

296
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:04,829
And they use it all over
   the place.

297
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,398
Pick up, one mussel.

298
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,401
From mussels Provençal
 to oysters with jalapeños,

299
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:12,370
lemon juice, and a little
  provolone, to escargot.

300
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:15,106
Yeah, this is exactly the
process I thought I'd be finding

301
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,408
when I pulled up to Scully's.

302
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,475
A lot of people pass us by,

303
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:18,743
don't know what
    they're gonna miss.

304
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,712
I looked at the menu, I said,
"Oh, they have escargot."

305
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,247
You find that at every bar
   joint, right?

306
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:24,449
They serve it to you just
  like you would get it

307
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:25,950
in a French restaurant.

308
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,686
Hands down, first time we've
 ever seen escargot on a menu.

309
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,354
But it goes over well?
Fantastic.

310
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,922
People love it?
They love it.

311
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,891
Quit talking, let's get into it.
Let's do it, then.

312
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,392
Let's do it.
The pan's hot, already.

313
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,394
6 mushrooms.

314
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,595
Okay, is this new math,
    'cause you got 7.

315
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,964
There you go. Put a little oil
  in it first

316
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,233
just to get it started.

317
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,704
We take Belgian escargot,

318
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,339
got a little seasoning with
salt and white pepper.

319
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,542
And then as we made earlier,
 our garlic butter.

320
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,610
So, everybody comes to
   temperature together.

321
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,379
We're gonna take out
 our mushrooms.

322
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,114
Take our escargot.

323
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,415
And this is a big seller
    on the menu?

324
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,651
Big time.
You come and have that,

325
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:02,253
a couple appetizers,
 make it a meal.

326
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,755
Oh.

327
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:07,892
We're gonna take a little
 provolone cheese.

328
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,628
Look at that.
 That's pretty well done up.

329
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,498
Mm, nothing like a little snail
   and cheese.

330
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,368
I've had so many escargot
  that are so chewy.

331
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,537
That was so delicate,
   it was like --

332
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,706
It was like buttah.
   Oh, man.

333
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,641
What you getting after,
  a little escargot?

334
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,677
Mm. It's good?
  Excellent.

335
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,748
It's rich, very well-cooked,
 very tender.

336
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,816
Mm. It's so good.

337
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:35,053
I asked for extra garlic,
   and you get it.

338
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:39,124
I didn't see where it said
 <i> Le</i> Sports Bar and<i> Le</i> Pub.

339
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,927
Blackened dolphin.

340
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,230
Gourmet food in a dark bar.

341
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,531
Blue Burger, no fries.

342
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,666
Even their bar food classics...
Chili cheeseburger.

343
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,969
...are done the Scully's way.
10 wings.

344
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:53,238
I mean, I've had wings
  many ways to Sunday.

345
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,040
I have never fried them,
  and then grilled them.

346
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,143
But that's exactly what they're
   doing here.

347
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,645
And what are you having,
  the Oriental Wings?

348
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:01,946
The Garlic and Buffalo.

349
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,882
Scampi Wings and sauce.

350
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,750
All with sauce done Chris's way.

351
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,352
10 wings, Buffalo style.

352
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:09,320
Buffalo wings are hot sauce
   and butter,

353
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,256
and that's it,
  but I'm ready to watch.

354
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:14,526
We're gonna take a gallon of
  hot sauce,

355
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:16,327
half gallon of Worcestershire.

356
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,363
Fresh chopped garlic.
 Whipped butter.

357
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,799
Yeah, roasted wings.
They're all fresh wings.

358
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,433
Like a pterodactyl.
We par-fry 'em.

359
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,702
Put a crunch on 'em.
Yeah.

360
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,871
So you fry 'em,
  then you toss 'em,

361
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:29,274
then you grill 'em,
  then you toss 'em,

362
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,843
then you grill 'em,
  and then you eat 'em.

363
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,946
I love the handle.
  That's a good wing.

364
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:37,849
It has that smoky under flavor.
  Delicious.

365
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,718
I have never tasted any wings
  like this.

366
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,453
Or this.
     Scampi wings.

367
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,523
Scampi wings, take our smashed
 and crushed garlic,

368
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,825
chopped garlic.

369
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:49,093
No oil in the pan?
Not yet.

370
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:52,564
I don't know that
   I've seen this.

371
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,332
Or the sauté with the finger.

372
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,768
Gonna add a little bit of oil.
 Caramelize that.

373
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,970
Now we can start to add
  our butter.

374
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:00,638
So, you let that slowly
   melt down.

375
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,740
How are our wings looking?
What do you think?

376
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:05,143
Crispy?
 Just grill it up,
give it a little flavor.

377
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,744
Sauce is ready?
Let's do it, let's do it.

378
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,246
Wow, you can smell 'em.

379
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,648
Parmesan cheese.

380
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,317
And that's it.

381
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:15,420
Probably gonna get kicked out of
 the national wing-eating club.

382
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,055
Sacrilege.

383
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,891
Mm, I would have just done it
  with regular garlic,

384
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:22,393
but the kicker was
  the caramelized garlic.

385
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,996
Some legit food, brother.
   Legit, legit.

386
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,297
It's delicious.

387
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,899
Got a card special,
 Bleu Burger.

388
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,001
I've had everything on the menu.

389
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,436
You're never gonna be
    disappointed.

390
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:34,272
The thing that makes this place
  work is Chris and Cass,

391
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:35,773
they're great.
This is awesome.

392
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,076
People just love it,
  and they keep coming.

393
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:40,411
The joint that's got two
   pool tables,

394
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,313
people would call it
   a sports bar,

395
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,781
and you're serving escargot.

396
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,217
Yep.
    Fantastic, dude.

397
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,386
Coming up in Queens, New York.

398
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,122
What up?
 Mac and cheese gone atomic.

399
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:52,857
All right, this is now --

400
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,293
And an offer that's
   hard to refuse.

401
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,395
Never seen that coming, baby.

402
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,639
So, I'm right over the bridge
   from Manhattan

403
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:08,640
in Astoria, Queens.

404
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,408
You remember Astoria --

405
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,144
wan area with a lot of history

406
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,879
and a lot of character,
   this is it.

407
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:17,782
And speaking of characters, wait
 till you check out this joint.

408
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,118
I hear it's off the hook.
  This is Queens Comfort.

409
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,757
Captain Crunch chicken fingers,
  table 11.

410
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,958
It's just mind blowing.

411
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,793
The Egg Mc'Ruffin.

412
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,628
I love it.
   This is great.

413
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,030
I mean, it brings you
  back to your childhood.

414
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:33,097
A little bit of nostalgia.

415
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,166
It makes you feel
 like you're a kid again.

416
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:37,902
All the pictures
 on the wall made you feel like

417
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,137
you were at your aunt's house --

418
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,605
your aunt that could cook
   really good.

419
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,140
Brisket mac and cheese,
   table six.

420
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:43,608
The food here is unmatched.

421
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,043
Donnie makes it work
   fantastically.

422
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:47,245
This is Donnie D'Alessio.
     Double "D."

423
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,313
Nice to meet you.

424
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,481
What up?

425
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:54,385
A cat from Queens who traded
 in his low-budget film career

426
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:57,355
to open up this joint in 2011.

427
00:15:57,357 --> 00:16:00,391
And he's had a "Triple D"
drive-by on his mind ever since.

428
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:01,492
This is
 my dream come true.

429
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:02,961
Seriously?
 Yeah.

430
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,096
Are you married, Donnie?
Um...

431
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,965
Okay, I'm not married yet.

432
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,466
I've been in a relationship
 for five years

433
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,002
and I just recently bought
  a ring,

434
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,737
but I haven't proposed yet.
      Very nice.

435
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,539
Probably 'cause he's had
   his hands full

436
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,407
coming up with the out-of-bounds
    dishes

437
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,810
that keeps this place packed.

438
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,578
This is like
an eclectic-funk menu.

439
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,815
Enchiladas and burgers
  and comfort food.

440
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,683
- Chicken and waffles.
- Anything you can imagine.

441
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:28,987
Or Donnie can imagine.

442
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,555
Atomic Fire Balls.

443
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,156
Plus, he's making
 the kind of unique food

444
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,225
that only a kid could dream up.

445
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,728
I got the Atomic Fire Balls.

446
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,696
It's like homemade mac
 and cheese scooped into a ball.

447
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:44,235
They're atomic, but they're
 really, really, really good.

448
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,637
So, now we're making
the Atomic Fire Balls.

449
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,139
Okay.
   All kinds of cheese.

450
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:52,176
We got the Béchamel, here.
This is milk and cream.

451
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,212
When are
   you gonna get engaged?

452
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,114
Oh,
a couple years from now.

453
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:58,950
Man, I wouldn't wait around
  on that one. Okay, we good?

454
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:00,551
Garlic powder.
       Okay.

455
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:01,886
Onion powder.  Onion powder.

456
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,287
Cayenne.

457
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,689
Salt.

458
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,290
Black pepper.

459
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,592
Tabasco.

460
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:08,860
Texas Pete.

461
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,361
Wow, this<i> is</i> spicy.

462
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,996
Sriracha.

463
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,865
Shredded yellow cheddar.

464
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,433
White cheddar.
       Yeah.

465
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,502
Shredded fontina cheese.

466
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:19,070
All right,
so we're gonna whisk this...

467
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,407
Okay.
 So, that's that.

468
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,909
We're gonna add heavy cream
 and the egg yolks.

469
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,677
Gonna whisk that in.

470
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:27,745
Elbow macaroni.

471
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:33,284
Pour it into a hotel pan
 and let it set.

472
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,786
That looks
 like it's gonna be a mess.

473
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:36,554
Try this.

474
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,490
Mmm! That is spicy, though.
     Whoo!

475
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:43,027
Parchment.
    Let it set up.

476
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:45,663
So, now we're gonna make
the egg wash. Eggs, here.

477
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:48,032
Tabasco.

478
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,567
Texas Pete.

479
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,469
Sriracha.
 That's ready to go.

480
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:54,572
All right, so, now we have
 our flour, panko.

481
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,474
Now we're gonna make
  the balls.

482
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,209
Scoop the macaroni.

483
00:17:58,211 --> 00:17:59,844
Form it.

484
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,647
Now you go into the flour,
   into the egg wash...

485
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:05,116
Yeah. Into the panko,
which we also have --

486
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,385
And the panko
   is seasoned with...?
Cayenne.

487
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,820
You deep fry it.

488
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:12,457
So,
  they're out of the fryer.

489
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:13,424
You get five per order.

490
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:16,794
This is the garnish.

491
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,196
Oh, geez.

492
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:19,730
All right,
   this is now obscene.

493
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,801
Mmm! Aw!

494
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,839
I'm gonna have to go back
 for another round of hot yoga.

495
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:30,875
That's crazy.

496
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:34,278
Typically, when you have mac
 and cheese balls, they're dry.

497
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,781
But the fact that you had
  that Béchamel so thick,

498
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,117
you fried them quickly,
  you made them small enough

499
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,085
so the heat could get
   all the way through

500
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,820
without cooking
    all the cheese out.

501
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,155
These things
    are bangin', dude.

502
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:46,824
Well done.

503
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:47,992
Pow!

504
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,760
Fire Balls ready.

505
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:52,864
It's like my mom's mac and
 cheese but with a kick to it.

506
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,999
Clear your sinuses right up.

507
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,767
It's just a great thing to have
  in the neighborhood.

508
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:00,938
Being on this show
has been a dream come true.

509
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,674
It would also be
a dream come true if...

510
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,244
Jill Sirota,
 will you marry me?

511
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:09,147
Yes, of course!

512
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:17,421
Engaged today on "Triple D."

513
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:20,057
Never seen that coming,
     baby!

514
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:25,096
Up next on this full hour of
  amazing appetizers...

515
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:26,464
I'm telling you.
      Thank you.

516
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:27,498
Good eats.

517
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,033
In Paola, Kansas...

518
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,902
A lot of work for
  a chicken wing, man.

519
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:33,804
...a barbecue joint even smoking
   the starters.

520
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:37,508
I've had smoked mozzarella,
 but smoked cream cheese?

521
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,477
And in Vinita, Oklahoma...

522
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,912
Ah!

523
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:42,313
...a down home café...

524
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,581
Look at that right there.

525
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,884
...taking the bull by the
 opposite end of the horns.

526
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,686
Huh?
  Moo, moo, buckaroo.

527
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,027
about 40 miles south of
   Kansas City.

528
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,296
Now, a lot of folks think of
  this as cattle country,

529
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,498
but you might change your mind
  after you try some of

530
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,634
the tasty pork at
   the BBQ Shack.

531
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:04,902
Order up!

532
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,838
From whole hogs
  to racks of ribs.

533
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,874
Fantastic.
   It's go big...

534
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,843
Look at that!
 ...or go home at this joint.

535
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,345
Just get into it?
  Yeah.

536
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,646
And you can eat the whole thing?

537
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,114
Come back in an hour.
   Order up!

538
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:21,085
It was a big gamble that paid
 off big for Rick Schoenberger.

539
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,621
Got the barbecue blood flowing.
   You barbecue, right.

540
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:27,225
Who left a corporate job to turn
 his hobby into his business.

541
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,360
Now, he's firing up
  the monster smoker...

542
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:32,430
Figure out what you need and get
the next step bigger.

543
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,633
...cranking out burnt ends,
  homemade sausage,

544
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:38,402
and even loading the smoker
  with chicken wings.

545
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,271
That's a mess of wings.
   They're good.

546
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:42,006
They're the best chicken wings
    around.

547
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:45,409
Most people just take 'em,
  fry 'em, sauce 'em,

548
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,478
but you're gonna season 'em,
   smoke 'em,

549
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,813
and then fry 'em to order.

550
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,014
Then we deep fry them to order.

551
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:53,384
We'll just take some of this
rub, dump it right on.

552
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,553
And a little of this?
 Now, this is the secret kicker?

553
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,989
Throw some of them peppers
 in there, too.

554
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:00,658
Dried chipotles, 'cause these
 are dried, smoked jalapeños.

555
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,827
Put a nice little kick on it.

556
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:04,262
How long do these go on the
   smoker for?

557
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,097
Probably a couple hours.

558
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:09,884
Really? A lot of work for
   a chicken wing, man.

559
00:21:09,886 --> 00:21:12,820
t iteytake --
Oh, maybe a minute.ours.

560
00:21:12,822 --> 00:21:14,021
Looks like they're ready.

561
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,856
All that seasoning still
   stays on?

562
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,258
Yeah.

563
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,560
Yeah, it's cooked into 'em out
   there on the smoker.

564
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:23,364
You get that smoke
  right off the bat.

565
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:24,732
Yeah.
Wow, this is good.

566
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:26,534
Good stuff, brother,
 I'm telling you.

567
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:29,570
Thank you.
Good eats.

568
00:21:29,572 --> 00:21:31,539
I think it's the best place
  in Paola to eat.

569
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,708
Just real friendly, just that
  kind of atmosphere.

570
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,911
And the kind of place
  where the smoker's

571
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:40,614
always smoking with everything
 from whole hog to ribs...

572
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:42,316
Fantastic.
  ...to brisket...

573
00:21:42,318 --> 00:21:45,453
It's real tender.
 ...and now jalapeño poppers --

574
00:21:45,455 --> 00:21:46,587
the way they were done

575
00:21:46,589 --> 00:21:48,589
before the chain restaurants got
   a hold of 'em.

576
00:21:48,591 --> 00:21:50,257
Where do all the peppers
   come from?

577
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:52,159
These particular ones
I grew in my garden.

578
00:21:52,161 --> 00:21:57,698
We actually just core the seeds,
the insides of the jalapeño.

579
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,367
Okay, so you take the top off.

580
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:01,836
Yeah, core the jalapeños
with the chili twister.

581
00:22:01,838 --> 00:22:04,505
Now, tell me about this
    cream cheese thing.

582
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:09,076
Okay. Take just your standard
 cream cheese

583
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:12,179
and just squeeze a little bit
into each one of them peppers.

584
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:15,049
That enough?
Yeah, that's probably good.

585
00:22:15,051 --> 00:22:16,584
We'll take it a step further.

586
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:20,254
I use a water chestnut
 marinated overnight

587
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:24,058
in a little brown sugar
 and some soy sauce.

588
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,794
I have seen some funny things to
   stuff a pepper with,

589
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:29,430
but this might be the top of it,
    a water chestnut.

590
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:33,034
And then some more cheese?

591
00:22:33,036 --> 00:22:35,736
All right, now we're ready
 for the baking.

592
00:22:35,738 --> 00:22:38,005
Try to get your beginning and
 end to meet in the same spot?

593
00:22:38,007 --> 00:22:39,340
That'd be a good thing.

594
00:22:39,342 --> 00:22:41,108
And then go right through
     the center.

595
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,077
And now we're gonna sprinkle
    the dry rub --

596
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,545
the universal dry rub?

597
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:48,049
Just a little bit, kind of use
 it like paprika

598
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:49,717
to give a little
 nice appearance.

599
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:51,452
Just dust it, add some color.
Yeah.

600
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:54,155
Now these go in the barbecue.
  Yep, right on the smoker.

601
00:22:56,392 --> 00:22:59,660
Look at those.

602
00:22:59,662 --> 00:23:01,695
Those are like mondo popper.

603
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:05,099
I've had smoked brie,

604
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:08,636
I've had smoked mozzarella,
 but smoked cream cheese?

605
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,908
Those are fresh peppers.

606
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,177
Brother, that's wicked hot.

607
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:17,611
It is.
   Great flavor.

608
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:19,313
Like everything
  Rick's rolling out.

609
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,115
Just really good, really good.

610
00:23:21,117 --> 00:23:23,184
He really is the real deal.

611
00:23:23,186 --> 00:23:27,988
The rub, the smoke,
  all done low and slow.

612
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,790
And it's the same every time,
     wonderful.

613
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,426
I've had everything.
You've run the menu?

614
00:23:32,428 --> 00:23:33,994
I eat here a lot.

615
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,529
Out goes the old theory of

616
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:37,631
cooking them
  cools them down, huh?

617
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:40,468
That's right.
 Seasoned peppers are hot. Wow!

618
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,236
Welcome to Vinita, Oklahoma,

619
00:23:42,238 --> 00:23:44,472
about an hour northeast of Tulsa
  in cattle country.

620
00:23:44,474 --> 00:23:46,474
Now, we're heading to a place
  called Clantons,

621
00:23:46,476 --> 00:23:49,009
a family-owned joint
  for over 80 years.

622
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,845
Famous for their
  chicken-fried steak,

623
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:52,580
and another
  cattle country delicacy

624
00:23:52,582 --> 00:23:54,648
you just got to check out.

625
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,850
Ever had calf fries?

626
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:57,118
I've not had any calf fries

627
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,053
anywhere else in a restaurant
     like these.

628
00:23:59,055 --> 00:24:00,888
Cat fries?
      Calf.

629
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:03,224
Some places know 'em as
  Rocky Mountain oysters.

630
00:24:03,226 --> 00:24:05,025
Others don't know 'em at all.

631
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:07,194
They come from the underside
   of the calf.

632
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,362
Mm.

633
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,097
They say -- when you're a
  first-time customer,

634
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:11,432
they send out a free order.

635
00:24:11,434 --> 00:24:14,068
They're a classic here, along
 with chicken-fried steak.

636
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,903
And they do use
the good seasonings.

637
00:24:15,905 --> 00:24:17,138
And chicken and dressing.

638
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,572
It's just like my mom
 would have made.

639
00:24:18,574 --> 00:24:22,843
Country favorites --
  and a local favorite.

640
00:24:22,845 --> 00:24:25,579
In the same family
  for four generations,

641
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:28,149
starting with a guy named
   Sweet Tater.

642
00:24:28,151 --> 00:24:29,717
My great-grandfather.
Sweet Tater.

643
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,785
Sweet Tater.
 'Cause he was
a sweet potato farmer.

644
00:24:31,787 --> 00:24:33,187
Wasn't making a living at it.

645
00:24:33,189 --> 00:24:35,422
So, he said he was gonna
open up his own restaurant.

646
00:24:35,424 --> 00:24:37,124
And 80 years later,
   Dennis Patrick

647
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:39,093
and his wife, Melissa --
  she's a Clanton --

648
00:24:39,095 --> 00:24:40,394
are keeping it rolling.

649
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,762
Chicken-fried chicken ready?

650
00:24:41,764 --> 00:24:44,031
They took over
  almost ten years ago

651
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:46,066
when Melissa's
  parents retired.

652
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,469
We were both pretty
 busy in the corporate world,

653
00:24:48,471 --> 00:24:50,504
and our kids were getting into
  high-school age,

654
00:24:50,506 --> 00:24:53,340
junior high age, and we said,
   "We're coming back."

655
00:24:53,342 --> 00:24:54,708
Nice.

656
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,043
Iced tea, got it.

657
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:58,212
Real friendly people,
   great food.

658
00:24:58,214 --> 00:25:00,181
It's just a nice, homey place.

659
00:25:00,183 --> 00:25:02,483
A homey place where their
  home cooking knows

660
00:25:02,485 --> 00:25:04,251
homemade calf fries.

661
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,654
The governor and his
  wife come in here.

662
00:25:06,656 --> 00:25:08,155
She loves 'em.

663
00:25:08,157 --> 00:25:10,824
"You have the best
 calf fries in Oklahoma"?

664
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:13,594
That is the first lady of
Oklahoma telling you that.

665
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:17,431
Here we have Oklahoma's finest
   calf fries.

666
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,567
Where does one
 harvest these?

667
00:25:19,569 --> 00:25:22,570
From the underside of a calf,
   actually.

668
00:25:22,572 --> 00:25:23,871
Agh!

669
00:25:23,873 --> 00:25:25,573
Yeah, the batter's gonna matter.

670
00:25:25,575 --> 00:25:27,308
Chicken base,
    ground mustard,

671
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,176
a little salt and pepper
     in here.

672
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:30,778
Just pour that in there.
The whole thing?

673
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,047
Yes, sir.
It's chunky.

674
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:34,481
Well, it's buttermilk.

675
00:25:34,483 --> 00:25:36,817
With a cornmeal,
  cayenne flour dredge.

676
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:38,586
Cayenne, kill it, kill it.

677
00:25:38,588 --> 00:25:40,487
Now we just dump 'em
    in the deep fryer.

678
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:42,656
See, they didn't even scream.

679
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,860
You got to be right in my face
  with this, don't you?

680
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,435
Not bad.
  Not really good.

681
00:25:54,437 --> 00:25:56,904
Got any hot sauce?

682
00:25:56,906 --> 00:25:58,505
Digging it with the blue cheese.

683
00:25:58,507 --> 00:26:03,777
Chicken-fried calf fries,
  Buffalo wing style.

684
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,246
Hot.

685
00:26:05,248 --> 00:26:06,547
That was good.

686
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:08,616
I don't know that I like
  the big ones yet.

687
00:26:08,618 --> 00:26:10,217
Look at that right there.
    Huh?

688
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:12,086
Moo moo, buckaroo.

689
00:26:12,088 --> 00:26:13,821
Calf fries, you need ketchup
 with those fries?

690
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:16,624
Do they ever do, like,
  calf fries ceviche

691
00:26:16,626 --> 00:26:18,892
or calf fries
  on the half shell?

692
00:26:20,196 --> 00:26:21,762
How did you like the calf fries?

693
00:26:21,764 --> 00:26:23,697
We were anxious to see how you
   liked them.

694
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:26,233
They were very unique.
  I like smaller ones better.

695
00:26:26,235 --> 00:26:28,469
I did -- a couple that I had
 were very big.

696
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:30,804
Were very, like --
the whole family was there.

697
00:26:32,108 --> 00:26:35,909
We pride ourselves on carrying
    over the tradition

698
00:26:35,911 --> 00:26:38,379
that started actually
    80 years ago.

699
00:26:38,381 --> 00:26:40,047
And not just
  the calf fries --

700
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:41,615
they're keeping everything
   classic.

701
00:26:41,617 --> 00:26:43,050
Two iced teas.

702
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:45,586
With down home favorites like
   fried catfish,

703
00:26:45,588 --> 00:26:48,055
homemade apple pie,
  and Clanton's legendary

704
00:26:48,057 --> 00:26:49,490
chicken and dressing.

705
00:26:49,492 --> 00:26:51,392
How you doing?

706
00:26:51,394 --> 00:26:53,227
And for the folks
  in this small town,

707
00:26:53,229 --> 00:26:55,262
Clanton's has been kind of
   an extension of

708
00:26:55,264 --> 00:26:57,665
their own dining room
 as far back as they remember.

709
00:26:57,667 --> 00:26:59,066
Appreciate y'all
     coming in.

710
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:02,303
Everybody kind of gets together,
and they know one another.

711
00:27:02,305 --> 00:27:03,704
It's nice.

712
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,572
It's like sitting at
   mama's table.

713
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,774
Is it, really?
    Yes.

714
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:10,811
Every day, every dish,
 for everyone of 80 years.

715
00:27:10,813 --> 00:27:13,247
Like you'd get at home.
Just a real savory taste.

716
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:14,715
A few more minutes.

717
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:17,484
I've ate here ever since
 I've been 6, 7 years old,

718
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:19,153
that's where I've always come.

719
00:27:19,155 --> 00:27:20,921
Thank you.
    Have a good day.

720
00:27:20,923 --> 00:27:23,023
Your order of calf fries are
coming out right now.

721
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:24,625
Oh, super.
  How many you have?

722
00:27:24,627 --> 00:27:26,760
You got to evolve.
 People are always changing,

723
00:27:26,762 --> 00:27:28,595
except they'll say,
  "Hey, that's great.

724
00:27:28,597 --> 00:27:30,998
Let's try that on the menu.
 Let's put something fancy

725
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,334
on that, but I'm gonna eat
 my chicken-fried steak."

726
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:34,968
You get emotional about this?

727
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,538
I do.
    I love this place.

728
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,406
Coming up in Atlanta, Georgia...

729
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,507
Gosh, that's good.

730
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:42,009
...we're bellying up the bar...

731
00:27:42,011 --> 00:27:44,578
appetizer menu you
  Gwouldn't expect..

732
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,113
Jerk chili?
    Yeah.

733
00:27:52,054 --> 00:27:53,687
You know, finding great bar food

734
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:56,523
is way more than just a menu --
 it's a whole experience,

735
00:27:56,525 --> 00:27:59,159
like here in Atlanta at
 this joint, The Highlander.

736
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:01,195
It's a dive bar in a strip mall.

737
00:28:01,197 --> 00:28:02,763
Now, they're heavy on tattoos,

738
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:06,066
but serious about
  scratch cooking.

739
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:07,668
Cheers!
     Cheers!

740
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,236
Everybody here is
 really twisted.

741
00:28:09,238 --> 00:28:10,804
Who's got the chili
   and fritters?

742
00:28:10,806 --> 00:28:12,906
The food here is so much better
than it needs to be.

743
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:14,608
Look at the menu --
   oxtail soup.

744
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,243
You see that on every
    drive through.

745
00:28:16,245 --> 00:28:18,112
It's awesome bar food.
It's very fresh.

746
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:20,147
Wow, you got it going on with
   this, man.

747
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:21,849
Excellent.
It's a neighborhood place.

748
00:28:21,851 --> 00:28:24,218
Has been since '92...
You want a cider, right?

749
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,719
when Jeff Merback and some
  buddies took a chance

750
00:28:25,721 --> 00:28:28,138
and opened up in a strip mall.

751
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,373
Anrear 16 years later.

752
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,641
That's your brand, right? mall.

753
00:28:30,643 --> 00:28:32,376
Like being the place
  that's still open

754
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:33,577
at the end of a long night.

755
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,579
More Jaegers, absolutely.

756
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:38,982
We knew our clientele was gonna
  be bartenders, waiters,

757
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:41,902
waitresses, cooks, and I
  couldn't throw out

758
00:28:41,904 --> 00:28:45,072
Ibrahim Garba Jahumpa.

759
00:28:45,074 --> 00:28:46,940
Oh, so let's just
 go with Ice.

760
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:48,776
Ice, yeah.
  French dip, there you go.

761
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:50,978
When he became our kitchen
 manager, he brought

762
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,846
his personality
to our special board.

763
00:28:52,848 --> 00:28:54,581
Every day, something's
   different.

764
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:55,883
They have a lot of things here

765
00:28:55,885 --> 00:28:57,851
that a lot of places
in Atlanta don't have.

766
00:28:57,853 --> 00:29:00,287
This week, our specialty is
oxtail soup and curried goat.

767
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:02,589
I'd walk right by here and
 think, "Mm, curried goat."

768
00:29:02,591 --> 00:29:06,427
And for a starter, there's a cup
  of this with a twist.

769
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:08,295
Jerk chili?
    Yeah.

770
00:29:08,297 --> 00:29:10,030
It's the best bowl of chili
     in town.

771
00:29:10,032 --> 00:29:11,331
What makes it jerk?

772
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,133
There's a jerk marinade that we
     add to it.

773
00:29:13,135 --> 00:29:14,701
I mean, just because you're
 cooking it with me

774
00:29:14,703 --> 00:29:16,370
doesn't make it jerk, right?
  No, no, no, ground beef.

775
00:29:16,372 --> 00:29:19,740
80/20?
Yeah, and spicy Italian sausage.

776
00:29:19,742 --> 00:29:21,241
So, this cooks to nice
     and brown.

777
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:22,843
Onions, yellow, red.

778
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,611
Yellow peppers, red pepper,
    green pepper.

779
00:29:24,613 --> 00:29:25,813
I like the colors.

780
00:29:25,815 --> 00:29:27,047
Now we add the kidney beans,

781
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:28,682
black beans,
   and the peeled tomato.

782
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:29,783
No garlic, though?

783
00:29:29,785 --> 00:29:31,185
The garlic is coming
 in a second.

784
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:32,453
All right, just making sure.

785
00:29:32,455 --> 00:29:34,588
This looks like about the entire
   spice counter.

786
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,990
So, that is the veggie base.

787
00:29:36,992 --> 00:29:38,625
Chicken stock.
The habaneros?

788
00:29:38,627 --> 00:29:40,160
Habaneros.
    Roasted garlic.

789
00:29:40,162 --> 00:29:42,396
Oh, I like that call.
Your jerk seasoning?

790
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:44,097
Can I taste it?
 Not too spicy.

791
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:45,532
Spiced rum, tomato paste.

792
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,836
We just gonna mix everything
    that's in here.

793
00:29:48,838 --> 00:29:50,971
Now, he's happy now,
     you know.

794
00:29:50,973 --> 00:29:53,340
Everybody move back.
That's nice.

795
00:29:53,342 --> 00:29:55,676
Have that in a holster, maybe
 wear it on a --

796
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,946
Put that in my bag.

797
00:29:58,948 --> 00:30:01,615
This goes in our cauldron of
 beans and peppers.

798
00:30:01,617 --> 00:30:02,816
Want me to scrape?
    Sure.

799
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,451
I mean, if we're gonna be
     same team.

800
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:08,589
Brown sugar, black pepper,
thyme, onion powder, mustard.

801
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:10,791
Dry mustard, garlic powder,
     bay leaf.

802
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:14,061
Right, color.

803
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:15,762
Cilantro.
   Cilantro.

804
00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:18,232
Okay, red chili flake,
    celery seed.

805
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:19,666
The allspice.
  So, there's your Jamaican.

806
00:30:19,668 --> 00:30:20,868
A little white pepper.

807
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,836
White pepper, cumin,
   chili powder.

808
00:30:22,838 --> 00:30:24,271
Round it out with the cayenne.

809
00:30:24,273 --> 00:30:26,073
Wow. So, now how long we
  gonna let that simmer for?

810
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,574
A couple hours.

811
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,177
Big chunks of meat,
  still see all the colors.

812
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:31,879
Gosh, that's good.

813
00:30:31,881 --> 00:30:33,313
That's got a little heat to it.

814
00:30:33,315 --> 00:30:35,215
Great spice, great color,
   great textures.

815
00:30:35,217 --> 00:30:36,383
That's good chili.

816
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:38,685
Dude, is the chili legit?
Outstanding.

817
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:40,521
It's meaty,
    lots of nice spice.

818
00:30:40,523 --> 00:30:41,755
Crazy dependable food.

819
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,323
Crazy dependable food.

820
00:30:43,325 --> 00:30:44,558
There's some chips,
    ready to roll.

821
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,160
The fish specials
 are always amazing.

822
00:30:47,162 --> 00:30:50,330
There's a wonderful caprese
salad that I really dig.

823
00:30:50,332 --> 00:30:53,534
Marinated lime chicken, it's got
really refreshing lime marinade.

824
00:30:53,536 --> 00:30:55,369
Mussels, the corn fritters.

825
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:57,271
Those are huge.
 They're like golf ball size.

826
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:59,473
Served up with
  The Highlander's

827
00:30:59,475 --> 00:31:01,074
roasted red pepper remoulade.

828
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:03,577
I like the remoulade sauce
 'cause I'm from Louisiana.

829
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:04,912
Mm, I like it, man.

830
00:31:04,914 --> 00:31:07,447
I got to make myself a note
    on that remoulade.

831
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,249
It's spicy and delicious.

832
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:11,118
And seriously in demand.

833
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,653
Potato skins are up.

834
00:31:12,655 --> 00:31:14,955
Like everything here.
Turkey sandwich with a salad.

835
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:17,524
'Cause a lot of folks'll
  tell you that this is

836
00:31:17,526 --> 00:31:19,960
their first choice for
 eating out and hanging out.

837
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,929
Who's dry?
   This food is nothing

838
00:31:21,931 --> 00:31:23,931
if you don't have the atmosphere
    going with it.

839
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:25,566
Jaeger?
 All night, coming right up.

840
00:31:25,568 --> 00:31:27,234
From mohawks just down
   to yuppies.

841
00:31:27,236 --> 00:31:30,237
It is the epitome of where
 you're allowed to be yourself.

842
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:31,772
Everybody's welcome here.

843
00:31:31,774 --> 00:31:33,140
It's a twisted Cheers.

844
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:34,708
Ally's on it.

845
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,610
People would come here to drink,
    anyway,

846
00:31:36,612 --> 00:31:38,645
and you get a great menu of
  food on top of it.

847
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,280
Even the bar basics.

848
00:31:40,282 --> 00:31:41,515
Nachos coming out.

849
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:43,050
With that Jamaican jerk chili.

850
00:31:43,052 --> 00:31:44,918
Tonight, I'm eating the loaded
    potato skins.

851
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,620
Mini burgers they're calling
   sliders.

852
00:31:46,622 --> 00:31:48,522
Chicken quesadilla,
 I love them.

853
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:51,224
Spicy buffalo or Jamaican
  jerk chicken wings.

854
00:31:51,226 --> 00:31:53,060
Bar food,
  you don't expect much,

855
00:31:53,062 --> 00:31:55,228
but here, they give you it made
   from scratch.

856
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,664
Even the bar staple
  mozzarella stick.

857
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,800
Here, it's wrapped in pasta.

858
00:31:59,802 --> 00:32:02,269
They're much better than normal
    mozzarella sticks.

859
00:32:02,271 --> 00:32:04,838
It just adds a little
   something extra to it.

860
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,441
I'm gonna make an egg wash, egg
yolk, a little bit of water.

861
00:32:07,443 --> 00:32:08,542
Whoa, whoa, whoa, just yolks?

862
00:32:08,544 --> 00:32:09,910
I've never seen it done
     this way.

863
00:32:09,912 --> 00:32:11,845
I've never seen it done this way
 until I came here.

864
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,747
Until you came here.
This is the breading.

865
00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:15,682
We're going to add Italian
 seasoning to it.

866
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,185
Sheeted egg pasta, brush it with
 a little bit of the egg wash.

867
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:20,487
Just like that.
 That's it, just one rollover.

868
00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:22,189
Yeah. Yeah, now we're gonna
 dip it in the --

869
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:24,424
Wash again.
  And then the bread crumb.

870
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:26,493
I like this.
  Now we're gonna fry 'em?

871
00:32:26,495 --> 00:32:28,261
So, does the pasta get crunchy
    on the outside?

872
00:32:28,263 --> 00:32:29,296
Yes.
Oh.

873
00:32:29,298 --> 00:32:30,597
What are we gonna serve
  with these?

874
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:31,932
The marinara sauce.
Marinara sauce.

875
00:32:31,934 --> 00:32:34,501
Scratch made with roasted
   garlic, onions,

876
00:32:34,503 --> 00:32:36,903
peppers, red wine, herbs,
   and spices.

877
00:32:36,905 --> 00:32:38,372
Wow, those look good!

878
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,641
Wow.

879
00:32:40,643 --> 00:32:43,143
I'm impressed.

880
00:32:43,145 --> 00:32:44,478
That's great, man.

881
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,279
The sheet around it makes it
   hold together,

882
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:48,148
gives it a nice texture --
  that's tasty, man.

883
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,350
Those are bananas.
   These are delicious.

884
00:32:50,352 --> 00:32:52,052
Everyone loves this food.

885
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:55,355
He is as good for this place
   as any of us.

886
00:32:55,357 --> 00:32:57,758
Atlanta has better bar food
  than any city deserves,

887
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,960
and The Highlander is one of
  the best in town.

888
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:02,562
You come here, and it's just
comfort -- comfort food.

889
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:03,964
Whatever the hour.

890
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:05,866
Roll in, hang out,
 have a blast.

891
00:33:05,868 --> 00:33:06,900
You got food coming.

892
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,335
It's supposed to be a bar,

893
00:33:08,337 --> 00:33:09,603
but it's not bar food.

894
00:33:09,605 --> 00:33:10,871
Southern comfort food,
 all the way.

895
00:33:10,873 --> 00:33:13,473
You still like each other?
 Oh, yeah.

896
00:33:13,475 --> 00:33:15,075
Anybody got a Highlander tattoo?

897
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:17,511
Not one I can show you.

898
00:33:17,513 --> 00:33:18,912
Up next...

899
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,180
Opa!

900
00:33:20,182 --> 00:33:21,281
In Dundalk, Maryland...

901
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:23,517
You are the quintessential
   diner dude.

902
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,819
Real deal Greek.

903
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:26,887
That is killer.

904
00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:28,689
Just like Yia Yia made it.

905
00:33:28,691 --> 00:33:31,091
Your Yia Yia should be very,
 very impressed with that.

906
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:32,893
And in Belmar, New Jersey...

907
00:33:32,895 --> 00:33:35,629
Mm!
   Mm, mm, mm!

908
00:33:35,631 --> 00:33:37,064
...a bar food classic...

909
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:39,766
These are rockin'.
 ...getting a Mexican makeover.

910
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:40,801
Got to come try these wings.

911
00:33:45,507 --> 00:33:47,207
You know, I think we've figured
   it out by now.

912
00:33:47,209 --> 00:33:49,276
Some of the greatest diners
 we've seen on "Triple D"

913
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,311
are owned by Greek families.

914
00:33:51,313 --> 00:33:54,448
I mean, it's the passion
 for food, the strong family,

915
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,116
and fueled by tradition.

916
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,451
And this one's no different.

917
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:59,152
Here we are in Dundalk,
   Maryland,

918
00:33:59,154 --> 00:34:01,922
right outside of Baltimore --
 this is the Boulevard Dinner.

919
00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:05,425
Spinach Pie up.
Brown gravy on that.

920
00:34:05,427 --> 00:34:07,094
It's like a landmark here.

921
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,531
This is the go-to joint.
      Oh, yeah.

922
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:13,433
Sour beef and dumplings.

923
00:34:13,435 --> 00:34:17,604
Perfected over years by
 owner Marc Tsakiris's granddad.

924
00:34:17,606 --> 00:34:21,641
Your grandfather has
 a diner back in the day.

925
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,477
It was called the --
House of Neptune.

926
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:25,145
Seafood diner?
Crab house.

927
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:26,780
Some of the old school
   menu items

928
00:34:26,782 --> 00:34:28,682
that he did there, you guys
   still do here.

929
00:34:28,684 --> 00:34:32,018
Yes.
Boiled crab cakes in the window.

930
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,821
So, it was an easy choice
 when the pre-med student

931
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:37,090
got a shot at running
  his own diner --

932
00:34:37,092 --> 00:34:38,291
Spinach pie up!

933
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:40,660
On, get this,
  the same family lot.

934
00:34:44,633 --> 00:34:46,399
This is just part of
  your family make up.

935
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:47,734
Part of my family
 make up, yes.

936
00:34:47,736 --> 00:34:49,035
What's the favorite thing
    on the menu?

937
00:34:49,037 --> 00:34:50,303
Yia Yia's grape leaves.

938
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:53,273
It's a rice and a beef mixture.

939
00:34:53,275 --> 00:34:54,508
They're great.

940
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,209
And that makes 'em very special.

941
00:34:56,211 --> 00:34:58,712
Yia Yia is grandma?
Yes.

942
00:34:58,714 --> 00:35:01,081
It's my grandmother,
and these are a family recipe

943
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:03,483
that comes from Greece.
They're actually called --

944
00:35:03,485 --> 00:35:05,585
-- we just call
them stuffed grape leaves here.

945
00:35:05,587 --> 00:35:08,522
So, we're gonna start with our
ground pork and beef,

946
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:10,157
fresh scallions, fresh dill --

947
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:12,225
Copious amounts of that, huh?

948
00:35:12,227 --> 00:35:15,095
Yes. Chopped white onion,

949
00:35:15,097 --> 00:35:17,497
and then we're gonna add
 some garlic powder,

950
00:35:17,499 --> 00:35:19,366
salt, and a little
 black pepper.

951
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:21,134
We're gonna have some rice.

952
00:35:21,136 --> 00:35:22,235
Sands of the hour glass.

953
00:35:22,237 --> 00:35:23,470
And we're gonna mix it up.

954
00:35:27,309 --> 00:35:28,942
Mm, I smell that dill,
    it's awesome.

955
00:35:28,944 --> 00:35:31,845
Okay, right now we're gonna make
our tomato puree sauce.

956
00:35:31,847 --> 00:35:33,880
We're gonna start with some
butter, melt that in there.

957
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:37,150
We're gonna add olive oil.

958
00:35:37,152 --> 00:35:39,019
We're gonna add some
 tomato puree.

959
00:35:39,021 --> 00:35:42,189
Cook it all the way down,
  and this all goes in with

960
00:35:42,191 --> 00:35:44,191
Yia Yia's
    grape leaf mixture.

961
00:35:44,193 --> 00:35:45,826
Yes, sir, we're gonna
 dump that in.

962
00:35:45,828 --> 00:35:48,328
Smell the magic in there.
Did you put magic in there, too?

963
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:49,396
I didn't even hear it.

964
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:51,431
So, now we've got this mixed up,
    now what up?

965
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:53,166
Roll 'em up.
  Grape leaf.

966
00:35:53,168 --> 00:35:54,901
Take this stem
 off the back here.

967
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,436
Get a little portion on,

968
00:35:56,438 --> 00:35:59,139
and we roll the back first,
 then the side.

969
00:35:59,141 --> 00:36:00,907
Then all the way.
  You got it.

970
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,143
Yours is a jumbo,
but you're a natural.

971
00:36:03,145 --> 00:36:04,911
When you were a kid, and you'd
  go to your Yia Yia's house,

972
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,580
you'd make these?
She would.

973
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:08,849
Now everybody in my family
gets me to make 'em for 'em.

974
00:36:08,851 --> 00:36:11,551
So, you're the one --
I am the<i> dolmade</i> man.

975
00:36:11,553 --> 00:36:13,019
Now, this into here?

976
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:15,388
Yes, but first we're gonna
line the bottom of the pan

977
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,823
with some grape leaves, also.

978
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:18,959
An old Greek trick, I guess,

979
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:22,529
so that we don't burn the bottom
portion of the grape leaves.

980
00:36:22,531 --> 00:36:24,397
So, you can just stack 'em
   on top of each other?

981
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:26,399
We're gonna stack 'em neatly.
It's gonna go this way.

982
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:28,635
So, they're in.
Now, we're gonna add

983
00:36:28,637 --> 00:36:31,238
some olive oil first, and we're
gonna add lemon juice.

984
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,506
And usually, we use
a full bottle just because

985
00:36:33,508 --> 00:36:35,542
this is where all
the flavor comes from.

986
00:36:35,544 --> 00:36:38,245
It gets saturated into the grape
leaf, and that's what you want.

987
00:36:38,247 --> 00:36:39,679
And a little bit of water.

988
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:41,748
And we're gonna cover this.
    Where's the lid?

989
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,516
Where's the lid?
   Just went into robot.

990
00:36:43,518 --> 00:36:45,619
So, we've put the pie pan down,

991
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:48,088
and we put this to
 weigh it down.

992
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,623
That keeps pressure
    on the whole mix?

993
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,424
Keeps the pressure on so
 everything doesn't

994
00:36:51,426 --> 00:36:53,426
blow up in there, and then
we're gonna put our lid.

995
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:55,061
Keeping all the steam inside.
That's it.

996
00:36:55,063 --> 00:36:56,730
Wow, that fits snug.
Oh, yes.

997
00:36:59,534 --> 00:37:01,001
I use it as a shield.

998
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:04,604
Simmer probably for about
   an hour.

999
00:37:04,606 --> 00:37:06,072
They're done.

1000
00:37:06,074 --> 00:37:08,041
We usually put five out.

1001
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:09,743
We also have a sauce
   with it, too.

1002
00:37:09,745 --> 00:37:11,645
We're gonna put our chicken
   stock down.

1003
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:14,047
We're gonna let that go roux
  to that, and raw eggs.

1004
00:37:14,049 --> 00:37:15,815
And a little lemon.

1005
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,250
And that's gonna be the sauce?

1006
00:37:17,252 --> 00:37:18,852
That's gonna be the sauce
we're gonna put on top

1007
00:37:18,854 --> 00:37:20,020
when we present it.
      Awesome.

1008
00:37:20,022 --> 00:37:21,621
Cracked pepper,
 and we're set.

1009
00:37:21,623 --> 00:37:23,757
That's all she wrote.
That's all she wrote.

1010
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:28,461
Dude, that is killer.

1011
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:31,498
The grape leaf just really wraps
  around it nice and tight.

1012
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,099
I think people look at it
  and go, "Ooh, grape leaf,

1013
00:37:33,101 --> 00:37:34,501
I don't know if I want to eat
    a grape leaf."

1014
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:35,869
That's the thing, yeah.
    It's tender.

1015
00:37:35,871 --> 00:37:37,504
You got the lemon juice eggnog
 sauce that you put on there.

1016
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:39,806
You got the texture of
    the beef, the rice.

1017
00:37:39,808 --> 00:37:41,474
All the flavors locked
    right inside.

1018
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:43,176
Right.
 I'd get in trouble with these.

1019
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,477
Outstanding.

1020
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:47,147
Your Yia Yia should be very,
  very impressed with that.

1021
00:37:47,149 --> 00:37:49,649
I could seriously --
   I'll have those to go.

1022
00:37:49,651 --> 00:37:50,917
Great.

1023
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:53,153
Nice job.

1024
00:37:53,155 --> 00:37:55,322
The feeling has to be nice
   and moist.

1025
00:37:55,324 --> 00:37:56,690
Not soggy.
   Exactly.

1026
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:58,692
I've had grape leaves elsewhere,
   but these are the best.

1027
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:01,127
This is real deal food.
     Oh, real deal.

1028
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,864
Chicken souvlaki.

1029
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,701
The menu has pretty much
 got everything you want.

1030
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:09,936
This is not a menu.
    This is a book.

1031
00:38:09,938 --> 00:38:11,905
It's a book.
   Dude, it's enormous.

1032
00:38:11,907 --> 00:38:14,641
It's a shield.
     It's a hat.

1033
00:38:14,643 --> 00:38:17,410
It's wings.

1034
00:38:17,412 --> 00:38:18,812
I absolutely love it.

1035
00:38:18,814 --> 00:38:21,548
Cool place. Yeah, I see why
 the tradition's going well.

1036
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,984
You're rocking it out.
 You are definitely a character.

1037
00:38:23,986 --> 00:38:26,353
You are the quintessential
     diner dude.

1038
00:38:26,355 --> 00:38:27,754
Diner dude!

1039
00:38:27,756 --> 00:38:29,956
On "Triple D," when I say
   New Jersey,

1040
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:33,360
I know what you're thinking --
 you're thinking diner capital.

1041
00:38:33,362 --> 00:38:34,627
Along with those great diners,

1042
00:38:34,629 --> 00:38:36,196
they got some funky
   little joints

1043
00:38:36,198 --> 00:38:37,897
like the one
 I'm here to visit today.

1044
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:41,601
45 minutes south of New York
 City in Belmar, New Jersey,

1045
00:38:41,603 --> 00:38:43,670
this is
 10th Avenue Burrito Company.

1046
00:38:43,672 --> 00:38:45,105
Smothered burrito.

1047
00:38:45,107 --> 00:38:47,440
Smothered in chipotle cream
sauce, absolutely phenomenal.

1048
00:38:47,442 --> 00:38:49,476
Chicken tortilla soup.
   It is the best.

1049
00:38:49,478 --> 00:38:51,878
This, to me, is like food
  that we find in California.

1050
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,380
Firing a corn soup.

1051
00:38:53,382 --> 00:38:56,249
'Cause that's where Jersey boy
  Brian Katz fell in love

1052
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,884
with this kind of Mexican food.

1053
00:38:57,886 --> 00:38:59,252
Firing pork mole.

1054
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,720
And learned to cook, too.

1055
00:39:00,722 --> 00:39:02,822
Went for a job one day, and I've
 been in the kitchen ever since.

1056
00:39:02,824 --> 00:39:04,491
And after decades
   in the biz...

1057
00:39:04,493 --> 00:39:06,793
Tequila lime shrimp.
 ...he brought his own take

1058
00:39:06,795 --> 00:39:09,362
on Mexican home to Jersey.
Amazing.

1059
00:39:09,364 --> 00:39:11,097
You can't get any Mexican like
  this around here.

1060
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,099
I just like to let people
    experiment with new

1061
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,234
and different flavors.

1062
00:39:14,236 --> 00:39:16,102
Like a Mexican spin
  on chicken wings.

1063
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,104
Adobo wings.
   I've never made Adobo.

1064
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,539
And that gets tossed on
     the wings?

1065
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:22,308
That gets tossed on the wings.

1066
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:25,712
The Adobo sauce is outrageous.

1067
00:39:25,714 --> 00:39:27,280
Adobo wings.
   I love 'em.

1068
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,882
We're gonna make Adobo sauce.

1069
00:39:28,884 --> 00:39:30,884
Adobo being the red
    tomato sauce,

1070
00:39:30,886 --> 00:39:33,486
some vinegar that reconstitutes
    the chipotles.

1071
00:39:33,488 --> 00:39:35,422
Absolutely.
  Which is a smoked jalapeño.

1072
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,923
Got 'em right here.

1073
00:39:36,925 --> 00:39:38,625
Put the strainer in the pot,

1074
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:40,260
and then we're gonna add
 everything in the strainer.

1075
00:39:40,262 --> 00:39:41,895
Okay.
  Whole heads of garlic.

1076
00:39:41,897 --> 00:39:43,430
Onions in there.
    Wow, this is cool.

1077
00:39:43,432 --> 00:39:45,265
Cinnamon sticks, a little
 sweetness with the heat,

1078
00:39:45,267 --> 00:39:47,033
thyme, the oregano.

1079
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:49,002
Like a cup, just about.
  Throw some bay leaves.

1080
00:39:49,004 --> 00:39:50,370
Peel and seal it.
        Oh!

1081
00:39:50,372 --> 00:39:53,506
This, crystallized, hard,
   Mexican sugar. Awesome.

1082
00:39:53,508 --> 00:39:56,042
Add just a few cloves,
   oranges, water,

1083
00:39:56,044 --> 00:39:57,710
straight-up white vinegar.

1084
00:39:57,712 --> 00:39:59,412
And this is pineapple and orange

1085
00:39:59,414 --> 00:40:02,148
that I just let steep in
 cold water for a few days.

1086
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,584
Let that cook down for about
   3 1/2 hours.

1087
00:40:04,586 --> 00:40:06,119
All right,
   so this is simmered.

1088
00:40:06,121 --> 00:40:08,021
Strain out all the solids
   from the Adobo.

1089
00:40:08,023 --> 00:40:10,090
Look at 'em, how they soak up
    all that juice.

1090
00:40:10,092 --> 00:40:11,624
A little tomato puree.

1091
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:13,493
Let it boil out, go ahead
  and give this a --

1092
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:15,562
Whoo! How much longer are
  we gonna let this simmer?

1093
00:40:15,564 --> 00:40:17,931
For about another
  15 or 20 minutes.

1094
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:19,299
I don't feel any more
    chunks, boss.

1095
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:21,167
I think we're good to go, then.

1096
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,635
Check this out.

1097
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:24,137
That is awesome.

1098
00:40:24,139 --> 00:40:25,538
Aw, you're gonna
    put that on wings.

1099
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,073
Season them with a little
   kosher salt,

1100
00:40:27,075 --> 00:40:29,209
a little cracked black pepper,
 and toss 'em in the sauce.

1101
00:40:29,211 --> 00:40:30,510
Nice, thickened up a little.

1102
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:32,011
And you don't just serve 'em
like that, put 'em on the grill?

1103
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,413
No, we actually put 'em on
   the grill,

1104
00:40:33,415 --> 00:40:35,482
just a little more flavor,
put 'em right back in this bowl.

1105
00:40:35,484 --> 00:40:37,383
Awesome, and we're gonna
 come over here and plate 'em,

1106
00:40:37,385 --> 00:40:38,618
a little
  avocado ranch dressing.

1107
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,654
Here we go.
    Mm, gosh, dude.

1108
00:40:41,656 --> 00:40:43,423
Mm, these are rocking.

1109
00:40:43,425 --> 00:40:45,959
The sauce is out of bounds.

1110
00:40:45,961 --> 00:40:50,063
Right heat, right spice.
     Mm, mm, mm!

1111
00:40:50,065 --> 00:40:51,965
Dude, you are truly
   a rock star on this.

1112
00:40:51,967 --> 00:40:53,600
Nice job.
   Thanks, man.

1113
00:40:53,602 --> 00:40:54,868
Got to come try these wings.

1114
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,035
Adobo wings.
Fantastic.

1115
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,170
Caramelized on the outside,

1116
00:40:57,172 --> 00:40:58,538
when it's grilled,
  puts it over the top.

1117
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,007
Pork mole platter.
 Fresh food, unique food.

1118
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:03,443
Amazing.
Adobo mac and cheese, please.

1119
00:41:03,445 --> 00:41:04,644
You're knocking this food out.
 It's a great job.

1120
00:41:04,646 --> 00:41:05,745
Thanks, man.
   I appreciate it, man.

1121
00:41:05,747 --> 00:41:06,913
It's really a pleasure.
      Thank you.

1122
00:41:06,915 --> 00:41:09,782
So, that's it for
this road trip, but don't worry,

1123
00:41:09,784 --> 00:41:12,919
we got plenty more joints to
 find all over this country!

1124
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:14,654
I'll be looking for you
   next time

1125
00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:17,257
on "Diners, Drive-ins,
   and Dives."

1126
00:41:17,259 --> 00:41:19,626
Amazing.

1127
00:41:19,628 --> 00:41:22,061
Did you see the tear?
 Actually, I got a little tear.

1128
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:26,065
He gave you the ring, and you
started to cry, I'm, like, "Ah!"
