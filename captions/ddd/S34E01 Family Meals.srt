00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,201
        Hey, everybody.         

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,669
        I'm Guy Fieri,          
     and we're rolling out      

3
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:06,738
 looking for America's greatest 
  "Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives." 

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,873
          This trip...          

5
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,608
             We're off the rails
               at this point.   
We are.                         

6
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,610
        ...it's all about       
       all in the family.       

7
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,078
   To see a family              
that's sticking together        

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,746
in the restaurant business,     

9
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,416
you got to be one tough,        
  tenacious family.             

10
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:20,418
    Like a mother/son tribute   
    in Richmond, Virginia...    

11
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,888
         Dude, you got it going.
              You got it going. 

12
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,357
       ...a seafood legacy      
      in Ottawa, Canada...      

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,758
      Bring on the lobster.     

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,094
        ...and Char-B-Que       
       in Reno, Nevada...       

15
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,562
               That's no joke.  

16
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:33,165
   ...fired up by a father/son  
           dream team.          

17
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,834
I can talk about food           
and people gain weight.         

18
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:38,303
              I am so stealing  
                 that line.     

19
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:42,974
That's all right here, right now
on "Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives."

20
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:48,246
                     ♪♪         

21
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:53,985
                     ♪♪         

22
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,455
 Now, you always hear me talking
 about my family on "Triple D," 

23
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:57,656
 and there's something about it.

24
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:58,991
        There's something       
         about families,        

25
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:00,926
  and the restaurant business,  
      and working together,     

26
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,994
     and the crazy dynamic,     
      and the awesome food.     

27
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,329
          Well, I hear          
      there's a place here,     

28
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:06,598
     south of Reno, Nevada,     
    that's got a great story.   

29
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,133
      It's a dad that's got     
         a long history         

30
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:10,802
      in the meat business,     
  his three sons, and his wife. 

31
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,605
  And what they're turning out  
 is something you haven't seen. 

32
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:18,743
    This is Butcher's Kitchen   
           Char-B-Que.          

33
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,679
                  Order up,     
              brisket sandwich. 

34
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,215
         It's barbecue,         
   but it's way more refined.   

35
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:25,484
  Char that tri-tip             
   to perfection.               

36
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:28,887
   Ed Ferencik, he forgot more  
 about meat than I'll ever know.

37
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:32,023
He's worked in the meat business
       for over 40 years.       

38
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,424
 Not my first rodeo.            

39
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,227
          Ed's son went         
       to culinary school.      

40
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:36,628
         They teamed up.        

41
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,831
 FIERI: Then father and son got 
 the rest of the family on board

42
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,700
   dealing their unique meats.  

43
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,701
 Give me the spirit             
of the business here,           

44
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:44,903
You're not a butcher shop.      

45
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,372
           We're a Char-B-Que --
          char pit and barbecue.

46
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,107
To see a family that's sticking 
      together                  

47
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,242
in the restaurant business,     

48
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,577
you got to be one tough,        
  tenacious family.             

49
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:56,514
  I'm going to let my freak flag
    fly today, Guy, so look out.

50
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:57,716
         Let's go, boys.        

51
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,985
  I cut Ed's hair, and I said,  

52
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,521
    "I don't want your money.   
       I want your ribs."       

53
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,656
I knew he was a gangster.       

54
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,391
     One order of rib tips.     

55
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:07,593
          -Meat candy.          
             -Yeah.             

56
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,261
          -Meat candy?          
     -Candy is the rib tips.    

57
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,996
    MAN: Kind of like little    
        popcorn chicken,        

58
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,131
       but barbecue beef,       
      so it's even better.      

59
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,466
              Okay, what are we 
               gonna do, boss?  

60
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,134
Well, this is going to be       
   our house rub.               

61
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,805
We're going to start with kosher
salt, chili powder, paprika,    

62
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:23,742
brown sugar, curry powder,      
black pepper, onion powder-     

63
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:27,078
     He's got every single thing
                on the shelf.   

64
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,548
...onion flake, garlic powder,  
      garlic...                 

65
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,616
         -Garlic flake.         
     -...flake, celery seed.    

66
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,151
       Would it be easier to say
                 the things     

67
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,352
               that you<i> didn't</i>  
                put in here?    

68
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,754
Stick with the script, Guy.     

69
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:38,890
Marjoram, finocchio,            
or better known as fennel.      

70
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,425
                  Throwing      
             his Italian around.

71
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:43,928
Crushed red pepper, oregano,    
    cumin, basil,               

72
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,163
      parsley,                  
 and a little thyme.            

73
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,366
          Thyme. All that folks,
                just for you.   

74
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:50,301
       So this is the spare rib,
   cut off of the baby back rib.

75
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,570
      I'm told                  
 you're a food guy.             

76
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,638
           Oh, yeah, I've cooked
         a little bit in my day.

77
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,308
The longest bone is about       
the third or fourth bone in,    

78
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,510
that's going to start           
    our cut line.               

79
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,711
  That's a rib tip.             

80
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,713
             This'll get cooked 
        as St. Louis style ribs,

81
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:02,914
               and that'll be   
                the rib tips.   

82
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,483
    That's right.               
Three hours of smoke,           

83
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:07,185
    right below 200 degrees.    
    -What are we up to next?    

84
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,255
We are making our house-made    
   barbecue sauce.              

85
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,924
Starting with ketchup,          
    soy sauce...                

86
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,926
        -Worcestershire.        
    -...Worcestershire sauce,   

87
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:18,530
apple cider vinegar,            
house-made guajillo paste.      

88
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,399
It's three different            
 New Mexico chilies.            

89
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:22,134
             -Okay.             
  -Pineapple chunks and juice.  

90
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:23,801
                  You think     
       I didn't see that coming?

91
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,537
          -Fish sauce.          
  -Didn't see that one coming.  

92
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,807
Little bit of liquid smoke,     
lemon juice, oil, garlic,       

93
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,143
      sea salt,                 
cumin, mustard powder,          

94
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,279
    white pepper                
   for that umami,              

95
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,749
paprika, cayenne, black pepper, 
and some onion powder.          

96
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,951
               Okay, hit with   
          the immersion blender?
  That's right.                 

97
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,287
     And this is the house sauce
  we're putting on the rib tips?

98
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,356
  We use some of it             
in our jus that we make.        

99
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:47,959
Apple juice concentrate,        
apple cider vinegar,            

100
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,629
our house-made barbecue,        
     cold water.                

101
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,497
   After the tips               
come out of the smoker,         

102
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,899
   we jus them up,              
cook them in the oven,          

103
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,370
    250 degrees,                
190 to 195 cook temperature.    

104
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,239
         And then we're going to
       finish them on the grill?

105
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,773
Then when you order them,       
     they go --                 

106
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,174
                That's a big    
                overachiever.   

107
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,644
Get a proper char on them,      
    chop them up,               

108
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:08,780
and then put them back          
on the grill to finish the char.

109
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:11,449
              We put more work  
                into one dish   

110
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,186
     then I see some restaurants
          do in all five dishes.

111
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:17,255
             It's like 97 steps.
It's like the tango of barbecue.

112
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,857
Our customers like them.

Cured chicken livers.           

338
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,459
      Shallots, a little garlic,
                  allspice.     

339
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,129
Coriander and fennel,           
white pepper, cayenne pepper,   

340
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,464
and a little bit of ginger,     

341
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,932
    and I'm going               
to grate some nutmeg.           

342
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,335
 Let's go with some             
   sherry, cream.               

343
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,003
          And that's going to go
          to the food processor.

344
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,271
We're off to the races.         

345
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,939
          And now we're going to
        emulsify it with butter.

346
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,608
  And we're looking             
 for a sound really.            

347
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,010
        FIERI: Only here,       
    at Pop's Market On Grace,   

348
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,678
    can you look for a sound.   

349
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,480
               I'm looking for  
           that sound right now.

350
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,614
         -It's lapping.         
             -There.            

351
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,217
-That's what you're looking for.
         -There you go.         

352
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:33,885
 We're going to make            
our Cuban bread here,           

353
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:36,086
so we've got some starter,      
    salt, yeast,                

354
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,023
vegetable shortening,           
AP flour, and water.            

355
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,691
        How many different types
             of breads and rolls

356
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,627
     and muffins and shenanigans
              do you guys make? 

357
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:45,430
There's two different bagels,   
the English, the biscuits,      

358
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,032
the focaccia bread, banana      
nut bread in the mornings.      

359
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:49,033
          It's a half-hour show.

360
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,634
    Yeah, sorry.                
     Yeah, yeah,                

361
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,036

362
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:55,239
We'll let it proof, bake it off,
and we'll have our Cuban bread. 

363
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,108
           We're into pork butts
              for this banh mi. 

364
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,912
Yep. We're going to rub the pork
with salt, thyme's coming in.   

365
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:03,047
          -And garlic.          
  -Just a little bit of water.  

366
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,114

367
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,316
               Roast this off.  

368
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,185
   And braise them              
   for six hours.               

369
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:09,053
   Now we're ready              
to build our banh mi.           

370
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:10,254
   So we have some              
    reserve pork.               

371
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,056
             -Okay.             
  -We're gonna refry this pork, 

372
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:14,258
     almost like                
a fried chicken style.          

373
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,195
                This just in.   
           He's not your friend.

374
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,729
A homemade chili glaze.         

375

           This dude don't stop.

376
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,666
  Chopped cilantro              
    and scallion.               

377
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,334
                A lot of work   
        for one sandwich, buddy.

378
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,470
Let's see if it's all worth it. 
We're going to hinge this.      

379
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,606
              -Mmm!             
 -That's a little hibachi sauce.

380
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,075
It is a garlic mayonnaise, which
I think was more traditional.   

381
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,276
                    Okay.       

382
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,945
But we went ahead               
with some ginger and ketchup.   

383
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:35,079
             We're off the rails
               at this point.

             -Okay.             
     -So this is red onion.

   sophisticated and balanced...

394
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,439
     it kind of wrecks it for me
        with other banh mis now.

395
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,074
          The twice-cooked pork,

396

397
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,912
   The pâté is delicious, silky,

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,160
Got our pork belly ready        
 for braising here.             

452
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,230
 Start with onions,             
  carrots, celery,              

453
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,633
   garlic cloves,               
thyme -- fresh sprigs.          

454
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,768
So I'm going to roast           
   this open, 400,              

455
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,903
for about half an hour,         
     45 minutes.                

456
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,438
We got our apple cider.         

457
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,706
          Usually get most of it
                 in the pan?    

458
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,107
I usually get most of it        
      in there.                 

459
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,576
Not every day. No, I try.       

460
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:19,777
           -Cover it.           
         -You've got it.        

461
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,446
      -And go for how long?     
      -Three to four hours.     

462
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:22,847
                   Got it.      
              What are we into? 

463
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:25,450
 Our parsnip puree.             
   Butter, onion,               

464
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:26,984
Granny Smith apples.            
       Wa-bam.                  

465
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,253
 Is that an Emeril I just heard?
              Was that a "bam"? 

466
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,722
          -A "wa-bam."          
     -It's a Canada Emeril.     

467
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:32,189
We do things a little           
  differently here.             

468
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,458
          -Yes, you do.         
             -Okay.             

469
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,826
     Stirs it counter-clockwise.
              Now the parsnips? 

470
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,661
             Let that cook down.
                  And then?     

471
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,862
The cream and the water.        

472
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,732
          Puree it, make it nice
           and smooth and silky.

473
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:41,866
  It's going to be              
     tasty, man.                

474
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,201
              Let's bring this  
                all together.   

475
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:46,336
Okay. Scallops, salt and pepper 
on there, olive oil.            

476
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,805
 We're going to move            
   right in here.               

477
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,274
We've got to treat them nice,   
like your lady there, bud.      

478
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:51,342
        Back.                   

479
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,677
              You put your lady 
                 in hot oil?    

480
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,611
          [ Laughter ]          

481
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:54,879
   So while these               
  kind of rest out,             

482
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,214
   we're going to               
  start searing off             

483
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,348
that nice chunk of belly        
    we got there.               

484
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,618
   Here's our jus.              

485
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,287
Butter, and that's what's going 
to thicken it up for us.        

486
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,288
             Let's see it, Chef.

487
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,157
Apple-parsnip puree.            
Beets, some snap peas.          

488
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,760
  Brussels sprouts              
and some green curly kale.      

489
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:14,899
Scallops, pork belly,           
waffle fries and the jus.       

490
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,701
       Voilà.                   

491
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,036
            That's a really good
                scallop, man.   

492
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,171
        You cooked it perfectly.

493
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:21,972
                Super tender,   
            there's great crust.

494
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,776
             The jus is a really
          nice complement to it.

495
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:28,512
             That parsnip puree,
            now that's dynamite.

496
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:31,449
       The time that you all are
taking here to braise the belly,

497
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,584
             and to serve it up 
          with the seasonal veg,

498
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,120
             carries it through.
 Nice job, man. Really nice job.

499
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,522
 Scallops going in.             

500
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:40,858
       Just lovely, tender      
    and moist, and succulent.   

501
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,193
   MAN: The pork belly with a   
    little bit of apple cider   

502
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,997
 gives it that nice crispiness, 
   and that subtle dry flavor.  

503
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:50,067
  This place has created dishes 
     that make me come back     

504
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,869
     over and over and over.    

505
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,472
     You walk in and you see    
     the market right away.     

506
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,073
             This is like a real
              deal fish market. 

507
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,076
FOSTER: We've got rainbow trout,
 haddock and cod, fresh halibut.

508
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,677
   MAN: We'll come and pick up  
          some salmon,          

509
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,280
         or take it home        
          and prepare.          

510
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,348
   Other nights when you just   
       feel like going out      

511
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,217
  and being pampered, come here 
    and have lobster poutine.   

512
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,820
You come to Canada, you get     
to think about the poutine.     

513
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,222
               But this isn't   
              a normal poutine. 

514
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,491
             WOMAN:             
   Lots of nice meaty lobster.  

515
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:16,294
           The gravy,           
  it's a lobster bisque blend.  

516
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:18,129
  The combination blew me away. 

517
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,964
     FIERI: Poutine is typically
   fries topped with beef gravy,

518
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,567
                 with curds,    
 but we're taking it to lobster.

519
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:24,568
   We're taking it              
  to lobster town.              

520
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,703
         Is there a lobster town
        in Ottawa? Now there is.

521
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,305
       -Here. Right here.       
         -Now there is.         

522
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,307
Start with the stock,           
but our raw lobster bodies      

523
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,508
right on top of our mirepoix.   

524
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,643
It's gonna go in the oven.      

525
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,045
           -How long?           
      -Two to three hours.      

526
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:35,646
        You glaze it with       
    the white wine right now.   

527
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:36,781
Right into the pot here.        

528
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,249
          Okay. Water, bay leaf,
               and peppercorn.  

529
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,784
       And how long are we      
      going to let this go?     

530
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,520
          -Three hours.         
            -Next up?           

531
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,454
We are going to make            
 the lobster bisque.            

532
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,723
                    Okay.       

533
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:48,259
Olive oil, white onion,         
red pepper, orange carrot.      

534
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,127
             Because they're out
              of the blue ones. 

535
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,130
We got our lobster stock, and   
we're going to get this pureed. 

536
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,332
                  Say hello     
            to my little friend.

537
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,534
Thicken this up with our butter 
   and flour roux.              

538
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,403
       This is the longest stock
                in the world.   

539
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,138
  -Time for her to go back in.  
           -All right.          

540
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,541
     Our brandy                 
and our Jagermeister,           

541
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:04,876
 secret weapon here.            

542
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:07,011
Right into our mixture,         
     and cream.                 

543
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:08,479
             This is the bisque 
             that you're serving

544
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,880
              in the restaurant 
                all the time?   

545
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,749
Yeah, so we're going to turn it 
into a lobster gravy.           

546
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,686
All right, start it up.         
Mascarpone and our cream cheese.

547
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,287
      We still have cheese curds
                  to come?      

548
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,488
     You got it.                

549
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,358
      Is there a swimsuit season
               here in Ottawa?  

550
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,825
 For about a month.             

551
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,828
       That's when I'm not going
        to eat the cheese curds.

552
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,096
           Bring on the lobster.

553
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:27,364
Let's take out our lobby        
straight from the steamer.      

554
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,767
  -Do you steam them per order? 
              -Yep.             

555
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,169
   When you say lobster poutine,
             you're not joking. 

556
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,572
Fries. So we cut them           
 by hand every day.             

557
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:35,940
Cheese for the gravy.           

558
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:38,309
And we're going to put the rest 
right on top of the fries.      

559
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,443
       Gravy.                   

560
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,178
       Choooo.                  
       Chives.                  

561
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,846
             What was the noise 
             that just happened?

562
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,382
You got to make that noise      
   if you want it               

563
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:45,516
   to fall nicely,              
      you know?                 

564
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,653
            Never in the history
                of "Triple D"   

565
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:51,188
              have we ever had  
       a sound-effect seasoning.

566
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,590
                     ♪♪         

567
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,393
        I respect the full swing
              of the bat here.  

568
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,328
      And I'm thinking I'm going
          to get bits of lobster

569
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,197
              sprinkled inside  
               of the poutine,  

570
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,865
      but when you get it served
     in the body of the lobster,

571
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,869
             this is higher end.

572
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,405
              Wow. I'm getting  
         all that brandy flavor.

573
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,940
       Next level with the cream
     cheese, and the mascarpone.

574
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,009
                Great fries.    
      Delicious dish. Well done.

575
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:14,011
           -Right on.           
        -Lobster poutine.       

576
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:17,014
  This ranks probably as one of 
the best poutines I've ever had.

577
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,616
         And believe me,        
   I've had a lot of poutines.  

578
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:21,685
    The sauce is super silky    
        and it's perfect.       

579
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,354
             WOMAN:             
 This whole dish is so Canadian.

580
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:25,089
            It's red,           
     like the Canadian flag.    

581
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,291
   Can you believe they invented
            lobsters to turn red

582
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:29,360
             when they're cooked
         just for the Canadians?

583
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:30,628
         Coconut shrimp.        

584
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,697
       I never say no to,       
     "Let's go to Pelican."     

585
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,164
        That's for sure.        

586
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,233
      All right, guys, I dig it.
      It's a good-looking place.

587
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,768
             And I'll tell you, 
             freshness prevails.

588
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,037
                  Nice job.     

589
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,373
    That's it for this week,    
      but don't you worry,      

590
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,976
   I'll been looking for more   
  joints all over this country. 

591
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:48,646
    I'll see you next week on   
 "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives."

592
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:51,048
    Chef you might get the award
            for the first person

593
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,785
   that's ever worn denim shorts
               on "Triple D."   

594
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,120
     I'm brave if anything.     

595
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,321
         I'm standing over here.

596
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,323
     You are now next to the guy
            in the denim shorts.
