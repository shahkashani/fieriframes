1
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:02,668
 Hey, everybody, I'm Guy Fieri, 
     and we're rolling out,     

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:06,271
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

3
00:00:06,307 --> 00:00:07,339
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
           This trip--          

4
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:09,408
          "Ah-loo-may."         

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,143
 GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): --we've 
     got all kinds of meats.    

6
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:12,077
           Pork-ules!           

7
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,078
           Pork-ules!           

8
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,279
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
       And a little sweet.      

9
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:15,814
     It's really delicious.     

10
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:18,016
 GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): There's 
  a full culinary extravaganza  

11
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:19,885
  in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. 

12
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,620
      This is unique to the     
    world, just so you know.    

13
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:22,754
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
           Incredible           

14
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:24,556
  Indian in Fairbanks, Alaska.  

15
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,758
       I hope people know       
      what a gift this is.      

16
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:28,427
   GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): And   
    in Fargo, North Dakota--    

17
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:29,762
              Whoa!             

18
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:31,497
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
  --things are getting sticky-- 

19
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:32,698
           No sticky.           

20
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,500
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
   --and totally scratch-made.  

21
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:35,901
   Straight out of Flavortown.  

22
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,570
     That's all right here,     
     right now, on "Diners,     

23
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,038
     Drive-Ins, and Dives."     

24
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:43,409
         [music playing]        

25
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:54,720
   So I'm here in Sioux Falls,  
  South Dakota with my brother  

26
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:58,590
 from another mother, the judge 
  and great chef Justin Warner. 

27
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:00,859
    Now, chef, I'm taking you   
   to a special grocery store.  

28
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,194
 Is it Flavortown Market again? 

29
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,196
GUY FIERI: No, this is different
 than an average grocery store. 

30
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,797
      It's a grocery store,     
         bakery, butcher        

31
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,934
  shop, coffee shop, specialty  
     store for restaurants.     

32
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,202
     And they got a brewery.    

33
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:11,670
       Are you sure we're       
      in South Dakota, Guy?     

34
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:12,471
            Exactly.            

35
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,139
   This is Look's Marketplace.  

36
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,607
             Cheers.            

37
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,476
   MAN: The market is amazing.  

38
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:19,410
   it's kind of a destination.  

39
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:20,746
         Plating tacos.         

40
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,482
        Incredible food,        
      incredible beverages.     

41
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:24,816
         There's nothing        
         else like this.        

42
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,418
      I've come down to get     
       a couple of steaks.      

43
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,953
      Pick up some seafood.     

44
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,155
        Wander back here        
       to the charcuterie.      

45
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:32,558
     We were having a pizza,    
     have a couple of beers.    

46
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,958
       I don't know how I       
     would get out of here.     

47
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:35,227
     It's an all-day event.     

48
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,629
  GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): Which  
    started out back in 1883    

49
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,564
  as Carl Look's Butcher Shop.  

50
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,033
   But when Greg Heineman, his  
   son Nick, and their cousin   

51
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:46,171
     Beau Vondra bought the     
      place, they went big.     

52
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,839
        We thought, let's       
        start a brewery.        

53
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:48,840
      Let's start a bakery.     

54
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,309
        We're part of the       
      Good Food Foundation,     

55
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,110
      and we travel around      
       the country a lot.       

56
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:54,713
  We saw places like this, and  
    we really wanted to bring   

57
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:55,914
     it back to Sioux Falls.    

58
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:57,582
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
   And they brought the pizza   

59
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:58,784
   from Detroit along with it.  

60
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,852
  Motor City, up in the window. 

61
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:01,719
        Motor City pizza.       

62
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:02,788
              Wow.              

63
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,055
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
     The crust is handmade,     

64
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,458
      and they have all of      
     their house-made meats.    

65
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,392
       What are we making?      

66
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:08,393
       BEAU VONDRA: We're       
        making the pizza        

67
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,394
 dough for the Motor City pizza.

68
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,662
       First, we're going       
       to take the water.       

69
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:12,064
     Then the osmotic yeast.    

70
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:12,864
           "Osmatic"?           

71
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,265
      This just in, folks--     

72
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,602
 Justin Warner learns something.

73
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:17,536
            Beats me.           

74
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:18,803
         The reason for         
        the osmotic yeast       

75
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:21,673
     is we can push the salt    
    level over 3% on the mix.   

76
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,208
        The more salt you       
     can put into the dough,    

77
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:24,610
      the bigger the flavor     
         is going to be.        

78
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,345
    BEAU VONDRA: Then we also   
   use the sour dough starter.  

79
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:28,080
          Extra virgin          
      California olive oil.     

80
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:29,081
          Kosher salt.          

81
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,082
      GUY FIERI: I've never     
      seen that much salt.      

82
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:30,882
          Bread flour.          

83
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:32,150
  Mix for about eight minutes.  

84
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:32,951
    GUY FIERI: Let it proof.    

85
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,419
 BEAU VONDRA: About a half hour.

86
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:36,021
     Now we're going to make    
     the hot Italian sausage    

87
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,155
    that we do here in house.   

88
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:40,091
      Kosher salt, paprika,     
      sugar, brown fennel,      

89
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,159
       whole fennel seeds.      

90
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,227
  I get mental with my fennel.  

91
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,028
          Black pepper.         

92
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:43,896
      Crushed chili flake.      

93
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:44,696
             Garlic.            

94
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,898
            Cayenne.            

95
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,232
   GUY FIERI: And our mixture   
     over here on the pork?     

96
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:49,234
        BEAU VONDRA: It's       
     shoulder, belly, loin.     

97
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,368
    Are we casing this also?    

98
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:51,903
        BEAU VONDRA: No,        
      this is going on raw.     

99
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,638
         And we blend in        
       some mushrooms that      

100
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,973
 are grown by our mushroom guy. 

101
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:55,974
    You have a mushroom guy?    

102
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,175
        I have a fun-guy.       

103
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,510
 It's the guy with two thumbs-- 

104
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,444
            this guy.           

105
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,578
        BEAU VONDRA: Cut        
       them down smaller.       

106
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:01,580
      Salt and oil them up.     

107
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:02,514
     In the wood-fired oven.    

108
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,582
       Give them a little       
         roast, and then        

109
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:04,549
  we're ready to build the pie. 

110
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,250
         BEAU VONDRA: We        
       actually start out       

111
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,384
  with garlic butter for ours.  

112
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,986
 We go all the way up the sides.

113
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,721
        You don't want to       
    stretch the dough at all.   

114
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:10,922
    You want to push it out.    

115
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:12,524
    We're going to start out    
   with a three-cheese blend.   

116
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,125
       That's the two-year      
          cheddar, aged         

117
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,594
 Widmer, and then a mozzarella. 

118
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:18,463
     That cheese right there    
  is like cheese board cheese.  

119
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,565
 BEAU VONDRA: And we can channel
    the cheese up the sides.    

120
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:21,532
     Channeling the cheese.     

121
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,535
          "Ah-loo-may."         

122
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,336
            Namaste.            

123
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:25,337
    That'll stay right here.    

124
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:26,805
        BEAU VONDRA: Our        
        mushroom melange.       

125
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:27,806
        Hot soppressata.        

126
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,208
         Probably one of        
        my biggest vices.       

127
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:31,343
          There you go.         

128
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:32,143
          Come on, Guy.         

129
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:33,345
 You want me to beg like my dog?

130
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:34,479
         [guy whistles]         

131
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,215
          [justin gags]         

132
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,082
        BEAU VONDRA: The        
      hot Italian sausage.      

133
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:38,883
     GUY FIERI: In the oven.    

134
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,018
           What temp?           

135
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,553
       BEAU VONDRA: 550 to      
     600, about 12 minutes.     

136
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:42,354
       JUSTIN WARNER: Hey.      

137
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,155
          Look at that.         

138
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,556
   Don't drop Justin's piece.   

139
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,224
         I forgot there         
       was dough in this.       

140
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,159
   BEAU VONDRA: Hot red sauce.  

141
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,560
        When you say hot,       
       do you mean spicy?       

142
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,562
        No, it's actually       
       temperaturally hot.      

143
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,697
     It's hot with ricotta,     
    creme fraiche, and cream.   

144
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,833
     Basil leaf and a little    
        bit of olive oil.       

145
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:55,634
             Dig in.            

146
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:56,568
     JUSTIN WARNER: Oh boy.     

147
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,502
          Did you just          
       call me dough boy?       

148
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:58,704
               No.              

149
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:00,239
      I'm surprised at the      
      structural integrity.     

150
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:01,373
      I mean, look at this.     

151
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:03,008
        The crust is like       
       this cheesy reward.      

152
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,178
  It's crunchy on the outside.  

153
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,913
   You get all of this molten,  
    meaty goo on the inside.    

154
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,114
    You really get that funk.   

155
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,783
     And I've never thought     
   about the funk of a cheese   

156
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,185
   as being a palate cleanser.  

157
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,719
    That little acidic bite.    

158
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,721
         But everything         
        else is so rich.        

159
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,724
      This is like you guys     
    have been in the Detroit    

160
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,193
 pizza business for generations.

161
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:25,397
  I mean, you've taken all your 
   expertise as a chef and all  

162
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:28,934
    the support that you get    
   here from the marketplace,   

163
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,002
       and just swing for       
        the fences, man.        

164
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,137
       Thank you so much.       

165
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,006
          All right, we         
       got the Motor City.      

166
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,208
      You take one bite out     
   of that crust right there,   

167
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,277
    and it is something else.   

168
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:41,479
    The ricotta cheese on the   
 top reminds me of ricotta that 

169
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,081
 my mother made on the lasagna. 

170
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:45,883
 BEAU VONDRA: Beer cheese sauce 
   going on top of the fries.   

171
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,086
      Everything about this     
     place is an experience.    

172
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:49,755
        And you go to the       
   butcher shop, for example,   

173
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,024
     and maybe pick up some     
       seasonings with it.      

174
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,958
        And then the best       
      part is the guidance      

175
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:55,560
 you can get on how to grill it.

176
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,362
    MAN: You know, they make    
     beer right in the back.    

177
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:59,497
       They got varieties       
       on the wall there.       

178
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,765
    Don't go anywhere, folks.   

179
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,901
  Guy Fieri and Justin Warner,  
   hanging out in Sioux Falls,  

180
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,169
   South Dakota with this guy.  

181
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,636
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
       And with everything      

182
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:07,439
        going on in this        
      joint, you know he's      

183
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,240
 got more tricks up his sleeve. 

184
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:11,242
   Porcules, up in the window.  

185
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,644
      The Porcules sandwich     
      is a carnivore dream.     

186
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,913
MAN: It's takes a special person
 to get through the whole thing,

187
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,315
        that's for sure.        
      - Look's Marketplace.     

188
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:18,016
        See you in a bit.       

189
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:21,452
           Come here.           

190
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,187
             Oh, no.            

191
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:24,989
             Blargh!            

192
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,391
        Comes with heart        
         paddles, folks.        

193
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:29,928
          Welcome back.         

194
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,197
     Triple D hanging out in    
   Sioux Falls, South Dakota.   

195
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,465
         It's a special         
      edition because I got     

196
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,033
  my one and only brother from  
 another mother, Justin Warner. 

197
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,336
         We are here at         
       Look's Marketplace.      

198
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,605
       Now, it's not your       
     everyday grocery store.    

199
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,207
        Heatseeker going        
        up in the window.       

200
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:43,475
        There's something       
          for everyone.         

201
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,878
  From a complete charcuterie,  
       to a butcher shop,       

202
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,513
        to a wine store.        

203
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,814
  And everything is phenomenal. 

204
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,016
      Searing the Porcules.     

205
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,219
    The particularly sandwich   
   starts out with a Ciabatta   

206
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,087
   bread that's made in house.  

207
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,690
      You've got pork, and      
    then you've got sausage.    

208
00:05:58,825 --> 00:05:59,624
        It's incredible.        

209
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,892
         GUY FIERI: What        
        are we on to now?       

210
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,093
            Ciabatta.           

211
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:05,430
      We have water, yeast,     
     flour, salt, olive oil.    

212
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,631
          Start it up.          

213
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,800
    Very, very slowly add the   
     remainder of the water.    

214
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:09,567
          Let it rest.          

215
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:10,902
       GUY FIERI: Portion.      

216
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,637
  BEAU VONDRA: It goes into the 
   oven for about 16 minutes.   

217
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,638
        What are we into?       

218
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:14,773
       What are we working      
          on right now?         

219
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,641
       Working on our pit       
    sausage for the Porcules.   

220
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:17,642
           Beef chuck.          

221
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,378
      Back fat in the pork.     

222
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:20,979
   JUSTIN WARNER: By grinding   
      this in the walk-in--     

223
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,314
     Everything being cold.     

224
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,849
     JUSTIN WARNER: --you're    
       preserving the fat.      

225
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,251
 This thing can actually create 
    a degree of heat that is    

226
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,119
 going to self-render that fat. 

227
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,454
        And if the fat's        
        already rendered        

228
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,322
    by the time it's in your    
  patty, it's not going to make 

229
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:32,524
    its way into your mouth.    

230
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:33,925
       GUY FIERI: Stack in      
       for a second grind.      

231
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,793
        BEAU VONDRA: And        
      we're going to mix up     

232
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,060
 the spices inside the grinder. 

233
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,996
       Salt. Curing salt.       

234
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:39,264
      JUSTIN WARNER: Sodium     
        nitrate, correct?       

235
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,065
            Correct.            

236
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,199
         Ground mustard.        

237
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,400
       Crushed red pepper.      

238
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:43,602
          Black pepper.         

239
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:44,336
           Coriander.           

240
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,403
          Totally key.          

241
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,404
        Granulated onion.       

242
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:47,538
       Granulated garlic.       

243
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,807
      And we're just going      
       to mix this thing.       

244
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:49,741
             Dig it.            

245
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,742
        BEAU VONDRA: Case       
         up the sausage.        

246
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,210
  Smokes for about 45 minutes.  

247
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,011
            Next up?            

248
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:53,945
   BEAU VONDRA: Pork shoulder.  

249
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
    A little yellow mustard.    

250
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,080
 GUY FIERI: You get the enzymes.

251
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,014
        You get the acid.       

252
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,149
       BEAU VONDRA: So we       
        hit it with salt        

253
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,550
      first so the paprika      
        and stuff doesn't       

254
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,886
   clog the pores of the meat.  
       GUY FIERI: Got it.       

255
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,353
     JUSTIN WARNER: Salt is     
      going to open it up.      

256
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,889
           Start the--          
    GUY AND JUSTIN: Osmosis.    

257
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,223
            Exactly!            

258
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:05,957
    BEAU VONDRA: So now we're   
  going to hit it with the rub. 

259
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:06,825
      GUY FIERI: Whose rub?     

260
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:07,959
     Three Little Pig's rub.    

261
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,227
       Then we hit it with      
      their Touch of Cherry     

262
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,228
     as kind of a finishing.    

263
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,363
         Rest overnight.        

264
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:12,697
 Hit it with a little more rub. 

265
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,432
    It's going to go into our   
 smoker for about 12 to 15 hours

266
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:15,299
      at about 200 degrees.     

267
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:16,701
           Love this.           

268
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,303
 BEAU VONDRA: Pull it, and then 
  it's ready for the sandwich.  

269
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:19,237
           Pork-ules!           

270
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,572
           Pork-ules!           

271
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:21,840
    BEAU VONDRA: First, we're   
 going to split the pit sausage.

272
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,508
         GUY FIERI: Nice        
        wood-fired grill.       

273
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,442
           Pork butt?           

274
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:25,911
   BEAU VONDRA: Pork brisket.   

275
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:27,979
        Regular butter to       
      give it a nice toast.     

276
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,247
        Let's build that        
        sandwich for you.       

277
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:30,315
     Little chili lime mayo.    

278
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,317
        Pit Sausage that        
       we ground together.      

279
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:33,452
          Pork brisket.         

280
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:34,519
          Pulled pork.          

281
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,054
        House-made spicy        
     mustard barbecue sauce.    

282
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:37,923
             Got it.            

283
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:38,790
 BEAU VONDRA: Pickled red onion.

284
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:40,058
         Arugula on top.        

285
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,392
          "A-roo-gula."         

286
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:42,594
  You know, like the old horn?  

287
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,128
          "A-roo-gula."         

288
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,497
    I'll just see myself out.   

289
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,767
     BEAU VONDRA: All right,    
    and there's the Porcules.   

290
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,005
         There are three        
        textures of pork.       

291
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,473
     Three flavors of pork.     

292
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,809
    Because three things were   
      treated individually,     

293
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,878
      and they brought out      
       their best selves.       

294
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,213
      It's a triple punch.      

295
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:02,547
       Left, right, left.       

296
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,215
        The sauce in the        
        accoutrements is        

297
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,951
  not overpowering any of that. 

298
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,585
          It just lets          
      everybody sing, man.      

299
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,488
         Being that I'm         
        the-- or I was--        

300
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:11,790
  the host of the show, I agree 
  with everything Justin says.  

301
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,761
   This is a wonderful way to   
   explore the world of pork.   

302
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,029
   All the pork is fantastic.   

303
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,097
         Seasoned great.        

304
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,633
      That Ciabatta roll is     
       the perfect vessel.      

305
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,101
      It's a full home run.     

306
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,503
        Here's a Porcules       
        sandwich for you.       

307
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,839
     Thick and juicy because    
  it's just loaded with meats.  

308
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:28,640
          Pork-ception.         

309
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:29,641
         Pork-ceptional.        

310
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,243
         MAN: Everything        
      mixes well together,      

311
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,711
but still stands out on its own.

312
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,312
      This is unique to the     
    world, just so you know.    

313
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,713
        Hot soppressata.

     WOMAN: What they've got    
     going on is incredible.    

315
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,719
  I don't know how far you live 
 from Sioux Falls, South Dakota,

316
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,453
      but if you're looking     
       for a place to get

    GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): Up   
 next, a red-hot spot in Alaska.

322
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,665
        It is everything        
        you want it to be       

323
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,199
   on a cold day in Fairbanks.

  GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): Firing 
    up hearty Indian recipes.

 GUY FIERI: Rich and fulfilling.

326
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,805
 A tremendous amount of flavor. 

327
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,474
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
     Real deal, all the way.    

328
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:03,407
       This is fantastic.       

329
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,142
        I'm knocked out.

         [music playing]        

331
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:12,550
  Believe it or not, folks, it  
 has been 11 years since Triple 

332
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,419
   D was in Fairbanks, Alaska.  

333
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:16,554
I mean, that's when we came here
  and met our good friend Benny 

334
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,356
   Lin from Pagoda Restaurant.  

335
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,758
   So we come back into town,   
    and we see that the food    

336
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,360
    scene has just blown up.    

337
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,829
    And I say, hey, is there    
      an Indian restaurant?     

338
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:25,964
       They said, you got       
        to check it out.        

339
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,332
        This is Hari Om.        

340
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,168
      Chicken tikka masala.     

341
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,305
      I've been completely      
   transformed by this place.   

342
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,639
  I'm working on palak paneer.  

343
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,242
  It feels like you're walking  
     into a different world.    

344
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,244
   GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): And   
  it's all legit thanks to chef

      Paul's culinary cred.     

346
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
       AMIT PAUL: All the       
     spices come from India.    

347
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:49,588
       Do you have enough?      

348

00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:54,125
       The flavor profiles      
   that you experience here--   

351
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,060
     I highly recommend it.

00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:59,197
       Lamb korma is lamb       
      in a wonderful sauce.     

354
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,365
          It's amazing.         

355
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,833
     GUY FIERI: So what are     
     we going to make today?    

356
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:07,204
   AMIT PAUL: Salt, turmeric,   
    lime juice, chili powder.   

357
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,239
          Just regular,         
        old chili powder?       

358
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:14,546
  That's the old "clean out the 
  bowl with the chunks of lamb" 

359
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:15,880
           technique.           

360
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,549
        And how long will       
      this marinate, chef?      

361
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,216
         For 30 minutes.        

362
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,552

00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:33,998
            Cinnamon.           

376
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,768
   Toasting these whole spices  
  just opens up all the flavor. 

377
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,036
       [blender grinding]       

378
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,904
     Such a soothing sound.     

379
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,307
     Makes you want to curl     
      up with a good book.      

380
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,108
      What's our next step?     

381
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,644
        Clarified butter.       

382
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,045
         Green cardamom.        
       AMIT PAUL: Cloves.       

383
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:48,780
      GUY FIERI: Cinnamon.      

384
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,452
     AMIT PAUL: And then you    
    add ginger garlic paste.    

385
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,521
  What you call something else. 

386
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:57,589
               Oh.              

387
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:58,589
        That's not what I       
      was going to call it.     

388
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,791
 AMIT PAUL: Cook for 10 minutes.

389
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,325
   Then you're going to add--   
           - Tomatoes?          

390
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:02,126
              Yes.              

391
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,995
              Salt.             

392
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,997
 GUY FIERI: Garam masala, chili 
    powder, coriander, cumin.   

393
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:07,699
         AMIT PAUL: Yes.        

394
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,603
  It cooks right in the sauce?  

395
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:12,403
            Yes, sir.           

396
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:14,605
      For 30 to 35 minutes.     

397
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,007
       GUY FIERI: And you       
     heat it up for service?    

398
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:16,775
         AMIT PAUL: Yes.        

399
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:19,944
     GUY FIERI: Melon seed?     
         AMIT PAUL: Yes.        

400
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,845
   So those have been soaking.  

401
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,215
 That's a new one for me, folks.

402
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:25,015
    AMIT PAUL: Cashew paste.    

403
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,317
   Cashew paste I've heard of.  

404
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:29,421
               OK.              

405
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:33,824
     A little basmati down.     

406
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,625
         AMIT PAUL: Yes.        

407
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:37,361
         [music playing]        

408
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:40,097
        To get lamb that        
       tender is amazing.       

409
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,768
    Never had the melon seed    
    milk, but it's delicious.   

410
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,503
      Rich and fulfilling.      

411
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,971
 A tremendous amount of flavor. 

412
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,109
    When you have a chance to   
   taste a fresh garam masala,  

413
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,444
       you'll want to come      
      back for it forever.      

414
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,512
       This is fantastic.       

415
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:55,714
        I'm knocked out.        

416
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,148
 AMIT PAUL: Lamb korma for you. 

417
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,049
         The lamb korma         
        is really hardy.        

418
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:01,319
  Super tender and super nice.  

419
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,055
       MAN: It's soaked up      
      these amazing spices.     

420
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:05,656
     There's that nuttiness,    
        but then there's        

421
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:06,925
 a little bit of heat behind it.

422
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,192
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
         And in Alaska,         

423
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,994
   a little heat can be good.   

424
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,995
   Have you done a winter yet?  

425
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:11,796
              Yes.              

426
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:12,663
          Negative 32.          

427
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:13,497
          Not so much.          

428
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,799
          Not so much.          

429
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,635
 WOMAN: At the end of a long day
 of working with our sled dogs, 

430
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,403
         it's one of our        
    favorite places to come.    

431
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,338
       Chicken vindaloo is      
      for here, table two.      

432
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:24,342
     Chicken vindaloo has a     
   really nice mix of spices.   

433
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,210
 It's got a really thick sauce. 

434
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,545
    I could eat this all day.   

435
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:28,313
       What are we making?      

436
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:31,950
            Bay leaf.           

437
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,220
         Green cardamom.        

438
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,888
   Is green cardamom used more  
  than black cardamom, correct? 

439
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:37,655
              Yes.              

440
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,295
  GUY FIERI: Pureed red onion.  

441
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,230
           Very nice.           

442
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,064
    AMIT PAUL: Ginger garlic.   

443
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,235
 You have to add all the spices.

444
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,971
              Salt.             

445
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,972
          Garam masala.         

446
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:55,974
      Indian chili powder.      

447
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,475
       And is that spicy?       
         (WHIMPERS) No.         

448
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:03,982
            Gorgeous.           

449
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:04,983
     And then tomato sauce.     

450
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,317
       And how long are we      
    going to cook this down?    

451
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:07,452
        AMIT PAUL: Hour.        

452
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,653
      GUY FIERI: Boneless,      
    skinless chicken thighs.    

453
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,454
         And let this go        
       for another, what?       

454
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,189
    AMIT PAUL: Half an hour.    

455
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,058
          What have the         
    potatoes been cooked in?    

456
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,661
       GUY FIERI: Love it.      

457
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,697
         [music playing]        

458
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,199
       Mm, it's fantastic.      

459
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,068
Vindaloo is one of my favorites.

460
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,004
      I love the spice, and     
       I love the acidity.      

461
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,137
         A little bit of        
       that vinegar coming      

462
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:28,339
   from that red chili sauce.   

463
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,209
         Tender chicken.        

464
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,610
 Lots of flavor, but not heavy. 

465
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,079
    I mean, it is everything    
       you want it to be.       

466
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,014
      Especially on a cold      
        day in Fairbanks.       

467
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,549
      Trust me on this one.     

468
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:39,317
           Well done.           

469
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:41,952
      OK, chicken vindaloo.     

470
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,487
   The chicken is to die for.   

471
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:44,622
   I mean, it just fell apart.  

472
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,157
        WOMAN: I like the       
        zip in that one.        

473
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,225
          It's so good.         

474
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,960
  Making the little lentil dal. 

475
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:50,895
     WOMAN: I really do love    
     everything I've tried.     

476
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,029
       It's an experience.      

477
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:53,765
        To have this type       
         of Indian food,        

478
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,166
       I hope people know       
      what a gift this is.      

479
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,167
     How do I say it again?     

480
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:56,901
       AMIT PAUL: Hari Om.      

481
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,436
  Yeah, you better hurry home.  

482
00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,237
         You can use it.        

483
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,104
           It's funny.          

484
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,040
            Hari Om.            

485
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,842
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
    Coming up, a true bakery    

486
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:05,910
  cafe in Fargo, North Dakota.  

487
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,444
   You are a gift to the town.  

488
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,113
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
    Rocking out pecan rolls.    

489
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,381
       That's ridiculous.       

490
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,383
   GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): And   
  packing savory flavor bombs.  

491
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,985
       GUY FIERI: That's a      
  come-back-to dish, for sure.  

492
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,790
         [music playing]        

493
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:20,859
    You know, the restaurant    
 scene, the restaurant culture, 

494
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:21,859
       is always changing.      

495
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,194
   And right now, what's hot?   

496
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,463
    It's ethnic restaurants,    
      Korean and Ethiopian      

497
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,530
    being two of my favorite.   

498
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,800
      But one that was such     
      a longstanding staple     

499
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:32,136
        in the restaurant       
   business was bakery cafes.   

500
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,337
       You know, bakeries       
         that were doing        

501
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,005
 it all, baking it from scratch.

502
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,541
         So I'm here in         
      Fargo, North Dakota.      

503
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,875
         And when I hear        
      about a place that's      

504
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,411
     been doing it all from     
       scratch since 2003,      

505
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:41,412
      I gotta check it out.     

506
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:42,814
 This is Nichole's Fine Pastry. 

507
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:45,817
        MAN: Nichole's is       
         a local staple.        

508
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,819
   It's fresh-made everything.  

509
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,620
  Fresh fruit tarts, order up.  

510
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:52,090
    They're really known for    
   their desserts and sweets.   

511
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,491
       And we always check      
      out all of the soups      

512
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:55,960
   and salads and sandwiches.   

513
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,162
       It's hard to resist      
       everything she has.      

514
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,497
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
       Which is a lot now,      

515
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:03,501
   but Nichole Hensen actually  
 started with the final course. 

516
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:06,371
     First year and a half,     
      it was just dessert.      

517
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,907
     But we added croissants    
         and sandwiches,        

518
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,975
       and we kept putting      
     it in the pastry case.     

519
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:13,244
     MAN: Everything in the     
      case looks delicious.     

520
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:16,513
       It's just, uh, I'll      
        take that today.        

521
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,182
 Sticky roll going in the oven. 

522
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:20,384
         MAN: The sticky        
       bun this my go-to.       

523
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,119
        I don't like them       
      in most other places.     

524
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,655
     But this one, they just    
      have a special taste.     

525
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:25,589
   What are we starting with?   

526
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,391
         Caramel sauce.         

527
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:27,591
    Well, let's get into it.    

528
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:28,792
      NICHOLE HENSEN: We're     
     pouring some sugar in.     

529
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,461
        Cream of tartar,        
       and a little water.      

530
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,330
    Cook this to 350 degrees.   

531
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,864
     GUY FIERI: Corn syrup.     
     NICHOLE HENSEN: Cream.     

532
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,799
              Salt.             

533
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,334
       Let this cool, and       
       we're going to go.       

534
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:37,601
      NICHOLE HENSEN: We're     
        making the dough.       

535
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:38,802
         What do we have        
        for ingredients?        

536
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,605
NICHOLE HENSEN: Mashed potatoes.
       - Mashed potatoes.       

537
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,539
       Secret ingredient.       

538
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,674
     Helps with the texture.    

539
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,008
         This is magic.         

540
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,209
     NICHOLE HENSEN: Sugar.     
         [guy whistles]         

541
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,744
             Butter.            
            And milk.           

542
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,679
      Heat this up to 115.      

543
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:50,681
        You know that you       
        are the real deal       

544
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:54,551
   when you carry your offset   
      spatula ninja style.      

545
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:55,753
        [slashing noises]       

546
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,087
     Don't serve that cake.     

547
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,156
       [imitates slicing]       

548
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,357
         NICHOLE HENSEN:        
        Once that's done,       

549
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:04,161
    we'll add the flour, some   
    yeast, salt. Pouring in.    

550
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,096
              Eggs.             

551
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,364
         OK, how long is        
       this going to mix?       

552
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:07,298
           One minute.          

553
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:08,432
        I'm going to put        
       the dough hook in.       

554
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,767
        GUY FIERI: So the       
    all-purpose flour again?    

555
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:10,568
      NICHOLE HENSEN: Yep.      

556
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,036
           One minute.          

557
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,504
 NICHOLE HENSEN: And then we're 
  going to speed two for three. 

558
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,839
            Whoa-ho!            

559
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,908
     NICHOLE HENSEN: Let it     
    proof for about an hour.    

560
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,775
      Look at that caramel.     

561
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,378
       It's got that tang,      
     that richness, the funk    

562
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:22,313
   that you get from caramel.   

563
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,248
        I'm not a sweets        
    person, but that's good.    

564
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,783
      Buttered in the pan.      

565
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,251
     Big amounts of caramel.    

566
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,320
   Sprinkle some pecan pieces.  

567
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,055
And then we'll make the filling.

568
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,190
         There's sugar.         
         There cinnamon.        

569
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,191
              And--             
           - Cardamom.          

570
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:33,991
            Cardamom.           

571
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,060
    I was gonna say cardamom!   

572
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:39,263
     Now we take the proofed    
      dough, roll this out.     

573
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,598
     A little melted butter.    

574
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,933
    Don't sit there and play    
  the little spoony-spoon game. 

575
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,601
        Just pour it on.        

576
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:45,670
           Roll us up.          

577
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,538
    GUY FIERI: All this work    
    for just one pecan roll?    

578
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,873
        One pan of seven.       

579
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,011
         You're a ninja.        

580
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,512
          Into the pan.         

581
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,280
         Once it proofs,        
       we go to the oven.       

582
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,416
      NICHOLE HENSEN: 325,      
        about 25 minutes.       

583
00:16:58,418 --> 00:16:59,484
  GUY FIERI: That's ridiculous. 

584
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,018
            [laughs]            

585
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:01,819
            Oh, boy.            

586
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,354
        We got a problem.       

587
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,488
           No sticky.           

588
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,390
            [laughs]            

589
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,027
  GUY FIERI: There's something  
       about cinnamon roll      

590
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,428
     coming out of the oven.    

591
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:14,565
   The sugar, the caramel, the  
 cinnamon, and the fresh yeasty 

592
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:15,766
              roll.             

593
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,201
   I don't know this thing of   
    putting the potato in it.   

594
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:22,440
    But when I eat the dough    
       on this, it's rich.      

595
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:26,710
It has the texture of bread, but
  the light fluffiness of cake. 

596
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,979
      Not too many pecans.      

597
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:28,912
      Not too much caramel.     

598
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:29,713
              Yeah?             

599
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:30,848
         It's dynamite.         

600
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,050
 I mean, it's really delicious. 

601
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,518
  Pecan sticky roll, order up.  

602
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,120
           The caramel          
       sauce is delicious.      

603
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,188
WOMAN: It's not, like, so sweet.

604
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:38,856
         But it's, like,        
        crunchy, kind of.       

605
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,124
          Where did the         
      baking thing come in?     

606
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,992
        I got interested        
     halfway through school     

607
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:42,993
     for a business degree.     

608
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,728
  And then I went up to Alaska. 

609
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:46,396
      I worked at a fly-in      
         fishing lodge.         

610
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:47,331
  They bring you in the flour.  

611
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,599
        They don't bring        
        in the pastries.        

612
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:49,534
 They don't bring in the bread. 
        - That's correct.       

613
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,868
         And then I went        
        to pastry school.       

614
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,403
       Holy entrepreneur.       

615
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,272
     WOMAN: There's a lot of    
     coffee shops in Fargo,     

616
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,039
 but this one has more variety. 

617
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,142
      Here's your mushroom      
     and asparagus galette.     

618
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,077
  MAN: The galette's a pastry,  
      and it can be stuffed     

619
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,412
 with multiple different things.

620
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,681
          The mushroom,         
     asparagus, cream cheese    

621
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:04,748
   goes really well together.   

622
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:07,217
     I'm not a cream cheese     
      guy, but I love this.     

623
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,219
  So what are we going to make? 

624
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:09,887
          The mushroom          
       asparagus galette.       

625
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,422
      And a galette is a--      

626
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,024
 NICHOLE HENSEN: Free-form tart.

627
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:14,625
- We're going to make the dough?
             - Yes.             

628
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,026
         And we're going        
      to make the filling?      

629
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:16,960
              Yes.              

630
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:17,895
          And it's only         
        a half-hour show.       

631
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,363
          That's right.         
    GUY FIERI: Cream cheese.    

632
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,231
       Caramelized onion.       

633
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,232
 NICHOLE HENSEN: Chopped garlic.

634
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,300
       Red pepper flakes.       

635
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,169
   Flaked thyme, cumin, salt.   

636
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:27,305
    GUY FIERI: So we're just    
  going to soften it up a bit.  

637
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:28,706
  Going to pour in some cream.  

638
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:29,640
       GUY FIERI: Next up?      

639
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,708
         NICHOLE HENSEN:        
        Mushroom mixture.       

640
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,710
   Crimini, oyster, shiitake.   

641
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,111
        So a little oil.        

642
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,312
        Salt and pepper.        

643
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:36,980
    GUY FIERI: What temp are    
    we dropping these in at?    

644
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,115
      NICHOLE HENSEN: 425.      

645
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:40,050
     Same on the asparagus.     

646
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,785
         We need to make        
       some galette dough.      

647
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,187
           [gibberish]          
         Galette dough?         

648
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:44,788
        Oh galette dough.       
That's what I was going to make.

649
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,190
         NICHOLE HENSEN:        
       All-purpose flour.       

650
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:47,058
            Cornmeal.           

651
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,726
       Salt. Cold Butter.       

652
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,528
    Into the food processor.    

653
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:51,528
  GUY FIERI: Making the gravel. 

654
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:52,663
NICHOLE HENSEN: So on the mixer.

655
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,665
        This is a lot of        
    equipment for one dough.    

656
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,466
             Water.             

657
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,534
      A little sour cream.      

658
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,336
 I like to make this extra cold.

659
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,338
       Keeping the butter       
       cold is important.       

660
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,607
       So a little Martini      
     shaker might help you.     

661
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,208
    Yeah, it might, actually.   

662
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,544
   GUY FIERI: No, so we could   
 have Martinis, is what I meant.

663
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:07,344
         How we looking?        

664
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:08,279
  NICHOLE HENSEN: Pretty good.  

665
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,413
     We let the dough chill.    

666
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:10,281
             Chill.             

667
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,482
 NICHOLE HENSEN: Portion it out.

668
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,017
       Scoop of our cream       
         cheese filling.        

669
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,753
    Which, by itself, should    
   just be served on a spoon.   

670
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,088
      You can just lick it.     

671
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,355
         Offset spatula.        

672
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,624
       [swooshing sounds]       

673
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,760
     NICHOLE HENSEN: We'll a    
    scoop of the vegetables.    

674
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,028
     Give it a little pleat.    

675
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:25,496
       A little egg wash.       

676
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:26,430
         Mold and salt.         

677
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,431
           30 minutes.          

678
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:28,699
      NICHOLE HENSEN: 375.      

679
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,701
       We'll plate it with      
        a side salad with       

680
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,436
  a homemade lemon vinaigrette. 

681
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:35,106
        In today's world,       
     there's not many times     

682
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,307
        in the middle of        
        the day that you        

683
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:40,844
     can go and find roasted    
     mushrooms and asparagus    

684
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:42,246
       in a composed dish.      

685
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:43,313
           Delicious.           

686
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,449
     Let's first start with     
       the galette dough.       

687
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:49,386
     Very nice, very flaky,     
       and very not heavy.      

688
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:52,456
    The asparagus still have    
    really nice bite to them.   

689
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:56,393
And you really can still pick up
 the earthiness of the mushroom.

690
00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:01,265
 The herbed cream cheese is just
   straight out of Flavortown.  

691
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,734
        I mean, that's a        
  come-back-to dish, for sure.  

692
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,469
  Plating a galette right now.  

693
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:06,403
        MAN: It's hearty.       

694
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,738
         It's delicious.        

695
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,008
 The cream cheese garlic flavor 
 in every bite really hits home.

696
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,143
     I'll take all of those.    

697
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,012
   I'm addicted to Nichole's.   

698
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,213
  WOMAN: It just very European. 

699
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:17,682
       It's just amazing.       

700
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,483
  I think a lot of folks around 
 here are probably like, I mean,

701
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:20,884
         everybody just         
      doesn't have a really     

702
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:24,888
  awesome gourmet bakery that's 
   across-the-board delicious.  

703
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,157
   You are a gift to the town.  

704
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:26,958
             Thanks.            

705
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,494
         Man, that was a        
        fantastic visit.        

706
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,229
          But don't you         
      worry-- there's funky     

707
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:33,631
  joints all over this country. 

708
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,032
  And we'll see you next time-- 

709
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,701
           On "Diners,          
     Drive-Ins, and Dives."     

710
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:37,501
              Yeah!             

711
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:42,239
  Call this, like, the culinary 
     unicorn of Sioux Falls.    

712
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,040
     Of South Dakota, yeah.     

713
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,375
       Hold just a second.      

714
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:46,644
  So, um, the culinary unicorn  
   is what I was going to use.  

715
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:47,778
           Oh, shoot.           
           Sorry, Guy.          

716
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:48,980
         So I had that.         
    It was a really good one.   

717
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,314
      So [inaudible] mine.      
            - Got it.           

718
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,048
              Cool.             
              - OK?             

719
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:51,515
             - Yeah.            
          - Good talk.          

720
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:52,583
              Cool.             

721
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,318
   So the culinary leprechaun   
        of South Dakota.        

722
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,186
           [laughter]           

723
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:59,490
         [music playing]
