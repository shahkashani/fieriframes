    <i> AND HIS BROTHER MATT...</i>

376
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,050
         I'VE BEEN DOING FISHING
              MY WHOLE LIFE     

377
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,784

378
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,653
   STARTED OUT AT A FISH MARKET,
   BASICALLY BEHIND THE COUNTER 

379
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,655
                   CUTTIN' FISH.

380
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,657
 YEAH, WORKING ON SPORT BOATS-- 
   STARTED OUT AS A DECKHAND,   

381
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,059
AND THEN ENDED UP               
 BEING THE COOK.                

382
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,262

        PIECE OF FISH           

408
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,989
BECAUSE IT'S OPAQUE.            
            AND THEN YOU SKIN IT
           AND THEN CUT IT DOWN.

409
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,191
THAT'S IT.

                WITH TERIYAKI.

00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,808
 SO THE FIRST THING WE'RE GONNA 
  DO IS ROLL IT IN BREADCRUMBS. 

418
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:46,077
  EVEN THOUGH IT                
GOES ON THE GRILL?              
       YEP. WHEN YOU'RE DEALING 
      WITH A DELICATE WHITEFISH,

419
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,878
             IT KINDA JUST WORKS
                AS A BINDER.    

420
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,880
NOW WE'RE GONNA PUT THE MARINADE
 ON THE FIRST SIDE OF THE FISH. 

421
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,416
     LEMON, GARLIC AND BUTTER-- 

422
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,018
 A LITTLE BIT OF FAT,           
A LITTLE BIT OF FLAVOR.         
                   LOOK AT THAT.

423
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:57,021

   OH, YOU CAN SMELL THAT GINGER
         RIGHT OFF THE BAT.     

424
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,291
    FRESH ROLL                  
FROM THE BREAD GUY.             
             THROW A LITTLE MARK
              ON THE OTHER SIDE.

425
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,760
AND I'M GONNA BASTE IT AGAIN    
       WITH TERIYAKI.           

426
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,495

  GARLIC AND BUTTER.            

427
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,563
                   FRESH LEMON  
                 ON TOP OF THAT.

428
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:09,033
            SO THE FISH IS DONE.
  THE BREAD--                   
LIGHTLY TOASTED.                

429

431
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,907
JUST DO A SMALL SALAD,          
   TOMATOES, ONIONS,            

432
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,710

                         CAPERS?

 FRESH AVOCADO.                 
                           NICE.

435
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:26,918
SAME DEAL ON THE SANDWICH.      
           LOOK AT THESE THINGS.

436
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,587
THAT'S A MONSTER.               
      MMM.                      

437
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,924

SOMETHING GOIN' ON HERE.        

438
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,659

A NICE TOAST.                   

439
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,995
THE TARTAR SAUCE COMPLEMENTS

442
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,735
 SO MUCH FLAVOR FROM THAT FISH, 
   JUST A LITTLE LEMON JUICE,   

443
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,404
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED             
 A DRESSING. MMM.               

444
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:49,607
TERIYAKI'S ON POINT.            
  IT'S LIKE BUTTER.             

445
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:52,076
I CHALLENGE ANYBODY THAT SAYS   
   THEY DON'T LIKE FISH--       

446
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:55,813
     TRY THAT AND TELL ME       
THAT WOULDN'T MAKE THEM A FAN.  
                THAT HAPPEN--   
             THAT HAPPENS A LOT.

447
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,682
  THEIR MOTTO IS "ALL WE DO IS  
 FISH," AND THAT'S ALL THEY DO. 

448
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:00,818
THAT'S THEIR BUSINESS.          
          SERIOUSLY, NO BURGERS?

449
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,953
NO NOTHIN'. NO STEAKS.          
     NO HOT DOGS.               

450
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:06,224
ALL WE DO IS FISH.              
          THE SEAFOOD'S AMAZING.
         THAT'S WHY I COME HERE.

451
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,360
        IT'S DELICIOUS.         
FOUR BASS TACOS TO GO.          

452
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,896
       I HAVE WHAT'S LEFT       
    OF A SWORDFISH TACO. MMM.   

453
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,831
            WE DO WHATEVER KIND 
          OF FISH TACO YOU WANT.

454
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,366
       IT GETS LOADED UP        
           WITH FISH.           
SO IF I WAS GONNA GO            

455
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:18,702
FOR A FISH FROM THE CASE        
       FOR A TACO,              

456
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:21,238
WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND.       
      LET'S DO A SEA BASS TACO. 
     GET YOUR CHIPOTLE MARINADE.

457
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:24,175
  IT'S CHIPOTLE PEPPERS, GARLIC,
        BUTTER AND OREGANO.     

458
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,310
      IT GIVES IT A GOOD KICK.  
     WE DON'T TOP IT WITH SALSA.

459
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,045
                YOU JUST DO IT--
EXACTLY.                        

460
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,914
          HOW FAST WILL THIS GO,
            ABOUT TWO MINUTES?  
ABOUT TWO MINUTES.              

461
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:31,782
     GIVE IT ANOTHER LITTLE KISS
           WITH THE SAUCE.      

462
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:34,385
THE TORTILLA GOES ON.           
LET THE CHEESE MELT.            

463
