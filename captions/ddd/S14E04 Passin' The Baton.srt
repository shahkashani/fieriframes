117
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,997
      MELTED BUTTER. LET'S ADD

MAYBE A SMALLER BOWL            
     NEXT TIME.                 
                WELL... (laughs)

121
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,271
HOW LONG IS IT GONNA GO         
   IN THE OVEN FOR?             

122
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,407
       IT'S GONNA GO IN THE OVEN
            FOR THREE HOURS.    

123
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,175
WHAT TEMP?                      
                            225.

124
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:42,614
OKAY, LET'S MAKE                
 THE PANCAKES.                  

125
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,117
     THIS IS MY MONSTER PANCAKE.
THAT'S A BIG CAKE.              

126
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:51,022
          (mouth full) LOVE 'EM.
    NOW YOU CAN'T SPEAK,        
'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT A MOUTHFUL.

             with mouth full)   

128
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:57,696
         THAT IS SOME RIGHTEOUS,
            RIGHTEOUS GRANOLA.  

129
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:00,198
I'M GONNA FLIP IT NOW.          
              OH, WAIT A SECOND.

130
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,768
       (drumming rapidly)       
(laughing)                      

131
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,503
        (slaps surface)         
                           YEAH!

132
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:05,971
THERE YOU GO!                   
                           WOW! 

133
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,375
   VANILLA YOGURT, AND I'M GONNA
  TAKE SOME FRESH MIXED BERRIES.

134
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,443
  GOTTA BE FRESH, GOTTA BE GOOD,
          GOTTA BE JUICY.       

135
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,912
THERE'S NO WAY WE COULD PUT     
      ANY MORE ON IT.           

136
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,381
            MORE VANILLA YOGURT,
                   AND...       

137
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,316
      MORE FRESH BERRIES ON TOP.

138
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,985
     SCOOP OF OUR GREAT GRANOLA.

139
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,154
                  THERE YOU GO--
                   PANCAKE ROLL.

140
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,989
HMM. WOW.                       

141
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,324
     (mouth full)               
THE ACID OF THE YOGURT          

142
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,592
AND THEN THE SWEETNESS          
   OF THE BERRIES,              

143
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,261
THE SPONGINESS                  
OF THE PANCAKE,                 

144
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,196
     BUT THEN THE CRUNCH        
OF THE GRANOLA ON TOP OF IT--   

145
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,664
I MEAN, IT'S A PERFECT STORM.   

146
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,266
  AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT      
I'M NOT A HUGE BREAKFAST FAN.   

147
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:36,201
WITHOUT QUESTION, I WOULD       
ORDER THAT IN A HEARTBEAT.      

148
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:39,871
  IF YOU'RE COMING TO PETE'S,   

149
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,072
      YOU REALLY GOTTA TRY      
       THE PANCAKE ROLL.        

150
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,540
      IT'S LIKE A PARFAIT       
         ON A PANCAKE.          

151
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,208
 IT'S JUST A GREAT COMBINATION  
          OF FLAVORS.           

152
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,811
         PETE'S IS JUST         
      A GREAT PLACE TO BE.      

153
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:48,179
 BREAKFAST EVERY SUNDAY MORNING 
     FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS.     

154

  <i> SERVED UP BY THE SAME FOLKS</i>

                  BEING AT HOME.

(lowered voice) THIS IS         
  GONNA BE SO STRONG.

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,861
                     (splashing)
  WITH A MIXTURE LIKE THAT,     
YOU COULD REFINISH FURNITURE.   

173

            (whirs)

THAT'S THE RIVER                

175
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,601
THAT FLOWS OUT OF MOUNT VESUVIUS

176
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,270
              GOT SOME FRESH-CUT

   WHY?                         

177
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,338
YOU SHOULD JUST DROP IN         
  LIKE 2 OR 3 QUARTS            

178
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,140

    I MIGHT TRY IT.

     IT TAKES OUT THE INTENSITY.

274
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,809

       THE FUNNIEST EVER.       

519
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,018
