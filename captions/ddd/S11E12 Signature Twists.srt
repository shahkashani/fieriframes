00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,442
           JAMBALAYA CAN BE MADE
               WITH ANYTHING.   
IT CAN BE.                      

196
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,444
WE MAKE IT WITH CHICKEN         
AND ANDOUILLE SAUSAGE.          
            GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN.

197
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,647
 ALL I DO IS TAKE               
THE SKIN OFF OF IT.             
                      BECAUSE...

198
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,049
LESS FAT.                       
   GOT THE SKIN AND THE MAJORITY
       OF THE FAT CUT OFF IT.   

199
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,519
SALT AND PEPPER, FRESH CHOPPED  
  BASIL, A BUNCH OF GARLIC,     

200
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,587
    A LITTLE BIT                
OF CHOPPED ROSEMARY.            

201
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,923
 WAS THIS HOW YOU SAW IT GETTING
     DONE WHEN YOU GOT HERE,    

202
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,925
                  OR WAS THIS   
               YOUR IMPROVEMENT?
OH, THIS IS ALL ME.             

203
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,894
         WHAT TEMPERATURE ARE WE
          ROASTING THIS OFF AT? 
450.                            

204
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,929
                450 FOR ABOUT...
45 MINUTES.                     

205
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,931
              ALL RIGHT,        
      SO THE BIRD'S COOLED DOWN.

206
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,866
            YOU'RE JUST GONNA   
        SHRED THIS BIRD BY HAND?
    I TAKE                      
THE BREAST OFF,                 

207
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,868
AND THEN I JUST                 
START PULLING.                  
           AND HOW MANY CHICKENS
               ARE WE DOING?    

208
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,937
     1 CHICKEN                  
FOR 8 CUPS OF RICE.             
        NOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

209
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,673
NOW LET'S MAKE                  
THE JAMBALAYA.                  
                           OKAY.

210
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,476
       BUTTER,                  
GET IT NICE AND HOT.            
          NOW THIS IS THE FAMOUS
            CAJUN HOLY TRINITY. 

211
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:35,079
   ADD THE ONIONS,              
BELL PEPPERS, CELERY.           

212
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,081
          YOU HAVE THE MIREPOIX,

213
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,083
         WHICH IS A LOT OF TIMES
           IN THE FRENCH FOOD,  

214
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,085
           WHICH IS THE CARROTS,
             CELERY, AND ONION. 

215
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,087
    THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT
      ADDING THAT PEPPER TO IT  

216
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,089
            THAT JUST STARTS    
       TO SET OFF THOSE FLAVORS.

217
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,091
                   DO YOU AGREE?
I DO AGREE WITH THAT.           

218
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,093
                  OKAY, SO YOU  
               SWEAT THESE DOWN.
 AFTER THAT,                    
YOU THROW IN                    

219
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,229
    2 1/2 POUNDS                
OF ANDOUILLE SAUSAGE.           

220
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,632
          THIS IS ABOUT AS CAJUN
                AS IT GETS.     
 IT DEFINITELY HAS              
AN EXTRA KICK IN IT.            

221
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,633
SWEAT THE ANDOUILLE.            
                    RENDER      
               SOME OF THAT FAT.

222
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,702
    LET THE FLAVOR              
SORT OF DRAW OUT OF IT.         

223
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,504
     MORE CHOPPED GARLIC,       
FRESH BASIL, AND FRESH PARSLEY. 
                    WHAT'S NEXT?

224
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,374

                           OKAY.

225
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,976
NOW TRADITIONAL JAMBALAYA,      
THAT'S MORE WITH BEEF STOCK     

226
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,978
  AND A LITTLE BIT              
MORE WHITE IN COLOR.            

227
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,447
I ACTUALLY USE                  
TOMATO SAUCE.                   
            AND I GOTTA TELL YA,

228
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:12,116
                  I'VE HAD A LOT
                   OF JAMBALAYA 

229
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,118
                    FROM A LOT  
                 OF CRAZY DUDES.

230
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,120
         THAT'S THE FIRST TIME  
      I'VE SEEN ANYTHING CLOSE--

231
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,122
               I'VE SEE TOMATOES
                     GO IN,     

232
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,124
             BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN
                TOMATO SAUCE.   
(laughs)                        

233
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,193
 YOU AND I ARE BOTH GONNA GET IN
  SOME TROUBLE IN THIS TOWN NOW.

234
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,729
     THEN NEXT IS GONNA BE      
THE FRESH CHICKEN STOCK WE ADD. 

235
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,098
                 SO A LITTLE BIT
                   OF SIMMER.   
AND THEN ADD YOUR RICE.         

236
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,400
   PARBOILED RICE--MEANS THAT IT
     ACTUALLY HAS GONE THROUGH  

237
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,469
               A LITTLE BIT     
         OF ITS COOKING PROCESS.

238
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:34,205
   YOU'RE GONNA LET THIS JUST GO
         FOR A LITTLE BIT?      
     COOKS DOWN                 
FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES.           

239
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,474
           EVAPORATE THE LIQUID.
YOU'RE GONNA STIR IT            
   PROBABLY, UH...

THAT'S IT.                      

241
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:41,346

  MMM, GOOD LITTLE SPICE.       

244
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,020

  IT'S A NICE LITTLE SPIN.

LITTLE UNIQUE TWIST TO IT,

GOTTA START WITH BUTTER.        

275
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,230
LET THAT SAUTé UP

   A LITTLE BIT,                

279
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:15,106
   YOU ADD A LITTLE BIT OF      
CHOPPED UP CREMINI MUSHROOMS.   
    THOSE WILL REALLY BREAK DOWN
           FOR THE FLAVOR.      

280
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,709

            A LITTLE BITE THERE.

285
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:29,054
VERY IMPORTANT TO USE           
HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM.           

286
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,188
IT'S GOTTA BE 36% MILK FAT      
         OR MORE.               

287
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,324
           OKAY, WHAT'S UP NEXT?
  WE LET THIS                   
START TO SIMMER,                

288
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,459
  AND RIGHT BEFORE              
IT STARTS TO BOIL...            
                PARMESAN CHEESE.

289
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,461
A LITTLE PARMESAN CHEESE,       
   A LITTLE BIT OF...           
              CORNSTARCH SLURRY.

290
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,463
CORNSTARCH SLURRY.              
                   THAT'LL HELP 
                  TIGHTEN IT UP.

291
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,399
    A LITTLE                    
SALT AND PEPPER.                
                           OKAY.

292
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,801

             RIGHT OFF THE BAT. 

294
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,139
PARMESAN CHEESE...              
              PUT A LITTLE CRUST
                    ON IT.      

295
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,542
 A LITTLE BIT                   
OF BREADCRUMBS.                 
   AND WE'RE GONNA BAKE THAT OFF
     IN THE OVEN AT WHAT TEMP?  

296
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,944

  HUGE FLAVOR.                  

300
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,555

     IN THAT CREAM SAUCE.

00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,623
     GET A LITTLE BIT           
OF THE SHERRY, GOOD CRUNCH.     

302

NOT CUTTING ANY CORNERS--       

303
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,827
THAT'S HOW GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE 
           WAS MADE.            

304
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,696
EVERY TIME I WAS AROUND         
   FOR THE HOLIDAYS,            

305
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:14,098
THEY'D HAVE TO FIGHT ME OFF     
       WITH A STICK             

306
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,100

CASSEROLE DISH AWAY.            
                        (laughs)

310
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,307

   THE GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE.    

311
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,443
            NICE AND CREAMY.    
        IT WAS A LITTLE CRUNCHY.

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,311
       A FEW PRAWNS RIGHT ON TOP
        SO THEY DON'T OVERCOOK. 

381
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,646
          COVER THIS. SIMMER FOR
           TWO OR THREE MINUTES.

382

BUT THE TIME AND ENERGY YOU TOOK

393
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,675

00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,290
BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE           
IN THERE FOR TWO DAYS,          

470
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,292
SO WE DON'T WANT IT             
  TO BALLOON UP.                

471
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,294
  WITH THE COLD WATER, THE YEAST
     IS NOT STARTING TO GROW.   
RIGHT.                          

472
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,296
GIVE IT A REALLY GOOD MIX.      
WE'RE GONNA ADD OUR FLOUR.      

473
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,099
AND THEN LOCAL WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR
   FROM WOODLAND, CALIFORNIA.   

474
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:57,835
   TURN THIS BABY ON.           
IT GOES ABOUT 20 MINUTES.       

475
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,570
                IT'S PULLED AWAY
                 FROM THE BOWL. 

476
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,706
              GONNA PULL IT OUT.
WE'RE GONNA PUT IT OUT.         

477
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,708
THEN WE'RE GONNA GO RIGHT INTO  
MAKING OUR PIZZA DOUGH BALLS,   

478
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,176
PORTIONING IT OUT TO 13 OUNCES, 
  PUT IT ON OUR PIZZA TRAYS.    

479
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,445
                   LOOKING GOOD.
 WE'RE GONNA GO                 
INTO THE WALK-IN.               

480
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,448
                           OKAY.
    THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN        
IN THE WALK-IN FOR TWO DAYS.    

481
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,783
A LITTLE MOIST                  
TO THE TOUCH...                 
                            WOW.

482
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:15,519
THEY'RE READY TO BE             
ROLLED OUT. DUST IT.            
          AND YOU DO 'EM WITH   
       A SHEETER VERSUS BY HAND?

483
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,788
  WE START IT OFF THIS WAY,     
LIKE, ABOUT TWO OR THREE TIMES  

484
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,790
THROUGH IT, 'CAUSE WE GO THROUGH
       SO MANY, SO FAST.        

485
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,726
AND NOW I'LL STRETCH IT OUT     
       A LITTLE BIT.            

486
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,527
PUT A LITTLE CORNMEAL           
   ON MY PIE TIN.               

487
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,796
AND NOW WE'RE READY             
    TO TOP IT.                  
                           OKAY.

488
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,865
SO PUT SOME MOZZARELLA--        
      WHOLE MILK--              

489
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,001
OVEN-ROASTED CHICKEN,           
    NOT TOO MUCH.               
               NO SAUCE ON THIS.

490
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:33,136
   NO SAUCE--SOME SPINACH       
THAT WE ROASTED IN THE OVEN,    

491
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,473
    GARLIC CLOVES POACHED       
IN A LITTLE BIT OF OLIVE OIL.   

492
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,474
     THEN PROVOLONE             
WILL BE THE LAST TOPPING.       

493
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,610
              SHOULD'VE MADE ONE
                 FOR YOURSELF.  
READY TO GO.                    

494
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,613
            SET IT UP. I'VE SEEN
               SOME BIG OVENS.  

495
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:46,083
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE ON A TRAILER
  THAT YOU TOW BEHIND A TRUCK.  

496
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:48,886
     THIS THING IS SMOKIN' HOT--
           650 ON THE DECK.     

497
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:51,422

         IN ABOUT THREE MINUTES.
READY TO BRING IT OUT.          

498
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:53,824

        REALLY GOOD-LOOKING PIE.

499
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:56,427
PUT A LITTLE BIT OF GARLIC OIL  
      AROUND THE EDGES.         

500
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:59,497
SPRINKLE SOME FRESH HERBS,      
SOME FRESHLY GRATED CHEESE.     

501
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,431
OKAY.                           
             GOOD-LOOKING CRUST.

502

             I LIKE THE SPINACH.

                 CAN'T BEAT     
            THE ROASTED CHICKEN.

00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,437
                GREAT CRUST,    
            DYNAMITE PIZZA OVEN.

BRICK CHICKEN PIZZA.            

507

 SALTY. THE CHEESE IS FABULOUS. 

508
