1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,134
   So when I come off the road  
      from doing<i> Triple D,</i>      

2
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,670
  the first thing I want to do  
    is get home to my kitchen   

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,137
        and cook my food        
         for my family.         

4
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:09,274
     -And after a few weeks,    
       they're gonna be--       
    -Hey, Dad, can we just...   

5
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,677
         I mean, please,        
       go to a restaurant       
       at least one time?       

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,878
      They start to revolt.     

7
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,012
   So I came up with an idea.   

8
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:17,082
     How about we reach out     
  to some of our favorite chefs 

9
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:19,284
          and have them         
      send us dinner, huh?      

10
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,086
        I like that idea.

00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:46,625
    another<i> Triple D</i> alumni.    

106
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,026
      They were in a group      
        called Messlords.       

107
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:52,497
  They have traveled the world  
   taking care of our troops,   

108
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,566
      and cooking for them,     
     and cooking with them.     

109
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,634
         So they were on        
       the<i> USS Enterprise.</i>      

110
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,036
           And they're          
       taking ingredients,      

111
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,504
        and figuring out        
   what they're going to make.

00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,572
  [Shane]<i> So this one's called</i>  
      <i> the angry Hawaiian.</i>      

113
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:03,308
     We take a bacon cheese,    

114
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:04,776
     <i> sub out the American</i>      
        <i> for Provolone,</i>         

115
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,512
       <i> and then, on top,</i>       
       <i> we do pineapples,</i>

     [Guy]<i> So, I know this,</i>     
 <i> the boiled bacon of Hodad's.</i>  

118
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,519
         -What is this?         
          -It's bacon.          

119
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,586
              [Guy]             
      It's like bacon soup.     

120
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,723
     And then he would make     
    these patties out of it.    

121
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,659
          Turn it over.         
         It looks almost        
        like hash browns.       

122
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,527
           Do you guys          
     have a press for that?     

123
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,362
         Of course I do.        

124
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:25,597
          Look at that.         

125
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,399
       [Guy] What you want      
       done with the buns?      

126
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,601
           Toast 'em.           
       Did you throw down       
     those beef patties yet?    

127
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,803
       I took this bacon,       
        and I started 'em       

128
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,805
        in this cast iron       
          to season it          

129
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,340
        before I dropped        
         those patties.         

130
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,475
             [Shane]            
      Little flavor saver.      

131
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:37,742
    Everything tastes better    
        when it's cooked        

132
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,610
         in a little bit        
        of bacon residue.       

133
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,746
  [Guy] And season these with?  
    [Shane] Some season salt.   

134
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,548
   Throw that cheese on there.  

135
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,549
       And one per bacon.       

136
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,883
     Oh, and hit the bacon.     

137
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:49,421
    Tomato on the bottom bun,   
  and then the lettuce snowball 
             on top.            

138
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,623
       Boy, if that's not       
       a Mike Harden 101.       

139
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:54,126
          We call this          
      the lettuce snowball.     

140
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,161
           Bada-bing.           

141
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,831
           So you have          
   the pineapple, the jalapeno  
     and the barbecue sauce.    

142
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:00,966
     -We got 'em right here.    
          -Mix them up.         

143
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:01,833
    Now, that's looking good.   

144
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,901
    Yeah, I'm getting hungry,   
            honestly.           

145
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,704
           Bacon patty          
    on top of the beef patty.   

146
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,373
             It goes            
   to the top of the lettuce.   

147
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,777
       Fit as much of that      
       pineapple jalapeno       
         barbecue sauce.        

148
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:12,777
      Without falling off?      

149
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,380
          Look at that.         
 Do you have the burger diaper? 

150
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,581
  <i> Do you have the wax paper?</i>   

151
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,449
        -Where are they?        
   -They should be in the box.  

152
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,451
       -I didn't see any.       
    -Right next to the beer.    

153
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,720
         [all laughing]         

154
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:24,256
        No burger diaper.       
    You're on your own, man.    

155
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:25,023
       Look at this thing.      

156
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,224
              Wow.              

157
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,461
          I'm jealous.          
      That's all I can say.     

158
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:31,263
    That's, like, so unfair.    

159
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,664
       That looks amazing.      

160
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,733
     You go from that sweet     
     barbecue and pineapple     

161
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,735
          to just that          
        bacon and burger.       

162
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,403
         [Guy] You know         
       who we got to call?      

163
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,205
     Say hi to Panini Pete,     
           everybody.           

164
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,273
          Hey, Panini.          

165
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,542
   So we're having this thing   
    called an angry Hawaiian.   

166
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,243
         Do you remember        
       making this burger?      

167
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:50,816
  That is a legit burger, bro.  

168
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,817
        This bacon patty        
        always prevails.        

169
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:53,885
<i>Then you get the Hodad burger,</i>  

170
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,953
         which is cooked        
        on that flat-top,       
        simply seasoned.        

171
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,890
     But that juxtaposition     
          that you get          
       with the pineapple       

172
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,760
    and that pickled jalapeno   
      chopped up on there,      

173
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,696
     I got to tell you, man,    
  I can't believe they let you  
        walk off the ship       

174
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,231

175
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:07,432
          Say goodbye.

179
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,504
       Is there any left?       

180

   [Guy] "Is there any left?"

    that's what Hunter and I

00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,475
     Hey, I signed it, too.     

215
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,143
   "To my frosted-tip homie."   

216
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,479
     Somebody sent a press.     

217
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,547
         -I'm impressed.        
       -Hey, there it is.       

218
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,949
       Capital "T" tasty.       
       And that is money.       

219
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:35,220
            Oh, look,           
      I'll put it in front      
  of this little kid's picture. 

220
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,121
          That's fine.          

221
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,356
          [Guy] What is         
       the game plan here?      

222
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:40,625
         So we're making        
    the Ray's waffle burger.    

223
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:41,760
        Ray is my father.       

224
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:43,628
   Unfortunately, we lost him   
     a couple of years ago.     

225
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,564
        <i> He used to love</i>        
      <i> bacon with waffles.</i>      

226
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,433
    Ran out of bacon one day,   
     and he had a hamburger,    

227
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,768
         <i> put it on top</i>         
        <i> of his waffle,</i>         

228
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,369
         <i> and that was</i>          
    <i> his favorite breakfast.</i>    

229
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,571
        -I like this guy.       
        -That's awesome.        

230
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,706
      You're going to start     
   making the burger patties.   

231
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,641
   Are you just going to snack  
 on that cheese the whole time? 

232
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,577
        Why did you send        
         so much cheese?        

233
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,712
            [Suzanne]           
       <i> Because last time</i>       
      <i> I was on Triple D,</i>       

234
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,647
 <i> you closed the cheese aisle.</i>  

235
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,582
     <i> You, like, wanted me</i>      
   <i> to make a grilled cheese.</i>   

236
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,851
    Oh, there was no cheese?    

237
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,519
      Suzanne took a pizza      
    and put in the microwave?   

238
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,653
              [man]             
  She's getting cheese off it.  

239
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,522
    [woman] Oh, that's smart.   

240
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,390
        [Suzanne]<i> It was</i>        
   <i> a real easy competition.</i>    

241
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,525
          Thanks a lot.         

242
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:14,525
         Ah, it's funny.        

243
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,327
       Let's start making       
        the burger first.       

244
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:17,996
    Half sausage, half beef.    

245
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:18,863
      You want two patties.     

246
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,599
      We're gonna stuff it      
          with cheese,          

247
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:21,933
    if you have cheese left.    

248
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:22,734
            What kind           
       of cheese is that?       

249
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,003
            It's, uh,           
      a pepper Jack cheese.     

250
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:25,937
         It's delicious.        

251
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:26,738
   [Suzanne] Guy, if you want   
      to start cooking off      

252
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:27,872
       -some of the bacon.      
          -[Guy] Okay.          

253
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,075
      [Suzanne] So, Hunter,     
     just do, like, an ounce    

254
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:31,543
          and, kind of,         
      ball it in your hand,     

255
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,877
            and then            
   you're gonna want to put it  

256
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,746
          in the center         
      of one of the patties     

257
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,614
             and put            
     the other patty on top.    

258
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:37,782
    Crump up all the creases,   

259
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,551
          so the cheese         
         doesn't escape.        

260
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,619
            And then,           
      you guys should have      
        some coffee rub.        

261
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,687
       [Guy] What's in it?      

262
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,423
        [Suzanne] Coffee,       
     chili powder, paprika,     

263
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,559
           kosher salt          
         and raw sugar.         

264
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,493
       You want a liberal       
       seasoning on this?       

265
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:50,428
     Yeah, make love to it.     

266
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,097
               Oh.              

267
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:54,832
       [Suzanne] And then       
    if you have some of that    
     bacon fat rendered off,    

268
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,235
        you can use that        
         as your grease         
         for the burger.        

269
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,037
            Oh, yeah,           
        that looks good.        

270
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,039
         Now, let's talk        
       about this waffle.       

271
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:01,840
        Okay. All right.        

272
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,708
         Quit waffling.         
       All right, Suzanne?      

273
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,310
            [Suzanne]           
      So, crack your eggs.      

274
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:08,380
          Hard boiled?          

275
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,784
   They come out hard boiled,   
     it's so hot in Atlanta.    

276
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:13,785
   [Suzanne] Grab the wet mix.  

277
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,855
   -Buttermilk, regular milk.   
      -Sour cream and eggs.     

278
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,657
            And then,           
        you're gonna take       
      the dry mix package.      

279
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,659
         What do we have        
       in the waffle mix?       

280
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,862
     [Suzanne] Flour, sugar,    
         baking powder,         
      a little bit of salt.     

281
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,599
      And then, you've got      
   a waffle maker over there.   

282
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:28,933
         You want about         
        a cup of batter.        

283
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:33,338
 Boy, I love how this activates 
        right off the bat       
      with the buttermilk,      

284
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,406
       and the baking soda      
            in there.           

285
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,808
        It's already nice       
         and puffed up.         

286
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,743
            [Suzanne]           
      And then, we're going     
    to make the maple aioli.    

287
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:41,279
     There's so many things     
   we're supposed to be doing   
          around here.          

288
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,415
       Make this, do that.      
            Go here.            

289
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,283
        -Mayo for aioli.        
          -Maple syrup.         

290
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:46,751
       [Suzanne] How does       
      the waffle look, Guy?     

291
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,753
              [Guy]             
  I think I might have given it 
  a little bit more than a cup. 

292
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,888
    -Nothing wrong with that.   
   -What else is going there?   
         Worcestershire?        

293
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:54,492
            [Suzanne]           
  Cider vinegar, pinch of salt  
      and some dry mustard.     

294
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:55,994
       [Guy] It's a pretty      
     interesting concoction.    

295
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,564
          I like that.          
    It's not too breakfast-y.   

296
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,633
           All maple.           
   It's a little more mature.   

297
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,501
         A little lunch         
    with the fat of the mayo.   

298
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,437
    And we make our own mayo    
         in house, too.         

299
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,072
           Well done.           

300
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,041
   How's that waffle looking?   

301
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,442
           Is it good?          

302
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,445
     It's light, it's airy.     

303
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:15,447
   But it's got a great crust   
         on the outside.        

304
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:16,514
       But it's not sweet.      

305
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,649
    It's not too sweet. Good.   

306
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,517
    I'm sorry. Was I supposed   
   to cut these into portions?  

307
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,519
       I was about to say,      
      "What are you doing?"     

308
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:25,056
  You want to make that waffle  
       to be the same size      
         as your burger.        

309
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,592
   And then slather both sides  
     with that maple aioli.     

310
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,661
         Put the burger         
       down on the bottom.      

311
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,930
        Take that bacon,        
       put the other piece      
        of waffle on top,       

312
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,200
           and that's           
       your Ray's burger.       

313
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:36,234
          I want that.          

314
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,006
       I'm not gonna lie.       
  I didn't know what to expect  
          out of that.          

315
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,876
       That pork in there       
    is really nice, actually,   
    the pork and the cheese.    

316
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:48,846
  If there was ever a sandwich  
      that I was gonna call     
       a brunch sandwich.       

317
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:51,549
         Not too sweet,         
     where it's right in the    
     beginning of breakfast.    

318
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,019
         Not so burger-y        
         that it forgot         
       where it came from.      

319
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:57,422
  Little of that breakfast fat  
  that you love with the bacon. 

320
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:58,356
        Delicious patty.        

321
00:10:58,358 --> 00:10:59,758
    Cutting it with the pork    
       in there is genius,      

322
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:03,561
     and I think stuffing it    
   with the cheese makes it...  

323
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,896
       I love what you did      
  in paying homage to your pop.

    slow things down, folks.    

328

      a little brief break,     

329
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:18,442
         maybe lay down,        
       maybe do some yoga,      
       clean the kitchen.

             -Okay.             

334
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:29,888

       Oh, we are rolling.      

336
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,691
         Hi, everybody.         
          Welcome back.         

337
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,426
         My name's Guy.         
       I'm in a food coma.      

338
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:35,493
        What's your name?       

339
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:36,694

             -Yeah.             

340
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,162
           We're doing

341
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:41,900

     by Shane from Hodad's,     
          in San Diego,         

342

      with a brunchy burger     
      named after her dad,      
       done with a waffle.      

345
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:53,778
     Hopefully, the next two    
  are something like a parfait  
          and a sorbet.         

346
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:56,514
      -Yeah, a small salad      
          or something.         
    -A salad would be great.    

347
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:57,582
          Not a chance.         

348
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,584
      That's our buddy Doug     
           from Dough.          

349
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:00,718
         Doug, be nice.         

350
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,787
      You're going to have

351
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:03,855
         Oh, he sent us         
          a pizza oven.         

352
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:04,855
          There you go.         

353
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,391
     That's how we ended up     
   seeing you the first time.   

354
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,460
 <i> I'm a big fan of great ovens.</i> 

355

              [man]             
   That thing is rocking hot.   

356
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,396
              Mmm.              

357
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,265
             Too bad            
      you didn't want any.      

358
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,401
      Prosciutto nub. Holy!     

359
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,535
       A whole prosciutto.      

360
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,671
        You've got to see       
    where the nub comes from.   

361
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,673
       -You're going to--       
        -I appreciate it,       
    because I was wondering,    

362
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,474
        "Where would one        
          get the nub?"         

363
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:24,542
              [Guy]             
    This is expensive stuff.    

364
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,877
             [Doug]             
        It is. It's dear.       

365
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,746
       It's actually pork.      
      But that's delicious.     

366
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,616
            You know,           
 if you're going to make pizza, 
      you need a pizza hat.     

367
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,484
    -Hey, I'm making a pizza.   
          -That's good.         

368
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:34,618
       And we go cycling.       

369
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:36,821
          It's so tight         
         on my fat head.        

370
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,622
   -[Hunter] That is awesome.   
              -Wow.             

371
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,825
     Can you walk me through    
       what we're making?       

372
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:44,361
    We're going to start with   
  the Calabrian diavola wings.  

373
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,832
    Let's get a cast iron pan   
    with a little bit of oil    
          in the oven.          

374
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:48,833
           These wings          
        have been brined.       

375
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:49,834
          What did you          
      brine them in, Chef?      

376
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:50,968
     Salt, sugar, bay leaf?     

377
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:54,705
   <i> You have honey, aromatics</i>   
     <i> for about four hours.</i>     

378
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,109
     <i> Then we marinate them</i>     
    <i> in Calabrian wing sauce</i>    

379
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,110
          for 24 hours.         

380
00:12:59,112 --> 00:12:59,911
          What's in it?         

381
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,580
    [Doug] Olive oil, onions,   
         minced garlic,         

382
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,249
     the Calabrian chilies,     

383
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,584
            rosemary,           
        salt and pepper.        

384
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,787
      So, are you actually      
        parboiling those        
     ahead of time or what?     

385
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,456
          I roast them          
  till they get cooked through. 

386
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,657
           I love it.           
     Hunter, grab that pan.     

387
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,459
             [Doug]             
    Right back into the oven.   

388
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,460
       So you want to get       
    some nice color on that.    

389
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,462
        Well, that works.       

390
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,664
           I see that           
      you sent us something     
          for a pizza.          

391
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,599
   <i> Talk to me about the sugo</i>   
      <i> that's going on it.</i>      

392
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:22,933
      [Doug]<i> We go through</i>      
        <i> a lot of hams.</i>         

393
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,803
         And we ended up        
  with all these nubs left over 

394
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,472
          that you can          
        no longer slice.        

395

          <i> We cook 'em</i>

   <i> It picks up great flavor.</i>   

398
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,482
      So, you sent me some      
    braised prosciutto butt.    

399
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,885
        Yes. You can make       
     this sugo really easy.     

400
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,086
         Oil in the pan.        

401
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:45,756
   Put your mirepoix in there,  
  little salt and tomato paste. 

402
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,425
         -[Guy] Got it.         
      -Hunter, did you give     
       those wings a turn?      

403
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,360
              Yeah,             
      he gave them a turn.      

404
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:50,695
      [Doug] Put that wine      
          in there now,         

405
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,764
    and I think you're ready    
         for the wings.         

406
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:56,367
            Rosemary            
         and the chopped        
       Calabrian chilies.       

407
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,502
    The garlic goes right in.   

408
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,969
           This smells          
       so good right here.      

409
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,906
    Hunter, back in the oven    
   to finish those wings off.   

410
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,508
        All right, Chef,        
         I've cooked out        
         all my veggies,        

411
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,642
       my wine's reduced.       

412
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,777
     -What's the next step?     
 -[Doug] Italian plum tomatoes. 

413
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,646
       [Guy] Dried thyme.       
        Sugar now, Chef?        

414
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:09,914
           [Doug] Yep.          
          [Guy] Pepper.         

415
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,515
          [Doug] Yeah.          
    [Guy] Couple bay leaves.    

416
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,284
          Chili flake,          
     a little dried oregano.    

417
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:14,985
   It's coming to a boil now.   

418
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,989
     All right, let's go in     
  with that pulled prosciutto.  

419
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:19,390
     It's like a full parade    
         in Flavortown.         

420
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,858
           [chuckling]          
          Full parade.          

421
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,794
      [Doug] Only last bit      
       is the Doughanzola       
         dipping sauce.         

422
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,330
 [Guy] Calabrian chili as well? 
           [Doug] Yes.

        Coming over, Dad.       

425
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,536
           Those look           
       out of bounds, man.      

426

427

              Yeah.             

429
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:39,811
      I don't know anybody      
    watching at home to think

433
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:47,752
       get that cast iron

          Super tender.         

437
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,626
       I want to be buried      
      in a gallon of this.      

438
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:55,693
      Oh, that's the sauce.     

439
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:58,963
          -Doughanzola.         
   -Doughanzola. Very clever.   

440

      [Guy] The little kiss     
        of the rosemary.        

441
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:01,499
            And then,           
     the Calabrian chilies,     

442
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,300
          they add that         
    nice little bit of heat,    

443
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,302
      and not overpowering.     

444

448
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:16,648
    then the Fontina cheese.    

449
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,382
       Where's the sausage      
          coming from?          

450

451
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,651
         What mushrooms         
        do we have here?        

452
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,521
             [Doug]

453
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:24,856
        roasted peppers.        

454
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:27,725
     And then, you're going     
      to grate some cheese      
       and go in the oven.      

455
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,861
           -Launch it.          
     -Whoo. That was close.     

456
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,795

         for 90 seconds.        

458
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,166
      Take a look at that.      

459
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:36,401
              Nice.

462
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:44,876
           That crust,          
     really nice and light,     
       but very chewsome.       

463
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:45,743
      It's got a good chew.     

464
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,612
   And it takes a little char   
         on the bottom.         

465
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,812
          It can handle         
         the high heat.         

466
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:50,681

530
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,349
       No, with no onions.      
           No onions.           

531
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,551
      A separate stockpot.      

532
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:07,819
            Come on!            
      You're not putting it     
            in there?           

533
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,021
       Isn't it all gonna       
   party together eventually?   

534
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:13,557
         Heck yeah, man.        
  We just don't want any bones  
  in those collard greens, man. 

535
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,760
   All right, so the garlic in  
    with the sweated onions.    

536
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:16,961
        [Chuck] Put your        
   collard greens in that pot.  

537
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,830
      [Guy] Let them sweat      
          and pull out          
       their own moisture.      

538
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,766
        [Chuck] Correct.        
   [Guy] Warming this rib up.   

539
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:22,967
      -Love this technique.     
            -Mmm-hmm.           

540
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:25,836
     To be able to get this     
       big, old, authentic      
          smoked meat.          

541
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,771
     You got that Chuck flap    
       in the water, too?       

542
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,507
       -You want that in?       
         -[Chuck] Yeah.         

543
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:30,441
          Hey, hold on.         

544
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:33,244
          We have Mario         
      from Four Kegs, man,      

545
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,845
       with my Stromboli.       

546
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:38,382
          [Guy] When we         
   first started<i> Triple D,</i> one  
   of the producers asked me,   

547
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,051
    "So, you have any places    
         you really like        

548
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:40,918
         that are, like,        
     like<i> Triple D</i> joints?"     

549
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,720
       And I said, "Huh."       
      College kid favorite,     

550
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,722
      <i> that's where we met</i>      
      <i> our brother Mario.</i>       

551
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,523
             I want             
      the Stromboli recipe.     

552
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:47,859
       We'll give you 80%.      

553
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:48,926
    Did we have the Stromboli   
        delivered to us?        

554
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:51,395
     -I don't think we did.     
  -Well, we love you, brother.  

555
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,796
        Thanks, brother.        
       Be good. Peace out.      

556
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,665
    What else are we putting    
    in these collard greens?    

557
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,335
 [Chuck] Take that turkey stock 
       and add that to it.      

558
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:58,802
    Collard green ninja dust.   

559
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,871
      Go ahead, put it in.      
    Crushed red pepper, yeah.   

560
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,606
    When do you want to drop    
      this turkey meat in?      

561
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,408
            Go ahead            
      and add it right now.     

562
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,543
      [Guy] Smells so good.     

563
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:06,610
           Somebody's           
      getting this at home.     

564
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,613
       You send the greens      
   where they're already done,  

565
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:09,880
        set, ready to go?       

566
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:13,217
    [Chuck] Yeah, and that's    
     actually a boiling bag     
        right there also.       

567
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:14,819
      [Guy] Walk me through     
        these green beans       
          you sent me.          

568
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,421
     We basically make them     
          the same way          
     as the collard greens.     

569
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,890
    Add some russet potatoes,   
           red onions.          

570
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,625
    Now, what do you want us    
      to do with this rib?      

571
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,761
    [Chuck] Just plate it up    
       on that flat plate.      

572
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,363
          -Oh, my gosh.         
  -[Chuck] Cut that Chuck flap. 

573
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,299
          Man, look at          
         that knifework.        

574
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,567
      Comes with two sides.     

575
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:30,568
           Oh, great.           
          Come on down.         

576
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:31,702
     Feed the family of ten.    

577
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,170
            Can I put           
   the barbecue sauce on now?   

578
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,439
      -Hit it now. Hit it.      
       -[Hunter] Oh, yeah.      

579
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,375
         I can smell it         
    from here in San Antonio.   

580
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,776
        You're definitely       
         being tortured.        

581
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,579
             [Chuck]            
     Hey, you should garnish    
   with the onions first, man.  

582
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:42,847
       That kicks it off.       

583
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:46,717
       There's not enough       
      beef rib in my life.      

584
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:47,784
          And beef rib          
      is so much different      

585
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,053
       than any other part      
         of the animal.         

586
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:52,389
           -So tender.          
     -[Guy] The smoke on it     
          is beautiful.         

587
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,292
       -What kind of wood?      
       -Pecan and hickory.      

588
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:56,460
       It's got good fat.       

589
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,929
 Half inch of smoke ring on it. 

590
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,597
       This is how you do       
      barbecue right here.      

591
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,298
          The collards,         
         they're tender.        

592
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,133
         Not too salty.         

593
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:03,533
           Little bit           
    of that turkey in there.    

594
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:04,668
        And that is about       
          as old school         

595
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,537
      Southern a green bean     
        as you get, man.        

596
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,537
          Outstanding.          

597
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:08,472
     Well, here's the deal,     
             folks.             

598
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,740
           And I want           
        to say thank you.       

599
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,009
  <i> You've all been fantastic.</i>   
<i>The dishes are super creative.</i>  

600

602
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,615
    Let me go talk to Hunter.   

603
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:18,749
       Hold tight, please.      

604
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,751
    I don't know. Those wings   
       looked pretty good.      

605
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,553
   Yeah, you guys killed this.  

606
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,488
          Well, folks,          
      not an easy decision.     

607
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,623
        What's the line,        
     Hunter, we usually say?    

608
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,557
        -Winner, winner,        
         chicken dinner?        
             -Right.            

609
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:29,226
           But today,           
         it's got to go
