00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,735
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out

00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:06,738
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,340
          This trip...          
    Stack 'em up.

00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,541
...we're diggin' into comfort...

6
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:10,675
     Excellent.                 

7
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,811
        ...that goes way        
   beyond Grandma's cookbook.   

8
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:14,947
I want to order 100 of these.   

9
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:17,015
   We're talking Tex-Mex meat   
          in Austin...          

10
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,218
    That's legit.               
I mean, like, legit, bro.       

11
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,153
      ...pumped-up pub grub     
         in Salt Lake...        

12
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:24,156
     Delicious.                 
    Don't judge.                

13
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:25,758

00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,495
 Someone didn't send            
      the memo.

 ...servin' up soul with a spin.

    There you go.               

19
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,302
     That's all right here,     
           right now,

24
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:55,920
     and you try great food,

00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,522
      or think if you were      
       a flight attendant       

26
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,324
and you flew all over the world,

27
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:01,794
      and you got to taste      
    all this incredible food.   

28
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:03,795
        Think if you took       
      all that information      

29
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,330
          and came back         
 and opened your own restaurant.

30
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:06,798
        I've got a place

32
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,668
 If you're in Atlanta, Georgia, 

33

     you've got to check out    
          Twisted Soul.         

34
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,675
        Portobello stack        
      with dirty-rice orzo.     

35
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,810
      It's not necessarily      
     your regular soul food.    

36
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,612

  FIERI: And the culinary angel 
      is Deborah Vantrece,      

39
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,220
     who took off from being    
       a flight attendant       

40
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:30,222
 to landing her own restaurant. 

41
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:32,157
 Someone didn't send            
      the memo.                 

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,028
We can't have two bleach blondes
    in this show.               

43
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,563
 Although, it looks             
   better on you.               

44
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:40,966
             WOMAN:             
  Deborah has taken ideas from  
  her travels around the world  

45
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,901
  and created something unique. 

46
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,769
               We're gonna do   
      a little fusion soul food.

47
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,105
Is that what the restaurant     
is about, is soul food?         

48
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:48,040
                    Yeah.       
         It's globally inspired.

49
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:50,909
           'Cause in my opinion,
  all cultures have a soul food.

50
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,777
      You can feel the East     
         and the West...        

51
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,846
    the North and the South.    

52
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:55,380
     Southern seafood Louie.    

53
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:59,718
   The Southern seafood Louie   
     is so amazing, so rich.    

54
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,053
     The crab, the shrimp...    

55
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:03,121
           everything           
     is perfectly seasoned.     

56
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,723
So, we're gonna do a little play
on the little crab Louie salads.

57
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,192
                  You know,     
   the Southern belles down here

58
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,660
               used to do that  
             at the tea parties.

59
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,062
 I've never been to             
    a tea party.                

60
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:12,597
     I've been to a kegger.     
        -Nah. Tea party.        

61
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,132
    -Tea party is different?    
             -Yeah.             

62
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,401
    So, first thing, the roasted
      corn vinaigrette that goes

63
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:18,403
               on the seafood   
           Southern Louie salad.

64
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,605
       Gotcha.                  
       Gotcha.                  

65
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:20,805
                 All right.     
       A little olive-oil blend.

66
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,741
                Some onions.    
            And red bell pepper.

67
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,810
                 Fresh corn.    
           Sautée this up a bit.

68
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,946
               So this is some  
          apple-cider olive oil.

69
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,948
                  Cilantro.     
               Garlic powder.   

70
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,083
               Seasoning salt.  

71
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:32,884
          Onion powder.         
            -Next up?           

72
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,152
                  Hoecakes.     

73
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,954
        Don't you say --        
       -Now wait a second.      

74
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:38,623

   into Flavortown              

75
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,091
and say it the wrong way.       

76
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,027
So how would one say            
what we're gonna make next?     

77
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,829
           -A hoecake.          
           -Hoecakes.           

78
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,096
 Did I get it right?            

79
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,031
           -That's it.

80
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,367

                 Buttermilk.    
                  Avocados.     

87
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,576
I've seen a lot of things       
   in hoecakes...               

88
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,712
   I've never seen              
 the avocado combo.             

89
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:03,181
           It is soul food fused
              with California.  

90
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,316
      I got it.

91
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:05,783
So even the California people   
    are included.               

92
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,052
              They've got soul. 
              They've got soul.

00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,793
And that's all she wrote.       
What do we have next?           

97
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,194
              Next, we're gonna 
             poach the seafood. 

98
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,796
                A little oil.   
              Shrimp 'er down.  

99
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:18,864
   Shrimp 'er down              
    a little bit.               

100
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,398
              Shrimp 'er down.  
                Lobster down.   

101
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,533
                   Water.       
                  Old Bay.      

102
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,734
    A little bit                
    of crab oil?                

103
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,136
       A little bit of crab oil.
                 Lump crab.     

104
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,072
 So a little poach?             
   Being delicate.              

105
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,540
                    Yep.        
      And then we let them cool,

106
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,208
         and then we'll be ready
               for the salad.   

107
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,745
You know that I don't often,    
on "Triple D," do salads.       

108
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,080
              A little arugula. 

109
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,015
   -But this has got attitude.  
       -A bit of attitude.      

110
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,283
                Corn relish.    

111
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,819
Then the hoecake is what puts it
                over the top.   

112
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:41,887
    There ya go.                

113

              Add our lobster.  

114
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:46,224
               Our lump crab.   
             Mango vinaigrette. 

115
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,627
            We're gonna top that
         with some micro greens.

116
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,429
It's too pretty to eat.         

117
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,096
     It is kinda cute, isn't it?

118
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,699

119
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,501
  I don't typically             
 like cold seafood.             

120
00:03:56,503 --> 00:04:00,372
Because by the time it cooks    

121
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:02,907
   and gets held,               
it's lost its flavor.           

122
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,378
You, on the other hand, you wild
woman, you better blonde...     

123
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,912

         -It's refined.         

125
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:11,716
   It's balanced.               

126
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,653
You perfectly cooked            
    the seafood.                

127
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:17,389
   Avocado hoecake              
is a perfect complement.        

128
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:20,525
There's not many salads         
that I would order again.       

129
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:23,061
I would order that every time.  
That is too legit to quit.      

130
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,130
               I'll take that.  
            Seafood Louie salad.

131

   The seafood Louie is great.  

132
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,267
    The shrimp is excellent.    

133
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,468
    I feel I'm having dinner    
         with my salad.         

134
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,937
 You've got lobster, you've got 
    shrimp, you've got crab.

             What is a hoecake? 

141
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,084
     A hoecake?                 
     A hoecake?                 

142
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:47,752

145
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,224
  She would make dinner for us  
         on our flights.        

146
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,427
I heard you used to make        
some galley gourmet.            

147
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:56,762
          Buy ducks in London...

00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,764
             get on there and...
             a whole light meal.

she really wants to feed people.
       -We're in Atlanta.

00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,306
We're hanging out with my sister

155
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,376
 When we come back,             
what are we gonna make?         

156
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,311

    -We'll see you in a bit.

165
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,797
Welcome back. Twisted Soul.     
     "Triple D."

Started me off with this        

169
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,469
  "try this little              
   seafood salad"               

170
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,805
and "I'm gonna make this        
roasted corn dressing."         

171
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:42,473

                 fried chicken. 

172

 Yeah. And you know             
that means treadmill.           

173
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,544
  The fried chicken is perfect. 

174
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,814
   From the crust all the way   
      through to the bone.      

175
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,349
Now we're gonna put some South  
    in the mouth.               

176
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,218
 -Now we're going to the South.

              all this goodness 

182
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,161
      just simmer down together.

183
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,229
Now simmer down, now.

197
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,250
   And how long is              
 it gonna hang out?             

198
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,519
                  24 hours.     

199
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,587
             Dredge it in flour 
            and house seasoning.

200
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,523
And then right from the jets    
  to the cast-iron?

   -Hit it, don't babysit it.   

202
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:36,527
     Now we're ready to assemble
         our collard-green roll.

203

            Turn up.            
          -Turn it up!

211
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,742
              a little paprika. 

212
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:54,212
 We'll let that baby just simmer
    four about two, three hours.

213
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,347
 All right, sister.             
   Let me see it.               

214
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:57,382
                 All right.     
        Blanched collard greens.

215
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,884

216
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,152
          Got our cooked greens.

217
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:01,886
Fold it up and get it done.     

218
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,754
And these are gonna sit there   
and steam a little bit.         

219
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,557
  -These are gonna sit there... 
 -And get a little more tender. 

220
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,626
        Now we're ready to plate

         with our dry rub again.

 my favorite band's lead singer.

   Oh, no kidding?              

406
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:13,525
     So, we have "Maynard" after
         the Tool lead singer...

407
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:16,327
     Cornell, Cobain, and Chino,
   the singer from the Deftones.

408
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,396
That's awesome. How long does   
it go on the smoker?            

409
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,664
     About 30 minutes each side.

        -Toss it on here.       

412
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,668
    Just sear it                
  for some texture?             

413
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,803
Toasted bun.                    
I'll hit that just for a second.

414
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,539
        -Just warm it up?       
         -House pickles.        

415
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,741
          -Big burger.          
      -Caramelized onions.      

416
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,609
        A couple of bacon pieces
                   on top.      

417
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,877
                 And hit it     
      with the hot-mayo mustard.

418
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,412
I don't know if the burger      
   is big enough.               

419
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,681
  It's not the size             
   of my head yet.              

420

Wow. Just the right amount      
      of smoke.                 

422
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:45,356
The goat cheese inside of there 
offers the perfect tang.        

423
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:46,691
 The queso blanco...            

424
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:49,694
it just melts and becomes       
the creamy ambassador.

   of Flavortown.               

427
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:55,166

haven't you? You nailed it.     

428

         The smoking...         

430
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,172
  it just adds a lot of flavor  
             to it.

       I think                  
what you two are doing,         

438
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,120

      well, it's not really     
          a restaurant,         

455
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,925
      and it's not exactly      
           just a bar,          

456
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,794
        and they're kinda       
        doing Asian food,       

457
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,596
       but it's also mixed      
       with American food.      

458
00:14:58,598 --> 00:14:59,863
      You know, these folks     
        have always just        

459
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,865
    kinda been in Purgatory.

      that's a great name.      

461
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,770
          Check it out.

 And that American/Asian mash-up

472
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,826
  comes from the Asian-American 
        forces behind it,       

473
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,896

      and Chef Hiro Tagai.      

474
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:33,498
    Hiro both grew up eating    
          American food         

475
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,099
 and grew up eating Asian food, 

476
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,568

perfect example of that bar food

480
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,642
     and the Asian infusion.    

481
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:48,178
      It's just adds up to      
   a pretty incredible flavor.

 Pork-belly nigiri.

    -We call it "pork stalk."   

487

   the pork belly, we strain it.

488
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,259
  And it just keeps             
  building flavor?              

489
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,062
I mean, it's kind of like
