00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:00,497
           IT'S ALREADY STARTING
              TO SMELL GOOD.    
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO NOW         

417
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,567
        IS BEGIN                
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART,        

418
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,569
WHICH IS MAKING THE ROUX.       
                        MMM. OH.

ANY LUMPS IN THE ROUX.          

424
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,315
    WE ADD THE WATER            
ALL THROUGH THIS PROCESS.       

425
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,317
  WE DON'T PUT IT               
ALL IN AT ONE TIME.             

426
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,319
WE JUST KEEP STIRRING           
AND KEEP ADDING WATER.

430
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,792
NOW WE'LL JUST LET              
  THAT ROUX COOK                

431
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,729
 FOR ABOUT, I'D SAY THREE HOURS 
    OR SO, AND YOU'RE THERE.    

432
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,731

    FINISHED,

   IT IS NOW,                   

434
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,802
THEN WE'RE GONNA ADD            
TOMATO CONCENTRATE.             

435
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,738
    THEN WE'RE GONNA ADD        
DICED TOMATOES AND THE OKRA.    
         AND WE MIX THIS ALL UP?

436
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,207
THAT'S CORRECT, AND WE BRING    
YOU BACK UP TO TEMPERATURE.     

437
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:46,276
BRING IT BACK UP TO TEMPERATURE,
    AND WHEN THAT'S DONE...     
IT'S DONE.

          TO ADD TO IT.         

453
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,842
       IF I DON'T GET BACK      
    TO LOUISIANA THAT OFTEN,    

454

OR IS THIS WHAT YOU CALL?       

481
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,965
    NO, THIS ACTUALLY ORIGINATED
