         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out

00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:06,738
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,872
          This trip...          

5
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:08,740
                     Oh!        

6
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,009
  ...we're unhinging the jaw... 

7
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:11,343
        You don't do much small,
                   do you?      

8
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,079
   ...for some major mouthful.  

9
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,214
Will there be nine lumberjacks  
who will come to eat this?      

10
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:17,883
      I'm not kidding you,      
   just listen to the lineup.   

11
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:20,285

         football of Flavortown.

12

   and the sauce in Jersey...   

13

                right there.    

16
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:29,694
        ...and in Oregon,       
      the whole shabamwich.     

17
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,096

19

             That is ridiculous.

20
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,169

          kind of show.

as I can into my face.

in my family's business.        

48

       That was Clemente's

     as a New York City cop,    

54

55

     to open up this mother     
of a market deli and restaurant.

 think of this idea?

to make the dough now.          

88

So, we'll dump the water

            Stromboli gone wild.

115
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:03,574
You take some olive oil,        
extra virgin, some locatelli.   

116
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,310
            I'm setting this out
               for Christmas.   

117
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:06,911
 Just little parsley            
   to dress it up.              

118
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,448
  So, here you go.              

119
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,916
                  That's...     

120
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,383
             Ah, it's too pretty
                   to eat.      

121
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,853
                No, it's not.   

122
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,124
             That is ridiculous.

123
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,860
              And when you cook 
             these Italian meats

124
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:25,130
         and you let all the fat
            cook into the dough,

125
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,664
    you just get all the flavor.

126
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,167
             The depth of flavor
             in this is massive.

127
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:34,406
              The key, though,  
        is how you cook the meat

128
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:35,807
               on the outside   
                of the bread.   

129
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,008
Gives it that crunch.           

130
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,810
               Out of bounds.   
       Seriously, out of bounds.

131
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,612
           -Thank you.          
  -Oh, you want this for sure.  

132
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,813
                  Trust me.     

133
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,316
                One more bite   
                just for you.   

134
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,487
                  An order      
            of prosciutto bread.

135
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,155
 You could eat it for breakfast,
        lunch or dinner.        

136
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,090
It has a really good kick       
to it, too, kind of spicy.      

137
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,425
    -Got a little heat to it?   
       -Got a little heat.      

138
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:55,026
   -So what can I do for you?   
      -Some vodka rigatoni.     

139
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,628
 Vodka rig, how much            
   would you like?              

140
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,630
 WOMAN: Anything that you could 
    possibly think of to make   

141
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,098
   for a Sunday family dinner   

142
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,233
      is available in Dolce     
          & Clemente's.         

143
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,503
 If you lived in a 5-mile radius
         of this place,         

144
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,038
     you'd rip your kitchen     
       out of your house.       

145
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,640
         -That's right.         
   -And make an extra bedroom.  

146
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,642
     Because you don't need     
           a kitchen.           

147
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,909
Boss of the sauce up.           

148
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,712
  Boss of the sauce, you could  
      feed an army with it.     

149
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,246
Pork and beef braciole,         

150
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,249
   baby back ribs,              
 homemade meatballs.            

151
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:19,317
       -All in the sauce?       
       -All in the sauce.       

152
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,386
       Boss of the sauce.       
   -You're going to love this.  

153
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,554
              See you in a bit. 

154
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:30,728
            FIERI: Welcome back.

155
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,998
       "Triple D" is hanging out
           at Dolce & Clemente's

156
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,733
              in Robbinsville,  
                 New Jersey,    

157
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,801
                 where this     
              ex-police officer 

158
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,403
              has come together 
          with his father-in-law

159
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:39,670
                  to make,      
            I'm not kidding you,

160
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,406
               one of the most  
              outrageous delis  

161
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:42,874
              you've ever seen  
                in your life.   

162
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,009
            What else           
      would you like today?     

163
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,011
        They simply offer       
       everything Italian.      

164
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,345
             Boss of the sauce. 

165
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,680
              MAN:              
  Boss of the sauce reminds me  

166
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,014
       of my grandmother's      
         Sunday dinner.         

167
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,883
             WOMAN:             
  Meatballs, sausage, braciole. 

168
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,419
     Everybody in the house     
  winds up happy from one dish. 

169
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,020
                    Now,        
          who started this dish?

170
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,955
Really, my grandmother.         
She called it Sunday sauce.     

171
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,023
                Sunday sauce.   

172
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,426
   So, let's start              
 with beef braciole.            

173
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,961
         -Do you sleep?         
           -Not much.           

174
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,830
  For the braciole,             
I use top round of beef.        

175
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:05,897
        And we're going to pound
                it a little.    

176
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,232
   Now we're going              
 to pound these out.            

177
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:08,900
  Salt and pepper,              

178
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,635
house-made bread crumb,         
  chopped parsley.              

179
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,036
                Parsley. Oh!    

180
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,371
   Little garlic.               

181
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,507
       Your family have interest
       in a breath-mint company?

182
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,842
Next is the soppressata.        

183
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,378
And then we go provolone.       
  We roll them up.              

184
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,981
Take some butcher's string      
  and you're done.              

185
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,717
      -Okay, meatballs now.     
  -Chopped beef, pork and veal. 

186
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,118
   We're going to               
   pour the eggs.               

187
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,720
           -Parmesan?           
       -Sicilian oregano.       

188
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,856
  -I could smell it from here.  
         -Stems and all.        

189
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,457
    Tomato paste,               
  chopped parsley,              

190
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,193
house-made bread crumb,         
   chopped garlic,              

191
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,262
  salt and pepper.              

192
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,396
 Knead them by hand.            

193
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,665
        You don't do much small,
                   do you?      
  No.                           

194
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,468
         -Bake them off?        
 -About 42 minutes, 325 degrees.

195
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,737
               I don't know if  
             I should bow to it.

196
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,205
This is the almighty.           

197
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,207
             This is ridiculous.
              Fire me up, boss. 

198
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,344
All right, so oil and real,     
natural butter, chopped celery. 

199
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:53,745
                 So you got     
            your mirepoix going.

200
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,748
Carrots, Spanish onion,         
   sliced garlic.               

201
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,683
            With the razor blade
           like in "Goodfellas"?

202
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:01,019
     -No, I use a mandolin.     
             -Okay.             

203
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,488
 Then I start to set            
    in da meats.                

204
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,089
              -Da.              
            -Da. Da.            

205
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,157
 And so we're going             
to put the pork ribs in it,     

206
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,559
 next we do a little            
   pork for gravy.              

207
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,294
        -I'm sorry what?        
        -Pork for gravy.        

208
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,563
        -Pork for gravy.        
 -There you go, beef for gravy. 

209
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,698
             -Yeah.             
     -Pork braciole's next.     

210
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,967
             Pork braciole also,
             real underachiever.

211
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,770
Beef braciole, hot sausage,     
   fennel sausage.              

212
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,238
         -All made here?        
         -All made here.        

213
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,640
                Can't believe   
           there's nothing else.

214
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,508
    Want to put a shoe in there,
              a baseball glove? 

215
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,444
San Marzano tomatoes,           
  crushed by hand.              

216
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,979
             -Okay.             
       -And tomato paste.       

217
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:30,115
  Salt and pepper,              
      oregano.                  

218
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,316
 After that's cooked            
    for a while,                

219
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:32,650
 we're going to add             
  the fresh basil.              

220
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,186
    -And then the meatballs.    
    -And then the meatballs.    

221
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:35,453
This goes for four hours.       

222
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,788
            And then we'll serve
              this with pasta?  

223
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,123
            -Pockety.           
            -Pockety?           

224
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,524
      Pockety,                  
   giant rigatoni.              

225
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,192
          -I'm so dumb.         
        -You're not dumb.       

226
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,527
     You're just                
  from California.              

227
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,630
              You're not dumb.  
    You're just from California.

228
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,268
        Okay, Boss of the sauce.
             That's a wristband.

229
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,403
 Just plate it right            
 on top of the pasta            

230
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,006
  and put the sauce             
    right on top,               

231
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,674
    a big dollop                
  of fresh ricotta.             

232
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,410
               I like how you   
        really do things subtly,

233
00:07:58,412 --> 00:07:59,611
              really delicate.  

234
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,746
             It's such finesse. 

235
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,482
Chopped parsley and then        
fresh-grated locatelli.         

236
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,484
       -What's locatelli?       
-It's basically Pecorino Romano.

237
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,685
                   Uh-huh.      

238
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,088
  Just on a higher              
classification and that's it.   

239
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,256
                Look at that.   

240
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,027
         That's, um, ridiculous.

241
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,962
               I've never seen  
            anybody go this far.

242
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,698
             The pork braciole, 
             the beef braciole, 

243
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,033
           the homemade sausage,
         the homemade meatballs,

244
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,168
              all those things  
                put together.   

245
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,769
          But you really take it
                over the top    

246
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,304
             and that's kind of 
      the attitude or the energy

247
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,639
              that I'm catching 
           from the whole place.

248
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:30,242
  Yeah.                         
             Because everything 
              is over the top.  

249
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:33,979
       You're cooking for people

250
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,846
       like it's your daughter's
                wedding day.    

251
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,382
       I try.                   

252
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:41,119
               I find them all  
        and you are truly a gem.

253
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,120
                Outstanding.    

254
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,788
Here's a beef braciole.         

255
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,390
   Yeah, it's like              
   a meat heaven.               

256
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,592
           A good buddy of mine,
     Roland and his friend Noah.

257
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:51,262
     Roland has a fantastic show
        on SiriusXM, channel 206

258
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,131
                   called       
          "Roland's Food Court."

259
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,600
     He does that with my buddy,
   Carl Ruiz. What do you think?

260
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,735
This is one of the best sauces  
  I've ever tasted.             

261
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,738
   So meaty, rich, delicious.   
     -This is so much food.     

262
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,139
               Take that home.  
               Take that home.  

263
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,408
              You got a couple  
           of days of leftovers.

264
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,876
           Thank you.           
        Have a nice day.        

265
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,278
    MAN: Dolce & Clemente's,    
       each and every time      

266
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,080
 will exceed your expectations. 

267
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,949
   Awesome place,               
  the whole thing.              

268
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,283
     -Thank you. Thank you.     
        -Very impressed.        

269
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,619
        I appreciate it.        

270
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,687
        FIERI: Coming up        
   in Louisville, Kentucky...   

271
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:17,555
   This is funky.               

272
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,224
    ...over-the-top seafood.    

273
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,292
  It's really good.             

274
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:21,960
    ...at an under-the-radar    
         kind of joint.         

275
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,829
You might be up there           
 in the championship            

276
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,731
     dive joints                
   of "Triple D."               

277
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,002
                Welcome back.   
                  Triple --     

278
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:34,439
               5, 4, 3, 2. No,  
         not the hug. [ Laughs ]

279
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,542
    So, the name of the show    

280
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,012
      is "Diners, Drive-Ins     
           and Dives."          

281
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,747
    Oh, we find a good amount   
          of drive-ins,         

282
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,616
       quite a few diners,      
  but we don't find many dives. 

283
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,752
   So I'm here in Louisville,   
      Kentucky, at a joint      

284
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,487
   that's in an old tire shop.  

285
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,088
 That sounds like a dive to me. 

286
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,258
    This is The Seafood Lady.   

287
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,228
         Cajun crawfish.        

288
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,432
 This is the definition of good,
    Southern seafood cooking.   

289
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,167
    NICHELLE: Fried gator up.   

290
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:04,369
 She brought a taste of Florida 
           to Kentucky          

291
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:05,436
     that we really needed.     

292
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,905
  -Where'd you get the recipe?  
        -My grandfather.        

293
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,307
                He was a chef   
        in the Navy for a while.

294
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,908
                  He cooked     
             for so many people.

295
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,644
             FIERI:             
   And when Nichelle Thurston   

296
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,980
      came up from Florida      
 to her husband Luke's hometown,

297
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,582
        she began cooking       
      for big crowds, too.      

298
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,051
       I would come home to like
       30-40 people on my porch,

299
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,052
        I'll be like, "Hold up."

300
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,453
              -No.              
             -Yeah.             

301
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,321
 FIERI: So they knew it was time
       to make it official      

302
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,257
 and The Seafood Lady was born. 

303
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,726
  WOMAN: You can't go anywhere  
    in Louisville, Kentucky,    

304
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,128
  and get this type of seafood. 

305
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,929
                For you, sir,   
               the full combo.  

306
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,132
      The full combo plate      
          is crab legs,         

307
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,200
     shrimp, potatoes, corn,    

308
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,669
     boiled egg and sausage.    

309
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,338
    If you're hungry, that's    
   definitely the dish to get.  

310
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,539
        Okay,                   
what are we making first?       

311
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,808
               The Cajun boil   
               and full combo.  

312
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,143
     Cajun boil                 
   and full combo.              

313
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,212
             You get bay leaves,
             black peppercorns. 

314
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,881
            -Oregano.           
        -Pickling spice,        

315
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,216
        cinnamon, mustard seeds.

316
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:53,084
       This is                  
your grandpa's recipe?          

317
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,687
                Yes. Paprika,   
             red pepper flakes. 

318
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,088
Whole mess of Cayenne.          

319
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,958
           Fresh dill, sea salt.

320
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,093
             -Adobo.            
           -Coriander.          

321
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,429
             -Thyme.            
        -Cardamom seeds.        

322
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:05,697
    Kitchen sink.               

323
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:09,968
            Ginger, whole onion,
         green onion and celery.

324
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,502
      And then we'll add...     
           -Potatoes.           

325
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,572
        ...corn, smoked sausage.

326
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:15,907
                 Whole eggs.    

327
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,109
That's like the little gem      
that everybody gets.            

328
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,845
     -I know you hate eggs.     
       -Snow crab, shrimp.      

329
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,313
               We'll cook this  
            for about 15 minutes

330
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:23,781
             until the potatoes 
                  are done.     

331
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:24,982
              Okay.             
           -All right.          

332
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,384
             We're going to make
         the full combo platter.

333
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:29,120
             Two potato halves, 
          one snow crab cluster,

334
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,588
           one full ear of corn,

335
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,257
     two of your smoked sausage,

336
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,925
              10 jumbo shrimps. 

337
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,126
           -Shells on?          
              -Yes.             

338
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,794
            One Cajun boiled egg

339
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,396
              and then you add  
         the house sauce on top,

340
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,531
              which is butter,  
              garlic, Cayenne,  

341
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,601
   Cajun seasoning, lemon juice,
    lime juice and onion powder.

342
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:47,105
       And then we add the Cajun
          seasoning and parsley.

343
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,875
                  Perfect.      

344
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,543
Just want to make sure          
in front of The Seafood Lady    

345
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,245
that I got stuff right.         

346
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,416
  Just warming up.              

347
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,684
                 [ Laughs ]     

348
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:03,855
Shrimp's great. Crab's great.   
   Tons of flavor.              

349
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:07,025
   You know you do              
 your spices right.             

350
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:09,493
  Mmm, I love this              
 house sauce on top.            

351
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,162
         -Kicks it out.         
           -Oh, yeah.           

352
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:14,299
   That Cajun dust              
at the end is spot on.          

353
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:15,834
     I'm having                 
  a difficult time              

354
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:18,169
   trying to host               
  my show right now             

355
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:22,507
as I'm shoveling this as fast   
as I can into my face.          

356
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,443
 That's really good.            
  Back to business.             

357
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:26,577
                 [ Laughs ]     

358
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,712
      It's exciting taste.      

359
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,582
       Kind of a down-home      
        Southern flavor.        

360
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,316
      You know Damaris Phillips.
             One of our judges, 

361
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,851
          one of our competitors
               on "Triple D."   

362
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,120
     So, it's legit, right?     
         -It's so good.         

363
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,923
 And for this Louisville native,
      it's super familiar.      

364
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,125
        She said it's right next
       to my parent's old house.

365
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,327
Literally next door.            

366
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,929
When we were little kids,       
this was a tire shop called,    

367
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,531
Don't boot that tire,           
       cap it.                  

368
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:47,599
                  What it?      

369
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,134
Don't boot that tire, Guy.      
       Cap it.                  

370
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,403
        Ah, I think Seafood Lady
             sounds way better. 

371
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,938
             WOMAN:             
It's kind of a hole in the wall,

372
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,540
         but it's always        
      a line out the door.      

373
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,809
I mean, this just has           
so much personality.            

374
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:00,011
            -It does.           
  -This Saturday, I sing here.  

375
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:03,014
  The Seafood Lady              
    has a lounge.               

376
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,348
   And it's a lot               
   of great food.               

377
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,551
               For you, ma'am,  
              we have the hulk. 

378
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,419
   The hulk is fried lobster,   

379
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,688
          fried shrimp          
    and a buttermilk waffle.    

380
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,089
                 All right,     
            lobster and waffles,

381
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,892
      my life is complete.      
    -What are we making now?    

382
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,426
             We're going to make
            a house-made waffle.

383
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,762
     I'm going to put the flour,
               baking powder,   

384
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,463
                sugar, salt,    

385
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,300
           little oil, two eggs,
               vanilla, milk.   

386
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,768
       I like it a little thick,

387
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,970
                so I can get    
         a really fluffy waffle.

388
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,172
     All right.                 

389
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:28,505
                 We're going    
          to make the fry batter

390
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,642
               for the lobster  
               and the shrimp.  

391
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,043
             -Okay.             
        -Yellow cornmeal.       

392
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,511
   And this again               
is one of grandpa's?            

393
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,179
                  Yes, all      
             grandpa's secrets. 

394
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,716
            Flour, onion powder,
             granulated garlic, 

395
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:41,252
               Cayenne pepper,  
               paprika, adobo,  

396
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,721
                black pepper,   
             sea salt and thyme.

397
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,723
Got to have the thyme.          
  Now what happens?             

398
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:48,726
           Pop this sucker open,
                roll him out.   

399
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,929
   Like old-school              
 dinner-house style.            

400
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,864
           And then we'll batter
                 the shrimp.    

401
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:57,068
Deep fry the whole tail         
   and the shell.               

402
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,069
             Now we're going to 
            pull the waffle out.

403
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,404
        Okay.                   

404
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,606
             I'm going to top it
    with the deep-fried lobster,

405
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:05,877
             deep-fried shrimp, 
     top off with mayo, parsley.

406
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,346
              Then you serve it 
                 with syrup.    

407
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,147
            There you have it --
                  the hulk.     

408
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,684
That's a good-looking           
    lobster tail.               

409
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:13,985
                 Thank you.     

410
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,692
    The dredge...               
   out of bounds.               

411
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,027
   It's not heavy,              
    not too much.               

412
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,762
You don't overcook your         
seafood, which is great.        

413
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:26,230
       You got                  
 that seafood hand.             

414
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,099
Get a piece of waffle,          

415
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:31,035
  tear off a chunk              
   of that shrimp               

416
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,838
  and a little bit              
   of that sauce.               

417
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,573
That's a bite right there.      

418
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,309
         Order up, hulk.        

419
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,979
        The fried lobster       
 is just definition of amazing. 

420
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,713
        WOMAN: Mixed with       
     the buttermilk waffle,     

421
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,915
   I really can't explain it.   

422
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,717
    But it dances in my mouth   
      and it works perfect.     

423
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,719
            NICHELLE:           
   Lobster and cheesy fry up.   

424
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,456
  No other place in Louisville  
  compares to The Seafood Lady. 

425
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,123
There's a line of people        
  outside right now             

426
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,926
and I know why because          
 you're killing it.             

427
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,595
   This is funky.               
You might be up there           

428
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:00,698
 in the championship            
dive joints of "Triple D."      

429
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,301
        Yes.                    

430
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,740
  FIERI: Up next, a legit food  
  truck in Portland, Oregon...  

431
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,675
I like the way you roll.        
       ...'cueing it up...      

432
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,143
That nice smoke ring            
    right there.                

433
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:13,344
     ...and doing it right.     

434
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,545
Come on, dude, you can't get    
any better than that.           

435
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,921
      I'm here in Northeast     
        Portland, Oregon,       

436
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,589
       in the parking lot       
         of a pawn shop         

437
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,392
and the story just gets weirder.

438
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,193
     You see, there's a dude    
        from Long Island        

439
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:30,728
    and he moves all the way    
          to Australia          

440
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,596
    to study Texas barbecue.    
          That's right.         

441
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,732
       Then he comes back       
    with his Australian wife.   

442
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,067
        Well, they travel       
         across country         

443
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:38,202
        to the west coast       
  and they open up this joint.  

444
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:40,238
       This is Matt's BBQ.      

445
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,208
    Hot mess and                
a chopped brisket sandwich.     

446
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,278
    This is such a step above   
  any other place in Portland.  

447
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,680
          It's always like this?
               Always packed?   

448
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:49,947
Always like this, yeah.         

449
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,816
             Can we get four of 
          the pulled pork tacos?

450
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,151
      It's just incredible.     

451
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,286
     FIERI: All the hype is     
      for Matt Vicedomini,      

452
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,288
    who ditched New York City   
 fine dining to head down under.

453
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,623
    VICEDOMINI: And I took a job
               as a sous-chef   

454
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,959
           and they had a smoker
                 in the back    

455
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,627
            and they were making
            Texas-style barbecue

456
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,961
                 and, yeah,     
             I just got hooked. 

457
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,297
   So hooked that he came back  
         to the States,         

458
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,499
    tasted the best barbecue    
       around the country       

459
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,168
        and finally found       
        a place to park.        

460
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,170
     Portland is not south,     

461
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,839
     but Matt's bringing it     
   right here in a food cart.   

462
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,040
And the favorite thing          
that he has on the menu         

463
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,374
   that you enjoy?              

464
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,977
WOMAN: I love the ribs the most.
             They're delicious. 

465
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,780
We're related if you couldn't   
 tell from the hair.            

466
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,581
VICEDOMINI: Half pound of ribs  
  with pinto beans.             

467
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,117
          The way he smokes them

468
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,252
               puts just this   
          incredible bark on it.

469
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:31,121
All right, big Matt's BBQ,      
we got a full spare rib.        

470
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,523
         -That's right.         
       -Show me the magic.      

471
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,324
     So, yeah, first thing we're
    going to do is trim it down,

472
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,259
          round it out.         
             -Okay.             

473
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:36,527
              We're just going  
               to season them.  

474
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,197
           All our rubs are salt
        and pepper, Texas style,

475
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,398
and we'll put them on the smoker
          for four to six hours.

476
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,668
             We run pretty hot, 
             roughly around 275.

477
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,803
     I like to say hot and slow,
              not low and slow. 

478
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,338
             We get a great bark
                on our ribs.    

479
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,874
I'm expecting at 275,           
     we better.                 

480
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,543
All right.                      
                 So this is     
    for our smoked garlic jelly,

481
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,011
             which we turn into 
               our rib glaze.   

482
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,146
 Onions and garlic?             

483
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,748
        Yeah, we're going to get
        a lot of smoke on there.

484
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,282
           -How long?           
        -Two hours maybe.       

485
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,217
              Add some vinegar  
      and let it soak overnight.

486
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,552
 Soften it up a bit             
      and then                  

487
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:02,953
  we're going to go             
to an immersion blender.        

488
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,223
              Yup. We're going  
              to add our sugar, 

489
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,157
             cook this for about
              20 to 30 minutes. 

490
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,426
  So, this is just              
the jelly not the glaze?        

491
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,428
Mmm, I don't know what          
you're going to put that on     

492
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,830
   but anything would be good.  
             -Yeah.             

493
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,499
              So, we're making  
             the rib glaze now. 

494
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:15,900
Equal parts of ketchup          
     and jelly.                 

495
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,835
                That's right.   
               Worcestershire.  

496
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,103
Worcestershire sauce?           

497
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,637
              Just whisk it up. 

498
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,240
               Ribs just came   
               off the smoker.  

499
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:23,841
                 We'll take     
             our barbecue sauce 

500
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,576
                on the foil,    
              put the ribs on,  

501
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,778
        I'm just going to hit it
            with the glaze here.

502
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,980
       Flip them, barbecue sauce
                 in the back    

503
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,983
          and then they're ready
               to get wrapped.  

504
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:33,584
 And how long you're            
leaving them wrapped?           

505
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,119
     I like to rest for at least
               a half an hour   

506
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,654
     and they're good to go.    
         -Look at that.         

507
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:40,057
   Three quarter pounds of ribs,
   potato salad and pinto beans.

508
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,327
That nice smoke ring            
    right there.                

509
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:46,730
Good rib buddy, lightly         
sauced, lightly glazed,         

510
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,532
 pull apart tender.             

511
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,735
Potato salad's spot on.         

512
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,804
The beans are a meal            
   in themselves.               

513
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,472
All here in the parking         
 lot of a pawn shop.            

514
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,807
         -That's right.         
    -I like the way you roll.   

515
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,543
              Yeah, thank you.  
     Here's your rib plate, sir.

516
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:01,345
           -Thank you.          
        -So, so, so good.       

517
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:02,814
              MAN:              
   Some of the best I've eaten  

518
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:05,883
       and I've eaten ribs      
          in 37 states.         

519
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,217
             MAN #2:            
      Matt does a whole lot     

520
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,952
   in that little bitty space   
          that he has.          

521
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,655
      -Oh, we make it work.     
   -What year is this trailer?  

522
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,824
             -1976.             
        -It's a nice one.       

523
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,026
                 Thank you.     

524
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:16,426
       It looked a lot different
               when I got it.   

525
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,229
  MAN #3: There's some prettier 
       carts in the city,       

526
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:19,363
        but I don't think       
     they're producing food     

527
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:20,698
 anywhere near the same quality.

528
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,966
           VICEDOMINI:          
      The whole shabamwich.     

529
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,367
      What's in                 
the whole shabamwich?           

530
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,769
          All our meats         
         in a sandwich.         

531
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,572
           It is a taste shabam.

532
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:28,840
   What's up next?              

533
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:31,375
-Our spice mix for our sausages.
         -Let's hit it.         

534
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,177
                First thing,    
           salt and some pepper,

535
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,713
        paprika, Cayenne pepper,
                 some water.    

536
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,515
  And we're making              
  a pork and beef?              

537
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,250
              Our sausages are  
              all rib trimmings 

538
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,518
          and brisket trimmings.

539
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,253
Come on, dude, you can't get    
any better than that.           

540
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,454
  Yeah, totally. I like to grind
   it up with some fresh garlic.

541
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,056
And after it goes through that, 
we're going to hit it           

542
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,658
      with the spice blend?     
              -Yep.             

543
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,860
              And then I'm just 
           mixing with my hands.

544
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,129
 -And we're going to case this. 
           -Oh, yeah.           

545
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,265
      Now, we're going to season
the other meats from the smoker.

546
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,600
            -Got it.            
      -Pork butt and again      

547
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:57,801
        it's all salt and pepper
      and then with the brisket,

548
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,203
            it's salt and pepper

549
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,671
             except we'll hit it
   with a little bit of mustard.

550
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,273
It adds a little flavor,        
  a little vinegar.             

551
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,141
           That's it. It's ready
               for the smoker.  

552
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,477
   -How long for the sausage?   
  -I try to go an hour and 15.  

553
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,746
      Pork is 6 to 8 hours.     
        -And the brisket?       

554
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,814
        -Around 14 hours.       
-Okay, are you ready to do this?

555
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,949
             First, we're going 
              to pull the pork  

556
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:13,818
             and we season this 
           with chipotle vinegar

557
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,287
  that we make at the cart here,
               salt and sugar.  

558
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,289
             -Sugar?            
           -Oh, yeah.           

559
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,757
I've seen a lot in my day,      
I've never seen that.           

560
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,159
             So, the first thing
               on the sandwich  

561
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,562
                 are pickles    
          and pickled red onion,

562
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:27,898
                pulled pork,    
            sausage just on top.

563
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,366
  And will there be             
  nine lumberjacks              

564
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,701
   that will come               
    to eat this?                

565
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:33,037
           Yeah, there's a pound
       of meat in this sandwich.

566
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,439
           So, then we'll hit it
             our barbecue sauce,

567
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:38,175
    brisket on top, coleslaw.   
           -Of course.          

568
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:42,446
        And then a giant skewer,
          rib, whole shabamwich.

569
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,181
That's just flat-out            
     ridiculous.                

570
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,183
I don't know exactly            
 how to attack this.            

571
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:50,254
I think it'd be better          
if I just got on the tray.      

572
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,092
   This definitely              
  deserves a hunch.             

573
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,932
         I got any here?        
           -A little.           

574
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:02,934
         -A little bit?         
             -Yeah.             

575
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:04,335
Nothing to worry about          
 in front of the TV?            

576
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,537
             It's totally fine. 
          It makes me look good.

577
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,805
It makes you look good.         
 It's dynamite, man.            

578
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,141
 I want to tell you             
     right now,                 

579
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:11,676
     the sausage                
   is outrageous.               

580
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,877
Look at this, the juice         
that comes out of that sausage. 

581
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,079
The brisket's spot on.          

582
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,614
Little vinegar chipotle         
kick from the pulled pork.      

583
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,884
Well, you're not hiding         
 any of the barbecue            

584
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,018
in a bunch of sauce.            

585
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,353
          We spend a lot of time
                 cooking it     

586
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,021
             and we want people 
          to taste it, you know.

587
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:26,824
 You really should.             
     Shabamwich.                

588
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,893
         The pulled pork        
          is fantastic.         

589
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,294
    The sausage is the best.    

590
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,763
   The brisket's world class,   
 some of the best I've ever had.

591
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,431
       Kill it                  
every single time here.         

592
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,766
             The two-meat combo.

593
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,768
   I love it, man.              
I see why you're doing so well. 

594
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,170
      -Yeah, awesome, man.      
           -Congrats.           

595
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,839
          So, that's it         
       for this road trip,      

596
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:42,907
        but don't worry.        

597
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,442
    We got plenty more joints   
             to find            

598
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:45,843
     all over this country.     

599
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,578
         I'll be looking        
        for you next time       

600
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,114
      on "Diners, Drive-Ins     
           and Dives."          

601
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,248
  What do you guys              
  call each other?              

602
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,516
      I call him Mr. Crabs.     

603
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:54,051
  What do you call              
  the Seafood Lady?             

604
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:56,053
            -Come on.           
      -Miss Crabs, come on!     

605
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,188
          [ Laughter ]          

606
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,690
Best interview in years.
