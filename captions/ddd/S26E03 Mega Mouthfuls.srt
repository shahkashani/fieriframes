00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:05,171
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,640
I'm Guy Fieri,
and we're rolling out

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,710
looking for America's greatest
diners, drive‐ins, and dives.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:10,877
This trip...

5
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:11,778
Oh!

6
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:13,079
...we're unhinging the jaw...

7
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,414
You don't do much small,
do you?

8
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:17,050
...for some major mouthful.

9
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,284
Will there be nine lumberjacks
who will come to eat this?

10
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,954
I'm not kidding you,
just listen to the lineup.

11
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,289
That's the official
football of Flavortown.

12
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,526
We got the boss
and the sauce in Jersey...

13
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,393
I've never seen
anybody go this far.

14
00:00:27,393 --> 00:00:29,062
...the hulk in Louisville...

15
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:30,396
That's a bite
right there.

16
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:32,733
...and in Oregon,
the whole shabamwich.

17
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,100
I don't know exactly
how to attack this.

18
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,269
It's a loosen‐the‐belt...

19
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,871
That is ridiculous.

20
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,173
...and strap‐on‐a‐napkin
kind of show.

21
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:43,009
I'm having a difficult time
trying to host my show

22
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,312
as I'm shoveling this as fast
as I can into my face.

23
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,649
That's all right here,
right now,

24

on "Triple D."

25
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:03,670
You know I love being
from California.

26
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,138
We got some of
the best of the best,

27
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:07,874
but what I wish we had more of
is old‐school Italian Delis

28
00:01:07,874 --> 00:01:08,942
like this, where they're

29
00:01:08,942 --> 00:01:10,511
scratch‐making
their own desserts.

30
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:12,513
They got a deli case
full of everything.

31
00:01:12,513 --> 00:01:13,980
We're talking about
prepared meals.

32
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,683
We're talking fresh pasta,
homemade sausage.

33
00:01:16,683 --> 00:01:18,084
I mean, you name it,
they got it.

34
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:19,452
So, the next time
you find yourself

35
00:01:19,452 --> 00:01:20,854
in Robbinsville, New Jersey,

36
00:01:20,854 --> 00:01:22,889
you got to check out
Dolce &amp; Clemente's.

37
00:01:22,889 --> 00:01:25,491
‐Yay!
‐Right on.

38
00:01:27,493 --> 00:01:29,395
Stuffed roast pork is ready.
Come get it.

39
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:31,598
‐Just an awesome place.
‐Who's next?

40
00:01:31,598 --> 00:01:33,867
Authentic Italian,
there's nothing here that isn't.

41
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:35,702

after the sauce?

FIERI: Which are Italian
specialties owner Joe Clemente

46
00:01:42,676 --> 00:01:44,545
has learned over a lifetime.

47
00:01:44,545 --> 00:01:46,613
I started when I was 9
in my family's business.

48
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:49,315
That was Clemente's
Italian market in Brooklyn,

49
00:01:49,315 --> 00:01:50,951
not far from the butcher shop

50
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:54,420

Frank Dolce, grew up in.

I started 8 years old.

FIERI: And after Joe spent time
as a New York City cop,

54
00:01:59,726 --> 00:02:01,194
he and Frank joined forces

55
00:02:01,194 --> 00:02:04,571
to open up this mother
of a market deli and restaurant.

56
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:05,872
And what did the family
think of this idea?

57
00:02:05,872 --> 00:02:08,208
‐It was terrible.
‐Nobody was excited?

58
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,076
‐No.
‐No.

59
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:11,678
‐But it's a perfect combo.
‐Yeah.

60
00:02:11,678 --> 00:02:13,580
You got everything
from sauces to salads.

61
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,716
And homemade Italian bread
that is just delicious.

62
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:18,417
I'll take one
prosciutto bread, please.

63
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:19,753
MAN:
That prosciutto bread,

00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:21,755
my most favorite thing
that Dolce &amp; Clemente serves.

Filled with all different
varieties of meat.

‐Stuffed prosciutto bread?
‐Mm‐hmm.

67
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:28,562
Hit it.
First I'm going
to put in the prosciutto.

68
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:30,230
It's so quiet.

69
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,566
Next, we'll put
the ham in, mortadella.

70
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:34,334
Ground‐up mortadella.

71
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:35,769
That should've been
my middle name.

72
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:38,171
Next, I'm going
to put the soppressata in.

73
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:40,006
Where'd this recipe
come from?

74
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:42,042
My grandfather.
Pepperoni.

75
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:43,510
During the holidays,
we'll sell between

76
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,646
15,000 to 20,000
of these Christmas week.

77

‐I'm sorry, 15 what?
‐20,000.

78
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:48,915
‐Of this?
‐Of these.

79
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:51,417
‐And you bake them all here.
‐All here.

80
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:53,754
I put the provolone
last so it can grab

81
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:55,255
all the meat
that's left inside there.

82
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:56,489
I dig it.

83
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:57,958
Then we put
the crushed black pepper.

84
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,434
I would like a snow cone
of that please.

85
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:03,770
Just for science.

86
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,806
It's so good.
Don't touch that.

87
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:07,974
We're going
to make the dough now.

88
00:03:07,974 --> 00:03:10,744
So, we'll dump the water
in the mixer bowl, yeast.

89
00:03:10,744 --> 00:03:11,978
Salt and sugar together.

90
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:14,314
Next is the oil.

91
00:03:14,314 --> 00:03:16,216
Type of flour
we're working with?
High gluten.

92
00:03:16,216 --> 00:03:18,251
‐Like a pizza dough flour.
‐Like a pizza dough flour, yep.

93
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:20,521
‐On the mixer, how long?
‐About 10‐12 minutes.

94
00:03:20,521 --> 00:03:22,556
Then we portion it,
then we let them rest overnight.

95
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:23,790
Okay.

96
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,859
This is how we've been
doing it for years in my family.

97
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:28,161
Push it down on one side
and flip it over.

98
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:30,163
You make sure you got enough
on the other side.

99
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:31,464
And you pick it up
and fold over.

100
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:33,567
Fold it over
from the outside.

101
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,001
Start making your fold.

102
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:36,269
And you just roll it.

103
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:39,339
That's the official
football of Flavortown.

104
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:40,941
I got to see that again.

105
00:03:40,941 --> 00:03:43,143
Set some music to it.

106
00:03:43,143 --> 00:03:44,344
Maybe Italian opera.

[ Opera music plays ]

108
00:03:51,685 --> 00:03:53,687
Then we bake it off.
What temp?

109
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:54,755
350, 38 minutes.

110
00:03:54,755 --> 00:03:56,690

[ Whistles ]
Too pretty to cut.

112
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:00,493
No, you got to cut one

00:04:00,493 --> 00:04:02,135
‐All right.
‐All right.

114
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:03,369
Stromboli gone wild.

115
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:06,573
You take some olive oil,
extra virgin, some locatelli.

00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:08,374
I'm setting this out
for Christmas.

117
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:09,910
Just little parsley
to dress it up.

118
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,513
So, here you go.

119
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:13,980
That's...

120
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,381
Ah, it's too pretty
to eat.

121
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:17,918
No, it's not.

122
00:04:20,754 --> 00:04:22,088
That is ridiculous.

123
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:24,925
And when you cook
these Italian meats

124
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:28,161
and you let all the fat
cook into the dough,

125
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:29,696
you just get all the flavor.

126
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:32,265
The depth of flavor
in this is massive.

127
00:04:34,534 --> 00:04:37,470
The key, though,
is how you cook the meat

128
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,805
on the outside
of the bread.

129
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:40,073

00:06:08,842 --> 00:06:10,677
For the braciole,
I use top round of beef.

175
00:06:10,677 --> 00:06:11,745
And we're going to pound
it a little.

176
00:06:11,745 --> 00:06:13,146
Now we're going
to pound these out.

177
00:06:13,146 --> 00:06:14,848
Salt and pepper,

178
00:06:14,848 --> 00:06:16,517
house‐made bread crumb,
chopped parsley.

179
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:17,951
Parsley. Oh!

180
00:06:17,951 --> 00:06:19,285
Little garlic.

181
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:21,354
Your family have interest
in a breath‐mint company?

182
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:23,724
Next is the soppressata.

183
00:06:23,724 --> 00:06:26,259
And then we go provolone.
We roll them up.

184
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:28,829
Take some butcher's string
and you're done.

185
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:31,665
‐Okay, meatballs now.
‐Chopped beef, pork and veal.

186
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:32,966
We're going to
pour the eggs.

187
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:34,635
‐Parmesan?
‐Sicilian oregano.

188
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:36,703
‐I could smell it from here.
‐Stems and all.

189
00:06:36,703 --> 00:06:38,371
Tomato paste,
chopped parsley,

190
00:06:38,371 --> 00:06:41,141
house‐made bread crumb,
chopped garlic,

191
00:06:41,141 --> 00:06:43,109
salt and pepper.

192
00:06:43,109 --> 00:06:44,277
Knead them by hand.

193
00:06:44,277 --> 00:06:46,647
You don't do much small,
do you?
No.

194
00:06:46,647 --> 00:06:49,382
‐Bake them off?
‐About 42 minutes, 325 degrees.

195
00:06:49,382 --> 00:06:51,718
I don't know if
I should bow to it.

196
00:06:51,718 --> 00:06:53,119
This is the almighty.

197
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:55,121
This is ridiculous.
Fire me up, boss.

198
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:58,224
All right, so oil and real,
natural butter, chopped celery.

199
00:06:58,224 --> 00:06:59,726
So you got
your mirepoix going.

200
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:02,703
Carrots, Spanish onion,
sliced garlic.

201
00:07:02,703 --> 00:07:04,671
With the razor blade
like in "Goodfellas"?

202
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:06,907
‐No, I use a mandolin.
‐Okay.

203
00:07:06,907 --> 00:07:09,342
Then I start to set
in da meats.

204
00:07:09,342 --> 00:07:10,944
‐Da.
‐Da. Da.

205
00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:12,012
And so we're going
to put the pork ribs in it,

206
00:07:12,012 --> 00:07:13,379
next we do a little
pork for gravy.

207
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:15,115
‐I'm sorry what?
‐Pork for gravy.

208
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:17,450
‐Pork for gravy.
‐There you go, beef for gravy.

209
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,553
‐Yeah.
‐Pork braciole's next.

210
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:21,822
Pork braciole also,
real underachiever.

211
00:07:21,822 --> 00:07:24,625
Beef braciole, hot sausage,
fennel sausage.

212
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,159
‐All made here?
‐All made here.

213
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:27,594
Can't believe
there's nothing else.

214
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:29,462
Want to put a shoe in there,
a baseball glove?

215
00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:32,332
San Marzano tomatoes,
crushed by hand.

216
00:07:32,332 --> 00:07:33,900
‐Okay.
‐And tomato paste.

217
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,969
Salt and pepper,
oregano.

218
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:37,237
After that's cooked
for a while,

219
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:38,572
we're going to add
the fresh basil.

220
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:40,140
‐And then the meatballs.
‐And then the meatballs.

221
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,374
This goes for four hours.

222
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:42,709
And then we'll serve
this with pasta?

223
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:43,977
‐Pockety.
‐Pockety?

224
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:45,411
Pockety,
giant rigatoni.

225
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:47,113
‐I'm so dumb.
‐You're not dumb.

226
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:48,381
You're just
from California.

227
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:51,585
You're not dumb.
You're just from California.

228
00:07:53,053 --> 00:07:56,222
Okay, Boss of the sauce.
That's a wristband.

229
00:07:56,222 --> 00:07:58,358
Just plate it right
on top of the pasta

230
00:07:58,358 --> 00:08:00,934
and put the sauce
right on top,

231
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:02,636
a big dollop
of fresh ricotta.

232
00:08:02,636 --> 00:08:04,304
I like how you
really do things subtly,

233
00:08:04,304 --> 00:08:05,506
really delicate.

234
00:08:05,506 --> 00:08:07,574
It's such finesse.

235
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:10,343
Chopped parsley and then
fresh‐grated locatelli.

236
00:08:10,343 --> 00:08:12,345
‐What's locatelli?
‐It's basically Pecorino Romano.

237
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:13,547
Uh‐huh.

238
00:08:13,547 --> 00:08:16,016
Just on a higher
classification and that's it.

239
00:08:16,016 --> 00:08:17,183
Look at that.

240
00:08:19,753 --> 00:08:21,955
That's, um, ridiculous.

241
00:08:21,955 --> 00:08:23,824
I've never seen
anybody go this far.

242
00:08:23,824 --> 00:08:25,659
The pork braciole,
the beef braciole,

243
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:27,894
the homemade sausage,
the homemade meatballs,

244
00:08:27,894 --> 00:08:29,129
all those things
put together.

245
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:30,664
But you really take it
over the top

246
00:08:30,664 --> 00:08:32,232
and that's kind of
the attitude or the energy

247
00:08:32,232 --> 00:08:33,567
that I'm catching
from the whole place.

248
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:36,202
Yeah.
Because everything
is over the top.

249
00:08:38,505 --> 00:08:39,940
You're cooking for people

250
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,742
like it's your daughter's
wedding day.

251
00:08:41,742 --> 00:08:43,309
I try.

252
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:47,047
I find them all
and you are truly a gem.

253
00:08:47,047 --> 00:08:48,081
Outstanding.

254
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:49,650
Here's a beef braciole.

255
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,251
Yeah, it's like
a meat heaven.

256
00:08:51,251 --> 00:08:53,554
A good buddy of mine,
Roland and his friend Noah.

257
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:57,190
Roland has a fantastic show
on SiriusXM, channel 206

258
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,025
called
"Roland's Food Court."

259
00:08:59,025 --> 00:09:01,535
He does that with my buddy,
Carl Ruiz. What do you think?

260
00:09:01,535 --> 00:09:03,670
This is one of the best sauces
I've ever tasted.

261
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,707
So meaty, rich, delicious.
‐This is so much food.

262
00:09:06,707 --> 00:09:08,008
Take that home.
Take that home.

263
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:09,242
You got a couple
of days of leftovers.

264
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:10,711
Thank you.
Have a nice day.

265
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:13,179
MAN: Dolce &amp; Clemente's,
each and every time

266
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:15,015
will exceed your expectations.

267
00:09:15,015 --> 00:09:16,883
Awesome place,
the whole thing.

268
00:09:16,883 --> 00:09:18,151
‐Thank you. Thank you.
‐Very impressed.

269
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:20,453
I appreciate it.

270
00:09:20,453 --> 00:09:22,556
FIERI: Coming up
in Louisville, Kentucky...

271
00:09:22,556 --> 00:09:23,423
This is funky.

272
00:09:23,423 --> 00:09:25,158
...over‐the‐top seafood.

273
00:09:25,158 --> 00:09:26,226
It's really good.

274
00:09:26,226 --> 00:09:27,794
...at an under‐the‐radar
kind of joint.

275
00:09:27,794 --> 00:09:30,764
You might be up there
in the championship

276
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:32,699
dive joints
of "Triple D."

277
00:09:38,404 --> 00:09:39,740
Welcome back.
Triple ‐‐

278
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,276
5, 4, 3, 2. No,
not the hug. [ Laughs ]

279
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:47,313
So, the name of the show

280
00:09:47,313 --> 00:09:49,750
is "Diners, Drive‐Ins
and Dives."

281
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,484
Oh, we find a good amount
of drive‐ins,

282
00:09:51,484 --> 00:09:54,387
quite a few diners,
but we don't find many dives.

283
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:56,590
So I'm here in Louisville,
Kentucky, at a joint

284
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,258
that's in an old tire shop.

285
00:09:58,258 --> 00:09:59,860
That sounds like a dive to me.

286
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,035
This is The Seafood Lady.

287
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,006
Cajun crawfish.

288
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:09,242
This is the definition of good,
Southern seafood cooking.

289
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,977
NICHELLE: Fried gator up.

290
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,079
She brought a taste of Florida
to Kentucky

291
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,214
that we really needed.

292
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,616
‐Where'd you get the recipe?
‐My grandfather.

293
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,084
He was a chef
in the Navy for a while.

294
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,686
He cooked
for so many people.

295
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,354
FIERI:
And when Nichelle Thurston

296
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,790
came up from Florida
to her husband Luke's hometown,

297
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,292
she began cooking
for big crowds, too.

298
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,795
I would come home to like
30‐40 people on my porch,

299
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:29,863
I'll be like, "Hold up."

300
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,197
‐No.
‐Yeah.

301
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,066
FIERI: So they knew it was time
to make it official

302
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,968
and The Seafood Lady was born.

303
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,470
WOMAN: You can't go anywhere
in Louisville, Kentucky,

304
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,839
and get this type of seafood.

305
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,674
For you, sir,
the full combo.

306
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:42,876
The full combo plate
is crab legs,

307
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,978
shrimp, potatoes, corn,

308
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,513
boiled egg and sausage.

309
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:49,182
If you're hungry, that's
definitely the dish to get.

310
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:50,383
Okay,
what are we making first?

311
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,653
The Cajun boil
and full combo.

312
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:53,987
Cajun boil
and full combo.

313
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,990
You get bay leaves,
black peppercorns.

314
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,625
‐Oregano.
‐Pickling spice,

315
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,960
cinnamon, mustard seeds.

316
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,902
This is
your grandpa's recipe?

317
00:11:01,902 --> 00:11:04,538
Yes. Paprika,
red pepper flakes.

318
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,906
Whole mess of Cayenne.

319
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:08,809
Fresh dill, sea salt.

320
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,811
‐Adobo.
‐Coriander.

321
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:13,179
‐Thyme.
‐Cardamom seeds.

322
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:14,480
Kitchen sink.

323
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,785
Ginger, whole onion,
green onion and celery.

324
00:11:18,785 --> 00:11:20,286
And then we'll add...
‐Potatoes.

325
00:11:20,286 --> 00:11:23,356
...corn, smoked sausage.

326
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:24,691
Whole eggs.

327
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:26,927
That's like the little gem
that everybody gets.

328
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:29,563
‐I know you hate eggs.
‐Snow crab, shrimp.

329
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,097
We'll cook this
for about 15 minutes

330
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:32,566
until the potatoes
are done.

331
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,767
Okay.
‐All right.

332
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:35,201
We're going to make
the full combo platter.

333
00:11:35,201 --> 00:11:37,904
Two potato halves,
one snow crab cluster,

334
00:11:37,904 --> 00:11:39,372
one full ear of corn,

335
00:11:39,372 --> 00:11:41,074
two of your smoked sausage,

336
00:11:41,074 --> 00:11:42,643
10 jumbo shrimps.

337
00:11:42,643 --> 00:11:43,844
‐Shells on?
‐Yes.

338
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:45,546
One Cajun boiled egg

339
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:47,213
and then you add
the house sauce on top,

340
00:11:47,213 --> 00:11:49,315
which is butter,
garlic, Cayenne,

341
00:11:49,315 --> 00:11:52,452
Cajun seasoning, lemon juice,
lime juice and onion powder.

342
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:55,956
And then we add the Cajun
seasoning and parsley.

343
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,626
Perfect.

344
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:01,334
Just want to make sure
in front of The Seafood Lady

345
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:03,103
that I got stuff right.

346
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:07,273
Just warming up.

347
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:09,475
[ Laughs ]

348
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:12,613
Shrimp's great. Crab's great.
Tons of flavor.

349
00:12:12,613 --> 00:12:15,716
You know you do
your spices right.

350
00:12:15,716 --> 00:12:18,218
Mmm, I love this
house sauce on top.

351
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:19,853
‐Kicks it out.
‐Oh, yeah.

352
00:12:19,853 --> 00:12:23,123
That Cajun dust
at the end is spot on.

353
00:12:23,123 --> 00:12:24,558
I'm having
a difficult time

354
00:12:24,558 --> 00:12:26,993
trying to host
my show right now

355
00:12:26,993 --> 00:12:31,231
as I'm shoveling this as fast
as I can into my face.

356
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:34,167
That's really good.
Back to business.

357
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:35,335
[ Laughs ]

358
00:12:35,335 --> 00:12:37,470
It's exciting taste.

359
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,405
Kind of a down‐home
Southern flavor.

360
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:41,074
You know Damaris Phillips.
One of our judges,

361
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:42,643
one of our competitors
on "Triple D."

362
00:12:42,643 --> 00:12:44,845
So, it's legit, right?
‐It's so good.

363
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:47,648
And for this Louisville native,
it's super familiar.

364
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:49,883
She said it's right next
to my parent's old house.

365
00:12:49,883 --> 00:12:51,151
Literally next door.

366
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:53,720
When we were little kids,
this was a tire shop called,

367
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,255
Don't boot that tire,
cap it.

368
00:12:55,255 --> 00:12:56,356
What it?

369
00:12:56,356 --> 00:12:58,892
Don't boot that tire, Guy.
Cap it.

370
00:12:58,892 --> 00:13:01,234
Ah, I think Seafood Lady
sounds way better.

371
00:13:01,234 --> 00:13:02,736
WOMAN:
It's kind of a hole in the wall,

372
00:13:02,736 --> 00:13:04,404
but it's always
a line out the door.

373
00:13:04,404 --> 00:13:06,673
I mean, this just has
so much personality.

374
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:08,842
‐It does.
‐This Saturday, I sing here.

375
00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:11,812
The Seafood Lady
has a lounge.

376
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:13,079
And it's a lot
of great food.

377
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:15,315
For you, ma'am,
we have the hulk.

378
00:13:15,315 --> 00:13:17,183
The hulk is fried lobster,

379
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,385
fried shrimp
and a buttermilk waffle.

380
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:20,821
All right,
lobster and waffles,

381
00:13:20,821 --> 00:13:22,589
my life is complete.
‐What are we making now?

382
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:24,157
We're going to make
a house‐made waffle.

383
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:26,459
I'm going to put the flour,
baking powder,

384
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,261
sugar, salt,

385
00:13:28,261 --> 00:13:31,097
little oil, two eggs,
vanilla, milk.

386
00:13:31,097 --> 00:13:32,566
I like it a little thick,

387
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:34,735
so I can get
a really fluffy waffle.

388
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:36,002
All right.

389
00:13:36,002 --> 00:13:37,270
We're going
to make the fry batter

390
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,472
for the lobster
and the shrimp.

391
00:13:39,472 --> 00:13:40,841
‐Okay.
‐Yellow cornmeal.

392
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:42,308
And this again
is one of grandpa's?

393
00:13:42,308 --> 00:13:43,944
Yes, all
grandpa's secrets.

394
00:13:43,944 --> 00:13:47,514
Flour, onion powder,
granulated garlic,

395
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:49,983
Cayenne pepper,
paprika, adobo,

396
00:13:49,983 --> 00:13:52,485
black pepper,
sea salt and thyme.

397
00:13:52,485 --> 00:13:54,487
Got to have the thyme.
Now what happens?

398
00:13:54,487 --> 00:13:57,524
Pop this sucker open,
roll him out.

399
00:13:57,524 --> 00:13:59,760
Like old‐school
dinner‐house style.

400
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,702
And then we'll batter
the shrimp.

401
00:14:01,702 --> 00:14:05,939
Deep fry the whole tail
and the shell.

402
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:06,907
Now we're going to
pull the waffle out.

403
00:14:06,907 --> 00:14:08,174
Okay.

404
00:14:08,174 --> 00:14:10,410
I'm going to top it
with the deep‐fried lobster,

405
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:14,681
deep‐fried shrimp,
top off with mayo, parsley.

406
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:17,050
Then you serve it
with syrup.

407
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,885
There you have it ‐‐
the hulk.

408
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:21,487
That's a good‐looking
lobster tail.

409
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:22,789
Thank you.

410
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:29,495
The dredge...
out of bounds.

411
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:31,732
It's not heavy,
not too much.

412
00:14:31,732 --> 00:14:33,534
You don't overcook your
seafood, which is great.

413
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:35,001
You got
that seafood hand.

414
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:36,903
Get a piece of waffle,

415
00:14:36,903 --> 00:14:39,773
tear off a chunk
of that shrimp

416
00:14:39,773 --> 00:14:42,643
and a little bit
of that sauce.

417
00:14:42,643 --> 00:14:45,345
That's a bite right there.

418
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:47,080
Order up, hulk.

419
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,816
The fried lobster
is just definition of amazing.

420
00:14:49,816 --> 00:14:51,484
WOMAN: Mixed with
the buttermilk waffle,

421
00:14:51,484 --> 00:14:52,753
I really can't explain it.

422
00:14:52,753 --> 00:14:55,488
But it dances in my mouth
and it works perfect.

423
00:14:55,488 --> 00:14:57,490
NICHELLE:
Lobster and cheesy fry up.

424
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,193
No other place in Louisville
compares to The Seafood Lady.

425
00:15:00,193 --> 00:15:01,902
There's a line of people
outside right now

426
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,737
and I know why because
you're killing it.

427
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:06,406
This is funky.
You might be up there

428
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,510
in the championship
dive joints of "Triple D."

429
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,112
Yes.

430
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:17,551
FIERI: Up next, a legit food
truck in Portland, Oregon...

431
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:19,385
I like the way you roll.
...'cueing it up...

432
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,854
That nice smoke ring
right there.

433
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,055
...and doing it right.

434
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,356
Come on, dude, you can't get
any better than that.

435
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:35,502
I'm here in Northeast
Portland, Oregon,

436
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:37,203
in the parking lot
of a pawn shop

437
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,972
and the story just gets weirder.

438
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,807
You see, there's a dude
from Long Island

439
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,308
and he moves all the way
to Australia

440
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,244
to study Texas barbecue.
That's right.

441
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,412
Then he comes back
with his Australian wife.

442
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,681
Well, they travel
across country

443
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:49,816
to the west coast
and they open up this joint.

444
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,952
This is Matt's BBQ.

445
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:55,822
Hot mess and
a chopped brisket sandwich.

446
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:58,892
This is such a step above
any other place in Portland.

447
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,393
It's always like this?
Always packed?

448
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:01,568
Always like this, yeah.

449
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:03,504
Can we get four of
the pulled pork tacos?

450
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,771
It's just incredible.

451
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:06,973
FIERI: All the hype is
for Matt Vicedomini,

452
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:09,943
who ditched New York City
fine dining to head down under.

453
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:11,277
VICEDOMINI: And I took a job
as a sous‐chef

454
00:16:11,277 --> 00:16:12,613
and they had a smoker
in the back

455
00:16:12,613 --> 00:16:14,180
and they were making
Texas‐style barbecue

456
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,582
and, yeah,
I just got hooked.

457
00:16:15,582 --> 00:16:17,951
So hooked that he came back
to the States,

458
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:20,086
tasted the best barbecue
around the country

459
00:16:20,086 --> 00:16:21,855
and finally found
a place to park.

460
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,857
Portland is not south,

461
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,527
but Matt's bringing it
right here in a food cart.

462
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,728
And the favorite thing
that he has on the menu

463
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:28,995
that you enjoy?

464
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:31,632
WOMAN: I love the ribs the most.
They're delicious.

465
00:16:31,632 --> 00:16:34,367
We're related if you couldn't
tell from the hair.

466
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:36,202
VICEDOMINI: Half pound of ribs
with pinto beans.

467
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:37,704
The way he smokes them

468
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:39,906
puts just this
incredible bark on it.

469
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:42,743
All right, big Matt's BBQ,
we got a full spare rib.

470
00:16:42,743 --> 00:16:44,110
‐That's right.
‐Show me the magic.

471
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,946
So, yeah, first thing we're
going to do is trim it down,

472
00:16:45,946 --> 00:16:46,947
round it out.
‐Okay.

473
00:16:46,947 --> 00:16:48,114
We're just going
to season them.

474
00:16:48,114 --> 00:16:50,784
All our rubs are salt
and pepper, Texas style,

475
00:16:50,784 --> 00:16:53,053
and we'll put them on the smoker
for four to six hours.

476
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,388
We run pretty hot,
roughly around 275.

477
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:57,524
I like to say hot and slow,
not low and slow.

478
00:16:57,524 --> 00:16:59,025
We get a great bark
on our ribs.

479
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:01,502
I'm expecting at 275,
we better.

480
00:17:01,502 --> 00:17:04,170
All right.
So this is
for our smoked garlic jelly,

481
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,639
which we turn into
our rib glaze.

482
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:06,873
Onions and garlic?

483
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:08,474
Yeah, we're going to get
a lot of smoke on there.

484
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:09,910
‐How long?
‐Two hours maybe.

485
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,878
Add some vinegar
and let it soak overnight.

486
00:17:11,878 --> 00:17:13,213
Soften it up a bit
and then

487
00:17:13,213 --> 00:17:14,581
we're going to go
to an immersion blender.

488
00:17:14,581 --> 00:17:16,783
Yup. We're going
to add our sugar,

489
00:17:16,783 --> 00:17:18,752
cook this for about
20 to 30 minutes.

490
00:17:18,752 --> 00:17:21,021
So, this is just
the jelly not the glaze?

491
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:23,023
Mmm, I don't know what
you're going to put that on

492
00:17:23,023 --> 00:17:24,490
but anything would be good.
‐Yeah.

493
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,192
So, we're making
the rib glaze now.

494
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:27,561
Equal parts of ketchup
and jelly.

495
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:29,462
That's right.
Worcestershire.

496
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:30,697
Worcestershire sauce?

497
00:17:30,697 --> 00:17:32,265
Just whisk it up.

498
00:17:32,265 --> 00:17:33,934
Ribs just came
off the smoker.

499
00:17:33,934 --> 00:17:35,468
We'll take
our barbecue sauce

500
00:17:35,468 --> 00:17:37,203
on the foil,
put the ribs on,

501
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:39,372
I'm just going to hit it
with the glaze here.

502
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:41,608
Flip them, barbecue sauce
in the back

503
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:43,677
and then they're ready
to get wrapped.

504
00:17:43,677 --> 00:17:45,211
And how long you're
leaving them wrapped?

505
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:46,780
I like to rest for at least
a half an hour

506
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,348
and they're good to go.
‐Look at that.

507
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:51,652
Three quarter pounds of ribs,
potato salad and pinto beans.

508
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:55,021
That nice smoke ring
right there.

509
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:58,391
Good rib buddy, lightly
sauced, lightly glazed,

510
00:17:58,391 --> 00:18:00,193
pull apart tender.

511
00:18:00,193 --> 00:18:02,368
Potato salad's spot on.

512
00:18:02,368 --> 00:18:05,506
The beans are a meal
in themselves.

513
00:18:05,506 --> 00:18:07,140
All here in the parking
lot of a pawn shop.

514
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,474
‐That's right.
‐I like the way you roll.

515
00:18:08,474 --> 00:18:10,276
Yeah, thank you.
Here's your rib plate, sir.

516
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:13,013
‐Thank you.
‐So, so, so good.

517
00:18:13,013 --> 00:18:14,480
MAN:
Some of the best I've eaten

518
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,551
and I've eaten ribs
in 37 states.

519
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:18,819
MAN #2:
Matt does a whole lot

520
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:20,554
in that little bitty space
that he has.

521
00:18:20,554 --> 00:18:23,256
‐Oh, we make it work.
‐What year is this trailer?

522
00:18:23,256 --> 00:18:25,458
‐1976.
‐It's a nice one.

523
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,593
Thank you.

524
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:28,028
It looked a lot different
when I got it.

525
00:18:28,028 --> 00:18:29,796
MAN #3: There's some prettier
carts in the city,

526
00:18:29,796 --> 00:18:31,031
but I don't think
they're producing food

527
00:18:31,031 --> 00:18:32,398
anywhere near the same quality.

528
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:33,634
VICEDOMINI:
The whole shabamwich.

529
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:35,001
What's in
the whole shabamwich?

530
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:37,403
All our meats
in a sandwich.

531
00:18:37,403 --> 00:18:39,172
It is a taste shabam.

532
00:18:39,172 --> 00:18:40,541
What's up next?

533
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,076
‐Our spice mix for our sausages.
‐Let's hit it.

534
00:18:43,076 --> 00:18:44,845
First thing,
salt and some pepper,

535
00:18:44,845 --> 00:18:47,380
paprika, Cayenne pepper,
some water.

536
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,215
And we're making
a pork and beef?

537
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,951
Our sausages are
all rib trimmings

538
00:18:50,951 --> 00:18:52,118
and brisket trimmings.

539
00:18:52,118 --> 00:18:53,854
Come on, dude, you can't get
any better than that.

540
00:18:53,854 --> 00:18:56,089
Yeah, totally. I like to grind
it up with some fresh garlic.

541
00:18:56,089 --> 00:18:57,691
And after it goes through that,
we're going to hit it

542
00:18:57,691 --> 00:18:59,359
with the spice blend?
‐Yep.

543
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:01,535
And then I'm just
mixing with my hands.

544
00:19:01,535 --> 00:19:03,804
‐And we're going to case this.
‐Oh, yeah.

545
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:05,906
Now, we're going to season
the other meats from the smoker.

546
00:19:05,906 --> 00:19:07,240
‐Got it.
‐Pork butt and again

547
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,475
it's all salt and pepper
and then with the brisket,

548
00:19:09,475 --> 00:19:10,844
it's salt and pepper

549
00:19:10,844 --> 00:19:12,312
except we'll hit it
with a little bit of mustard.

550
00:19:12,312 --> 00:19:13,914
It adds a little flavor,
a little vinegar.

551
00:19:13,914 --> 00:19:15,716
That's it. It's ready
for the smoker.

552
00:19:15,716 --> 00:19:18,151
‐How long for the sausage?
‐I try to go an hour and 15.

553
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:20,420
Pork is 6 to 8 hours.
‐And the brisket?

554
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,455
‐Around 14 hours.
‐Okay, are you ready to do this?

555
00:19:22,455 --> 00:19:23,624
First, we're going
to pull the pork

556
00:19:23,624 --> 00:19:25,491
and we season this
with chipotle vinegar

557
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:27,928
that we make at the cart here,
salt and sugar.

558
00:19:27,928 --> 00:19:29,863
‐Sugar?
‐Oh, yeah.

559
00:19:29,863 --> 00:19:32,365
I've seen a lot in my day,
I've never seen that.

560
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:33,734
So, the first thing
on the sandwich

561
00:19:33,734 --> 00:19:36,202
are pickles
and pickled red onion,

562
00:19:36,202 --> 00:19:39,506
pulled pork,
sausage just on top.

563
00:19:39,506 --> 00:19:41,041
And will there be
nine lumberjacks

564
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,375
that will come
to eat this?

565
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,745
Yeah, there's a pound
of meat in this sandwich.

566
00:19:44,745 --> 00:19:47,147
So, then we'll hit it
our barbecue sauce,

567
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:49,850
brisket on top, coleslaw.
‐Of course.

568
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:54,054
And then a giant skewer,
rib, whole shabamwich.

569
00:19:54,054 --> 00:19:55,856
That's just flat‐out
ridiculous.

570
00:19:55,856 --> 00:19:57,791
I don't know exactly
how to attack this.

571
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:01,902
I think it'd be better
if I just got on the tray.

572
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:06,740
This definitely
deserves a hunch.

573
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,514
I got any here?
‐A little.

574
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:14,615
‐A little bit?
‐Yeah.

575
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:15,916
Nothing to worry about
in front of the TV?

576
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,218
It's totally fine.
It makes me look good.

577
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,385
It makes you look good.
It's dynamite, man.

578
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,822
I want to tell you
right now,

579
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:23,256
the sausage
is outrageous.

580
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,491
Look at this, the juice
that comes out of that sausage.

581
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:26,760
The brisket's spot on.

582
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,229
Little vinegar chipotle
kick from the pulled pork.

583
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,565
Well, you're not hiding
any of the barbecue

584
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:32,666
in a bunch of sauce.

585
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,934
We spend a lot of time
cooking it

586
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:35,702
and we want people
to taste it, you know.

587
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:38,505
You really should.
Shabamwich.

588
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:40,473
The pulled pork
is fantastic.

589
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:41,975
The sausage is the best.

590
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:44,410
The brisket's world class,
some of the best I've ever had.

591
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,079
Kill it
every single time here.

592
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,413
The two‐meat combo.

593
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,415
I love it, man.
I see why you're doing so well.

594
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,884
‐Yeah, awesome, man.
‐Congrats.

595
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:53,520
So, that's it
for this road trip,

596
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,521
but don't worry.

597
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:56,156
We got plenty more joints
to find

598
00:20:56,156 --> 00:20:57,524
all over this country.

599
00:20:57,524 --> 00:20:59,192
I'll be looking
for you next time

600
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:01,802
on "Diners, Drive‐Ins
and Dives."

601
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,903
What do you guys
call each other?

602
00:21:02,903 --> 00:21:04,204
I call him Mr. Crabs.

603
00:21:04,204 --> 00:21:05,706
What do you call
the Seafood Lady?

604
00:21:05,706 --> 00:21:07,774
‐Come on.
‐Miss Crabs, come on!

605
00:21:07,774 --> 00:21:09,843
[ Laughter ]

606
00:21:09,843 --> 00:21:11,411
Best interview in years.
