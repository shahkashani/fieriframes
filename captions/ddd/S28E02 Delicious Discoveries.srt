              And lemon juice.  

451
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:36,060
         Extra virgin olive oil.
            Turn the blender on.

452
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,661
Now the white vinegar           
  is the last step?             

453
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,531
                    Yes.        
        And then this back on...

454
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:41,866
                 And voilà.     

455
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:44,335
   Is voilà French              
     or Spanish?                

456
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:48,139
     Well, I'm a French-Mexican.
French-Mexican. Got it.         

457
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,873
It's not as hot as I thought    
  it was gonna be,              

458
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,008
but it is really good.          

459
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,610
You could cook your shoe        
    in that good.               

460
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,545
            So, let's put it on!
All right!                      

461
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,080
                 All right!     
           Now we get the pulpo.

462
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,882
     All right,                 
 so we chop this up.            

463
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:01,753
    You want to sear the octopus
      in extra virgin olive oil.

464
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:04,021
              A little pepper.  
            Needs a little salt.

465
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,222
                   And...       
    The pesto.                  

466
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,591
              The pesto salsa.  
All right.                      

467
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,026
And then bring tortillas        
  off the flattop.              

468
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,893
     With melted asadero cheese.

469
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,229
   Asadero cheese.              
                Sliced avocado. 

470
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,897
              And then we throw 
                in the pulpo.   

471
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,366
              And a little bit  
                of the pesto.   

472
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:19,236
            The best way to prep
   the pulpo is with this salsa.

473
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,238
   The tomatillo.               
So a nice little bit of acid.

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,226
         the tortillas,         
         the mole sauce.        

501

   The Mole Fries? It's topped  
    with a special mole sauce   

503
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,700
     with crema and cheese.     

504
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:25,169
     I love mole. I grew up     
     eating it all the time     

505
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,905
      but had never thought     
   to have it on French fries.  

506
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,907
           When I was in Puebla,
                 in Mexico,     

507
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:33,644
they had this guy selling potato
     chips with house-made mole.

508
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:36,981
So why not tweak it a little bit
 and put my own version of that?

509
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,316
All right, let's get            
   into the mole.               

510
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:41,185
So, we've got guajillo.         
         Pasilla. Ancho chilies.

511
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:43,053
              Roasted peanuts.  
                Sesame seeds.   

512
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,655
We're gonna toast it?           
                          Yes.  

513
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,056
                 In the oven    
              for five minutes. 

514
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,925
    350 degrees.                
                       Yes.     

515
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:50,194
             Then we need to add
         extra virgin olive oil.

516
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:53,531
             The Roma tomatoes. 
     White onions. Fresh garlic.

517
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:54,799
Little salt and pepper?         

518
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,801
                 Then we're     
              gonna sauté this. 

519
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,136
          So now all the chilies
                have roasted.   

520
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,105
           It's time to put them
              in the hot water. 

521
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,539
                   This is      
            a special chocolate.

522
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,808
         The chocolate abuelita.
So it's Mexican chocolate.      

523
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,410
It's got a little bit           
of cinnamon in there,           

524
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,279
it's got a little cumin --      
It's not just like, "Hey,       

525
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,813
  I'm just throwing

                   Cloves.      
Chicken base.                   

528
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:16,086
     Now we throw in the peanuts
          and the toasted seeds.

529
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,756
           Then we let it simmer
           for 10 to 15 minutes.

530
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,491
This is cooked down?            
                 Let's do it!   

531
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,694
              We're gonna throw 
        all this to the blender.

532
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,296
With the tomatoes and           
the garlic and the onions?      

533
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:28,499
                    Yes.        
       Just throw in everything.

534
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,766
      We'll strain part of that.

535
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,702
To make sure we get rid         
 of all the solids.             

536
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,771
 Then we'll cook it             
on the stove for 45 minutes?    

537
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,641
             So now we're making
               the Mole Fries.  

538
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:38,308
