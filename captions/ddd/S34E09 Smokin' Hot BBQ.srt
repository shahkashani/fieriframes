00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,001
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:06,538
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,406
          This trip...          

4
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:08,807
        Wow.                    

5
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,143
 ...we're digging into all kinds
     of barbecue goodness...    

6
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:12,811
Oh, what a great idea.          

7
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,946
      ...like spicy sausage     
         in Virginia...         

8
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:16,348
Aren't you the gangster?        

9
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,149
  ...crazy chicken in Canada... 

10
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,551
You are in the business         
      of chicken,               

11
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:20,952
and business is good.           

12
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,287
  ...and brisket in Vermont...  

13
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:23,689
                I'll give you   
              some props, man.  

14
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,623
     ...served up in a bowl.    

15
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:27,692
                   Oh!          
        You guys are still here?

16
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:29,761
     I was having a shovel fest.

17
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:32,030
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

18
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,632
         on "Triple D."         

19
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:39,571

20
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,510
                     ♪♪         

21
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,846
  So I'm here in the Hintonburg 
     area of Ottawa, Canada,    

22
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,448
      which is not too far      
         from downtown,         

23
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,251
          to check out          
   a family-run chicken joint,  

24
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:54,586
         which brings me        
    to that childhood riddle.   

25
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:56,722
       Why did the chicken      
         cross the road?        

26
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,323
        Hey, guess what?        
    I think I figured it out.   

27
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:01,994
  This is The Foolish Chicken.  

28
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:03,995
       Saucing up two more      
         half chickens.         

29
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:05,663
   It's a fun place to go to.   

30
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:06,998
       It's always tasty.       

31
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,134
  Does the name fit             
  the restaurant --             

32
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,335
  Foolish Chicken?              

33
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:11,804
           You got to be foolish
             to not come here.  

34
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,006
     FIERI: And Rick Boland     
       and Natalie Aucoin       

35
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:17,075
were no chickens when it came to
    jumping into this joint.    

36
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:18,210
                   FIERI:       
              How did it start? 

37
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:19,744
My aunt and uncle had           
a chicken-and-rib place.        

38
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:20,946
 I worked for them.             

39
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,213
      But he wanted to open     
         his own place,         

40
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,682
            and I was           
      an interior designer.     

41
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:26,217
  So I said, "Okay, let's find  
 some place. Let's renovate it."

42
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,686
             And what kind of   
           chicken joint are we?

43
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,821
   It's pretty classic          
rotisserie-style chicken.       

44
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:31,757
   In this area specifically,   
        I think it's cool       

45
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,958
      because we're, like,      
 one of the only restaurants... 

46
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:35,494
         -That does it.         
     -...that does it, yeah.    

47
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:37,229
 One half rotisserie chicken up!

48
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:39,164
  WOMAN: This chicken actually  
         tastes the way         

49
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,500
   I remember chicken tasting   
        when I was a kid.       

50
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,502
      -What are we making?      
   -We're making chicken rub.   

51
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:46,638
           Brown sugar, paprika,
              salt, parsley,    

52
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:49,374
              basil, oregano,   
               and thyme...     
     Got it.                    

53
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,376
              ...onion powder,  
               garlic powder,   

54
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:52,911
         allspice, and cinnamon.

55
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,514
 Wow. We're all over            
   the board here.              
                Exactly.        

56
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:56,715
You didn't know that            
  you were gonna be             

57
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:57,649
in the restaurant business.     

58
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:58,917
               It's amazing     
           where life leads you.

59
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:01,119
Tell me. I'm standing in        
a tiny, little kitchen          

60
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:02,454
in the middle of Ottawa         

61
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,589
talking to an interior designer 
that's making chicken.          

62
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:07,459
               Yep. Olive oil,  
              Worcester sauce.  

63
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:08,793
              Rub our chickens. 

64
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,729
Really? That's as simple        
as it is right there.           
                   It is.       

65
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,064
What kind of rotisserie?        
      Where is it?              

66
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:12,998
          It's right behind you.

67
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:14,333
The whole restaurant            
    is based off                

68
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:16,602
 of the Henny Penny             
 Rotisserie Deluxe?             
                 It is.         

69
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,270
 That is old-school             
    right there.                

70
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,404
  What temperature              
   do we cook at?               

71
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,739
             350, about an hour,
                 an hour 10.    

72
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:22,808
  What are we gonna             
    work on next?               

73
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,342
                 Our chicken    
               barbecue sauce.  

74
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,211
            Ketchup, molasses...
     Molasses.                  

75
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,747
              ...liquid smoke,  
             soy sauce, honey...

76
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:29,748
  Red wine vinegar.             

77
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,482
     -Yes. Chopped garlic...    
             -Right.            

78
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,685
               ...lemon juice,  
              salt and pepper.  

79
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,753
Cook down a little bit.         
  What are we on to?            

80
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,689
           -Cornbread.          
       -Make it in house?       

81
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,225
        Yeah. I start with eggs,
              brown sugar.      

82
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,159
                  Whisk it.     

83
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,828
                 Canola oil,    
                creamed corn,   

84
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:46,097
               sour cream,      
        green chilies, cornmeal.

85
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,566
             So you have to fold
         the dry ingredients in.

86
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:48,700
   Oh, that's what              
  we're doing now.              

87
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,702
         Baking powder and salt.

88
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,070
 And how long are we            
  gonna bake this?              

89
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,106
          -20 minutes.          
-Our beautiful cornbread's done.

90
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,108
              -Yes.             
             -Ta-da!            

91
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,111
  I definitely like             
   the end piece.               

92
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,311
  Oh, that's good.              

93
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,714
We had cornbread in Hawaii      
      at Fat Daddy's.           

94
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,116
         That is                
that level of cornbread.        

95
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,052
Mmm! Let's talk about           
    the chicken.                

96
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,454
          Why don't you help me?
            Oh, you're the best.

97
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,523
  Cut this in half              
 and onto the grill.            

98
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,058
       Throw some barbecue sauce
               on there.        

99
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:14,993
              Couple of minutes 
               on either side.  

100
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:18,129
   The plate looks              
   a little naked.              

101
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,464
               Let me get you   
            some more cornbread.

102
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,999
Oh, what a great idea!          

103
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,467
    I don't like                
    to overdo it.               

104
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:23,534
    There we are.               

105
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:24,936
                 [ Laughs ]     

106
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:28,473
Cornbread is on point.          

107
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:29,741
  It's really good.             

108
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:33,745
Rotisserie is just the lost art 
of enjoying chicken.            

109
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,480
Self-basting as it cooks.       

110
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,150
    Super juicy,                
  lightly seasoned.             

111
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:40,219
The barbecue sauce complements  
       it really nicely.        

112
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:41,552
That's real-deal chicken.       

113

You are in the business         
      of chicken,               

114
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:43,955
and business is good.           

115
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,824
       So, I have a half chicken
              with fries.       

116
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,359
That's very juicy and flavorful.

117
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,028
      I love the crispiness     
          of the skin.          

118
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,297
    The sauce they use          
is just out of this world.      

119
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,165

          on the grill.         

122
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00,972
    Rick and Nat as a couple    
      are real characters.

       all over the place.

       -So you just row --

   They're always quite tender  
         and flavorful.

             with some red wine.

                Cherry cola.

   You hit that with            
the immersion blender.          

171

179
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:49,013

a braised-beef flavor.          

180
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,416
You definitely pick up the wine.
Good amount of the rub.

This is to cross between        
a good old barbecue beef rib

       and then it becomes      
      this barbecue place,      

225
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,831
          and it's got          
      a really funny name.      

226
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,032
         Wait a second.         

227
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,766
      That sounds just like     
    a "Triple D" joint to me.   

228
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:18,703
   This is Bluebird Barbecue.   

229
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,505
     MAN: Brisket's looking     
          really good.          

230
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:23,174
        The barbecue here       
    is absolutely fantastic.    

231
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:25,510
Half chicken with coleslaw      
    and collard greens.         

232
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,379
      Every time I'm here,      
  there's something different,  

233
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,714
         and it's always        
     executed to perfection.    

234
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,516
     It's the best I've had     
         in New England.        

235
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:34,051
  FIERI: And it was one of the  
first barbecue joints in Vermont

236
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:37,188
      when owner Sue Bette      
         opened in 2012.        

237
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:40,057
   And now she's got Dan Miele  
   on board as the pitmaster.   

238
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,059
What kind of barbecue           
      we doing?                 

239
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,261
        We do a regional        
       American barbecue.       

240
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,665
And then outside of that,       
you do fusion, other stuff?     
                     Yes.       

241
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,066
      Poutine with brisket.     

242
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,134
               Favorite thing   
                on the menu?    

243
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,602
I think I'm eating it --        
       the wings.               

244
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,804
         Pitmaster wings        
      coming up right now.      

245
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:55,206
       The chicken is just      
          really juicy.         

246
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:58,143
   The white sauce that comes   
     with them is fantastic.    

247
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,277
            All right, let's get
               into the wings.  

248
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,678
MIELE: We're gonna make         
our pitmaster rub --            

249
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,613
brown sugar, kosher salt,       

250
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,416
       chili powder,            
fresh-ground black pepper.      

251
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:05,550
                There you go.   
             Now, wait a second.

252
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:06,684
              I want everybody  
              to look at this.  

253
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,219
                  All gray.     
             Looks like gravel. 

254
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,488
              This fresh-ground 
            black pepper is key.

255
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:13,024
    Garlic powder               
  and onion powder.             
                      Okay.     

256
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,625
 So we got our wings            
     right here,                

257
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,362
       and then mix that        
with cayenne-pepper hot sauce.  

258
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,764
  Let that marinate             
for at least an hour,           

259
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,701
 and then right to the smoker --
       250 for two hours.       

260
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:23,635
               And what are we  
                smoking with?   

261
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,370
 Oak, maple, and...             

262
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,838
            -Plywood.           
          -...hickory.          

263
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:27,906
              What do we serve  
                 these with?    

264
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,840
       Alabama                  
white barbecue sauce.           

265
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:31,709
     It does have               
a little bit of a kick          

266
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,311
and an untraditional            
    twang to it.                

267
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,446
     -An untraditional<i> what?</i>    
             -Twang.            

268
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:38,049
         Twang! An untraditional
              twang to it.      

269
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:41,452
Water, rice wine vinegar,       
     sugar, ginger,             

270
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,655
    chili powder,               
   garlic cloves,               

271
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:44,922
     gojuchang.                 

272
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,492
      [ Blender whirring ]      

273
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:50,995
             We're in the middle
                of the race.    

274
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,064
    Mayonnaise --               
we make it ourselves.           

275
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,599
                 All right!     

276
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,868
              Let's get you     
         the overachiever metal.

277
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,069
Apple cider vinegar,            

278
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:59,870
     pitmaster rub              
that we made before...          
                  Got it.       

279
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:03,808
...cayenne pepper, paprika,     
ground mustard, cumin,          

280
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,544
fresh-ground black pepper,      
kosher salt, Worcester sauce.   

281
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,812
          "Washer-sister" sauce.

282
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,814
      -And then our sauce.      
              -Yes!             

283
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,750
       So that's where the extra
            <i> twang</i> is coming in.

284
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,419
Absolutely. This is gonna be    
served on the side to dip.      

285
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,887
        I'll take a side of that
                anytime.        

286
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,689
Yes. Chicken wings come out,    
 and then we'll fry to order    

287
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,825
and toss in a little bit more   
       pitmaster rub.           

288
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,894
          I can already tell you
     we have an enormous problem

289
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,229
         with the amount of     
    the<i> twang</i> sauce you gave me.

290
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,898
 Oh, there's extras             
    on the table.               

291
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,166
          These wings aren't hot
                  at all.       

292
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:31,836
        I can just tell you this
               right now.       

293
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:37,242
     The only thing that's wrong
     with smoked fried wings -- 

294
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:40,044
              too much smoke    
          and getting dried out.

295
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,379
               And that's not   
               a problem here.  

296
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,914
    You have the right-size wing
    to the right amount of smoke

297
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,383
      to the right type of wood,

298
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,986
   and then you've rendered them
            just enough         

299
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,655
         that when you fry them,
  a lot of the fat's cooked out,

300
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:53,992
               so your fry is   
               quick and fast.  

301
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,393
           And the pitmaster rub
                at the end      

302
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,462
             and then hitting   
          in that tangy sauce --

303
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,330
        good kickoff, my friend.

304
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,532
   Pitmaster wings              
 hitting the plate!             

305
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:04,068
  The smokiness and the flavor  
     really kind of hit you.    

306
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,537
       I would like an IV       
     of Alabama white sauce.    

307
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,340
 I would have it for breakfast, 
       lunch, and dinner.       

308
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,274
 Brisket plate with B&B pickles.

309
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,077
    I love this place a lot.    

310
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:14,212
   FIERI: The big question is,  
      what's with the name?     

311
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,947
   Explain.                     
     Bluebird of happiness.     

312
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,350
     Just wanted to be happy    
    every day I came to work.   

313
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:21,018
Couldn't call it, like,         
    The Happy Hog?              

314

              it's a rare bird. 

315
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:23,354
              You don't see it  
                all the time.   

316
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:24,956

           rare bird in Vermont,

317
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,959

       at the Bluebird Barbecue.

320
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,232
      I know. The name is crazy.
          But the food is legit.

321
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,834
              We come back,

MIELE: Pitmaster ramen.         

323

    The ramen's really good.    

324
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:41,239
      The barbecue flavors      
   with classic ramen flavors   

325
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,274
   just really comes together   
             nicely.            

326
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,176

   This is the most authentic   
 barbecue in Vermont. I love it.

334
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,596
    FIERI: And they're taking   
       their classic 'cue       

335
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:05,730
      and running with it.      

336
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,333
    I got a pitmaster ramen,    
         add burnt ends!        

337
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,201
Barbecue inside of ramen --     
          normal?               

338
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:12,537
    No. However, the flavors    
  really do pair well together. 

339
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:15,272
    It has that smoky flavor    
        that's delicious.       

340
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:16,941
MIELE: We're gonna show you     
how we make our burnt ends,     

341
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,611
which is the topping            
for our pitmaster ramen.        

342
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,079
           We going legit ramen?

343
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,081
       -Very legit ramen.       
    -All right, let's see it.   

344
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,683
Season this brisket up          
with a salt-and-pepper blend.   

345
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,351
            This is gonna go    
         on the smoker how long?

346
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:28,620
      15 hours.                 

347
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,089
       We start it at 220,      
and then we'll bump it up to 250

348
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:33,357
for the final two hours         
of the smoking process.         

349
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:35,093
            Got it. Let's talk  
           about the beef broth.

350
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,294
So this is actually gonna be    
a chicken broth. Yes.           

351
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,563
            -Really?            
      -A little different.      

352
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,532
       -All chicken bone?       
     -Just backs and necks.     

353
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,100
                      Got it.   
    They have really            
great collagen in there.        

354
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,168
    The collagen is what creates
          that creaminess.      

355
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,771
Then we have onions,            
  carrots, celery,              

356
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,307
fresh thyme, bay leaves,        
black peppercorns...            

357
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,909
           -Excellent.          
  -...and submerge with water.  

358
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,844
  -How long is this gonna run?  
           -12 hours.           

359
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,779
       And that's the stock that
    we're holding for the dashi.

360
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:55,914
     Absolutely.                

361
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,916
 Put in some ginger,            
 a little garlic...             

362
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:58,916
                 Lemongrass.    

363
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:02,386
    ...soy sauce,               
bonito flakes, kombu.           

364
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:03,788
         Cilantro, green onions.

365
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,123
             All right, how long
              is this gonna go? 

366
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,724
For an hour on high heat,       
and then we're just gonna       

367
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,861
drop it for 30 minutes          
on a simmer and then strain it. 

368
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,329
     We also add                
 lime juice in ours             

369
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,997
  for a little bit              
   of brightness.               

370
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,266
So here's our brisket.          
                 Gorgeous.      

371
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,735
We are going to take            
 the point of it off            

372
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,404
  and chop this up              
     into cubes.                

373
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:23,207
      Are those burners supposed
       to be running back there?

374
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,576
         No.                    

375
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,945
                Super tender.   
                  Not dry.      

376
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,548
We cook till an internal        
   temperature of 203.          

377
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,284
              I cant have this. 
             I only cook to 202.

378
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,019
              I can't have it!  

379
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,421
 Our pitmaster rub,             

380
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,222
Texas-style barbecue sauce      
      right on there.           

381
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,357
         That you make in house,
                  also.         

382
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,225
              -Yes.             
      -Back to the smoker.      

383
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,827
For one hour at 250.            

384
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,830
So we're assembling our         
pitmaster ramen right now.      
                   Okay.        

385
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,700
Drop our pre-blanched ramen     
noodles in our dashi broth.     

386
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:49,768
     Where are the noodles from?

387
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,236
  Sun Ramen Company             
   out of Hawaii.               

388
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,503
              -Yep.             
       -They're the best.       

389
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:54,105
      -Those are the ones.      
      -Our six-minute egg.      

390
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:59,310
               I can only have  
              a 4.3276519 egg.  

391
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,513
   -On high heat or low heat?   
       -That's on medium.       

392
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,781
  Noodles and broth             
right into our bowl.            

393
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,850
   Pickled carrot               
that we do in house.            

394
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,786
  Pickled jalapeño,             
 also done in house.            

395
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,455
  Shaved radishes.              

396
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,790
                Which we did    
             at the barber shop.

397
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,458
Some chopped scallions.         

398
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,727
   And then comes               
   our burnt ends.              

399
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:18,463
   Fresh cilantro,              
 toasted sesame oil.            

400
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:20,064
That is how we do ramen.        

401
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,999
               Yeah, just what  
              I expected to see 

402
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,001
             when I walked into 
              the old Bluebird.

404
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,809
                   Oh!          
        You guys are still here?

405
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,544
     I was having a shovel fest.

406
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,013
     The dashi broth is spot-on,

407
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,349
            and it's actually   
        a little more aggressive

408
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,886
      than maybe a typical dashi
              because...        

409
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:44,755
            you're gonna drop in
  these big pieces of burnt end,

410
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,625
          which I was so worried

411
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,494
        was just gonna turn into
              a smoke pit.      

412
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,761
              But it doesn't.   
  Absolutely not.               

413
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,230
                Love the acid   
               of the pickling  

414
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:53,832
       and a really good noodle.

415
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,699
             -Yeah.

        Noodles going in.       

417
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,703
The meat is so tender and juicy.

418
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,172
      It's got that umami,      

419
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,108
    the whole sweet and sour    
       and deliciousness.       

420
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:07,011
  I have a half smoked chicken  
     with slaw and collards!    

421
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,112
     If you've got barbecue     
          in your name,         

422
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:09,314

             I like how you play
         this little game, like,

427
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,123

         under pressure.        

445
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,931
You see, I have a responsibility
          to bring you          

446
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,668
    some of the best barbecue   
 you've ever seen on "Triple D,"

447
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,004
      and after this spot,      
   you'll say, "I thank you."   

448
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:09,474
          This is ZZQ.          

449
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:10,941
          All right, let's check
              on these ribs.    

450
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,409
     I love Texas barbecue,     

451
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,144
           and this is          
     the best place for it.     

452
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,346
How'd you find this place?      

453
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,682
         A buddy of mine sent me
         a picture of his plate,

454
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,751
           and we've been coming
                ever since.     

455
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:22,353
Alex and Chris are exceptionally
      good at what they do.     

456
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,288
   FIERI: Which hasn't always   
         been just 'cue.        

457
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,423
So you're both architects.      
Is that how you met?            

458
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,426
               No.              
Oh, this should be good.        

459
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:29,694
   I was playing roller derby.  

460
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,763
             I went to my first 
              roller-derby bout 

461
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,165
       and saw her on the track,
          and that was that.    

462
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,233
   FIERI: Then when Alex Graf   
         and Chris Fultz        

463
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:39,503
   skated off as a team, they   
  discovered their new passion. 

464
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:40,571
     We're doing                
   Texas barbecue?              

465
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,439
                 Yeah, yeah.    
            Starts with brisket,

466
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,509
           pulled-pork shoulder,
             pork spare ribs.   

467
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:46,577
          We do our own sausages
                 in house.      

468
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,380
  The habanero-Fontina sausage  
         is my favorite.        

469
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:53,250
     It has spicy habaneros     
 balanced by the Fontina cheese.

470
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,352
        You cut it open,        

471
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,787
 and you can see the cheese melt
       right out of them.       

472
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:56,787
Make your own sausage.          

473
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:57,989
  That's what we're             
gonna make right now?           

474
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,057
           -Yes, sir.           
         -Let's see it.         

475
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,725
              Minced garlic,    
           crushed red pepper...

476
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,260
          -Hi, antacid.         
 -...a little toasted coriander,

477
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,795
              cayenne for just  
             a little more heat.

478
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,330
That's just a touch?            

479
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,332
          Granulated onion,     
     coarse ground black pepper.
   Got it.                      

480
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:09,867
             So now we're gonna 
             season the meat -- 

481
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,269
       beef, pork, and fat back.

482
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:15,005
     Nice, lean,                
  delicate sausage.             
                  Yeah.         

483
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,340
 Now we're gonna go             
  into the grinder.             

484
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,609
             Wisconsin Fontina, 
              habanero peppers. 

485
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,278
    I'm a big fan               
    of the spice,               

486
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,013
but what is the heat level?     
               It's up there.   

487
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,016
        It's the hottest sausage
            by far that we make.

488
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,817
             Final ingredient --
                  cilantro.     

489
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:28,419
      After I get this mixed up,

490
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,355
               put a little...  
             a little ice water.

491
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,889
             All right,         
    ready to stuff some sausage.

492
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,359
      Here we go. We're gonna do
            a cool smoke on them

493
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,295
   for about an hour and a half,
        around 120, 150 degrees.

494
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,629
Okay, and then we'll make       
      the pickles.              

495
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,631
                 Yep.           
       We've got some cucumbers.

496
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,899
               We're gonna run  
            some Fresno through.

497
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,534
  Okay. Let's make              
 the pickling brine.            

498
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,503
                A boatload of   
            apple cider vinegar,

499
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,973
             kosher salt, sugar,
         celery seed, dill seed.

500
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,241
Aren't you the gangster?        

501
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,043
                Mustard seed,   
              fresh red pepper, 

502
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,778
           fresh garlic, onions.

503
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,047
        We're gonna put together
        a little sachet of dill,

504
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,714
             black peppercorns, 
              some bay leaves.  

505
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,183
All right, so let that          
    come to a boil.             

506
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,851
Pour it over the top            
  of the cucumbers.             

507
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,653
      Oh, and here's the kicker.
           They're all free.    

508
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,856
       We don't charge for them.
             It's complimentary.

509
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,457
       I love                   
your business model.            

510
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,726
  -All right. Finished product. 
     -I'll have all of them.    

511
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,062
              Habanero Fontina, 
             pickled red onions,

512
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,730
              ceviche onions,   
           pickles we just made,

513
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,666
                 jalapeños,     
              pickled carrots.  

514
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:19,670
That's all she wrote.           

515
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,873
  That's good heat.             
   Not overly hot.              

516
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,208
Saltiness of the cheese.        
    You got texture.            

517
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,943
     You got snap,              
and the great thing is          

518
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,478
 is you come in here            
for some of these...            

519
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:28,746
             Free pickled items.
                    Yeah.       

520
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,147
...the free pickled items.      

521
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:32,015
They cleanse the palate.        

522
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,217
 If you're gonna go             
 to all that effort,            

523
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,353
it better be delicious,         
   and it really is.            

524
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:36,954
            -Awesome.           
        -Architect, huh?        

525
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,423
            -Mm-hmm.            
          -Yeah, right.         

526
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,757
                    Yeah.       

527
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,093
  The habanero-Fontina sausage  
    has a nice, crisp crunch.   

528
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,429
  Just the right amount of heat 
        and great flavor,       

529
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,098
goes wonderful with the pickles.

530
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,366
          Couple ribs.          
             Enjoy.             

531
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,101
When did the love of barbecue   
         come about?            

532
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,103
        I'm a transplanted Texan
             living in Virginia.

533
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:56,306
I've met pit masters.           
I've competed in barbecue.      

534
00:17:56,342 --> 00:18:00,711
This might be the biggest       
collective of monster 'cues     

535
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:01,913
I've seen in my life.           

536
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,714
     We have three here and then
        one out in the backyard.

537
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:06,316
 It's like I'm right            
  in central Texas.             

538
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:07,518
          Tres Hombres.         

539
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,987
      MAN: Tres Hombres has     
   a Fontina-habanero sausage   

540
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:12,390
     as well as pulled pork,    
       and it has brisket.      

541
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,859
      And it is a big one.      

542
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:17,128
    -We're gonna make the...    
     -Tres Hombres sandwich.    

543
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,864
   We're gonna build our dry rub
            for our pulled pork.

544
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,198
    Let's see it.               

545
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,800
     Course ground black pepper,
  kosher salt, a little paprika,

546
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,402
      chili powder, brown sugar,

547
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,939
            granulated garlic,  
           and granulated onion.

548
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,740
              We're gonna take  
              our Boston butt,  

549
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:33,810
         apply a yellow-mustard-
      and-pickle brine, slather.
     Okay.                      

550
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:36,413
     Rub the butt pretty heavily
          with our dry rub.     

551
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,149
                They'll smoke   
             for about 12 hours.

552
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,684
Okay, on to the brisket.        

553
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,619
    And again, we're gonna start
         with black pepper,     

554
