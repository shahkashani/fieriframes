a heavy-weighted batter.

219

in there from that poblano.     

220

Mmm! You get that really        
 nice pepper flavor.

our pie crust for the pot pie.  

288
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:38,543
   Flour going in.              

289
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,612
    Salt. Sugar.                

290
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:42,947
 We're going to take

 as too much butter.            

293
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,285
     So, the key is to make sure
          that we're cold enough

294
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,421
       with the butter so we can

295
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,156
                 Otherwise,

296
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,291

297
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,160
    That's right.               
Then you add ice-cold water.    

298
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:57,295
It's going to just start        
  to come together.             

299
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,698
             That's incorporated
            enough of the flour.
It is.                          

300
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,701
  You want it to be             
as nice and flat as possible.   

301

304
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,174

for our chicken breasts.        

305
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,644
First you put in thyme,         
    some pepper,                

306
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:13,912
all four peppercorns            
      in there.                 

307
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,847
               There you go now.
   Next the salt,               

308
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,849
and then just sprinkle          
that on your chicken.           

309
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,117
    Be generous.                

310
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,319
It's going to cook for 15       
to 20 minutes on 350.           

311
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,323
Next, we're going to make the   
filling for our chicken pot pie.

312
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,592
                      Dig it.   
  So, butter makes              
 everything better.

314
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,929
      Sweat those down, a little
      salt and pepper into that.

315
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,063
Yeah, and now the thyme.        

316
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,798
  So, let this cook             
for 5 to 10 minutes.            

317
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,533
  We're just going              
to put those in there.          
                   There you go.

318
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:38,269
 We're going to make            
our Béchamel in the same pot.   

319
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:39,537

320
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,405
                So, building    
           a little bit of roux.

321
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,407
A little bit of garlic.         

322
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,808

four-peppercorn blend.          

323
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,476
A little bit of salt.           

324
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,879
  White wine, milk,             
  and heavy cream.              

325
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:50,148

435
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:56,728
  what kind of food             
  are you thinking?             

436
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,195
              God, it could be  
               about mofongo,   

437
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,464
                 it could be    
              a Cuban sandwich, 

438
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:00,865
            it could be seviche,
                it could be.    

439
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:03,067
Just slow it down, buddy.       
 This is real easy.             

440
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,803
       This is                  
The Meatball Stoppe.            

441
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:08,205
    ISABELLA: Chicken Marsala   
        over penne pasta!       

442
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,808
          This place is         
   a meatball lover's heaven.   

443
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,877
                Jeffy, I need   
              a meatball smash. 

444
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,079
       I'm a transplanted       
           New Yorker.          

445
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,548
             To me,             
      this is Little Italy.     

446
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,550
     FIERI: Not surprising,     
      since Chef and Owner      

447
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,752
    Isabella Morgia di Vicari   

448
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,756
 is a first-generation American 
           from Italy.          

449
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,290
  And she and her husband Jeff  

450
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,359
         are serving up         
      her grandma's recipes     

451
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:31,229
        while carrying on       
    another family tradition.   

452
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:34,164
  My family owned and operated  
     six Italian restaurants    

453
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,834
     in Orlando since 1972.     

454
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,437
Why a Meatball Stoppe?          
   Who doesn't love meatballs?  

455
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,439
   WOMAN: This is the sausage,  
       pepper, and onion.       

456
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,841
   FIERI: And even though they  
  serve up plenty of variety... 

457
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,110
                 The Buffalo    
         chicken meatball smash.

458
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,179
     ...they're not bailing     
         on the basics.         

459
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:49,514
    What are we making first?   

460
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:50,715
             Nona's traditional 
                 meatballs.     

461
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,049
           I'm ready.           
                   All right.   

462
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,584
            We're going to start
              our tomato sauce. 

463
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:58,188
         Extra virgin olive oil,
        fresh garlic, anchovies,

464
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,124
                a little bit    
             of the crushed red 

465
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,794
                  and then      
          the whole plum tomato.

466
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,396
      Now, oregano, kosher salt,

467
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:06,798
             and then I'm going 
            to put my gloves on,

468
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,465
                 because --     
          the old-fashioned way.

469
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,468
   Nature's whisk.              
              That's exactly it.

470
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,669
         Nature's whisk?        

471
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,070
    That's what you call it?    
  Yeah.                         

472
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,872
    I'm just going to crush them
             just a little bit. 

473
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,540
   Now, how long is this going  
to go in the oven, at what temp?

474
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,409
              400 for an hour.  

475
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,478
        We want a beautiful char
                 on the top.    

476
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,946
          That's where          
        all the favor is.       

477
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:24,015
      Now you're going to hit it
     with the immersion blender.

478
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,217
       Does Nona know that      
 you're using all these recipes 

479
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,752
      and giving them away      
        on TV right now?        

480
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,887
       All day long, sweetheart.
        Okay, here we go.       

481
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,955
                We're making    
      our traditional meatballs.

482
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,157
                Fresh garlic.   

483
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,493
             We're going to add 
             the basil, parsley.

484
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,696
              I'm going to add  
  a little bit of water in here.

485
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:41,098
                 All right.     
                Ground chuck.   
Ground chuck.                   

486
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,967
                Ground pork,    
        garlic, and fresh herbs.

487
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,236
          Now I have eggs, milk,

488
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:50,708
                bread crumbs,   
         Romano cheese, cayenne.

489
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,511
               I like a kick.   
        Kosher salt. Here we go.

490
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,246
     Do you love meatballs?     
Honestly, I don't.              

491
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:56,780
   Italian is not               
  in my wheelhouse.             

492
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:59,383
 I never had a Nona,            
      you know?                 
                     [ Giggles ]

493
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,852
          Then I'm going to form
        the balls with my scoop.

494
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,521
          I'm going to bake them
                 in the oven    

495
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,923
               for 12 minutes   
               at 400 degrees.  

496
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,325
   And you do leave them flat   
          on one side?          
                           I do.

497
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,994
I can tell you an advantage     
though of the flat bottom       

498
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:12,329
is that you eliminate,          
"I lost my poor meatball.       

499
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,065
  It rolled away."              
you know what I mean?           

500
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,933
  Before we serve the meatballs,
               we simmer them   

501
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:19,804
     in roasted tomato sauce and
   chicken stock for 45 minutes.

502
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,539
          Okay, what's          
        this concoction?        

503
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,873
                   This is      
               creamy polenta.  
             Got it.            

504
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,209
      And the secret is I hit it
     with the immersion blender.

505
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,144
    Super creamy.               

506
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:29,213
               Now I add these  
            beautiful meatballs,

507
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,682
        hit it with a little bit
             of Italian parsley,

508
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,585
                fresh basil,    
           and we're good to go.

509
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,556
Mmm.                            
        It's really good.       

510
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,491
      It's a cross between      
        light and dense.        

511
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:43,694
       A lot of meatballs,      
  in my opinion, are too dense. 

512
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:44,895
           This, when           
        you bite into it,       

513
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,230
      there's a good amount     
          of moisture.          

514
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,832
         I've never had         
   polenta immersion-blended.   

515
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,701
            Have you?           
  No, no, no.                   
It's a good thing.              

516
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,369
                      Is it?    
Yeah, it's smart.               

517
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,637
                 Do you like    
                 the flavor?    
     Yeah.                      

518
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,106
           Delicious.           
          Really nice.          

519
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:58,709
 It's very juicy on the inside. 
  It falls apart in your mouth. 

520
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,979
  The tomato sauce is tart, and 
  it's got a little sweetness.  

521
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,381
             WOMAN:             
 I come from an Italian family, 

522
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,115
          and it's like         
       being back at home.      

523
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,251
 FIERI: Where three generations 
         work together,         

524
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,588
    since their daughter and    
  Isabella's mom also help out. 

525
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,524
 Everything about the restaurant
    is revolved around family   

526
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:14,992
   and the tradition of having  
     a great meal together.     

527
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:16,994
  ISABELLA: Vegetarian meatball 
     on the white bean ragu.    

528
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:19,864
I never thought you could do    
a vegetarian meatball.          
                          Right.

529
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,198
    It's so good.               

530
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,602
    Once you pair it off with   
 some pesto sauce, you're done. 

531
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,671
          Okay, so, now         
we're onto vegetarian meatballs.

532
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:28,005
                        Yes.    
      Give us the rundown.      

533
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,475
              We've got<i> carota,</i> 
                  carrots.      

534
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:31,676
                 Mushrooms.     

535
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,077
       Oh, you don't like       
    the mushroom in Italian?    

536
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,345
                  <i> Funghi.</i>      
                 Absolutely.    

537
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:36,013
           All right,           
      I'm just making sure.     

538
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:38,248
         Onions, garlic, celery,

539
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,819
         kosher salt and pepper,
               and olive oil.   

540

you're going with this.

    the real kicker to this.
