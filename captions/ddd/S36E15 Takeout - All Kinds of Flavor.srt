114
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,527
       I'm running out of bowls.

115
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,663
            Can I put the garlic
     into the octopus sauce yet?

116
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,065
  Yeah, sorry. The garlic should
        be in the octopus sauce.

117
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,801
Put the tomatoes in,            
and we're gonna blister those.  

118
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:32,470
 -You put Guy to the test, man. 
      -[ Laughing ] I know.     

119
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,474
        -What size do you       
        want these, Suz?        
        -A good handful.        

120
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,542
        Make it in a ball       
and then flatten it a little bit

121
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,211
  so the inside gets really hot 
        when you fry it.        

122
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,547
 -You want something like that? 
          -Absolutely.          

123
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:46,351
    Flour, buttermilk, flour,   
     buttermilk, then panko.    

124
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:50,155
    All right. Welcome to the   
 96-item cooking hour. I'm Guy. 

125
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,890
   The tomatoes are blistered.  

126
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:54,893
Throw your cipollinis           
and your olives in there.       

127
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:57,495
    Beautiful-looking sauce,    
        by the way, Chef.       

128
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,499
      White wine now down.      
      -And then we're gonna     
      melt with the butter      

129
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,567
  and finish with the parsley.  

130
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:06,371
 -Excellent. Romesco is reduced 
       down by about half.      
             -Great.            

131
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,840
         -Go to the food        
      processor with that?      
          -Yes, please.         

132
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,575
           And you're just gonna
              pulse it, Jules.  

133
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,310
                 We want it     
          to be a little rustic.

134
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,313
      Did we get the sambal     
        in that romesco?        

135
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,247
                Yes, we did.    

136
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,449
      Perfect. You're doing     
      really good, Hunter.      

137
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,319
Thank you. How long do these    
    take to cook?               

138
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,986
          They're about         
      four to five minutes.     

139
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,455
   You want them golden brown.  

140
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,123
                 All right.     
  So let's talk about this salad

141
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,725
           that's gonna go along
                 with this.     

142
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:30,662
         So the perfectly-shaved
        asparagus and celery in.

143
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,532
           Parsley, celery leaf.
                 Nice move.     

144
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:35,400
         A little touch of salt.

145
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,736
     And this bloomed orange oil
           that you already did.

146
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,070
         Yeah, perfect.         

147
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,872
  If you don't mind, I'm putting
          a little black pepper.

148
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,675
              Beautiful salad.  
How do we want to plate this up?

149
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:47,278
  Make a gorgeous round circle  
      of the romesco sauce.     

150
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,481
                 Beautiful.

151
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:50,615
     They're screaming hot.     

152
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:53,218
    Drop it right in the center.
              The octopus next. 

153
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,886
         -Right on top.

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,587

          a fully-cooked rabbit.

208
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,589
       We try and layer flavors,
             so on that rabbit, 

209
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:13,525
   you have powdered sweet corn,
      you've got juniper, sumac.

210
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:16,127
           That sumac gives that
        little lemony sweetness.

211
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,662
   How was the rabbit braised?  

212
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,865
              We actually make  
  a traditional Osage corn soup.

213
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:23,301
     So we take that corn stock,
roasted the Mexican red chilies,

214
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,537
                sage leaves,    
               charred onions,  

215
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,472
  and then do a five-hour braise
                  on that.      

216
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,140
How big was the rabbit,         
      you said?                 

217
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,542
                Seven pounds.   

218
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,544
  Get that rabbit in that stock.
             It's ready to rock.

219
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,011

     get it hot.                

220
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,013
  -What are the name of these?  
           -Teparies.           

221
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,483
          They're a desert bean.
    That's why they're so small.

222
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,018
          Man, flavor's awesome.

223
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,953
              So you have some  
             fully-cooked beans 

224
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,088
              that haven't been 
              sautéed down yet.

            pickling liquid back
                to the stock.   

255

             on these tostadas? 

261
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:06,104

         our beans next.

263
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,174
