1
00:00:00,668 --> 00:00:01,734
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:01,736 --> 00:00:03,202
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:07,072
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:09,208
          This trip...          
Wow.                            

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,876
       ...we're pairing up      
         with a combo...        

6
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:11,743
                   Hit it.      

7
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,346
  ...of very unlikely partners. 

8
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,348
        It's                    
that kind of fantastic.         

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,551
   In Koreatown, Los Angeles... 
Seriously.                      

10
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:23,622
      ...a craft-beer joint     
   with a gourmet-food flip...  
Can you feel                    
the magic?                      

11
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:26,892
         ...that's doing        
    the Death by Duck dance.    

12
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:29,428
This dude has duck gone wild    
     times two.                 

13
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,364
      In Toronto, Canada...     
                  Freedom toast.

14
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:35,501
  ...the 24-hour retro diner... 
That's awesome.                 

15
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:39,171
  ...getting a big-time upgrade 
      on grilled cheese...      

16
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:41,707
 Three sandwiches is not normal.
               This is crazy!   

17
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,175
    ...apple pie a la mode...   

18
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:45,711
  It tastes like...             

19
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,045
  liquid apple pie.             

20
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,581
           ...and even          
      the chicken sandwich.     

21
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,583
              It's the keyboard 
               in flavor town.  

22
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,651
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

23
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,454
         on "Triple D."         

26
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:14,873
   So, I'm here in Los Angeles  
          in Koreatown.         

27
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,141
Now, I'm gonna check out a joint

28
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,677
     that has no Korean food    
          on the menu,          

29
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,412
       and the name of it?      
 Well, it sounds like it's owned

30
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,947
           by a couple          
     of fraternity brothers.    

31
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,748
       This is Beer Belly.      

32
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,017
       WAITER:                  
Some pork-belly chips.          

33
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:27,152
               We're all here   
            for the same reason.

34
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,888
       Good drinks and good eats
          all the time in here. 
Can't beat it.                  

35
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,490
      MAN: What first brought me
           and most people here 

36
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:32,691
       was their beer selection.

37
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:35,160
    FIERI: A rotating line-up   
      of local craft beers      

38
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:37,695
      that owner Jimmy Han      
         obsesses over.         

39
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:38,830
               Smog City XPA.   

40
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,099
I loved beer so much            

41
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:43,569
that I wanted to bring          
craft beer into Koreatown.      

42
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:47,306
   That's just what he and his  
  wife, Yume, did back in 2011. 

43
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,975
    And they named the joint    
        after a condition       

44
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:52,177
       they obviously know      
          little about.         

45
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,046
       But no beer belly at all.

46
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:56,448
When we started Beer Belly,     
it was all about the beer,      

47
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,051
but we got so blessed           
   with Chef Wes.               

48
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:00,519
He's just blown my mind.        

49
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:03,388
   That'd be Philly-transplant  
         Wes Lieberher.         

50
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,057
          Four minutes          
    on the Brussels sprouts.    

51
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:07,926
 He brings his own kind of flare
              to regular food.  

52
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:10,328
      What's your favorite thing
                  on the menu?  
             I love             
       the duck-fat fries.      

53
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,597
       HAN: Death by Duck.      

54
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,266
It's a bucket of fries          
 fried in duck fat.             

55
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:16,801
      Very, very good. It's     
 a shredded duck confit on top. 

56
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,605
     All right.                 
You are the Duckinator.         

57
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:20,739
            I am the Duckinator.

58
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,074
So, give me the rundown.        

59
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:23,742
Okay, this duck is gonna be used
               for two dishes.  

60
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,544
        One's the Death by Duck.

61
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:28,280
We're gonna use the legs, wings,
          and necks for confit. 

62
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:31,082
     We're gonna use the breasts
       for the Duck French Dip, 

63
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,018
                  the skin      
        for duck-skin cracklins.

64
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,087
    We're making                
 duck chicharrónes?             
                       Yes, sir.

65
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:38,090
      FIERI: A duck version     
    of deep-fried pork rinds?   

66
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:39,892
       Yeah, I'm onboard.       

67
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:41,426
  All right. Well,              
let's break down the duck.      

68
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,762
 All right. We're gonna take our
 whole duck. Here's the breast. 

69
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,431
Now we're gonna remove the skin,
           reserve the breasts. 

70
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,167
 The legs, the wings            
are gonna go to confit,         

71
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,703
because that's when you'll get  
the awesome shred-off meat.     
                           Yeah.

72
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:52,904
              We're gonna take  
               our skin, too,   

73
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,773
       and throw it in this pot,
               render it down.  

74
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,508
Nice and slow on that?          
                           Yeah.

75
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,243
             We'll let that sit 
      for 40 minutes. Salt this.

76
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,711
     You salt it                
before you confit it?           

77
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,646
                    Yes.        
         We cure them overnight.

78
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,049
     All right. So, this has sat
                for 24 hours.   

79
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,118
  We're gonna put it in our pan,
      and then we're gonna take 

80
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,187
this big old pot of rendered fat
and just pour it all over this. 

81
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,189
 Now the fat comes.             

82
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:12,457
Cover this with foil,           
pop it in the oven...           

83
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:15,394
             About four hours --
                 350°, 400°.    

84
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:18,397
              The chicharrónes  
             have rendered down.

85
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,799
         We're gonna take this  
         over to the fryer and  
         we're gonna drop it in.

86
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,534
Hit the fryer at 350°,          
make the chicharrónes.          

87
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,003
   And while that's frying up,  

88
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,405
    it's time for some sweet    
    and spicy dipping sauce.    

89
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,275
Okay,                           
so what do you have here?       
                   Okay, we got 
           our fresh raspberries

90
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,410
                 cooked down    
              with some sugar.  

91
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:32,944
             We're gonna put it 
      through this strainer here

92
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,146
      just to get the seeds out.

93
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:35,480
And the ratio of raspberries    
   to sugar was...              

94
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,115
                Three to one.   
I like it.                      

95
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,884
            Now we're gonna add 
        our whole-grain mustard.
Mmm.                            

96
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,286
             About half of this.
              Stir it together. 

97
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,023
     Delicious.                 

98
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,624
           Our fries are cooked.

99
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,360
               We're gonna get  
       our Death by Duck plated.

100
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,562
          Toss these fries with 
    a little bit of kosher salt,

101
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,764
            some smoked salt -- 
    It tastes like a campfire --

102
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,434
                  and then      
             sweet-onion sugar. 
I like                          
the sugar component to it.      

103
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,769
 Then we're gonna toss our fries
     in some rendered duck fat. 

104
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:58,704
     Seriously?                 

105
00:03:58,706 --> 00:03:59,705
                  Yes, sir.     

106
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,742
              Throw these fries 
             in the bucket here.

107
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,379
             It's not over yet. 
More?                           

108
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,247
           Now we're gonna take 
our chicharrónes, chop these up.

109
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,449
         A little salt on those.
 Dude.                          

110
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:12,317
            We're gonna put that
              on top of there.  

111
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,652
  Now we're gonna take some meat
      off this thigh over here. 

112
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,187
       That's                   
also gonna go on here?          
                            Yes.

113
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,722
  I'm out of here.

115
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,525
              You get your side 
           of raspberry mustard.

116
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,227
               And that's it.   

117
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:26,832
Oh. Fries are cooked crispy,    
 tossed in duck fat.            

118
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,133
The fries were enough.          

119
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,368
 Then you have to go            
and chicharrón the duck skin.   

120
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,870
You got that crunchy            
greatness on there.             

121
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,940
That was pretty ridiculous.     
This dipping sauce --           

122
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:35,940
      bananas.                  

123
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,543
     And you put                
awesome duck on top.            

124
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,480
      Mmm. It's                 
so ducking delicious, man.      

125
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:42,814
That's a meal in itself.        

126
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,484
Sometimes you just say,         
     "Duck it."                 

127

    That's very ducky. It has   
 that really strong duck flavor.

131
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,160
  It goes great with the fries, 
  'cause they're so soft,

   through that fattiness almost

134
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,965

they keep changing their kegs,

and do something brand new.

    to search out

You have duck how many ways

                  Three or four.

    this full-blown sandwich

      that's duck gone wild

fantastic.

what are we gonna make?         
                      All right.

153
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,870

Hit it.                         

155
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,273
     We're gonna salt and pepper
              them, roast them. 

156
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,808
This is where it all comes      
from -- the carcass, the bones. 

157
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,276
Really bring out                
  that flavor.                  
                       Yep.     

158
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,078
          Now we're gonna season
              the duck breasts. 

159
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,613
                   This is      
        for the Duck French Dip.

160
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:51,816
      Got the salt on the there,
        black pepper, and sage. 

161
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:52,951
Fresh sage?                     
                      Fresh.    

162
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,552
Are we flipping them?           
                           Yes. 
                    There we go.

163
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,020
    There you go.               
Can you feel the magic?         

164
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,289
   Need more salt?              
                           Yeah.

165
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,690
 And then we're gonna toss those
                in the oven.    

166
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,425
In the oven, 350°?              
            These actually go in
                       at 500°. 

167
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,361
Oh, so you're really            
just gonna sear them off?       
                           Yeah.

168
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:04,095
 And we're only gonna roast them
       for about eight minutes. 

169
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,030
              They need to be   
      still medium-rare to rare.

170
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,365
      Awesome.                  
On to the next step.            

171
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,434
                 All right.     
   This is our roasted duck jus.

172
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,302
  And the mirepoix              
with the roasted dark carcasses.

173
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,705
  Cooked down for a couple hours
              and strained out. 

174
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,375
     Now we just have our little
       salt there, some butter, 

175
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,042
                  and we're     
             gonna let that go. 
Beautiful.                      

176
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,177
                 All right.     
        This is our duck breast.

177
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,312
     We're gonna slice this down
               nice and thin.   

178
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,582
Nice and medium-rare            
on that. Super tender.          

179
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,082
   We got our toasted French bun
                    here.       

180
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,052
     This is the fried duck-skin
                horseradish.    

181
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,519
The chicharrón aioli.           

182
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,322
         Slather that on there. 
 And our jus's just about ready.

183
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,724
             We're gonna toss in
               our duck here.   

184
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,659
Just enough                     
to warm it up.                  
                 Good to go now.

185
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,794
 That may look like             
it's been cooked to well-done,  

186
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:37,662
   but it hasn't.               

187
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,130
It's still super tender.        

188
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,932
      Shredded provolone on top.

189
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,467
             Throw this bad boy 
             in the Salamander, 

190
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:43,868
      just melt the cheese down.

191
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,403
       Tell me                  
about these pickled onions.     

192
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,873
      House-pickled shallots -- 
just red-wine vinegar and sugar.

193
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,274
Well, you got a shallot.        

194
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,342
             And shallots, too. 

195
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,810
You miss those key points.      

196
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,079
         We're almost done here.

197
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,480
        Got our provolone melted
                   on top.      

198
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,415
    You can throw that on there.
                You're good.    

199
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,483
      And then our leftover jus.

200
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,485
Got to be kidding me.           

201
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,254
We got to cut this monster,     
 if you don't mind.             

202
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,157
    Look at this.               

203
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,461
        Mmm.                    

204
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,764
                 Sop it up.     

205
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,370
In the world of great duck      
sandwiches that I've had --     

206
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:21,706
   duck dishes --               
that's easily in the top-five,  

207
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,308
all-time of my life.            
                      Thank you.

208
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,977
It's tender. It's rich.         
   It's balanced.               

209
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:26,978
Duck chicharrón aioli.          

210
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,716
        It's                    
that kind of fantastic.         

211
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,051
This duck's good luck.          
  It's outrageous.              

212
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,120
        Mmm.                    
   Out of bounds.               

213
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,924
  Nice job.                     
                     Thank you.

          There you go.         

215
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,528
A lot of duck meat in there.    
Very moist. Very good.          

216
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,130
        The au jus is fantastic.

217
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,732
          I've maybe eaten duck 
          a few times in my life

218
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,534
            before I came here, 
          and now I'm a big fan.

      Honey cilantro wings.     

220
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:53,204
         The food is to die for.
          Completely real deal. 

221
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,806
              It's why I'm here 
        for six hours at a time.

222
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,476
This dude has duck gone wild    
     times two.                 

223
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,678
 When we come back,             
he's gonna make another dish.   

224
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,813
Can we have some chicken?       

225
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,181
              We're gonna have  
                some chicken.   

226
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,725
   Welcome back to              
"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives"  

227
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:14,659
   in Los Angeles.              

228
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,794
Not just Los Angeles,           
   but Koreatown.               

229
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,396
Hanging out with Chef Wes.      

230
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:21,199
Now, we have just done duck     
  two amazing ways,             

231
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,601
 and now he promised            
    no more duck.               

232
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,201
We're gonna do...               
                  Chicken wings.

233
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,538
        They're something       
    that people always order    

234
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,539
when they come here -- is wings.

235
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,739
             They're            
 always a little bit different. 

236
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,408
Not just chicken wings,         
       but...                   

237
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,076
              Volcano Chipotle  
               Chicken Wings.   

238
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,811
  So, those will be             
   nice and mild.               

239
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:36,213
MAN: Nothing better than having 
a platter of chicken wings      

240
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,283
in the middle of the table      
and sharing with your friends.  

241
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,952
     They are my favorite wings.
            It's hot. It's hot. 

242
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,288
    All right. We're gonna make 
the Volcano Chipotle Wing sauce.

243
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,822
   Hit it.                      
                      All right.

244
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,558
             We're gonna start  
             with some ketchup. 
Okay.                           

245
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,893
             Pureed and strained
              chipotle peppers. 

246
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,494
Re-hydrated in adobo.           
                            Yes.

247
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,896
              [ Boston accent ] 
           Worcestershire sauce.

248
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,165
Worcestershire.                 
           Worcestershire sauce.

249
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,767
        [ Normal voice ] I have 
     a lot of friends in Boston.
Okay.                           

250
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,235
               They made sure   
         I knew how to say that.

251
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,903
            Apple-cider vinegar.
A little sriracha?              

252
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,705
              Little sriracha.  
              This is Tabasco.  

253
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,240
Liquid smoke?                   
                      This is   
         applewood liquid smoke.

254
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,375
I can smell it from here.       

255
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,243
       Brown sugar, kosher salt.
Whoa.                           

256
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:06,778
                A little bit    
               of chili flake.  

257
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,112
             Put that in there. 

258
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,114
             Granulated garlic, 
               cayenne pepper.  

259
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,583
What?!                          
                 Just a little. 

260
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,518
        And whole-grain mustard.
               And that's it.   

261
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,520
             We give that a stir
              and cook it down. 

262
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,122
                 I put this     
             on a lot of stuff. 

263
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,390
              It does go great  
              with the wings.   

264
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,257
So, the sauce is made.          
       Now...                   

265
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,793
                We can start    
  our blue-cheese dressing here.

266
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:23,261
                  We've got     
           our house-made aioli.

267
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,996
 You make the aioli             
      yourself?                 
                            Yes.

268
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,932
  Sour cream, rice-wine vinegar,
                lemon juice.    
Gotcha.                         

269
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,801
    Whisk this up. Add some salt
           and our blue cheese. 

270
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,737
We let this set up a little bit,
  and then that is              

271
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,606
what gets served alongside      
these Volcano Wings?            

272
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:35,807
                 Absolutely.    

273
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:36,741
        Word.                   

274
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,343
        Okay.                   
 Let's do the wings.            

275
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:41,613
Mmm. That's the way I like them.
        Hot.                    

276
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:44,349
           This is our finished 
         Chipotle Volcano sauce.

277
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,950
Ooh, it's like wall paste.      

278
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,486
                    It's        
            all about the sauce.

279
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,688
                 All right.     
     We're gonna plate these up.

280
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,956
                 We're done.    

281
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,157
All right, my home chicken.     

282
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,426
                      All right.
Smells spicy.                   

283
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,630
     [ Coughs ]                 

284
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:03,702
        Wow.                    
 Man, those are hot.            

285
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,303
        Mmm.                    

286
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:09,106
So, they're spicy, not overly   
spicy, a little bit of sweet.   

287
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,910
 The sauce glazes on            
  really nice. Mmm.             

288
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,511
 I love the chipotle            
      in there                  

289
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:15,447
and a little bit of that        
liquid smoke coming through.    

290
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,216
The wings are cooked perfectly, 
and I mean perfectly.           

291
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,720
 And the blue cheese            
   is ridiculous.               

292
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,656
      Awesome.                  

293
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,257
           LIEBERHER:           
     Volcano Chipotle Wings.    

294
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:29,126
    They're great               
because they come on with a bang

295
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,596
  and then the heat             
really starts to sear.          

296
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,598
     There's also so much flavor
                  going on,     

297
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,468
       and the fact that they're
       so tender and so moist --

298
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,803
                        They're 
                 so good to eat.
       Chicken and Waffle.      

299
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,139
I don't consider myself a       
foodie, but I like quality food,

300
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,540
and that's what I get here.     

301
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:45,477
      It's a blend of everything
          that you ever want -- 

302
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,746
               good, American,  
            hearty comfort food.

303
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,013
          This is where it's at.

304
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,149
  Without question,             
Philadelphia's got to miss you.

 I'll be back.

309
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,093
       I mean, it's the crunchy 
  everybody's trying to achieve.

310
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,562
We're headed to Toronto, Canada,
  where an old-school diner...  

311
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:05,897
                   Really?      
      Yep.                      

312
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,899
...is getting a serious makeover
         in the kitchen.        

313
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,236
  We're gonna take the apple pie
                   and...       
Make a milkshake.               

314
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,637
                'Cause that's   
            what everybody does.

315
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,281
            You know,           
 when I say, "old-school diner,"

316
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,483
        I know you think        
  it's got to be in New Jersey. 

317
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:29,087
    Well, this joint -- It's    
  80 years old and guess what.  

318
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,488
     It's not in New Jersey.    

319
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,490
  Matter of fact, it's not even 
      in the United States.     

320
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:35,493
  It's here in Toronto, Canada. 
This is the Lakeview Restaurant.

321
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,300
      BOUY: One Lakeview Burger 
   with sweet fry in the window.

  you're walking back in time.  

323
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,904
      You're in the 1950's      
          or something,         

324
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,439
      like you're watching      
          an old movie.

       with fries in the window.

326
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,778
   It's that vintage vibe that

 The throwback that was brought 
    back to its former glory    

328
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,652
          in 2008 when          
 Alex Sengupta and his partners 

329
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,588
picked up this Toronto landmark.

330
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,989
 How do you describe            
    what this is?

          Gourmet 24-hour diner.

  nostalgic feel to this place.

   is James Bouy's department.

Everything's house-made here -- 
absolutely everything.          

336
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,603
Every dressing, burgers,        
everything's homemade.

00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:19,804
                   We just      
        revamped the whole menu.

338
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,072
                  Went back     
        to, sort of, the basics.

339

  While adding a little bit of  
 their own somethin' somethin'.

  different twists on the food.

         With the Freedom Toast.

342

  FIERI: A north-of-the-border  
           speciality.          

343
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,149
             WOMAN:             
   It's Stuffed French Toast,   

344
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,218
   so it's egg-battered bread   
  stuffed with peameal bacon -- 

345
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,353
        FIERI: Say what?        

346
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,554

   Peameal.                     

347
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,022
It's like Canadian bacon.       

348
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,690
   It's just cured              
and rolled in cornmeal.         

349
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,826
            Give me the rundown.
So, we got our Havarti.         

350
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,161
Just gonna cut that.            

351
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,295
 And then our brie.             

352
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,968
We're ready to build.           
So, we got three pieces down.   

353
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,504
Put our brie on the bottom.     
               This is one meal?

354
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,639
 This is one meal --            
      one dish.                 

355
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,440
    And that's one peameal each?
That's one peameal.             

356
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,042
And then our Havarti.           

357
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,116
 So, now we're gonna            
dredge it in egg wash.          

358
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:11,856
                     So,        
         it's a croque monsieur.

359
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:12,990
            That's what we call,
                 in France,     

360
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,125
             when you would put 

361
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,094
           the Swiss and the ham
                all together.   

362
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,396
     All right.

Cajun spice, and salt.          

368
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,344
     Now we have

    to the rest of the world,

 three sandwiches is not normal.

         This is crazy.         

374
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,092
     You have to                
dip it in the syrup.            

375
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,861
      You dip this in the syrup?
Correct.
