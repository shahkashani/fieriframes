1
00:00:02,036 --> 00:00:03,635
Hey, there. I'm Guy Fieri,
  and we're rolling out

2
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:07,272
looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.

3
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:08,307
This trip...
      Here we go.

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,275
...we're throwing down...

5
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:11,343
And we're off to the races.

6
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,912
...with a one-two
  pork and pasta punch.

7
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:17,049
That marinara is lookin'
   for a full fist fight.

8
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,417
Like in Spokane, Washington...

9
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:20,452
You are a dangerous,
    dangerous man.

10
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:23,355
...at a hole-in-the-wall
  culinary powerhouse.

11
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,824
That is a one-way ticket
    to Flavortown, bro.

12
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:28,260
Plus, things are getting real
  in the Windy City...

13
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:31,697
This is the "Welcome to Chicago,
    California Boy."

14
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,132
...with old-school Italian...

15
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:34,967
Wow.
   This guy's a gangster.

16
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:38,003
...and a barbecue specialty
 straight out of Hong Kong.

17
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:42,574
I have had some steam baths,
 but this one's really weird.

18
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,309
That's all right here,
   right now,

19
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:46,745
on "Diners, Drive-ins & Dives."

20
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,127
So I'm here in the great city
   of Chicago,

21
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,328
one of my favorite food towns,

22
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,364
and I'm in an area
  known as River North.

23
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:06,965
And I'm here to check out --
 what would you expect --

24
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,333
all right, Italian joint.

25
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:10,135
Now, some will come
  and some will go,

26
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,337
but I'm looking for ones
 that are like the old school,

27
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:13,572
30-year joints.

28
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,140
Oh I got one you got
   to check out.

29
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:16,675
This is the Bella Luna Café.

30
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:21,246
Comin' around the bend.

31
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,781
There's nothing else like this.

32
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:23,849
Ravioli up.

33
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:25,417
It's home-style Italian cooking.

34
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,819
Just like my mom.

35
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:29,455
I feel like I'm with my family
  when I come here.

36
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:32,191
'Cause it's the food
 Danny Alberga grew up with,

37
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:34,893
which he's been serving here
   since 1988.

38
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:37,162
Same menu, same everything.

39
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,730
What year was this --

40
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:39,798
I mean, Capone himself
     have this?
It's about 25 years old.

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,867
These ovens are mostly used
  in Chicago.

42
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,368
They're built for bakeries,
  mostly.

43
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,970
- When you're doing deep dish...
    -Yeah.

44
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:47,172
...you want an oven that cooks
    like a bread oven.

45
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,774
Chicago deep dish, sausage, up.

46
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:49,842
Deep dish?
  You got to come here.

47
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:50,976
It's just better.

48
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:52,578
The crust is amazing.

49
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,146
Light, airy, buttery.

50
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:55,514
Let's talk about
    making great pizza.

51
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:57,716
We're making our famous
 pizza dough.

52
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:00,686
Flour. Semalina flour next.
 A little sugar.

53
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:01,787
To sweeten up the dough
  a little.

54
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,355
Little salt. Olive oil.

55
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,357
Here is our mix between
live yeast, hot water...

56
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,458
Warm water and...

57
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,960
...and a little bit of
  olive oil.

58
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:09,628
That definitely needs some oil.

59
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,130
It's 30 years old, you know?

60
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:13,565
- Do you have anything new?
 -Everything works like a top.

61
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,767
You got to keep it
in tip-top shape over here.

62
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,769
We're gonna grease the pan
 with bacon fat.

63
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:18,971
Let it proof.

64
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,105
- What are we gonna put on it?
   -Sausage.

65
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:21,540
All right, let's make
    some sausage.

66
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:22,975
- We ground the pork ourselves.
 -Pork butt in-house. Okay.

67
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:25,544
- We start out with fennel.
 -I get mental with the fennel.

68
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:26,645
Paprika. Salt.

69
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,980
Where did the recipe come from?

70
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,181
My ma had a little something
 to do with that.

71
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:30,749
I think your ma had a lot
    to do with it.

72
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,050
Pepper. Red wine.

73
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:33,552
You'll let this rest.

74
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,020
And we're ready to
 rock and roll.
     Do you sleep?

75
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,122
I go to the gym at 5:00
in the morning, work all day.

76
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:38,257
- You're an animal.
   -That's it.

77
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,725
Let's make this pizza.

78
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:41,160
So the dough's proofed.

79
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,661
Start putting a little edge
  on there.
     That's edgy.

80
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:43,962
Sausage goes first.

81
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,498
Wow.
 You give the sausage up, huh?

82
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,367
Come on. You can't be cheap.
Whole-milk mozzarella.
       Got it.

83
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:49,668
Tomato sauce.

84
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,036
- Just ground tomatoes?
    -Right.

85
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,504
Now you're gonna season it up.

86
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,474
Oregano. Parmesan cheese.
Don't be cheap with the cheese.

87
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:57,376
- Top that pie, Chef.
   -You got it.

88
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,211
- 25 minutes?
   -We're ready.

89
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:01,012
- Come on, baby.
   -There you go.

90
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,815
That's a lot crispier
 than I see most Chicago pizzas.

91
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,817
I mean, it's not that big,
    spongy deep --

92
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,486
- That's not my style.
    -No.

93
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:09,020
Do you throw people out
  if they eat it with a fork?

94
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,090
Deep dish you can use a fork.

95
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:13,892
Mmm.

96
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:16,094
The sausage is outstanding.

97
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,496
All that rendered-down fat,

98
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:20,566
I mean, it just soaks
   right into that pie.

99
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:22,634
All that fennel,
 that red wine comin' through,

100
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,336
that right there was
   the best combination

101
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:26,405
between deep dish
    and thin crust.

102
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:27,806
You have enough oil in there

103
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,608
that it's almost frying
    the bottom of that.

104
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,443
It's got its own
    crispy texture.

105
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:34,346
The tomatoes are just bright
   and fresh and vibrant.

106
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,614
Dynamite.

107
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,316
Here's a Chicago-style
  deep-dish pizza.

108
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:39,985
It is fantastic. Crispy crust.

109
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,820
Just the right amount of cheese
   and sausage.

110
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:42,888
All right, tell me the truth,

111
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,156
buddy of mine,
    what do you think?

112
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:46,024
It tastes fresh,
especially the sausage.

113
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,926
- Do you cook?
 -Can't cook worth nothin'.

114
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,995
No.
 My name is Truth.
I got to tell you the truth.

115
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:52,264
- Well, my name's Cook.

116
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:55,434
I'm also looking for
an amen on the rest of the menu.

117
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,236
The one and only
 Rocco DiSpirito.

118
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:58,704
What makes great Italian food,
 in your opinion?

119
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:00,138
- Usually a mama.
    -Okay.

120
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,873
For someone that learned
 from a mama like this guy did,

121
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,076
you can tell,
  it's the hallelujah chorus

122
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,644
of Italian homemade food.

123
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,446
Goosebumps. It's magical.

124
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,180
Rápido, rápido.

125
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,383
Everything is fresh.
 The pastas are phenomenal.

126
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,751
Got ravioli up in the window.

127
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,954
Homemade. Filled with
  the ricotta and meat.

128
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,390
In my opinion, it's one of
 the best things on the menu.

129
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:20,826
All right, Chef.
  This is the filling for...
For the raviolis.

130
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,127
You start out
with some olive oil.
       Okay.

131
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,428
Ground beef. 80%/20%.

132
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,664
This is the same sausage
we use on the pizza.

133
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,865
Did you always want
    to be a chef?

134
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,133
I love to cook.
I always got to eat.

135
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,868
And I didn't have to do
  the dishes.

136
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,169
Did he steal my line?

137
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,671
Basil. Plum tomatoes.

138
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,039
- Dude, crush 'em by hand.
  -Crush 'em by hand.

139
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,207
Wow.
   This guy's a gangster.

140
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,942
Parmesan in there.
 A little garlic.

141
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,444
Let it cool down and then we'll
 stuff this into the raviolis?

142
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,946
Stuff these into the raviolis.

143
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,681
30-year-old pot here.
  You ready?

144
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,349
How about you tell me the things
  that aren't 30 years old?

145
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,752
We're gonna make marinara sauce.
 Chopped onions.

146
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,654
If your mom was still with us,
   I'd call her and say,

147
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,122
"Hey, I found
   your colander, ma'am."

148
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,390
'Cause that's full out
   of somebody's house.

149
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:52,457
That's the only thing
I got out of the will.

150
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,592
Are you kidding me?

151
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:54,926
That's the only thing
 they left me.

152
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,695
Chopped garlic.
 Isabella tomatoes.
       Okay.

153
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,430
- Salt.
   -Hit it.

154
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,165
Black pepper. And basil.

155
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,067
So these you're just gonna
 cook down till they break down?

156
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,234
I'm gonna smash them down.

157
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,203
See?
I like the old-fashioned way.

158
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,772
Okay.
  Let's build these ravis.

159
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,307
First we're gonna start
 with the dough.

160
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,342
Flour. Semalina flour.

161
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:13,478
Eggs. Olive oil.
Salt. A little bit of water.

162
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,314
We let it rest, we run it
through the sheeter,

163
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:16,815
and we're ready
 for our raviolis.

164
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,717
All right, let's see it.
    Oh, you're serious?

165
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,485
Every one of these
    is made by hand?
Yeah.

166
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:24,022
- Little bit of ricotta.
 -And a little fresh mozz.

167
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,624
Another sheet of dough
 right on top.

168
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:28,593
Trim the edges.
We crimp them with a fork.

169
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:31,963
You're cooking each ravioli
  in its own little basket?

170
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,165
Yeah.
Because they stick together.

171
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,700
Don't you know nothin'
  over here?

172
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:37,069
We got to teach you everything?

173
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:39,004
- Pull it out al dente.
  -Cheese on there.

174
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,040
And we're good to go.

175
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,409
And if you can finish four
of these, you're my hero.

176
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,078
Parsley.
Fresh Pecorino Romano.

177
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,181
Oh, by the way, this was once
a nice part of a coffee/tea set,

178
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,216
and now he's just hammerin' it
    with some Pecorino.

179
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:52,417
Those were left to me
 in the will.

180
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,720
Yeah. "It was left to me
    in the will."

181
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:56,221
- Dig in.
   -All right.

182
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,622
Look at the size of this thing!

183
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,925
That's how you're supposed
 to eat them.

184
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:01,293
If you really love the big,

185
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:03,228
thick pastas,
 you're gonna love this ravioli.

186
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,396
This is pasta city.

187
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,798
And great...

188
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,533
stuffing inside.

189
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,136
That marinara is lookin'
   for a full fist fight.

190
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:13,672
The garlic and the onion ratio
    is over-the-top.

191
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:17,242
Not the light, delicate,
  easygoing, gentle ravioli.

192
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:22,047
No, this is the "Welcome to
  Chicago, California Boy."

193
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,349
It's four raviolis,
  but it's a full experience.

194
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,485
- Your ravioli for you, ma'am.
  -It's beautiful.

195
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:28,987
One of the best raviolis
  I've seen in this city.

196
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,089
The sauce that comes out of
the top is absolutely fantastic.

197
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,257
You can tell how fresh it is.

198
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,725
Meatball mozzarella up!

199
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,527
If you're gonna come to Chicago,
  you want to come here.

200
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,129
I think that the reason
    you've done so well

201
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:38,363
and outlasted the comings

202
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,031
and the goings of all
   the restaurant joints

203
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,166
is because you're the real deal.
   -Thank you.

204
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:44,102
- Good job, brother.
   -Thank you.

205
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:45,437
Up next...

206
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,406
a tucked-away treasure
 in Spokane, Washington...

207
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,841
This is one of the most exciting
     Triple D's

208
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:52,010
I've seen in quite a while.

209
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,979
...going off-script
  with the gnocchi...

210
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:56,782
You're crushing it.
  I mean, bro, crushing it.

211
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:59,518
...and dishing out
  a dirty carnitas combo.

212
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,620
This is like something you have
    for your last meal.

213
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:09,561
Yeah, hello. Harmon?

214
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:13,064
Yeah. It's Guy.
 Yeah, no, I'm in Spokane.

215
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,800
Yeah, I'm looking for the place.
  I can't find it.

216
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:18,503
I'm at the corner
  of Monroe and Mallon.

217
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:21,173
Yeah, I know.
 You told me the food's amazing.

218
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:23,508
What kind of food is it?
   You don't know?

219
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,545
It changes --
 It changes the menu every week?

220
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:27,813
Anyhow. Listen.

221
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:30,015
I'm just standing next to some
   rundown place.

222
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,883
The place looks like ruins.

223
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,018
Oh!

224
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,020
This is it!

225
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,860
All right, guys.
 We have a roasted chicken.

226
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,094
It's the best food in town.

227
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,197
We got a minute on the pork.

228
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,265
It's always different,
  it's always delicious.

229
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:48,667
Lebanese meatballs.

230
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,669
It's kinda tough to find
 something different in Spokane.

231
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,370
We're kind of
 a meat-and-potatoes town.

232
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,839
This is big-city food.

233
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,141
'Cause while owner
 Tony Brown grew up here,

234
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,945
he cut his teeth in one of
my favorite food towns, Chicago,

235
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:02,147
and he made sure
 to bring all those flavors

236
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,215
back home with him.

237
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:04,783
We change our menu
 all the time.

238
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:08,520
The first year that we opened,
we did 52 menus in 52 weeks.

239
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:10,722
- It's pretty stupid.
  -Are you still...

240
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:11,957
--I didn't want to say it.

241
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,124
One week we would do Thai food,

242
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,360
next week
we would do Mexican food.

243
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,362
So how much of this is
 a business and how much of this

244
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,931
is just your personal culinary
     Disneyland?

245
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,733
A lot of it's my culinary
  Disneyland.

246
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,468
Dirty fries ready for pickup.

247
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,004
And this mash-up of
  carnitas and fries

248
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,639
is a ride worth jumping on.

249
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,374
They're to die for.

250
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,776
- We're gonna do dirty fries.
 -Boneless pork shoulder.

251
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,545
You slice it an inch
    and a half thick.

252
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:35,847
We just do a little bit
of Mexican oregano, dried.

253
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,516
A good healthy bit of salt.

254
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,384
You can't have enough,
 especially with all that fat.

255
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,453
Bay leaves.
And then chicken stock.

256
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:43,455
See what he's doing right there?
 He's pouring it in the corners

257
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:45,690
so he doesn't wash off
  the seasoning off the top.

258
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,393
Little bit of OJ.
  A little bit of moisture
to work in the steaming process.

259
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,062
Exactly.
  Which is gonna really help
    break it down.

260
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,964
How long?

261
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,333
325 for probably about
 2 1/2, 3 hours.
       Okay.

262
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,102
Then when it's ready
    for service...

263
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,770
Put it on the flat-top
and then just kinda chop it up.
       Right.

264
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,939
Okay, pork's goin',
    fries are goin'.

265
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:03,108
- Aioli.
 -We make ours with eggs yolks.

266
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,377
A little bit of garlic.
 White wine vinegar.

267
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,847
We're just gonna kinda buzz
that around, get it frothy.

268
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,482
Dijon mustard.

269
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:12,317
This is my kind of aioli.

270
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,219
Now we're just gonna
 emulsify this guy

271
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,688
really slow with the oil.

272
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,256
We're gonna coat the fries
     with this?

273
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,891
We're gonna coat
 the fries with it.
     That's nice.

274
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,893
No diet season up here
    in Spokane, huh?
Yeah.

275
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,762
A little bit of lemon juice.

276
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,897
Pinch of salt.
And you can make that at home.

277
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,332
What, did this turn
    into a cooking?

278
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:29,467
What, are you
   on Food Network now?

279
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,902
Salsa verde
   and then we're done.

280
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,437
Parsley. Green onion.

281
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,406
- Mint.
 -The mint is the kicker here.

282
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,707
It brings out
I think a great flavor.

283
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:36,841
- I love mint.
   -Yeah, me too.

284
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,877
Shallots. Lemon zest.

285
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,812
Chili flake. Little salt.

286
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,914
- Black pepper.
   -Lemon juice.

287
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,816
And oil will help marry
    the flavors.

288
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,118
Yeah, it'll marry it together.

289
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,720
I think if you're gonna eat
    a fry, it should be

290
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,255
a damn good fry.
   -Mm-hmm.

291
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,523
That's better
   than a damn good fry.

292
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:52,724
Great crunch.

293
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,659
You never see shoestring
     that small.

294
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,061
Pork. Aioli.

295
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:59,864
Salsa verde on there.

296
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,434
Garnish with a little bit
of extra green onion.

297
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:04,869
The dirty fries.

298
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,204
Don't say we look like twins.

299
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,309
You are a dangerous,
    dangerous man.

300
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:16,114
This just makes all other fries
    seem boring.

301
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,717
This is like something you have
    for your last meal.

302
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,085
The kicker is the aioli.

303
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,354
No, it's good.
It adds that acid to it.

304
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:25,457
That is a one-way ticket
    to Flavortown, bro.

305
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,825
Dirty fries for you.

306
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,560
The meat is super tender.

307
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:30,295
You get a little bit of salt
 and fat to go with fries.

308
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,230
It's the perfect thing
  to throw on top.

309
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,732
Lamb kofta.
  Ready for pickup.

310
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:36,468
This food is fantastic here.
 Tony's menu kinda hooked me.

311
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,236
Here's a white fish,
   in the window.

312
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,838
And that high-end culinary?

313
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,375
Well, it's coming out of a joint
 as low-rent as they come.

314
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:45,577
It's called Ruins because
  of the condition

315
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,145
that they first found it in.

316
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,214
Externally you don't really
  notice it too much

317
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:52,050
when you're driving by,
 which is part of its charm,

318
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,952
and then when you come in
  it's really inviting.

319
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,453
The vibe is really good in here

320
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,922
and it coincides
  with the food well.

321
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,357
So, here's the deal.

322
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,626
I'm hanging out in Spokane,
   Washington at Ruins.

323
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:04,729
When we come back,
 I think I'm gonna get ruined.

324
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,297
- Gnocchi?
   -Gnocchi next.

325
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,799
Oh, gosh.

326
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,934
The gnocchi? Oh, my goodness.
  I can't even begin.

327
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:12,037
It's the best gnocchi
   that I've had.

328
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:15,040
I'll be asleep in booth two.

329
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,644
One, two...

330
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,413
Okay, I got the clapper.

331
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,287
Welcome back. In Spokane,
   Washington at Ruins.

332
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,723
Oh, yeah.
 And the name fits completely.

333
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:34,859
I was just ruined
    by the dirty fries.

334
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,363
It was salty, it was tangy,
 it was crunchy, it was creamy,

335
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,998
it was everything.

336
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,866
It was three more hours
    on the treadmill.

337
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,069
We got a seafood stew
  ready for pickup.

338
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:47,272
Tony rotates the menu and keeps
 it fresh and interesting.

339
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:48,606
All right, guys.

340
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,108
We have the gnocchi
 with bacon and tarragon.

341
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,177
The gnocchi here
  is really fabulous

342
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,278
because it's not traditional.

343
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,746
It melts in your mouth.

344
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:56,514
The bacon just sets it off
   as well.

345
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:57,816
All right, Chef, next up?

346
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:59,317
Gnocchi.
This is Parisian gnocchi.

347
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,719
It's not made with potatoes.

348
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,587
It's made with
 flour and butter.

349
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,589
It's a called a pâte à choux.

350
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:07,025
Same thing you make, like,
 cream puffs.

351
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:09,194
- Okay.
  -Butter into the water.

352
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:12,297
I'm gonna wait for this guy
 to come to a boil.

353
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,466
I know we're gonna add
all of our flour at once.

354
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:16,201
Here we go!
  And we're off to the races.

355
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:18,837
It's gonna turn into,
 like, Play-Doh.

356
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,005
Now we're just gonna work
some ingredients into it.

357
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:24,409
Gruyère cheese. Dijon mustard.
  Tarragon.

358
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,844
Oh, this is a party.

359
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,545
And to really round out
    this pâte à choux,

360
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,581
now we start dropping
   the eggs in one by one.

361
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,116
Yes, one by one.

362
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:33,318
And then you want to wait
until it's incorporated.

363
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,353
It starts to almost look like
  a plastic-y

364
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,921
kinda really shiny dough.

365
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,656
- Sheen-y, yeah.
    -Yeah.

366
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,425
- In this little funky kitchen --
   -Uh-huh.

367
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,128
...you are putting this level
   of time and attention

368
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,529
together in recipes.
    -Yeah.

369
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,431
I love this one because
it's like fine dining.

370
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,234
No, it's not "it's like a,"
     it is "a."

371
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,136
This guy's not for real.

372
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,670
So we take this
    into a piping bag

373
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:53,905
and then we're just gonna
    pipe it right into

374
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,273
the salted boiling water?
    -Yep.

375
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,274
We're gonna parboil them,
 yeah, for...

376
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,343
- So they'll set up nice?
    -Yep.

377
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,245
Now we're gonna sautée them in
a little bit of butter and oil.

378
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,479
They start to puff up
 a little bit.

379
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:02,480
Put a little crisp to 'em?

380
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,915
Add our bacon in there.

381
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,350
That's my jam.

382
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:06,484
And that's all she wrote.

383
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,222
Here's the thing,
 there's barely enough gluten

384
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,825
to hold this together.

385
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,494
It defies gravity.

386
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,229
If you've misplaced
    your dentures,

387
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:21,166
come on down to Ruins,
  'cause you can eat this.

388
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:25,770
I can't taste anything
    out of balance.

389
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,138
Everything is in proportion.

390
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,506
I love this little crunch.

391
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,208
I love where you sautéed it
    just to the piece

392
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,645
where a couple of them
    aren't surviving

393
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,580
and they just turned into...
    -Crisp.

394
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,615
A little cheese fodder
    on the bottom.

395
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,050
You know what I don't
     understand?

396
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,152
Is why they don't serve that
   at the movie theater.

397
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,320
I know. Exactly.

398
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,588
Just put it like
 in your fanny pack

399
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,925
and just walk around all day.

400
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:50,161
Fanny pack.

401
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,163
Hi, guys.
 We have a gnocchi with bacon.

402
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,700
The tarragon and the bacon to go
 with the gnocchi is excellent.

403
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,135
That's as good as you can get.

404
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:59,137
This is Harmon, who I was
talking to on the phone,

405
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,538
and my brother Scott.

406
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,940
What do you think?
How's the gnocchi, Harm?

407
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,274
Tender. Tasty.

408
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,343
- Good flavor?
 -It's got everything you need.

409
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,045
Roasted chicken in the window.

410
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,714
I wasn't used to Spokane
 having food of this caliber.

411
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,049
Everything is just top notch.

412
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,451
This is one of the most exciting
     Triple D's

413
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,487
I've seen in quite a while.
   -Awesome.

414
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:19,624
'Cause you're doing what
   everybody wants to do.

415
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:23,328
You find an abandoned location,
   you make what you want,

416
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,431
when you want, how you want it,
   and you're crushing it.

417
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,533
I mean, bro, crushing it.

418
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,169
Awesome.

419
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,270
Coming up...

420
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,405
an authentic experience
   in Chicago...

421
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,974
Hot and fast, baby!

422
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:39,043
...at a joint goin' whole hog
with their Hong Kong barbecue...

423
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,778
This is like a lost art.

424
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,847
...and legit Chinese classics.

425
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:44,482
This is gonna turn into
    a one-hour show,

426
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:45,850
me eating all of the chow fun.

427
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,525
I'm here in Uptown Chicago

428
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,995
to check out a type
 of food you know I love.

429
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:58,963
It's Chinese but it's
  a little bit different.

430
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,466
It's a specialty, and you're
 lucky to find it when you can.

431
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:04,736
We're talking about real-deal
  Hong Kong barbecue.

432
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,504
This is Sun Wah Barbecue.

433
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,176
This is our barbecue spare ribs.

434
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:15,413
The food is always fresh,
  it's cooked just right.

435
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,780
Chock full of flavor.

436
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,683
Authentic Chinese food
  that you can't find

437
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,218
anywhere else, besides home.

438
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,353
Which for Eric Cheng,
   is Hong Kong --

439
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,655
the place where he ended up

440
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:26,491
after escaping
 Communist China in his 20's.

441
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:27,859
Give me just
   a brief understanding

442
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:28,927
of how you got
   to the United States.

443
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:34,666
So you came to the United States
 through an immigration program?

444
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:35,833
Yes.

445
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,101
But before he got here,

446
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,671
he mastered the art
  of Hong Kong barbecue,

447
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,406
which turned
  into the centerpiece

448
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,608
of his stateside restaurant.

449
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,343
Hi, guys. Your roast pork.

450
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,512
The roast pork is so unique.

451
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,881
It starts out with crispy,
   crispy skin.

452
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,382
Then there's a layer of fat.

453
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:54,052
And then the meat itself.
  It's a great dish.

454
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:55,253
What are we making?

455
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,487
- The whole pork.
   -The whole pig?

456
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,423
- Yes.
  -So how do we start?

457
00:15:58,425 --> 00:15:59,724
- So pure cane sugar.
    -Yeah.

458
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:00,725
Okay.

459
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,427
Rice wine. Red vinegar.

460
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,862
This is part of the glaze
    that's gonna go

461
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,397
on the outside of the pig?
    -Yes.

462
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,199
We're gonna take this
 and put it inside the vinegar?

463
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,200
- Yeah.
    -Okay.

464
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:10,768
So this pig, it's been cut.

465
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,503
I see that you put all these
    slices into it

466
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,672
so we can make sure we get this
 marinade all the way through.

467
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:17,842
First we go salt, sugar,
 and bean sauce.

468
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:20,645
The bean sauce?
  So now we're gonna hang it.

469
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,280
Now put the hot water.

470
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:26,784
I have had some steam baths,
 but this one's really weird.

471
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:29,287
Now the vinegar that we made
    with the maltose.

472
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:32,056
This is what's gonna make
  that skin nice and crackly.
Yes.

473
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,726
We're gonna cook the pig
  20 minutes.

474
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,928
Wow.

475
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,596
and then back in the roaster?

476
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,797
- Yes.
   -For how long?

477
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,032
For one hour.

478
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,233
Let's get it!

479
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:46,137
- Beautiful.
  -Now we can cut it.

480
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,972
- Now we eat it?
    -Yep.

481
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:50,742
This is what everybody loves
    the crispy skin,

482
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:52,744
the tender pork.

483
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,879
That's Hong Kong happiness.

484
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,014
- Huh?
    -Yep.

485
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,049
This is like a lost art.

486
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:00,151
- The sound alone...

487
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:02,487
That's Chinese chicharrón
    right there, baby.

488
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:05,223
Talk about goin'
     whole hog.

489
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,558
- Mmm. Dynamite.
   -Thank you.

490
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,827
Here we are.
  We have a roast pork.

491
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,362
The roast pork is crispy,

492
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,498
and then you've got
  that layer of fat

493
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,300
which exudes
  the flavor of the pork.

494
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,969
I've never had it
  like that before.

495
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:20,104
It is really delicious.

496
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:23,908
So, now, the restaurant is run
  by you, your daughters...
Yes.

497
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,143
- ...and your son?
   -My family.

498
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,377
How long has the restaurant
     been here?

499
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,445
Almost 30 years.

500
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,047
- 30 years?
    -Yes.

501
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,716
Man dad was a Chinese chef.
This was always his go-to place.

502
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:35,353
He always appreciated the fact
 that they did it authentically.

503
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:36,554
Beef chow fun.

504
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,489
Beef chow fun is white rice
   noodles.

505
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:41,192
The beef flavor is just infused
  into the noodles.

506
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,393
It's really, really good.

507
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,262
I know chow fun,
   I know rice noodles,

508
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:45,863
but I've never been
    in this process

509
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,065
of making the nice noodles.

510
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,166
We're gonna grind the rice?

511
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,101
- Yes.
  -Right in there.

512
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:52,003
I got to get one
    of these machines.

513
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:54,272
It's like we're making
   rice milk or something.

514
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,374
Okay.

515
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:57,408
So a little oil?

516
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,648
And the cement mixer.

517
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,049
This is how you get it done.

518
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:07,518
It's so quiet!

519
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,320
Now we go to the steamer.

520
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,421
- We're gonna steam that?
    -Yeah.

521
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:15,359
Right.

522
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,061
Okay, I trust you.

523
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,265
- Okay.
 -I put a little water in.

524
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,067
All right.
  A little beef tenderizer.

525
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,569
- Baking soda.
   -Baking soda.

526
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:25,670
Sugar.

527
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:26,804
- Little bit of salt?
    -Yep.

528
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:32,343
In Hong Kong,
they always do it like this.

529
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:35,279
Hong Kong and Chicago,
     close.

530
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:38,516
A little salad oil?

531
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,918
We're gonna let this marinate
    for how long?

532
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,953
Okay.

533
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,354
- So this is the noodle?
   -Mm-hmm.

534
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,989
I've been cooking all my life.

535
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:49,026
I thought I had a good idea
where the rice noodle came from.

536
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,361
Huh.

537
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,096
Huh.

538
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,534
- And then eating?
    -Yeah.

539
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:57,802
We get to do the eating part,
     right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

540
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,837
I'm gonna be great
    at that part.

541
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,672
First we need to pan-fry
 the noodles.

542
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:05,209
You're just gonna put
   a little char on them.

543
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:10,381
Onions, the been sprouts.

544
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,016
Hot and fast, baby!

545
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,484
Drop in the noodles.

546
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,621
- Sugar.
   -A little salt.

547
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:20,525
Soy sauce. Sesame oil.

548
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,393
- Now we drop that in?
    -Yeah.

549
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:26,597
Made the sauce right there
    in the ladle.

550
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,832
Look at that.

551
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,438
Hot! Hot!

552
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,706
- Hot?
   -Uh-huh.

553
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,008
It's very delicious.

554
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,777
Not just because you make
    the dish fresh,

555
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,915
but because you make
   everything in the dish.

556
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:46,450
Starting with this grinding
     the rice,

557
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,885
and putting all that together.

558
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:51,923
He's very mindful about the way
    he worked the wok.

559
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,624
This is gonna turn
   into a one-hour show,

560
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,293
me eating
   all of the chow fun.

561
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,231
- Delicious.
   -Thank you.

562
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,866
Hello. Large beef chow fun.

563
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,335
The noodles are terrific,
  the sauce is terrific.

564
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:07,138
This is my buddy Dane.
You do a fantastic radio show.

565
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,673
I've called in quite
 a few times.

566
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,708
Now I finally get to ask you
the hard-hitting questions.

567
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,109
It's like the big switcheroo.

568
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:14,245
Give me a little breakdown here
 on the chow fun.

569
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,013
The beef is exceptionally
     tender,

570
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:17,949
and this is pretty much
    as good as it gets.

571
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:20,651
This is our fish filet
 with ginger and green onions.

572
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,353
I met this guy, David,

573
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,822
when I was 16 years old
    living in Paris.

574
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,190
The way we discovered
 this place is,

575
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:28,459
I have clients who are Asian
who turned me on to it.

576
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,794
And I came here
and we got carry-out,

577
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,195
but we've been coming back.

578
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:33,264
This is the best
 Chinese restaurant in Chicago.

579
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,665
- Fantastic, my friend.
   -Thank you.

580
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,634
Very nice to meet you.

581
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:39,570
So, that wraps this edition of
 "Diners, Drive-ins & Dives."

582
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,139
If you want to get some of
 the recipes from today's show,

583
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,908
go to foodnetwork.com.

584
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,209
I'll be lookin' for you
   next week on

585
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:48,079
"Diners, Drive-ins & Dives."

586
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,914
It's like, the biggest thing
was getting the computer here.

587
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,148
That was aggravating.

588
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,883
Let's not have anything
    we can track.

589
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:54,885
That's right.

590
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,320
Cash only.

591
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,689
Two-party out-of-state check.
     Post date.
