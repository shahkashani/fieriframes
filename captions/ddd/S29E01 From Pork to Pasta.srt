   Hey, there. I'm Guy Fieri,   
      and we're rolling out

00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:07,272
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

3
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:08,273
          This trip...          
                     Here we go.

4
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:10,208
    ...we're throwing down...   

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,276
     And we're off to the races.

6
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:13,878
        ...with a one-two       
      pork and pasta punch.

        That marinara is lookin'
          for a full fist fight.

8
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,350
 Like in Spokane, Washington... 

9
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,418
            You are a dangerous,
               dangerous man.   

10
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,288
    ...at a hole-in-the-wall    
      culinary powerhouse.      

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,824
        That is a one-way ticket
             to Flavortown, bro.

12
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:28,160
  Plus, things are getting real 
      in the Windy City...

It's about 25 years old.        

44
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,766
These ovens are mostly used     
     in Chicago.                

45
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,301
They're built for bakeries,     
       mostly.

 Chicago deep dish, sausage, up.

49
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:49,774
           Deep dish?           
      You got to come here.

      Light, airy, buttery.

              Let's talk about  
             making great pizza.

54
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,583
We're making our famous         
    pizza dough.                

55
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:00,585
Flour. Semalina flour next.     
   A little sugar.              

56
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:01,720
To sweeten up the dough         
      a little.                 

57
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,388
Little salt. Olive oil.         

58
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,390
Here is our mix between         
live yeast, hot water...        

59
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:06,391
              Warm water and... 

60
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:07,926
...and a little bit of          
     olive oil.                 

61
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:09,594
 That definitely needs some oil.

62
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,129
It's 30 years old, you know?    

63
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,465
   -Do you have anything new?   
  -Everything works like a top. 

64
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,733
 You got to keep it             
in tip-top shape over here.     

65
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,803
We're gonna grease the pan      
   with bacon fat.              

66
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:18,937
    Let it proof.               

67
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,071
  -What are we gonna put on it? 
            -Sausage.           

68
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,540
           All right, let's make
                some sausage.   

69
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:22,941
 -We ground the pork ourselves. 
   -Pork butt in-house. Okay.   

70
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:25,477
   -We start out with fennel.   
 -I get mental with the fennel. 

71
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,545
   Paprika. Salt.               

72
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:27,880
 Where did the recipe come from?

73
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:29,081
My ma had a little something    
  to do with that.              

74
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,749
       I think your ma had a lot
               to do with it.   

75
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,084
  Pepper. Red wine.             

76
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:33,552
           You'll let this rest.

77
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:34,953
 And we're ready to             
   rock and roll.               
                   Do you sleep?

78
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:37,088
I go to the gym at 5:00         
in the morning, work all day.   

79
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,157
       -You're an animal.       
           -That's it.          

80
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,625
          Let's make this pizza.

81
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:41,092
         So the dough's proofed.

82
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,561
Start putting a little edge     
      on there.                 
                    That's edgy.

83
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:43,962
 Sausage goes first.            

84
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,498
                    Wow.        
   You give the sausage up, huh?

85
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,367
Come on. You can't be cheap.    
Whole-milk mozzarella.          
                         Got it.

86
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:49,568
    Tomato sauce.               

87
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,036
     -Just ground tomatoes?     
             -Right.            

88
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,437
  Now you're gonna season it up.

89
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,440
Oregano. Parmesan cheese.       
Don't be cheap with the cheese. 

90
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,242
      -Top that pie, Chef.      
          -You got it.          

91
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,177
          -25 minutes?          
          -We're ready.         

92
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,912
         -Come on, baby.        
         -There you go.         

93
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,849
           That's a lot crispier
 than I see most Chicago pizzas.

94
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,851
      I mean, it's not that big,
               spongy deep --   

95
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,452
      -That's not my style.     
              -No.              

96
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,054
         Do you throw people out
     if they eat it with a fork?

97
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:12,124
Deep dish you can use a fork.   

98
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:13,858
                    Mmm.        

99
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,128
     The sausage is outstanding.

100
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,462
     All that rendered-down fat,

101
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:20,465
           I mean, it just soaks
            right into that pie.

102
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,600
              All that fennel,  
   that red wine comin' through,

103
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,269
            that right there was
            the best combination

104
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,405
              between deep dish 
               and thin crust.  

105
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:27,739
    You have enough oil in there

106
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,608
         that it's almost frying
             the bottom of that.

107
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,409
              It's got its own  
               crispy texture.  

108
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,279
    The tomatoes are just bright
          and fresh and vibrant.

109
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,614
                  Dynamite.     

110
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,282
     Here's a Chicago-style     
        deep-dish pizza.        

111
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:39,951
 It is fantastic. Crispy crust. 

112
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,753
 Just the right amount of cheese
          and sausage.          

113
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:42,821
   All right, tell me the truth,

114
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,156
               buddy of mine,   
             what do you think? 

115
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:45,957
  It tastes fresh,              
especially the sausage.         

116
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,825
          -Do you cook?         
   -Can't cook worth nothin'.   

117
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,894
                             No.
  My name is Truth.             
I got to tell you the truth.    

118
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,163
     -Well, my name's Cook.     
          -[ Chuckles ]

   SERVER: Lebanese meatballs.

    It's kinda tough to find    
 something different in Spokane.

236
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,942
          We're kind of         
    a meat-and-potatoes town.   

237
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,410
     This is big-city food.     

238

    FIERI: 'Cause while owner   
    Tony Brown grew up here,    

239
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:05,616
   he cut his teeth in one of   
my favorite food towns, Chicago,

240
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,752
        and he made sure        
   to bring all those flavors   

241
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:08,820
       back home with him.

00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,488
 We change our menu             
    all the time.               

243
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,225
The first year that we opened,  
we did 52 menus in 52 weeks.

One week we would do Thai food, 

247
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:21,032
      next week                 
we would do Mexican food.       

248

 a business and how much of this

    -Boneless pork shoulder.

            You slice it an inch
              and a half thick. 

257
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,452
We just do a little bit         
of Mexican oregano, dried.      

258
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,120
A good healthy bit of salt.     

259
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,056
          You can't have enough,
   especially with all that fat.

260
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:46,992
     Bay leaves.                
And then chicken stock.

  He's pouring it in the corners

262
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,329
          so he doesn't wash off
      the seasoning off the top.

263
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,932
Little bit of OJ.               
        A little bit of moisture
to work in the steaming process.

264
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,668
Exactly.                        
      Which is gonna really help

               for service...

Put it on the flat-top          
and then just kinda chop it up.

 White wine vinegar.

       This is my kind of aioli.

  emulsify this guy

                 with this?

A little bit of lemon juice.

   Pinch of salt.               
And you can make that at home.

00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,416
           -Delicious.          
           -Thank you.          

577
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:19,951
   Hello. Large beef chow fun.  

578
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:22,486
    The noodles are terrific,   
     the sauce is terrific.     

579
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:25,289
This is my buddy Dane.          
You do a fantastic radio show.  

580
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,824
I've called in quite            
    a few times.                

581
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,826
Now I finally get to ask you    
the hard-hitting questions.     

582
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,294
   It's like the big switcheroo.

583
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,430
Give me a little breakdown here 
  on the chow fun.              

584
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,098
       The beef is exceptionally
                   tender,      

585
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,033
         and this is pretty much
             as good as it gets.

586
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:38,836
     This is our fish filet     
  with ginger and green onions. 

587
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,437
          I met this guy, David,

588
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,907
         when I was 16 years old
              living in Paris.  

589
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,242
The way we discovered           
   this place is,               

590
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,510
I have clients who are Asian    
who turned me on to it.         

591
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:47,845
   And I came here              
and we got carry-out,           

592
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,313
but we've been coming back.     

593
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:51,315
        This is the best        
 Chinese restaurant in Chicago. 

594
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:52,783
     -Fantastic, my friend.     
           -Thank you.          

595
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,718
          Very nice to meet you.

596
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,655
 So, that wraps this edition of 
  "Diners, Drive-ins & Dives."  

597
00:20:57,657 --> 00:21:00,190
   If you want to get some of   
 the recipes from today's show, 

598
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,059
     go to foodnetwork.com.     

599
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,327
     I'll be lookin' for you    
          next week on          

600
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:06,263
  "Diners, Drive-ins & Dives."  

601
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,065
It's like, the biggest thing    
was getting the computer here.  

602
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,333
That was aggravating.           

603
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,068
         Let's not have anything
                we can track.   

604
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,070
[ Laughs ] That's right.        

605
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:14,405
                 Cash only.     

606
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,841
   Two-party out-of-state check.
                 Post date.
