00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,878
    is coming to Ma Harper's.   

340
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,612
              Amazing-licious.  

341
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,414
  Amazing-licious?              
     Watch out.                 

342
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,016
 When Ma gets a hold            
 of amazing-licious,            

343
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,952
 she's going to make            
a whole new rhyme about it.     

344
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:36,354
       Red bean and rice,       
        everything nice.        

345
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,822
 Give me a one-liner            
    before we go.               

346
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:39,957
           89 in line and dying.

347
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,228
              Going to live 129 
             and in good health.

348
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,429
         Remember that.         

349
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,064
                Let's go, Ma.   

350
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,902
    Coming up, we're sticking   
        in San Antonio...       

351
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,770
                There you go.   
                There you go.   

352
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,238
       ...for smoked meat       
          sandwiches...         

353
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,373
              That's fantastic. 

354
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,641
 ...with some surprising spins. 

355
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,409

357
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,418
  So I'm here on the east side  
     of San Antonio, Texas,     

358
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,821
        in an area known        
       as Dignowity Hill,       

359
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,690
     where an East Coast boy    
       comes out to Texas       

360
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,091
  to go to school for finance.  

361
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,226
        And what happens?       

362
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,028
        He falls in love.

         his own way --         

365
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,433

  Dignowity's just this great,  
        unassuming place        

369
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,175
         that serves up         
       this amazing food.       

370
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,510
              I got a pit beef. 

371
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:35,179
        Hanging out here,       
    having beer and barbecue.   

372
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,514
      This is a fun place.

     Beer and barbecue in Texas,
         who would have thought.

00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,718
 -Yeah, who would have thought. 
   -Two smoked turkey caprese.  

375
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,187
   What makes Andrew stand out  
        is the attention        

376
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,789
 that he puts to each sandwich. 

377

  FIERI: 'Cause chef and owner  
          Andrew Samia

     for the deli sandwiches    

379
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,262
         he grew up with        
       on the East Coast,       

380
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,731
         and he's adding        
       a San Antonio spin       

381
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,667
        with Texas-style        
          smoked meats.         

382
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,534
  I wanted to smoke             
everything here in house,       

383
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,870
   take everything              
from start to finish,           

384
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,738
and just kind of really do it   
 the old-school way.            

385
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,940
                 Where'd you    
               learn to cook?

                 Smart guy.     

390
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,214
      It's a lot of really      
         classic items,         

391
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,683
   but everything's different   
       from the ordinary.       

392
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,084
Your Burnt End Melt.            

393
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,753
     MAN: The Burnt End Melt    
         has burnt ends,        

394
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,488
         mac and cheese,        
         melted cheese,         

395
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,757
       and a little sliver      
    of pear slipped in there.   

396
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,092
     It's really phenomenal.    

397
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,227
                  What are      
              we making first?  

398
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:24,361
This is going to be for our     
Burnt End Melt sandwich.        

399
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,363
Prime Angus brisket,            
and we're going to --           

400
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,498
                   Prime?       
              Hang on a second. 

401
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,566
        [ Whistle blows ]       

402
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,368
          Angus in its own right
             is fantastic meat. 

403
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,570
          Prime is what you find
        in high-end restaurants.

404
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,972
Yes, sir. First just going to   
hit it with some kosher salt.   

405
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,174
                           Okay.
And then coarse ground          
    black pepper,               

406
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,444
    Cajun spice,                
and granulated garlic.          

407
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,679
     Really giving it a gracious
              helping of this.  

408
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,381
  Because what's going to happen
      is you'd take the knuckle,

409
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,918
   and you'd cut these ends off,
        and then you'd go again.

410
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,653
        Well, it would look like
             these burnt pieces 

411
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:51,055
        'cause you reseasoned it
              and resmoked it.  
   Yep.                         

412
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,524
      But you want to talk about
        the pièce de résistance.

413
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:56,260
         So for you to be making
   a whole sandwich out of this,

414
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,328
      that's a give right there.

415
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,863
              What kind of wood 
              we smoking with?  

416
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,531
   Hickory chips.               

417
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,865
               Brisket's down.  
               What's up next?  

418
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,401
 We're going to make            
 our barbecue sauce.            

419
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,803
Ketchup, brown sugar,           
      molasses.                 

420
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,071
              Pineapple juice.  

421
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,140
 A little sweetness,            
a little bit of tang, as well.  

422
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,875
       Water.                   
    Liquid Smoke.               

423
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:12,409
      I got a waft of it as soon
               as I moved it.   

424
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,745
     -Yeah, you smell that?     
          -Dry mustard?         

425
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,346
      Yes, sir.                 
 Granulated garlic.             

426
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:16,947
     Cajun spice                
  and kosher salt.              

427
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,417
   All right, so let this simmer
          down, simmer down now.

428
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,886
           The brisket's cooled,
   and now you're gonna cube it.

429
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:24,422
Yes, sir. Now we're going to    
season and sauce it.            

430
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,624
    Cajun spice,                
a light brown sugar, our sauce. 

431
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,427
       And now mix it all?      
           Absolutely.          

432
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,295
 This is going to go            
into the smoker on 250          

433
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,064
  for about an hour             
and a half to two hours.        

434
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,632
      -And then it's done?      
    -And then it's finished.    

435
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,168
         Just waiting on the mac
       and cheese. Let's see it.

436
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,303
  Unsalted butter,              
all-purpose flour, cold milk.   

437
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,772
       So make a basic Béchamel.

438
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,507
I'm just going to add some      
sharp cheddar cheese,           

439
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:45,777
kosher salt, black pepper,      
and our Cajun spice.            

440
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,712
       Add the parboiled elbows.

441
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,646
          -Absolutely.          
     -Let's put it together.    

442
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,916
   -We got our mac and cheese.  
  -Where's the bun coming from? 

443
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,986
A local baker here in town.     
Smoked brisket burnt ends.      

444
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,320
    Sliced pear.                

445
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:57,989
       Everything's making sense
           except the pear, bud.

446
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,857
    I'm following your lead.    
        -You'll like it.        

447
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:02,126
Sharp cheddar cheese,           
a little more barbecue sauce.   

448
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,594
  Take a little bit             
   of the top out.              

449
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,329
      Wow, you're really helping
       on the carbs, aren't you?

450
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,264
That's so it's a little         
health-more conscious.

00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,056
   The fact you're bringing this
               to San Antonio   

562
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:54,192
               speaks volumes   
         about this relationship

563
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:57,328
                that you have

     and just your whole energy.

565
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,131
      It's not super hard to do,
       but it's labor intensive.

566
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,599
         It takes a lot of time.

567
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,735
     But I tell you, when you're
     in the mood for sauerkraut,

568
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:07,938
                  pastrami,     
      a little Russian dressing.

   Do I have any right there?   
   -A little bit right there.

            Dynamite.           
        -Thank you, Chef.       

572
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:15,946
          People are going to be
               showing up here  

573
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,548
     trying to buy this pastrami
                by the pound.   

574
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,083
      You better watch out.

  The Russian dressing on this  
         Reuben sandwich        

578
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,023
         kind of blends         
    all the flavors together    

579
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,425
   with cheese and the bread.   

580
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,760
    The toast is really good.   
    It complements the meats.

  you're treating it, great job.

 Thank you, brother.            

586
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:43,573
  Was that a road trip or what? 
        But don't worry.        

587
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,043
