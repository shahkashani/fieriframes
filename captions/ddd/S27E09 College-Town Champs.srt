Instant mashed potato.
‐Of course.

84

that a little bit,

to flour up the mold.

One side down.

117
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,586
We're gonna add
our fillings.

118
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:48,286
You get real
precise with it.

119
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:49,420
Well, you don't want air pockets
or anything like that.

120

You fill the cavity
better than a dentist.

lay it on top.

about three minutes.

to the flat top?
