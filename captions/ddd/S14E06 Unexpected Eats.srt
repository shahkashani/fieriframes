00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,296
WE DRAW THAT RESIDUAL SUGAR OUT 
 OF THE ONION THAT'S IN THERE.  

321
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:41,165
  WE'RE GONNA GET 'EM           
TO A NICE GOLDEN BROWN.         
              NEXT?             

322
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,968
     START WITH SOME MAYONNAISE.
A LITTLE FOOD LUBE.             

323
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,037
               BALSAMIC VINEGAR,
                   CILANTRO,    

324
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,372
                 ROASTED GARLIC,
                PARMESAN CHEESE.

325
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,374
    I KNOW IT'S AN ODD          
COMBINATION OF INGREDIENTS,     

326
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,043
BUT TRUST ME, IT WORKS.         

327
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,512
                 NOW WE'RE GONNA
                 ADD OUR ONIONS.

328
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,247
       NOW COMES THE POWER TOOL.

329
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:59,317
           (whirring)           

330
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,254
        (whirring stops)        

331
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:06,390
OKAY, THIS GREAT MIXTURE--      
GUESS WHERE IT GOES NEXT.       

332
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:10,795
      BETWEEN FANTASTIC         
LOCALLY MADE FLOUR TORTILLAS.   

333
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:13,665
         A HEALTHY PORTION HERE.
            SPREAD IT EVENLY.   

334
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:16,267
WE'RE GONNA MAKE 12 LAYERS      
         OF THIS.               

335
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,837
     IT'S A LOT OF WORK         
TO MAKE JUST AN APPETIZER...    

336
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,273
BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT--      
   YOU'LL NEVER FIND IT         

337
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,075
ANYWHERE ELSE LIKE THIS.        

338
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,743
ARE YOU DONE WITH THIS          
ALREADY, BETTY CROCKER?         

339
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,145
            DONE--YOU KNOW WHAT?
            IF IT'S NOT PERFECT,

340
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:30,014
                I DON'T WANT IT 
              OUT OF MY KITCHEN.
  (laughing)                    

341
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:33,151
   WE CAN'T JUST MAKE IT,       
CUT IT, AND GO TO THE GRILL.    

342
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:34,485
IT TAKES SOME TIME              
TO ACTUALLY SET UP.             

343
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,887
LET 'EM SET UP OVERNIGHT.       

344
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,756
LET IT KIND OF CONGEAL          
      TOGETHER,                 

345
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,223
TAKE IT OUT, SLICE IT,          

346
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,692
GRILL IT BOTH SIDES,            
A LITTLE CROSSHATCH,            

347
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,094
THEN FINISH IT IN THE OVEN.     

348
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,429
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.            
NOW THE DIPPING SAUCE           

349
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,299
  IS THE SAME MIXTURE THAT      
WE PUT INSIDE WHEN IT'S COOL.   

350
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,034
GIVE IT A LITTLE DUNK.          

351
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:53,972
(mouth full) THE TEXTURE'S      
        DYNAMITE.               

352
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,340
THE FLAVOR IS HUGE.             

353
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,651
   GREAT HANDMADE TORTILLAS.    
       SMOKINESS, CRISPY.       

354
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,386
         IT'S ALL ABOUT         
    THE CARAMELIZED ONIONS.     

355
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,255
     IT'S JUST AN EXPLOSION     
           OF FLAVOR.           

356
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,522
   THEY ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING   
     A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT     

357
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,057
         FROM THE NORM.         
       <i> I MEAN, COME ON.</i>        

358
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,659
         <i> WHEN IT COMES</i>         
     <i> TO ONE OF MY PLACES,</i>      

359
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,661
       <i> WOULD YOU EXPECT</i>        
        <i> ANYTHING ELSE?</i>         

360
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,863
 FOODS RUN INTO EACH OTHER HERE 
        IN A GREAT WAY.         

361
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,298
IT'S DEFINITELY FULL OF FLAVOR. 

362
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,133
      <i> JUST LIKE IT'S BEEN</i>      
   <i> SINCE I OPENED THE JOINT</i>    

363
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,270
   <i> WITH MY BUSINESS PARTNER</i>    
         <i> STEVE GRUBER</i>

           <i> IN 1996.</i>            

365
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,539
        WE WOULD TRAIN THE STAFF
             ON HOW TO COOK     

366
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,074
        AND HOW TO SERVE TABLES,
           AND THEN AT NIGHT--  

367
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:31,810
          'CAUSE WE SLEPT HERE--
                WE WOULD...     

368
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,744
WE'D DO CONSTRUCTION            
  ALL NIGHT LONG,               

369
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,614
   GET UP IN THE MORNING,       
AND BACK ON FOOD DEVELOPMENT.   

370
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,883
             THE IDEA WAS ALWAYS
              REALLY FRESH FOOD,

371
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,418
              CONTEMPORARY FOOD.

372
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,486
   <i> AND THAT NO-HOLDS-BARRED</i>    
           <i> ATTITUDE</i>

 <i> WITH A CHERRY BARBECUE SAUCE,</i> 

376

  <i> AND THIS RIGHTEOUS MIXTURE</i>   
 <i> OF ASIAN AND MEXICAN FUSION.</i>  

377
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,102
           ORDER IN--           
       SASHIMI WON TACOS.       

378
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:01,439
   IT'S A CROSS BETWEEN, UH,    
       SUSHI AND MEXICAN.       

379
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,109
I KIND OF BEGAN                 
 THE INVENTION                  

380
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,712
OF THIS RECIPE WITH MY BUDDY    
SAMMY HAGAR IN THIS KITCHEN,    

381
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:10,247
BUT MICHAEL IS GONNA            
WALK US THROUGH IT.             

382
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,383
           WE'RE GONNA START OFF
               WITH AHI TUNA.   

383
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,118
THIS IS SUSHI-GRADE AHI?        
                     YES, IT IS.

384
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,654
    THE KEY IS TO SLICE IT THIN,
          AND NOT TOO THIN,     

385
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,056
          BECAUSE WE DON'T WANNA
                BRUISE IT,      

386
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,523
      WE DON'T WANNA BEAT IT UP.

387
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,392
                 NOW WE'RE READY
                  FOR OUR SALSA.

388
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:22,660
          START OUT WITH JICAMA.

389
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,796
  SO JICAMA'S GOT THAT          
REALLY NICE CRUNCH TO IT.       

390
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:25,997
I DON'T THINK IT GETS           
  UTILIZED ENOUGH.              

391
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,066
PEOPLE ARE KINDA SCARED         
    OF WHAT THIS--              

392
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,734
THIS CRAZY RADISH IS.           

393
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,336
         BEAUTIFUL, FRESH MANGO.

394
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,404
          FIRM FLESH. IT'S GONNA
            BURST WITH FLAVOR.  

395
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:36,140
          RED ONION. CILANTRO.  
        ASIAN SWEET CHILI SAUCE.

396
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,142
                SWEET SOY SAUCE.
                    JALAPEÑO.   

397
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:39,944
       WE WANNA GIVE IT A LITTLE
         BITE, A LITTLE PEPPER. 

398
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,613
            AND A TOUCH OF SALT.
       SALT PULLS OUT           
A LITTLE BIT OF THE MOISTURE,   

399
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,015
PULLS OUT A LITTLE BIT          
    OF THE FLAVOR,              

400
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:46,350
AND YOU'LL MIX SOME OF THAT     
       WITH THE AHI.            

401
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,553
SO REALLY NICE AND LIGHT.       
JUST KINDA MIXING IT UP,        

402
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,888
LETTING THE FLAVORS             
MARRY A LITTLE BIT.             

403
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,358
       THIS IS READY. WHAT WE'RE
       GONNA DO IS LET THIS SIT.

404
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,426
             GONNA LET IT GATHER
                 THE FLAVORS.   

405
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,962
           THEN WE'RE GONNA TAKE
                OUR WONTONS.    

406
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,232
    THESE ARE THIN. WE DON'T    
       WANNA OVERDO THEM.       

407
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,434
       ABOUT 15 SECONDS,        
   AND WE'LL BE READY TO GO.    

408
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,570
        AND WE'RE DONE.         
LOOK AT THAT.                   

409
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,239
NICE AND GOLDEN BROWN.          
LET 'EM DRAIN OFF HERE.         

410
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,174
   WHILE THESE ARE COOLING DOWN,
        WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD    

411
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:12,176
             AND MAKE THE WASABI
                 CREAM SAUCE.   

412
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,512
                    HEAVY CREAM.
LOVE THIS.                      

413
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:17,582
       SALT, SUGAR, LEMON JUICE,
             RICE VINEGAR.      

414
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,584
SO A LITTLE ACID COMPONENT,     
 A LITTLE SUGAR COMPONENT,      

415
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,186
SALT COMPONENT, GETTING         
ALL THE FLAVOR PROFILES,        

416
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,921
AND NOW THIS RIGHT HERE--       
             THIS IS THE KICKER.

417
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,189
THIS IS THE HEAT COMPONENT.     

418
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,992
           WASABI POWDER.       
    SOUR CREAM TO TIGHTEN IT UP.

419
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,327
       THEN THE WHISKING STARTS.

420
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,261
THE KEY IS TO WHISK THIS UP     

421
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,931
AND LET THESE FLAVORS           
   MARRY TOGETHER.              

422
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,733
              FRESH PEA SHOOTS, 
             JUST LIKE YOU LOVE.

423
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,068
            WE GET 'EM IN DAILY.

424
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,803
             GONNA HIT THIS WITH
             A LITTLE EEL SAUCE.

425
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,204
EEL SAUCE IS REALLY CRAZY.      

426
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:43,074
YOU'RE KINDA THINKING ABOUT--   
OF A THICK, STICKY SOY SAUCE.   

427
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:44,942
      GONNA FILL THESE TACOS UP.

428
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,345
       THE WASABI CREAM ON THERE
