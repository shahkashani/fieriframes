1
00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:04,069
   Hey, there. I'm Guy Fieri,   
     and we're rolling out,     

2
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:06,538
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,273
          This trip...          
Wow!                            

4
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:11,876
   ...we're serving up a true   
    Flavortown flavor fest...   

5
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,812
  That's why we do              
     "Triple D."                

6
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:17,816
...like a farm-to-table treasure
  in Sebastopol, California...  

7
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,752
      making bomb bacon...      

8
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:21,353
        They are the Smithsonian
                  of swine.     

9
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,422
...and blowing up the waffles...

10
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:25,090
               That's a dish.   

11
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:28,426
     ...an empanada emporium    
   going big in San Antonio...  

12
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,428
That's a lotta empanada.        

13
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,230
      ...and a legit taste      
          of Chicago...         

14
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,766
                This, I hear,   
              is the real deal. 

15
00:00:33,768 --> 00:00:35,633
 ...deep in the heart of Texas. 

16
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,368
        Ohh!                    

17
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,171
           That's all           
     right here, right now,     

18
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:41,840
 on "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

19
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:47,379
                     ♪♪         

20
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:53,852
                     ♪♪         

21
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,387
          So, I'm here          
     in Northern California     

22
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,122
        on the west side        
        of Sonoma County        

23
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:58,991
     in a great little town     
       known as Sebastopol      

24
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:00,392
    to check out a restaurant   

25
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,994
       that's owned by two      
     of my favorite chefs --    

26
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:04,129
  one you've seen on "Triple G" 
        a bunch of times.       

27
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:07,065
   And these two are all about  
  community and farm-to-table.  

28
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,535
          This is it --         
      Zazu Kitchen + Farm.      

29
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:11,870
                Pimento mac!    

30
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,605
      It's one of the most      
     innovative restaurants     

31
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:14,940
    in all of Sonoma County.    

32
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,341
  Kimchi tacos.                 

33
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,610
  WOMAN: We have a lot of great 
     farm-to-table concepts,    

34
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:21,279
   but I don't think anything   
  is quite as special as Zazu.  

35
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,681
    John, I need                
  a butcher board.              

36
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,749
      FIERI: And the owners     
    are willing to prove it.    

37
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,818
My friend Duskie Estes is a chef

38
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,420
    who's competed and judged   
    on "Guy's Grocery Games."   

39
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,489
     And her husband, John,     

40
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:33,291
        is the real deal        
    and a charcuterie champ.    

41
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,826
               But how do you   
               describe Zazu?   

42
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,362
  Authentically farm-to-table,  
    'cause we farm ourselves.   

43
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,764
     We raise our own goats,    
          sheep, pigs,          

44
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,165
        chickens, ducks,        
         rabbits, and --        

45
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,633
              Can you say that  
              five times fast?  

46
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:42,768
          -Yeah, I can.         
         -Probably not.         

47
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,103
                I don't think   
              she can, either.  

48
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:45,904
  But we have two food styles.  

49
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,640
He does rustic Northern Italian,
   and I do playful Americana.  

50
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,442
            "Playful Americana."

51
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,043
 She didn't use the             
 word "whimsy." That            
would've been worse.            

52
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,378
               Oh, thank you.   
              Thank you, John.  

53
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,848
      FIERI: And sometimes      
   the rustic and fun collide,  

54
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,050
 like in this crazy concoction. 

55
00:01:58,052 --> 00:01:59,918
            Black Pig           
   bacon-in-the-batter waffle.  

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,522
  Bourbon gelato, bacon toffee, 
  bacon baked into the waffles. 

57
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,524
   Absolutely guilty pleasure.  

58
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:06,792
                 What are we    
              gonna make today? 

59
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,326
-A bacon-in-the-batter waffle...
             -Okay.             

60
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,195
       ...bourbon gelato,       
          bacon toffee.         

61
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:12,197
     -It's a half-hour show.    
           -[ Laughs ]          

62
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,499
       John, you're gonna start.
         We're gonna make bacon.

63
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,601
Brown sugar, kosher salt.       

64
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:18,069
Chili flakes 'cause everything  
should have some heat.          

65
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,004
    Black pepper.               
And then the curing salts.      

66
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,874
  Rub this pork belly with this.
       How long is it gonna sit?

67
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:23,809
Two weeks, sometimes three,     
  and that's really             

68
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,344
what distinguishes bacon we make
from other people's bacon.      

69
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,880
It just sort of concentrates    
 all that goodness.             

70
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:33,218
Then they will go into a smoker 
for 12 hours on applewood chips.

71
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,021
This area of Sebastopol is known
      for the Gravenstein apple.

72
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,622
             Is that the reason 
           for the apple, or...?

73
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,791
Yeah, so, the fruitwoods        
tend to be softer and sweeter   

74
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,293
   than something               
like hickory or oak,            

75
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:42,627
      which is                  
a super-smoky smoke.            

76
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,095
   -It's a super-smoky smoke?   
             -Super.            

77
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,631
       -Super-smoky smoke.      
        -It's whimsical.        

78
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,032
               Not hitting it   
             with heavy hickory.

79
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,366
Yeah, we're not trying          
   to cover up --               

80
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,634
                 Hitting it     
             with heavy hickory.

81
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:50,769
          Look at that.         
          The Triple H?         

82
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,237
         -There you go.         
         -Bacon toffee.         

83
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,173
Sugar, water, butter.           
 All of it together.            

84
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,441
           -What temp?          
              -300.             

85
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:57,709
          -Bacon salt?          
              -Yes.             

86
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,578
-Can I just have a bowl of that?
         -Yeah, you can.        

87
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,713
I mean, you can have that one.  
I got more in the back.         

88
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,114
    Spread it out               
    on this pan.                

89
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,916
       Let it cool, break it up.
              This goes on top. 

90
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,184
                 What's up next?
         Bourbon gelato.        

91
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,652
              Do you guys make  
           a lot of gelato here?

92
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,787
      Yes, a lot of gelato.     

93
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,922
        -A lot o' gelato?       
           -A lot o'.           

94
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,924
This is, like, the easiest      
thing in the universe.          

95
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,259
                 If you have    
              a gelato machine. 

96
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,061
      -From Bologna, yeah.      
        -That's baloney.        

97
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:19,464
Milk, sugar, vanilla beans.     
 Bring it to a boil.            

98
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,866
      I'll take                 
the vanilla beans out,          

99
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,934
and then I'll temper it         
into the egg mixture.           

100
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,604
The yolks just kind of          
bump up the fat. Bourbon.       

101
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:28,740
       This goes into the gelato
              machine how long? 
12 minutes.                     

102
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,075
     The only thing we have left
       to do is make the waffle.

103
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,410
             -Yeah.             
         -Are you ready?        

104
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:32,878
           I'm ready.           
         Are you ready?         

105
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,146
 You don't ask, "Are you ready?"
               if I was ready.  

106
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,749
    -I might be ready faster.   
        -Make the waffle.       

107
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,751
      Buttermilk, egg yolks     
       from our chickens.       

108
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,086
                 Local eggs.    
                 Oh, really?    

109
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,687
            -Butter.            
             -Flour.            

110
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,022
                  Cornmeal.     

111
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,091
    Sugar, salt, baking soda,   
       and baking powder.       

112
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,959

 And then this is the only place
        where you can get       

338
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,914
 a really good chili cheese fry.

339
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,316
              All right, Chef.  
             So what do we got? 

340
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:01,052
TINGAS: We're going ground      
beef -- shoulder clod, 80/20.   

341
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,253
           That's a lot of clod.

342
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,588
 So we're gonna make            
     a wet rub.                 

343
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,989
                Cumin, onion.   

344
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,058
   Black pepper.                
             Granulated garlic! 

345
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,726
      Granula--                 
How'd you know that?            
                 Oh, 'cause...  

346
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,195
           just the way you were
             winding up for it. 

347
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:11,863
                Seasoned salt?  
That's exactly what it is.      

348
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:13,832
             And Worcestershire?
Worcestershire sauce.           

349
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:16,000
       And this looks like steak
                sauce to me.    

350
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,568
       It is.                   

351
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,470
       Love me some steak sauce.
          A little bit of water?

352
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,272
     Of course.                 
              How long is this  
               gonna marinate?  

353
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,274
   Two, three hours.            
                Two, "tree."    

354
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,343
 Then grind it.                 
                  You grind     
             all your own meat? 

355
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,078
      Yes.                      
                 Impressive.    

356
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,214
           What are we into now?
We're making the chili.         

357
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,749
Ground beef, the onion.         

358
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,283
                The jalapeño.   

359
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,152
   Jalapeños.                   
                I'm helping.    

360
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,421
         Cumin, garlic, paprika.

361
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,422
Chili powder, brown sugar.      

362
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,957
              Did you announce  
                at the Cubs?    

363
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,425
                Brown sugar!    

364
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,294
      And salt.                 
                     Aw!        

365
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:46,430
  Crushed tomatoes,             
ground tomatoes, pinto beans.   

366
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,899
You want to puree half of them, 
the other half whole.           

367
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,035
          Okay. How long is this
          gonna cook down there?

368
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,837
   A couple hours.              
                 All right,     
              chili's working.  

369

        Time to make the burger.

370

   And here we go.              

371
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,176
          We go from grilling it
    to hitting it on a flat top.

372
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,044
All we wanted was the char marks
    on the grill.               

373
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,913
             All right, Jimmy.  
  Put the bacon on.

Grilled onions, and             
then we're going to             
put the cheese on there.        

376
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:08,052
  Just cover it up.
