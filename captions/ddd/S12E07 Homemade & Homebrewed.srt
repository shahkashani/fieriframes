106
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:06,445
       IS THE ENVIRONMENT       
         THAT IT'S IN.          
      WHAT'S UP?                

107

108
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,182

 <i> THAT CAJUN STANDARD--BOUDIN.</i>  

117
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,204
         IT'S BASICALLY         
    SAUSAGE FILLED WITH RICE    

118
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:34,273
   AND A LITTLE OF PORK LIVER   
  IN IT--IT'S VERY, VERY GOOD.  

119
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,608
ALL RIGHT, BROTHER,             
SO WHAT ARE WE INTO?            
        WE'RE MAKING THE BOUDIN.

120
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,343
BOUDIN.                         
                          RIGHT.

121
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,879
IT LOOKS LIKE PORK STEAK WITHOUT
 THE BONE AND THE HOLY TRINITY. 
                  EXACTLY RIGHT.

122
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:44,683
               OUR BELL PEPPER, 
              OUR ONION, CELERY.
OH, GO BIG WITH THAT.           
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?             

123
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,217
                  LET'S DO THAT.

124
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:49,154
          GARLIC, SOME BAY LEAF,
            SALT, BLACK PEPPER, 

125
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,622
                      AND THYME.

126
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,357
                   WE ADD WATER,

127
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:55,293
   AND WE'RE GONNA LET THAT COOK
       FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES.    
GOT IT.                         

128
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,696
              NOW IF YOU HAND ME
                  THAT LIVER.   
CAN'T DO IT.                    

129
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,230
                   SURE YOU CAN.
NOPE.                           

130
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,698
DON'T DO IT.                    
                         WELL...

131
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,701
  DON'T EVEN                    
PUT IT NEAR ME.                 
                           OKAY.

132
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,836
IT'S LIKE MY KRYPTONITE.        
              THERE'S OUR LIVER.

133
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,638
               AND IF YOU COULD 
              HAND ME THE WATER.
TOYING WITH ME                  
WITH THE LIVER.                 

134
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,375
             POUR THAT IN THERE.
YOU'RE JUST GONNA BOIL THAT     
   LIVER DOWN, TOO, HUH?        

135
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,176
                   THAT'S RIGHT.
THE LIVER'S COOKED UP.          

136
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,178
                          RIGHT.
THE PORK'S COOKED UP.           

137
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,781
             NOW WE GRIND IT UP 
            TO MAKE THE SAUSAGE.
RIGHT. LET'S CUT                
THE LIVER FIRST.                

138
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,984
    SO HERE, I GOT YOU          
A LITTLE PIECE YOU CAN TRY.     
                         OH, NO.

139
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,387
WE GOT OUR LIVER CUT,           
PORK DONE OVER HERE.            

140
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,589
GRIND IT ALL TOGETHER.          
             RUN IT ALL THROUGH.

141
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,658
     ALL RIGHT,                 
WE'RE DONE WITH THAT.           

142
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,994
               YOU'RE GONNA KILL
              THIS LITTLE THING.
NEXT, WE'RE GONNA               
  ADD SOME RICE.                

143
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,463
ADD SOME GREEN ONIONS           
  TO THIS, PARSLEY.             

144
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,432
 ISN'T THAT PRETTY?             
WE GOT THAT MIXED UP.           

145
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,600
WE'RE GONNA ADD THE STOCK.      
 WE WANT TO GET THIS WET.       

146
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,869
  THE LIVER WASN'T IN THE STOCK,
              WAS IT?           
MAYBE A TOUCH.                  

147
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,404
                         CARTER.
ADD SALT AND PEPPER.            

148
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:40,939
                      MIX IT UP.
ALL RIGHT,                      

149
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,341
NOW WE'RE GONNA SPOON THIS      
     IN THE STUFFER.            

150
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,343
PUT THIS HERE                   
 LIKE THIS.                     

151
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,012
ALL RIGHT,                      
HERE WE GO.                     

152
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,347
SO THERE'S YOUR LINK.           
      TWIST IT.                 
                   JUST KEEP    
                 ROLLING IT OUT.

153
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,349
               TAKE A LOOKIE-LOO
                    AT THAT.    
THAT'S IT.                      

154
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,351
             AND NOW WE'RE GONNA
                  GRILL IT.     
BOUDIN ON.                      

155
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,620
         FOR A MINUTE OR TWO.   
     GIVE IT A FEW LITTLE POKES.

156
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,756
    THAT HELPS THE STEAM ESCAPE,
        SO IT WON'T EXPLODE.    

157
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,758
DON'T WANT TO LOSE              
    THE LIVER.                  
                   THAT'S RIGHT.

158
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,893
       WE GOT SOME SAUTéED ONION
            AND BELL PEPPER.    

159
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,963
      OKAY, THAT SHOULD BE DONE.
         PUT THAT ON A PLATE.   
    ONE SIDE                    
OF MY BRAIN SAYS,               

160
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,898
     "IT SMELLS GOOD,           
IT'S GONNA TASTE AWESOME."      

161
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,900
 THE OTHER SIDE SAYS,           
"LIVER, LIVER, LIVER."          
                 CREOLE MUSTARD.

162
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,568
                      THAT'S IT.

163
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,570
