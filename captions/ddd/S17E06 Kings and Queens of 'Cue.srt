00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:03,068
         Hey, everybody!        
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:05,738
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

3
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:08,073
          This trip...          
How do things look?             

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,609
    ...I'm pushing the Camaro   
         to the limit...        

5
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,211
     Oh, not good               
for the "Triple D" car.         

6
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:15,080
         ...in the hunt         
      for some killer "Q."      

7
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:16,482
   This is a pretty interesting 
              brine.            

8
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:17,082
   You just wait.               

9
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:18,750
    In Compton, California...   

10
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,018
             How are we looking?

11
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:21,286
      ...the backyard joint     

12
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:23,155
serving up their take on ribs...

13
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:25,557
Want to try some of this?       
             No, I just thought 
              I'd just sit here 

14
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,559
and watch you just bring        
them out and tease me with them.

15
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,495
            ...and the real-deal
            collared greens.    

16
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,029
       It is legit as they come.

17
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,298
 In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 

18
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,167
      the southern spot...      
Cry about it.                   

19
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,102
                 I know.        
         It gets me every time. 

20
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:39,971
     ...stuffing sandwiches     
   with barbecue's best cut...  

21
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,841
     So we're gonna give it     
  the flat top, much like you.  

22
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:43,976
              That's not flat.  

23
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:46,245
                  That's --     
              That's irregular. 

24
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:48,380
   And in Denver, Colorado...   

25
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:49,581
                 Now we go!     
               There you are!   

26
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,649
     ...the husband-and-wife    
         pizza parlor...        

27
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:54,052
       Good luck and good luck. 
      ...going pie high...      

28
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:55,254
             Hang on.           
   I'll go get the kitchen sink.

29
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,257
  ...with beer-braised brisket. 
                   [ Whistles ] 

30
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,724
          That is monster, man. 

31
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:01,927
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

32
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,395
         on "Triple D."         

33
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,547
     So, you're looking for     
    a killer barbecue joint.    

34
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:22,614
       How do you find it?      

35
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:23,882
 Well, you could read about it, 

36
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:25,283
     a friend could tell you    
            about it,           

37
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,085
 you could watch some crazy show
          about a dude          

38
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:28,887
  driving all over the country  
       trying great food,       

39
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,289
   or you could sniff it out.   

40
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:32,424
       That's why I drive       
         a convertible,         

41
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:34,159
  and that's what's led me here 

42
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,961
  to South Long Beach Boulevard 
           in Compton           

43
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,764
    to check out some killer    
      barbecue at Bludso's.     

44
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,170
       It's off the chain.      

45
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:48,373
      Pulled pork on a bun with 
     a baked bean and hot sauce.

46
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,842
    Hands down it's the best    
barbecue in Southern California.

47
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,512
      Texas-style barbecue.     

48
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:56,248
    FIERI: And Kevin Bludso's   
     got a reason for that.     

49
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:59,984
  My granny had a little small  
   shack in Corsicana, Texas.   

50
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,321
Every summer, my                
mother and father would         
send me down there...           

51
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:04,256
            To learn            
     the ways of the pit --     

52
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:07,025
     Lessons he shared with     
  family and friends for years  

53
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,393
      when he was off duty.     

54
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,928
        What were you doing     
   before you opened this place?

55
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,263
           Working for          
 the Department of Corrections. 

56
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,065
                     Seriously? 
    Yeah, yeah,                 
corrections officer.            

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,333
In L.A.,                        
he made the jump and went --    

58
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,803
no pun intended -- whole hog.   

59
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,205
Kevin is barbecue.              
That's all he talks about.      

60
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,940
MAN: Kevin puts a lot of love   
into his work,                  

61
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,275
and I'm telling you,            
you can taste it.               

62

Best ribs in town.              

63
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,679
The spicy sauce here            
is to die for.                  

64
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,081
      What are we making, boss? 
Spicy barbecue sauce.           

65
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,950
               So, hot water.

                           Whoa!

69
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:41,492
Kind of let that cook           
for a little while,             
warm it up a little bit.        

70
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:42,861
     And we got                 
  our tomato paste.             

71
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:48,233
And we whisk that around        
      a little bit.

84
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:09,988
            Got to stir this up 
            a little bit.

 got to have some righteous rub.

109
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:56,168
          We got to mix that up.

110
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,970
     That's a good-looking rib. 

111
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,905
                 And this is    
              the Compton trim? 

112
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,839
    Yeah, this is               
  the Compton trim.             

113
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,909
   And then we cut              
the brisket bone off.           

114
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,444
        When we cut mine,       
I just take it all the way down.

115
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,446
     Typically, when you trim it
          all the way down      

116
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,982
   almost to where it's uniform

    Spare ribs in the window.   

230
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,117
       Out of this world.       

231
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,719
    O'SHEA: Lamb ribs are up.   

232
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,320
   Best barbecue in the city.   
         Plain as that.         

233
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:45,523
  FIERI: And it all started as  
 a hobby for owner Erin O'Shea. 

234
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,592
All of my barbecue is like      
 hanging out with friends.      

235
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:48,326
       That's the way to do it. 

236
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,396
   And after years of working   
   in other people's joints,    

237
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,132
  she decided to open her own,  

238
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:57,335
  bringing Texas-style barbecue 
    to the people of Philly.    

239
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,804
  Most of the meats are smoked, 
      and it's dry-rubbed,      

240
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,006
          so the flavor         
    just comes from the meat.   

241
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,408
    Chopped brisket sandwich.   

242
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,409
    The brisket's delicious.    

243
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:06,811
                What are we     
           getting started with?

244
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,213
  This is the brine             
  for the brisket.              

245
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,280
We're gonna start with          

246
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:10,615
      salt,                     

247
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:11,749
       sugar,                   

248
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:12,817
     bay leaves,                

249
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,619
       garlic,                  

250
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,287
     all spice.                 

251
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:17,689
                A lot of it.    
      Yes.

253
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,226
      and water.                

254
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,627
               This is          
     a pretty interesting brine.

255
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,062
   You just wait.               

256
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,198
     So we're gonna             
bring this up to a boil.        

257
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,166
                How long        
         are we gonna simmer it?

258
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,300
Just for a few minutes.         

259
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:30,335
We're just looking to           
dissolve everything.            

260
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,438
 Okay, we've strained our brine 
        and let it cool.        

261
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,975
  We're gonna take our brisket  
         and trim it up.        

262
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,310
  So, we're gonna give it       
a flat-top, much like you.      

263
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:40,979
              That's not flat.

              That's irregular. 

265
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:45,517
   So, here we go. We're gonna  
 take a little bit of the point.

266
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,653

                in my history

272
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:03,735

       How long will this brine?

275
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,542
  This is gonna go              
 for about 36 hours.            

276
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,144
          And this is all going 
         for a brisket sandwich?

      Yes.                      

278
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:15,946
                So 36 hours,    

279
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,882
              and then we go to

 more of burnt ends.

melted into the meat.

00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,318
                   for our

333
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,518
             This is pork belly

Same brine that we used         
   for the brisket?             

337
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:41,993

    let it brine?

340
