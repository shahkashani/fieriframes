                 of L.A.?       

115
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:01,373
Your box looks like it took     
the subway to get there, bro.   

116
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,709
      That's a garbage bag      
 in case you need a garbage bag.

117
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,043
       We're still digging here.

118
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,445
     Did you know the new future
             of cooking         

119
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,648
               is not to have   
             90,000 ingredients?

120
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,317
      No, I have two dishes     
          for you, Guy.         

121

 Making us look bad.            

122
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:15,387
                Alright.        
         So run me through this,

123
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:16,454
          what we're gonna make.

124
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:17,789
  The empanadas are from DAMA,  

125
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,458
   which is my Latin-inspired   
            concept,            

126
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,259
 which is downtown Los Angeles. 

127
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,194
Then we can make the rice balls.

128
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,796
    Some people say arancini.   

129
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:27,732
     I say rice ball because    
they're like giant tennis balls.

130
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,736
    They're not like little,    
         dainty arancini        

131
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:33,871
that you find in a really, like,
   refined Italian restaurant.  

132
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:36,475
   These are Christian Petroni  
             like...            

133
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,277
             [ New York accent ]
    Yo, we're having rice balls.

134
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,145
           You want to come over
             today or what, huh?

135
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,549
     I would probably start     
   with the empanada filling.   

136
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,551
     So you're gonna go raw     
          empanada meat         

137
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,353
      into a hot sauté pan.     

138
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:51,089
          [ Normal voice ] Okay.
      What is this, ground beef?

139
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,358
      Ground sirloin and 1%     
        dry-aged as well.       

140
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:55,227
 So what my meat purveyor does, 

141
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:58,162
  he takes all of the dry-aged  
   scraps from all of the meat  

142
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:01,232
  they dry age, and then grind  
 that and add it to the sirloin,

143
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:02,901
      about 10%, to give it     
     a little bit more funk     

144
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,236
        and a little bit        
  more aggressive meat flavor.  

145
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:05,303
                    Okay.       

146
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,038
     You're gonna brown it.     
          Salt. Pepper.         

147
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,174
         There should be        
        two Yukons there.       

148
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,376
      Just do like a 1-inch     
         dice to those.         

149
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,577
   Let that meat just brown up  

150
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:15,046
            and then            
 you can add the potatoes to it.

151
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:17,382
 Alright. And how long does this
        need to cook down, Chef?

152
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:18,449
           20 minutes.          

153
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,851
           While that's working,
                   Chef,        

154
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,652
            let's talk about    
        making these rice balls.

155
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,855
 So you should have some cooked 
    risotto rice that's there   

156
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,191
        for you already.        
                           Tada!

157
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,526
       Stick it in a bowl.      

158
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,394
There should be some microplaned
        Parmesan cheese.        

159
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:33,064
        The cheese melts        
   differently in to the rice   

160
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:35,200
      when it's microplane      
    versus when it's grated.    

161
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,802
Unless you eat it all right now.

162
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,870
                Oh, it wasn't   
                tasting time?   

163
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,539
      Whisk up three eggs,      
      and then you're gonna     

164
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,543
      whisk those eggs into     
  that cheese-risotto mixture.  

165
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,878
         Guy, like this.        
           Look at me.          

166
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:48,780
                    Huh?        

167
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,250
       It should be tacky.      

168
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,351
              It's not as tacky 

169
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,353
              as some people's  
               outfits today,   

170
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,288
                 but it's --    
               it's on there.   

171
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:58,957
     I do a cupping texture     
           like this.           

172
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,758
         Look, I cup it.        
              Yeah.             

173
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:01,959
                        Okay.   
              Yes.              

174
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:05,096
        Scoop meat, peas,       
     two types of cheese --     

175
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:06,631
      ricotta, mozzarella.      

176
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,366
  Take rice on the other hand,  

177
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,836
           pat it here          
    so it makes it like this,   

178
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:12,371
        and then on top.        

179
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,239
              I've made enough  
             arancini in my day.

180
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,441
               But the key is   
                to make sure    

181
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,177
             that that top      
       really seals that bottom.

182
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,513
              Yes.              
                So we don't have
                  the bleed-out.

183
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:24,783
     You're gonna dredge it     
  in the panko-parsley mixture. 

184
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,385
           Oh, this is gorgeous,
                by the way.     

185
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,220
    We're gonna let these set up
    in the fridge ahead of time.

               into the fryer,

                we don't have   
              the big ba-bosh!

with this beef and potatoes?

198
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,012
        and 2 tablespoons       
      of the tomato paste.      

199
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,614

            of water.           

200

        Once it's cooked,

214
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,774

               cool those off   

215
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,775
             before we drop them
                in the fire.

           And, yes, we are down
             to the nitty-gritty

455
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:20,318
             of who's gonna get 
                 best dish.     

456
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,586
             It will not involve
             any cash or prizes,

457
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:24,188
                 simply just    
              bragging rights.  

458
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,658
         And amongst these five,
              that's a lot.     

459
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,927
Dijon mustard, capers,          
   mayo and chives?             

460
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,662
   Little bit of chopped dill.  
                         Got it.

461
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,264
         Let's see them         
          crepe skills.         

462
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,533
       I think                  
I went a little big.            

463
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,334
     Oh, no, that's perfect.    

464
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,602
    Because you can actually    
      shape the crab cakes      

465
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:43,074
   and cut the crepes with the  
biscuit cutters that I sent you.

466
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:44,876
   Almost had it.               

467
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,210
                It's probably   
              just his recipe.  

468
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,279
            Stop it.            

469
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,980
    I think there's             
a user error going on.          

470
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,215
    The fact that you're out    
          in the heat,          

471
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,884
   that might be messing it up  
       a little bit, too.       

472
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:55,019
   Michael, how can             
I start this crab cake?         

473
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,555
   So I like to make the sauce  
   separately in another bowl   

474
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,223
        and then fold it        
       into the crab meat.      

475
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,092
 One egg, a little bit of mayo, 
    a little bit of mustard,    

476
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,226
          some Old Bay.         

477
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,494
         Scallions in the sauce?

478
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,029
              Yeah.             
      Right into the sauce.     

479
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,230
      We're making              
the [indistinct] for it,        

480
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,099
     so we're not gonna         
break up all that crap meat.    

481
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,100
  This is one pound of crab meat

482
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,169
  with, I think, maybe not even 
        1/4 cup of panko.       

483
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,170
         And that's it.         

484
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,605
This is all thriller,           
     no filler.                 

485
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,241
  So let's mix all the dressing 
       into the crab meat       

486
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,677
     until everything's nice    
     and, like, homogenous.     

487
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,248
    Wait, do we get that flip   
   in slow motion over there?   

488
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,983
Yeah, can I see that flip       
       in slo-mo?

      Yes. Yes.                 

491
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,856
   Put in about 1/4 cup panko.  

492
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:34,458
    And just barely fold that   
        into it as well.        

493
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,794
  Hunter, you look like you're  
  from Maryland right now, man. 

494
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,263
  This is actually my first time
        making crab cakes.      

495
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,398
Finally.

          There it is.          

497
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,802
      So you have the oven      
     preheated at 350, 375.     

498
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,003
              That is correct.  

499
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,606
      Hunter's doing            
a very nice job by the way.     

500
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,475
      So you're gonna press     
       that into the mold       

501
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,343
    and push your -- push it    
   with your fingers in there   

502
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,611
   so that it takes the shape,  
   but don't smash it too hard  

503
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,080
         that it becomes        
       like a hockey puck.      

504
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,815
And this is the Maryland        
       Blue Crab?               

505
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,217
   This is Maryland blue crab.  
Fantastic.                      

506
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:01,952
     They'll go in the oven     
      for about 14 minutes.     

507
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,554
        What I like to do       
    is cook them on one side    

508
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,022
       for half the time,       
         take them out,         

509
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:06,757
     flip it and let it cook    
      the rest of the time.     

510
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:07,825
So we bust these out.           

511

under some severe temperatures  
here in Northern California.    

517
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,505
But don't go anywhere.          
Crab cakes go to the oven

00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,488
            Marcus? Chef Marcus?

566
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:45,690
          One of the first times

567
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,024
         we got to work together
            was on "T.O.C.,"    

568
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,226
  "Tournament of the Champions,"
      and he was our lead judge.

569
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,495
         That method --         
     I've never seen before.    

570
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,698
    I don't think               
 any one of us have.            

571
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,566
         Marcus, you have really
             spent a lot of time

572
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:56,833
                helping a lot   
               of other people  

573
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,035
         and things are not easy
               in Harlem.

575
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:00,905
            And I like to see   
        that smile on your face.

576
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,240
      What's up, everybody?     

577
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,440
           My name is           
     Chef Marcus Samuelsson.    

578
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,510
     I was born in Ethiopia.    
    Then I grew up in Sweden.   

579
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:10,514
     So really what you see     
  in my food is a combination.  

580
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,784
    Roasted cauliflower steak   
       with eggplant puree      

581
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,253
      and summer succotash.     

582
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:17,521
         For me, cooking        
     is a way of expression.    

583
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:19,990
     So when it's all about     
       super-fine dining,       

584
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,259
      I do that at Marcus.      

585

        and block party,

   it's all about Streetbird.   

590
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,535
           Right now,           
    we're in downtown Newark,   

591
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:32,937
    which we're getting ready   

592
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,339
      to do our Streetbird      
       pop-up restaurant.       

593
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,674
      It's fun. It's funky.     

594
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,676
      It's to go, you know,     
     it's just a good time.     

595
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:41,279
       Alright. So, Chef Marcus,
          what have you sent me?

596
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,481
       Chicken and waffle       
         from Streetbird        

597
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,616
    with a cornbread waffle.    

598
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:48,152
 It's all about party in a box. 

599
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:50,087
                 Let me turn    
            the waffle maker on.

600
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:51,355
       Get your oil ready.      

601
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:54,558
 So let's put a big, whole bulb 
      of garlic in the oil      

602
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:55,893
    and a sprig of rosemary.    

603
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,162
          What temperature      
     you want that oil at, Chef?

604
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:59,363
              320.              

605
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,998
             We have it at 321. 
               We'll lower it.

609
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,571
               That is the way  
                to my heart.    

610
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,640
                 What was in    
             the collard greens?

611
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,176
  Sliced onions, sliced garlic, 
       white wine vinegar.      

612
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,111
             And there's already
               turmeric, Chef?  

613
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,847
Because I've got this nice,     
beautiful color in there.       

614
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,717
         I sent you some        
   really good spiced butter.   

615
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,718
                What's in       
        the spiced butter, Chef?

616
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:22,987
    Turmeric, ginger, garlic.   

617
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,923
              -Oh!              
      -That sounds amazing.     

618
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,991
           Why can't I have that
              on my popcorn?    

619

           -Oh. Nice.           

620
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:34,064
 I sent you some brined chicken,
 so it's been brined overnight. 

621
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:35,866
         Put the chicken        
       in the buttermilk,       

622
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:37,501
 so it's gonna be nice and sour.

623
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:38,869
        And you got my favorite.

624
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,806
             You got drumsticks 
                 and thighs.    

625
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,874
                That is where   
             the real flavor is.

626
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,409
         In this dredge,        

627
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,611
   you have panko, cornstarch,  
       and regular flour.       

628
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:49,813
         And I sent you         
       a bunch of spices.       

629
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:50,881
                Flour spice.

                little onion,

00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,352

632
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:56,687
        So throw that in.       

633
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:59,023
   You know, I didn't grow up   
       with fried chicken.      

634
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,091
        Before we opened        
         the restaurant,        

635
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,159
        I was so nervous        
     about getting it right.    

636
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:05,362
  So actually, the first person 
  that the fried chicken for me 

637
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,031
        was John Legend.

639
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:10,567
          John came up,         
       fried the chicken.       

640
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,036
           This is how          
   you're supposed to fry it.   

641
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:15,039
      Well, the first time I had
    made waffles was with Elvis.

642
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:18,042
           And he told me, "Guy,
        you got to make sure..."

643
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:20,711
            You know what?      
       I forgot to mention, Guy.

      her trick.                

650

     Take the fried chicken     
     out of the buttermilk,     

651
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:35,926

653

     The first fry is really    
     just to cook it through    

654
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,198
        and then you want

 a method guy than a recipe guy.

   the right amount of polenta  
         going in there.

   that polenta is gonna keep   
    going in the background.

               Let me get       
         this bone marrow going.

799
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:50,207
  Just do a little bit of salt  
     and pepper over the top    

800
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:53,210
 and put it in your pizza oven.

    can all go together, Guy,

       to let that simmer.

      we take the pork butt     

823
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:37,921
      and we cut them into,     
    like, 4-ounce medallions.   

824
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:39,323
       We pound them thin.      

825
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:42,726
  We make a paste with parsley, 
    Pecorino, garlic confit,    

826
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,862
         and then we rub        
  the inside of that pork butt. 

827
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,198
         We then roll it        
     and tie it with string     

828
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,067

908
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:47,977
     that's been warming up

909
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,779

       around that polenta      

910

        can go all about.

  and splash that black truffle

        the meatball, so tender,

          that little bit of fry
              on the outside.

            You stand right next
               to the hot oil   

1131
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:00,002
              in the 100-degree

00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:05,007
       I think the poutine      
        should be ready.        

1134
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,276
          Okay. Coming over hot.

           Cilantro as a garnish

1138
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:13,750
    Look at that

1142
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,893
             The masala sauce...
Yeah. Who made that?            

1143

1146
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:30,099
            was gonna be equally
                as delicious    

1147
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:33,035
            because the marinade
               was so spot-on.

1149
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:35,772
             and the creaminess

00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:36,906

              the extra thing,  

1153
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:40,977
            like, why doesn't it
             always have cheese?

1154
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,445
                   I mean,
