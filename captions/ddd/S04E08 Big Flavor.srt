        ADD SOME AMERICAN CHEESE
         TO IT, AND THERE WE GO.
RIGHT.                          

102
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,620
       IT'S READY FOR THE OVEN. 

103
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,355
          THAT SMELLS DYNAMITE. 

104
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:44,823
                    MMM! OH HO! 

105
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,692
        THE MEAT'S SUPER TENDER.
           CHEESE IS ON POINT.  

106
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:50,028
                 THAT'S UP THERE
                 WITH THE BEST. 

107
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,696
         YOU COULD TASTE        
 THE FRENCH FRIES A LITTLE BIT. 

108
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:54,833
       IT HAD A NICE MEATY      
          TASTE TO IT.          
            VERY UNIQUE-TASTING.
                 VERY GOOD.     

109
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:57,636
     BEST PIZZA IN TOWN,        
         HANDS DOWN.            
   WE CAN PICK                  
ANYTHING WE WANT.               

110
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,638
     I LOVE MAC AND CHEESE,     
        AND I LOVE PIZZA.       

111
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,907
        TOGETHER IS LIKE        
       THE ULTIMATE BOMB.       

112
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,709
FOR YOUR MAC AND CHEESE,        
  WE NEED A LITTLE BIT          

113
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,744
    OF ALFREDO SAUCE            
TO GIVE IT SOME TEXTURE.        

114
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,713
 HALF-AND-HALF TO IT,           
A LITTLE GARLIC BUTTER.         

115
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,582
LET THAT SIMMER.                
         YOU MAKE THIS EACH TIME
            YOU NEED A PIZZA?   

116
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,317

                            WOW.

118
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,853
A LITTLE BIT OF PARMESAN,       

119
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,788
  AND THAT'S OUR BASE           
FOR OUR MAC AND CHEESE.         

120
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,458
            WHERE DO YOU BOIL   
        THE WATER FOR THE PASTA?
RIGHT HERE.                     

121
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,727
            THERE'S ONLY ONE    
         EMPIRE STATE BUILDING, 

122
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,863
             AND ONLY ONE BURNER
               HERE AT B.O.P.   

123
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:27,733
NO, I'VE GOT THREE              
 OR FOUR OF THEM.               
                 WHERE ARE THEY?
                  ON VACATION?  

124
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:31,469
NO, YOU JUST CAN'T PLUG 'EM     
    ALL IN AT ONE TIME.         

125
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,872
 OKAY, SO YOU GOT SOME          
PRECOOKED PENNE RIGATE.         
          ALFREDO SAUCE INTO IT,

126
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,808
      AND WE'LL ADD A LITTLE BIT
         OF OUR CHEDDAR TO IT.  

127
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,745
      GARLIC BUTTER TO OUR CRUST
          AND ADD OUR PASTA.    
LOOK AT THAT.                   

128
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:43,281
NOW HOW LONG WILL THIS          
     TAKE TO BAKE?              
             ABOUT FOUR MINUTES.

129
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,749
   IT'S A GOOD-LOOKING CRUST.   

130
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,419
              MMM. CHEESY BREAD 
              WITH PASTA ON IT. 

131
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,622
     I THINK THAT'S REALLY GOOD.
      THE KIDS MUST LOVE THIS.  
OH, THEY LOVE IT.               

132
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,824
    IT'S LIKE MY TWO FAVORITE   
    THINGS. IT'S REALLY GOOD.   

133
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,694
        IT'S AWESOME.           
IT MAKES A NEW JERSEY           
  OR NEW YORK PIZZA             

134
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,429
PALE BY COMPARISON.             

135
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:58,630
                       (Guy) NO.
IT DOES.                        

136
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,832
  YOU CAN DEFINITELY TELL THAT  
  IT'S BRICK OVEN-BAKED PIZZA.  

137
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:04,503
            THAT IS A DYNAMITE, 
           DYNAMITE PIZZA OVEN. 

138
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,571
THIS OVEN IS 8 FEET WIDE,       
      8 FEET DEEP?              
                            YES.

139
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,307
FROM ITALY.                     
                     FROM ITALY.

140
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,842
AND WHAT TYPE OF WOOD           
    ARE WE USING?               
         WE'RE USING A HARD OAK.

141
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:13,644
  AND THAT DECK'S               
AT ABOUT 750 TODAY?             
                   PUT YOUR HAND
                     IN THERE,  

142
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,315
     IF YOU CAN KEEP IT IN THERE
      MORE THAN THREE SECONDS,  

143
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,583
            IT'S NOT HOT ENOUGH.
IT WILL LITERALLY COOK          
IN, LIKE, FOUR MINUTES?         

144
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,919
                         MM-HMM.
 I CAN NOT BELIEVE HOW CRISP    
THAT CRUST IS ON THAT PIZZA.    

145
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,654
ONLY WAY TO GO.                 
            <i> AND WHEN</i>           
    <i> YOU'RE LOADING IT UP...</i>    

146
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,857
    YOU CAN MAKE                
YOUR OWN COMBINATION.           
               OVER 50 TOPPINGS.

147
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:29,461
    I'VE NEVER SEEN POTATOES    
 AND RICOTTA CHEESE WITH SPINACH

148
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:30,862
      ALL AT THE SAME TIME      
          ON THE PIZZA.         

149
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:34,399
    AN 18-INCH PIZZA WITH ALL   
   52 TOPPINGS FOR 175 BUCKS?   

150
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,734
179.                            
               GOIN' UP 4 BUCKS.

151
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,935
        AND PEOPLE COME IN      
   AND SAY, "GIVE ME ALL OF IT"?
YEP.                            

152
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:41,473
             LOTS OF BIG FLAVOR.
I DO LOVE PIZZA, SO YOU CAN     
  PUT ANYTHING ON A PIZZA       

153
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:42,874
   AND I WOULD                  
PROBABLY EAT IT.                

154
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,744
       I LOVE THE FACT THAT THEY
       PUT SOY CHEESE ON PIZZA. 

155
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:48,880
          VEGETARIAN PIZZA--    
       I USE A VEGAN SOY CHEESE.

156
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:51,549
               JUST A LITTLE BIT
                MORE MARINARA.  
IT'S GOT GREAT FLAVOR.          

157
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,818
         PUT OUR VEGGIES ON TOP 
            OF THE MARINARA.    

158
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,553
            BLACK OLIVES,       
    ARTICHOKE HEARTS, MUSHROOMS.

159
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,489
BIG SELLER, THIS ONE?           
                           YEAH.

160
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,425
       BROCCOLI, A LITTLE ONION,
        A COUPLE LITTLE CAPERS. 

161
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:01,827
OH, THAT'S A NICE               
 LITTLE KICKER.                 

162
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,629
                     SOY CHEESE.
 THE SOY CHEESE                 
SCARES ME A BIT.                

163
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,631
                  OH, IT'S GOOD.
OH, THAT IS GOOD.               

164
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,034
KIND OF A FUNKY FLAVOR          
   TO IT. I LIKE IT.            

165
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,570
       THIS COOKS               
THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME?        
            ABOUT THREE MINUTES.

166
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,572
 3 MINUTES? NO WONDER           
YOU CAN COOK 120 PIZZAS         

167
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,973
   AND ONLY COME IN             
AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING.         

168
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,643
     MMM. THERE'S SO MUCH FLAVOR
     GOING ON IN THAT MARINARA. 

169
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,645
             THE CHEESE HAS GOT 
             A NICE TANG TO IT, 

170
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,647
 BUT IT REALLY COMPLEMENTS WELL.
     IT'S NICE. IT'S CREAMY.    

171
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,784
         BUT THE CAPERS ARE WHAT
           MAKE IT. I LOVE IT.  

172
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:26,985
         DUDE, YOU KILLIN' THIS.
THANK YOU.

              A WHOLE PIECE.    
     IT BLENDS REALLY WELL.     

174
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:30,922
     ALL THE VEGETABLES MIX     
      TOGETHER REALLY GOOD.     

175
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,058
  THE CAPERS--THEY ADD ANOTHER  
     LEVEL OF FLAVOR TO IT.     

176
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:36,794
THEY'VE MADE IT                 
 INTO AN ART.                   
        (woman) TONS OF CHOICES.

    THE FLAVORS ARE UNIQUE...   
       MMM... AND DIVINE.       

198
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,010
      IT'S LIKE                 
BEING BACK IN MIAMI.            
         <i> OR HAVANA.</i>            

199
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,813

 <i> ALL THIS COOKED BY A WOMAN...</i> 

204

   <i> WHOSE BACKGROUND IS GREEK.</i>  

205
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,759
   YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE CUBAN   
       TO COOK CUBAN FOOD,      

206
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,995
      BUT IT'S REALLY GREAT     
 IF YOU CAN LEARN FROM A CUBAN. 

207
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,965
                SANDWICH CUBANO.
  <i> THAT'S WHAT NIKI STAVROU DID</i>

        <i> NINE YEARS AGO.</i>        
HE'S FROM CUBA.                 

209
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,371
      THE RECIPES               
THAT I LEARNED FROM HIM         

210
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,706
ARE AUTHENTIC CUBAN RECIPES,    

211
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,375
 AND IT'S BEEN IMPORTANT        
THAT I KEEP IT THAT WAY.        

212
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:58,777
       THIS IS WHAT I COME FOR. 

213
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,179
       THE RANCHERO CUBANO      
 WITH THE BEANS AND PLANTAINS-- 

214
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:02,847
       IT'S A REALLY GOOD       
     ASSORTMENT OF FLAVORS.     

215
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,383
                DO YOU RECOMMEND
                 THE PICADILLO? 
ABSOLUTELY.                     

216
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:06,785
IT'S GOT A GOOD                 
 FLAVOR TO IT.                  

217
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,987
   IT'S A VERY A TRADITIONAL,   
      AUTHENTIC CUBAN DISH.     

218
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,855
               WE'RE GONNA START
                WITH THE BEEF.  

219
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,391
     I'M JUST GONNA LET IT START
       BROWNING FOR A MINUTE.

              OF SALT, PEPPER.  
SO WE'RE ALL BROWNED UP.        

221
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,863
   NOW WHO ELSE                 
JUMPS IN THE POOL?              
               THE CREOLE SAUCE.

222
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,865
 THE CREOLE SAUCE               
IN THE CUBAN FOOD?              
                           YEAH.

223
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,468
   THAT'S PART OF THE SPANISH   
       INFLUENCE IN CUBA.       

224
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,937
WHAT YOU GOT--THE OREGANO       
     AND THE GARLIC             

225
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,739
   AND THE PEPPERS              
AND THE TOMATO SAUCE.           
                        EXACTLY.

226
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,609
           GREEN STUFFED OLIVES.
SOMETIMES CALLED                
 SPANISH OLIVES                 

227
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:31,743
 WITH THE LITTLE                
PIMENTOS INSIDE.                

228
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,613
          THAT ADDS A LITTLE BIT
            OF SALTINESS, ALSO. 

229
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,748
MY MOUTH'S WATERING.

SMELLS KILLER.

                   OF SALTINESS 

247
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,654
              FROM THE CAPER    
           THAT WAS RIGHT THERE.

248
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,657
        SWEETNESS OF THE RAISIN 

249
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:19,924

                  EVERY DAY.

00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,485
   OLD BAY SEASONING. OLD BAY   
ACCENTS THE SEAFOOD REALLY WELL.

391
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:48,819
                 BAY LEAVES     
             AND MINCED GARLIC. 

392
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,821
     OH, YOU SEE HOW THE FLAVORS
         ARE COMING TOGETHER    

393
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,291
       AND EVERYTHING'S STARTING
          TO MARRY IN THERE?    

394
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,625
      WE GOT ONE IMPORTANT STEP 

395
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,227
THAT WE'VE GOT TO MAKE--        
  THE SMOKED SAUSAGES.          

396
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,497
              THEY'VE GOT TO GO 
             IN WITH THE BUTTER.
  TO BRING THAT FAT             
OUT OF THAT SAUSAGE,            

397
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,565
      YOU WANT                  
TO RENDER THAT DOWN.            
                     RENDER FAT.

398
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,833
FLOUR'S GOING DOWN.             
                  YEP, FLOUR'S--

399
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:04,835
WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE ROUX       
  RIGHT INSIDE OF THAT.         

400
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:07,838
                  NOW I NEED    
               THE SHRIMP STOCK.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T SOUS-CHEF     
   FOR MANY, ALL RIGHT?         

401
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,575
     NOW DID YOU MAKE           
THIS SHRIMP STOCK YOURSELF?     
                     YES, I DID.

402
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:11,842
   ABOUT 200 POUNDS OF SHRIMP   

403
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,844
                BOILS DOWN TO BE
                 ABOUT A GALLON.
OH.                             

404
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,314
           TOMATO SAUCE,        
   AND WE'RE GONNA LET THIS COOK

405
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,782
            FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES
                 TO AN HOUR.    

406
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,784
WE'RE ALL TIGHTENED UP?         
                  LOOKIN' GREAT.

407
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,786
      I ACTUALLY HEAT THE SHRIMP
               TO ORDER.        

408
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:24,655
  IF I HAVE PREACHED ONE THING, 
        THAT WOULD BE IT,       

409
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,791
IS THAT SEAFOOD OVERCOOKS,      
    AND WHEN PEOPLE GO          

410
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,059
AND MAKE THESE BIG VATS         
  OF GUMBOS OR STEWS,           

411
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:31,529
THEN THEY LEAVE EVERYTHING IN   
THERE, ALL IT DOES IS JUST...   
                           MUSH.

412
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,865
IT EITHER TURNS TO MUSH         
  OR TURNS INTO BBs.            
                         RUBBER.

413
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:36,734
THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT.        
        THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT.

414
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,604
IT'S SERVED OVER A LIGHT        
LONG-GRAIN BASMATI RICE.        
                      (whistles)

415
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:40,872
               THIS IS SOUTHERN 
                CREOLE COOKING  

416
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:44,675
         WITH A LITTLE INFLUENCE
            OF BASMATI RICE?    
IT HOLDS THE SAUCES,            

417
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,478
   AND IT REALLY MAKES          
FOR A NICE PRESENTATION.        

418
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,547
     MMM. THIS IS FANTASTIC.    

419
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,484
        THE SHRIMP              
IS REALLY NICE AND TENDER.      
             EVERYTHING'S FRESH.

420
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:56,554
ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT    
  THIS IS THE BASMATI RICE.     

421
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:59,490
IT'S A NICE FLAVORFUL RICE.     
        IT'S LIGHT.             

422
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:00,691
OH, THAT'S GREAT.               

423
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,893
THAT SAUSAGE IS DYNAMITE.       

424
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,830
WE EAT OVER IN NEW ORLEANS QUITE
A BIT, BUT THIS IS JUST AS GOOD.

425
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,766
 AND THE SHRIMP ARE REALLY FRESH
         AND VERY TASTY.        

426
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,768
    <i> AND THEY'RE SERVING THEM</i>   
        <i> BLACKENED, TOO,</i>

<i>WITH D's OWN BLACKENING SPICE.</i>  

429
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,507
     WHEN YOU BITE INTO IT,     

430
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,509
          YOU JUST KNOW         
  YOU'RE HAVING SOMETHING GOOD. 

431
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,845
                 WE GOT PAPRIKA.
WHICH IS THE PREDOMINANT.       

432
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,780
   THREE TO ONE TO EVERYTHING.  
   BUT YOU GOT CAYENNE PEPPER.  

433
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,849
         THAT'S THE SUPER SPICE.
THAT'S THE HEAT?                

434
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,851
                YOU GOT OREGANO.
                 YOU GOT THYME. 
OOH.

OF ALL SPICES.                  

437
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,857
                  THAT'S RIGHT. 
                 BLEND THAT UP. 

438
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:34,525
  YOU CAN MAKE YOUR

439
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,061

           ALSO ADJUST THE SPICE

440

MM-HMM.

MMM. REALLY NICE.               

444
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:46,804

THAT THE BLACKENING             

445
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:50,541
 HAS TO BE SO SPICY HOT         
THAT YOU CAN'T ENJOY IT.        
        BLACKEN MEANS FLAVORFUL.

446
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,543
