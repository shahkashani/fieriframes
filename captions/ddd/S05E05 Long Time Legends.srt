OH, THERE'S SOMETIMES           
  I LIKE ROAST BEEF             

95
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,966

                  IT GOT FLAVOR,

96
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,368

              JUST VERY TASTY.  

97
00:03:56,503 --> 00:04:00,638

                TURKEY SANDWICH.

                  FOR $5.50?    
THAT'S RIGHT.

A LITTLE DARK MEAT, TOO.        

112
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,746
LOOK AT THAT. SO YOU MAKE       
 THE GRAVY FROM SCRATCH?        
                            YES.

NEARLY AS GOOD AS THIS.

OKAY.                           

147
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,227
                WE ADD A LITTLE 
                GARLIC IN HERE. 

148
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,829
  A LITTLE BIT MORE, BECAUSE WE 
 NEED A GOOD FLAVOR TO COME OUT.

149
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,765
     THEN WE GOT A LITTLE ONION,
            WHITE PEPPER,       

150
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,767
BUT LESS THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE,
    YOU KNOW, WHITE PEPPER--    

151
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,902
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT TRYING        
     TO MAKE IT HOT.            

152
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,438
        THEN WE DO A PINK SALT, 
      THEN WE DO A NITTY-GRITTY.

153
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:15,974
THE NITTY-GRITTY?               
       OH, YES. THE NITTY-GRITTY
              MEANS WINE.       

154
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,976
               IF WE DON'T HAVE 
               THE NITTY-GRITTY,

155
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,978
            I MEAN, YOU'RE GOING
              TO BE IN TROUBLE. 

156
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,647
   WE ADD A LITTLE WATER FOR--  
 NOT TO GET US STUCK ON THE PAN.

157
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:25,583
SO HOW LONG IS THIS             
   GONNA GO FOR?                
                    NO MORE THAN
                    THREE HOURS.

158
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,586
     AND WITH THIS HALFWAY DONE,
        WE DROWN IT IN SAUCE.   

159
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,721
WHAT'S THE BASE                 
 OF THE SAUCE?                  
          THE STOCK OF THE LAMB.

160
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,657
OH, SO THE DRIPPINGS THAT WERE  
   GOING ON WITH THE LAMB--     
                          RIGHT.

161
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:34,659
LOOK AT THOSE.                  
            DO YOU WANT TO TASTE
                ONE OF THOSE?   

162
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:35,727
NO.                             
                        NO, HUH?

  IT'S SAVORY.                  

166
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:45,337
IT'S ROASTED DOWN.              
  IT FALLS APART.               

167
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,071
  THERE'S TONS                  
OF FLAVOR IN IT.                

168
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:50,208

   WOW. THAT'S DELICIOUS.

                 THE LAMB SHANK.

           HERE, TOO?"          

180

  I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER       
SEEN A FISH CUT LIKE THAT.      

216
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,363
  CARP'S PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE  
 THAT HAS THE LITTLE WIDE BONES.

217
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,365

218

                        CORRECT,

219
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:58,136
  BUT THEY GOTTA MAKE SURE WHEN 
 THEY PUT THE BREADING IN THERE,

220
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,904
         THEY BREAD SO THEY     
     OPEN UP LIKE LITTLE FINGERS

221
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:02,840
  AND THEY'LL FRY UP. FIRST CUT 
  I MAKE IS I CUT OFF THE TAIL. 

222
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,043
            THEN THERE'S THE RIB

        ALWAYS THE RIB.         
YOU GO TAIL AND RIB,            
OR STRAIGHT UP RIB?             

225
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,916
                      JUST RIBS.
    THE TAILS OVER THE RIBS,    

226
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,850
         'CAUSE THEY GOT        
   A LITTLE MORE MEAT ON 'EM.   

227
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,387
SO NOW WE MAKE THE BATTER.      
   SO GIVE US A RUNDOWN.        

228
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,389

229
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:20,592
                     CORN FLOUR.
BOTH FLOURS USED A LOT          
     IN DREDGING.

00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:23,594

              SALT FLAVORING.   

233
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:32,937
SALT FLAVORING?                 
                            YES.

234
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,872

              SPECIAL SEASONING.
               SALT AND PEPPER. 
WHOA!                           

238
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,882
         WE'RE GONNA FLOUR IT UP
           SO THE FLOUR GETS--  
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE                
  TICKLING IT.                  

239
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:47,018
IT'S THE TICKLE TECHNIQUE.      
          SCRATCH YOUR FINGERS  
        ACROSS THOSE SCORE MARKS

240
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,287
              SO THE FLOUR GETS 
             IN THE SCORE MARKS.

241
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,222
KIND OF LOOKS LIKE              
  A LOBSTER TAIL.               

242

     IT'S A CARP TAIL.          

244
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:58,029
JUST RIGHT IN.                  
             LET IT FIRM UP,    
         HARDEN UP A LITTLE BIT.

245
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:00,998
   LOOK AT THAT. KIND OF LOOKS  
 LIKE ONE OF THEM BLOOMIN' CARP.

246
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,901
            SLICE OF RYE BREAD. 

247
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,835

                  BUT NOT.      

249
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,174
                I REALLY DO HAVE
                  TO ASK YOU...

               ANY RESEMBLANCE?

00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,445
                   DO IT TO IT. 

252
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,113
OH!                             

253
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:18,516
          MAN, WHEN HE SAID     
    SOAK IT IN SOME HOT SAUCE...

254
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,451
                         MMM.   

255
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,921
           GREAT. IT FRIES WELL.
           IT'S NICE AND MOIST. 

256
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,724
     I GOTTA SAY THAT THE BATTER
       AND THE SCORING METHOD   

257
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,394
           MAKES IT WORK.       
     I HAVEN'T TASTED ANY BONES.

258
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,462

260
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,668
  ONCE YOU GET THE FIRST BITE,  
   YOU KNOW, IT SURPRISES YOU.  

261
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,870
    IT FALLS APART,             
AND IT'S REALLY TENDER.         

262
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,072

288
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:46,070

      CATFISH RIGHT THERE.      

291
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,877
   I ALWAYS GET                 
THE MEDIUM CATFISH.             

292
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:55,413
           WE HAVE A MEDIUM SIZE
             AND A LARGE SIZE.  
     ONE WILL FILL YOU UP.      

293
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,482
      THAT'S A BIT OVER A POUND.
            FOR ONE PERSON.     

294
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,083
               SALT AND PEPPER. 

295
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,152
            WE USE THE BREADING 
           FOR CARP AND CATFISH.

296
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,222
NOW DO YOU TICKLE               
 THIS FISH, TOO?                
                NO, WE JUST WANT
                TO GET THE FLOUR

297
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,158
    IN THOSE THREE SCORE MARKS  
   SO THE FISH FRIES UP EVENLY. 

298
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,160
AND THAT'S IT.                  
                  AND THAT'S IT.

299
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,629
SO THIS WILL GET                
   FRIED UP.                    
          THAT TAKES 15 MINUTES.

              DRAIN OUT OF IT.

   HAVE A FLAVOR TO IT.         

385
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:39,203

                 PULL IT CLEAN. 

479
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,958
        THE OTHER MARRIAGE      
   TO THE MEAT IS THE ESCAROLE. 

480
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,960
         SOME PEOPLE PUT SPINACH
         IN THEIR WEDDING SOUP, 

481
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,962
            BUT WE USE ESCAROLE.
NICE BROACH.                    

482
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,964
OH, THAT'S A MOUND              
   OF MEATBALLS.                

483
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,700
LOOK AT THAT. YOU HAVE NOT HAD  
ONE OF THEM COME OFF THE TRAY.  

484
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,303
  NICE AND SIMPLE FOR THIS      
ITALIAN WEDDING. I LIKE THAT.   

485
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:35,239
         SO GIVE THAT AN HOUR,  
      AND WE'LL ADD THE CHICKEN.

486
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,107
SO WE GOT DARK MEAT             
  AND WHITE MEAT?               

487
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,610
               YEAH, EVERYTHING.
THAT SMELLS GOOD. SO AS SOON    
AS THIS GOES IN, WE'RE READY?   

488
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,579
         WE'RE ABOUT READY, YEP.
LET'S SERVE SOME UP.            

489
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,114
I WANT TO TRY IT.               
                YOU WANT TO TRY?

490
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,115
MMM. OH.                        

491
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,984
THAT IS REALLY TASTY.           

492
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,053
THIS IS SO MACK.                

493
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:51,589
SEE? I'VE GOT THE HUNCH         
ALMOST, WORKING ON THIS.        

494
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,591
THE GREENS ARE AWESOME.         

495
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:56,126
I'M TAKING A CULINARY STROLL    
     WITH THE ESCAROLE.         

496
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,128
         WE HAVE BIGGER SPOONS. 

497
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,530
LISTEN--                        

498
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,932
I'M SO CLOSE TO JUST PUTTING    
THE WHOLE THING IN MY MOUTH.    

499
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:04,335
       DO YOU TASTE THE MARRIAGE
             OF THE MEAT...     
OH.                             

500
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,404
                 AND THE GREENS?
   I FEEL LIKE I'M AT           
THE RECEPTION RIGHT NOW.        

501
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,939
                 SUCH THE NAME. 

502
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,208
       I LOVE IT. IT'S ONE      
      OF MY FAVORITE SOUPS.     

503
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:13,210
              PLEASE DON'T TELL 
              MY HUSBAND'S AUNT 

504
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,212
             BECAUSE SHE MAKES  
           AWESOME WEDDING SOUP,

505
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,281
     AND SHE WON'T LIKE HEARING 
     THAT I WAS CHEATING ON HER.

506
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:20,218
                   GARLIC TOAST 
                  FOR EVERYBODY.
RESTAURANTS LIKE THIS THAT HAVE 
    BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME     

507
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,419
         ALWAYS MAKE IT         
       THE WAY WE LIKE IT.      

508
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:25,022
     QUALITY'S THERE, QUANTITY'S
     THERE. WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE? 

509
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,891
       I WANT 'EM TO SAY WHAT   
     MY UNCLE WOULD HAVE SAID-- 

510
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,893
          (speaking indistinctly
                in Italian)     

511
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:30,895
        WHICH MEANS, "WHEN YOU  
       COME HERE, YOU EAT WELL."

512
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,497
 WHEN YOU START EATING SOME REAL
  GOOD FOOD, YOU END UP GETTING 

513
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,432
     THAT--WHAT I LIKE TO CALL--
FOOD COMA.                      

514
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:38,369
I'M SORRY. MY FAULT.            
      WELL, LET ME JUST PUT SOME
          GLASSES ON THIS CAT   

515
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:40,838
         AND SPIKE HIS HAIR UP, 
         AND YOU GOT A NEW HOST.

516
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,373
 WELL, THAT'S ALL FOR THIS TRIP,

517
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,375
      BUT WE'RE HEADED FOR      
     SOME MORE GREAT JOINTS.    

518
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,645
    I'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME ON   
 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

519
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:50,715
          THAT'S ALL RIGHT HERE,
                 RIGHT NOW      

520
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:53,651
                ON "DINERS,     
           DRIVE-INS AND DIVES."
