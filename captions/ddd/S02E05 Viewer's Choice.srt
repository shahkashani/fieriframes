               WOW, THAT'S GOOD.
        I LOVE THAT IT'S        
         VERY ECLECTIC.         

506
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:20,484
 AND YOU CAN COME AND GET PIZZA 
         OR TATER TOTS.         
        <i> OR CHEESE CURD,</i>        

507
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,085
   <i> OR DEEP-FRIED CANDY BARS,</i>   

508
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,887
   <i> OR A DRINK THAT'S ON FIRE.</i>  

509
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:26,157
   THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE THIS   
         IN THE CITIES.         

510
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,159
                  THIS IS WHERE 
                I'M HANGIN' OUT.

511
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:30,627
        WHEN I COME BACK TO     
   MINNEAPOLIS, I'M COMIN' HERE.

512
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:34,398
WELL, HE LOOKS LIKE HE WORKS    
HERE. YOU'VE GOT THE TATTOOS.   
     I DON'T THINK THE HAIR     
       FITS HERE THOUGH.        

513
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,834
WHAT IS IT, A MOTOR LOUNGE?     
   NO, YOUR HAIR'S FINE.        

514
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,303
         "YEAH, HE LOOKS        
      LIKE HE'S GOT ISSUES.     

515
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,105
    HE PROBABLY WORKS HERE."    

516
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:43,107
  SO THAT'S ALL FOR THIS TRIP,  
        BUT WE'RE HEADED        

517
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:45,309
   FOR SOME MORE GREAT JOINTS.  
     I'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME     

518
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,779
           ON "DINERS,          
      DRIVE-INS AND DIVES."     

519
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:52,182
             OH, I LIKE THAT.   
           KEEP PUTTIN' 'EM ON. 

520
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,785
I'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER ONE.      
              I GET ANOTHER ONE?

521
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:56,787
   ALL RIGHT, TAKE 'EM BACK OFF 
    AND PUT 'EM BACK ON AGAIN.  

522
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:57,989
           (laughter)
