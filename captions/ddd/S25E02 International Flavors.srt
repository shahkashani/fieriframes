1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:03,335
       Hey, I'm Guy Fieri,      
    and you know what I need?   

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,537
   I need you ridin' shotgun!   
  I'm on my way to Flavortown.  

3
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:09,141
             This is            
 "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives."

4
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:10,609
          This trip...          
  Fire in the hole!             

5
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:13,745
       ...we're digging in      
to a worldwide culinary journey.

6
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,280
  This is amazing!              

7
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:17,282
First, a true taste of Africa...

8
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,684
      Mmm. Mmm!                 

9
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,953
          ...served up          
   by a San Francisco chef...   

10
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:22,687
    I don't want                
  this dish to end.             

11
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,356
      ...who also rocked it     
    on "Guy's Grocery Games."   

12
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,359
If I lived down the street,     
I'd be here every day.          

13
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,361
          Then a funky          
      Los Angeles joint...      

14
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,829
You're doing something          
 nobody's touching.             

15
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:34,165
    ...putting Filipino flair   
 on good ol' American classics. 

16
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,502
It's a grilled cheese           
     plus, plus.                

17
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:37,569
      And in Minneapolis...     

18
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:38,970
    This is where               
   it gets gnarly.              

19
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,105
     ...real-deal Indian...     

20
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:42,107
  Get it in the pan             
before I eat it all, Chef.      

21
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,643
     ...taking fresh flavors    
      to a whole new level.     

22
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:46,845
 Is anybody at home             
tripping out about this?        

23
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,713
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

24
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,183
      on "Diners, Drive-ins     
            & Dives."           

25
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:54,186
                     ♪♪         

26
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:04,796
            You know,           
   there's something going on   

27
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,132
  with these "Triple D" joints  
    and the restaurant owners   

28
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,535
    naming their restaurants    
       after animal parts.      

29
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:11,470
           Let's see,           
like The Whale's Rib in Florida.

30
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:13,138
   Then we had Clove and Hoof   
           in Oakland.          

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,873
     We had The Shaved Duck     
          in St. Louis.         

32
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,341
I mean, the list goes on and on.

33
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,210
          So, here I am         
  in Koreatown in Los Angeles.  

34
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,446
     You know what you get?     
     You get Belly & Snout.     

35
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:25,217
            Order up.           
  Chicken Adobo Grilled Cheese. 

36
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:28,153
 Belly & Snout is hands-down one
 of the best spots in Koreatown.

37
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:29,621
       Oxtail chili dogs.       

38
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:31,623
         It's delicious.        
   The flavors are addicting.   

39
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,492
         I don't always         
       get Filipino food,       

40
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,760
       and when I want it,      
      I have to come here.      

41
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,029
 We're in Koreatown,            
but this is Filipino.           

42
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,430
                    Yes.        
             Filipino-American. 

43
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,968
     Which means since 2014,    
  owner Warren Almeda has been  

44
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,538
 mashing up American faves with 
  traditional Filipino flavors. 

45
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,173
          Chef Warren,          
    he knows what he's doing.   

46
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,109
           He's doing           
   the Filipino people proud.   

47
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:51,844
    Order up. Sisig hot dog.    

48
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:54,246
    Sisig is different types    
           of porks --          

49
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:56,181
      the belly, the snout.     

50
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,984
            On top of           
 a traditional American hot dog,

51
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,785
       and then garnished       
         to perfection.         

52
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,654
 -Yeah, how do you say it again?
             -Sisig.            

53
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,190
 All right. So, this is the pork
  snout, and this is pork belly.

54
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,025
           A little bit of salt,
         a little bit of garlic,

55
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:08,327
         and then add the water.

56
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,061
 -How long's this gonna simmer? 
         -About 3 hours.        

57
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,462
This was a traditional dish?    

58
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,731
     This is a traditional dish.
         It goes well with beer.

59
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,667
Everything goes good with beer. 

60
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:19,271
So, we've got our cooked,       
cooled pork snout, pork belly.  

61
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:21,006
    And now we're gonna grind it
               for the Sisig.   

62
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,140
      Now what?                 

63
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,808
             So, we're gonna add
              the bell peppers, 

64
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,944
          jalapeños, red onions.

65
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,746
       Then we're gonna throw it
              on the flat top.  

66
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,681
        -Where we at now?       
 -So, this is the garlic crema. 

67
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:30,949
        This goes on everything.

68
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,017
            A little bit of oil.

69
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,218
       A bunch of pureed garlic.

70
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,820
               Garlic powder.   
             And a ton of salt. 

71
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,689
         We're gonna cook it off
           for about 20 minutes.

72
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,490
       Really?                  
So it's almost gonna caramelize?

73
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,759
              -Yes.             
     -Mix it with the crema?    

74
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,160
                    Yeah.       
             Grade-A sour cream.

75
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,361
  No Grade-B here.              

76
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,896
             All right, this is 
            the Sisig hot dog --

77
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,299
                beef hot dog,   
               garlic crema --  

78
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,034
             -Whoa.             
             -Sisig.            

79
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,036
  Oh, boy. Oh, boy.             

80
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,237
             Pickled red onions.

81
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,505
     Beautiful.                 

82
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,506
             Sliced red radish. 

83
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,175
                Green onions.   
                 Calamansi.     

84
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,244
       -Whatever that is.       
    -It's a Filipino citrus.    

85
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,445
     We grow it in our backyard.

86
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:01,980
-You grow that in your backyard?
             -Yeah.             

87
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,183
  -Throw in some chicharrones.  
        -And more crunch.       

88
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,187
     The snout's                
what it's all about.            

89
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,458
It eats bigger than probably    
any hot dog I've ever had.      

90
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,594
   The dog itself               
   is really good.              

91
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,930
The pickled onions play in.     

92
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:20,098
The garlic sour cream           
definitely adds some flavor     

93
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,801
 and a little acid.             
But that Sisig right on top?    

94
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:28,206
It's crunchy. It's tender.      
It's unctuous. It's fatty.      

95
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,875
It's just a really nice         
  complement to it.             

96
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,944
I want a whole sandwich         
      of that.                  

97
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,213
              MAN:              
     It has so many layers.     

98
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:36,481
  Every bite, you get a really  
   good combination of stuff.   

99
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,083
            Order up.           
    Longanisa Grilled Cheese.   

100
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:41,953
 I've been following Chef Warren
  since he had his food truck.  

101
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,355
FIERI: And even though he traded
 in the streets for a structure,

102
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,892
       he's still keeping       
    that original vibe alive.   

103
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,894
     You're still picking up    
        from the window.        

104
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,495
            Order up.           
   Pork Adobo Grilled Cheese.   

105
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,964
Ah, the grilled cheese          
     is so bomb.                

106
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,233
       -Oxtail Tater Tots.      
            -So good!           

107
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,302
     -What are we into now?     
  -The Oxtail Chili Tater Tots  

108
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:58,837
             and the Pork Adobo 
               Grilled Cheese.  

109
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,305
Like Mexican pork adobo?        

110
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,307
      -Filipino pork adobo.     
      -Filipino pork adobo.     

111
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,708
 -So, this is the Filipino part.
             -Okay.             

112
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,111
 So, we have cubed up pork butt,
                 soy sauce,     

113
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,780
             sugar cane vinegar,
      bay leaves, pureed garlic.

114
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,081
And then black pepper.          

115
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,449
             This is gonna cook 
              for three hours.  

116
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,785
  -Till it's shred, pull-apart. 
  -Till it's shreddable, yeah.  

117
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,520
        -What's up next?        
     -This is oxtail chili.     

118
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:16,721
     We're gonna add the oxtail.

119
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,656
 -Not chopped, just the oxtail. 
              -Yep.             

120
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,659
               Garlic cloves.   
            One whole red onion.

121
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,794
              Salt and pepper.  
                   Water.       

122
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,529
        Cook this for six hours.

123
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,197
   Then shred it.               

124
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,067
           A little oil. Garlic.
                  Mirepoix.     

125
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,470
      Now we're                 
French-American-Filipino.       

126
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,138
          -Red chilies.         
            -Mexican.           

127
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,940
                   Flour.       
              Spanish paprika.  

128
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,342
               Sweat this off   
           for about 20 minutes.

129
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,144
             -Next?             
          -Black beans.         

130
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,412
             Green bell pepper. 

131
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,612
                Oxtail stock.   

132
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,482
       -The oxtail stock.       
      -The braising liquid.     

133
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,351
           We'll let that reduce
             for 20, 30 minutes.

134
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,286
         -Okay. Next up?        
       -The peanut butter.      

135
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,354
         -In the chili?         
             -Yeah.             

136
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,822
 I got issues, kid.             

137
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,090
 And now the oxtail.            

138
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,025
    So, how long                
is this gonna cook down now?    

139
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,093
              For another hour. 

140
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,494
             We're gonna reheat 
               our pork adobo   

141
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,163
    to put on top of the cheese.

00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,305
        Then we're gonna garnish
             with Cotija cheese,

146
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:08,907
   a little bit of garlic crema,
              sliced jalapeños,

150

    Super creamy.

that you add with this adobo

   really takes it              
 to the next level.             

154
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:27,325
 It's just a really             
well-seasoned, delicious pork.

00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,593
                 Thank you.     

156

The tots are cooked perfect.    

157
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,599
     The oxtail                 
just screams flavor.            

158
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,267
 Not typical chili.             

159
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,204
Matter of fact, you're getting  
no American chili flavor.       

160
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:42,741
But what you<i> are</i> getting        
is just deep-down gravy,        

161
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:45,676
   meat, comfort,               
a little bit of spice.

    I've had a lot of grilled

00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:55,086
So, this is Brian Lando,        
one of my really good friends,  

167

168
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,024
on "Guy's Grocery Games."       
So, tell me what you think.     

169
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,226
          Tater tots are crispy,
         but the oxtail is soft,

170
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,763
    so both textures work great.

171
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,232
  You should think              
about doing food television.

00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:08,967

Little place. Fly by it.        
You'd never know you passed it. 

175
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,640

  coming out of it.             

176

           Hi, ladies.          
     Here's your short rib.     

207
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,714
 The food that you get is fancy,

208
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,783
        but it comes out        
    in a very unassuming way.   

209
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,385
Chicken Jambalaya in the window.

210
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,787
          The jambalaya         
   is so absolutely wonderful.  

211
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,789
         Very different         
  than the Southern jambalaya.  

212
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,392
So you're taking Louisiana and  
going right over to Ethiopia.   

213
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,927
         -That's right.         
  -All right, let's get going.  

214
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,197
 -We de-bone the chicken thighs.
           -All right.          

215
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,399
             Then we take, also,
         the chicken tenderloin.

216
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,000
               That's gonna be  
             cooked separately. 

217
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,335
    When you see                
  chicken fingers,              

218
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,003
 typically come from            
the chicken tenderloin.         

219
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,738
                That's right.   
        We're gonna marinate it.

220
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,008
     Get salt and pepper. We got
     fresh thyme, fresh oregano.

221
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,144
               All these come   
        in the community garden.

222
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,678
            -Really?            
       -Lemon juice. Yeah.      

223
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,415
                Pomegranate,    
  and a little bit of olive oil.

224
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:04,749
I got to be honest, Chef.       

225
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,618
I didn't see you move this fast 
in "Guy's Grocery Games."       

226
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,555
   No, I was paying attention to
   what other chefs were making!

227
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,024
              So, we have this  
   on top of the chicken thighs.

228
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,693
             -Okay.             
      -And the tenderloin.      

229
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:17,695
    And we marinate it overnight

00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,571
This really eats like           
this is all you need.           

569
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,441
Mmm. It's fulfilling.           
  It's nutritious.              

570
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,710
    I promise you               
you will love the dal.          

571
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,445
       Naan and dal ready!      

572
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:17,114
 We fight over the naan whenever
   we come to this restaurant.  

573
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:19,383
   It's every man for himself   
     when it hits the table.    

574
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,118
     It's like multi-layered    
           perfection.          

575
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,787
Multi-layered perfection.       

576
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,455
     Lights out.                
You just owned the show.        

577
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:25,789
      Tandoori Mixed Grill!     

578
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,991
       I love this place.       

579
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,592
               It's wonderful.  

580
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,062
You're a fantastic example      
  of the work ethic             

581
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:34,131
    and the pride               
and the respect of food.        

582
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:35,399
 Nicely done, Chef.             

583
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,204
So that's it for this edition of
 "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives."

584
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:43,074
 If you want to find the recipes
for some of the joints we visit,

585
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,076
   well, go to foodnetwork.com  

586
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,677
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

587
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,213
     on "Diners, Drive-Ins,     
           and Dives."          

588
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:51,349
     Is it part                 
of the music of the cooking?    

589
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:52,750
              -Hey!             
              -Yes.             

590
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,418
       Ha-a-a!                  

591
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,619
      Ho, hey!                  

592
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,620
                [ Laughing ]    
                 All right.     

593
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,088
     All right.                 
We'll be here all week,         

594
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,724
performing on Tuesdays.
