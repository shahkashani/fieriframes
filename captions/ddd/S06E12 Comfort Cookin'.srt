00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,190
            THIS IS WHERE       
     THE CHICKEN BACK CAME FROM.

391
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,192
    THEN I'M GONNA COOK IT DOWN,
       I'M GONNA LET IT BROWN.  

392
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,194
      AND I GOT SOME WHITE ONION
            TO ADD TO THAT.     

393
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,129
    NOW I'M GONNA COVER IT WITH 
    CHICKEN STOCK THAT WE MADE. 

394
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,198
  WHERE DID YOU LEARN           
THIS LITTLE TECHNIQUE?          
    THIS IS SOMETHING, YOU KNOW,
        OLD-SCHOOL EUROPEAN.    

395
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,135
    THIS IS MY RIGHT-HAND GUY   
WALLY'S WAY TO MAKE CHICKEN JUS.

396
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,204
         IT'S BEAUTIFUL. AS SOON
            AS THIS REDUCES...  
THAT TAKES US                   
AN HOUR OR SO.                  

397
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,273
                  RIGHT.        
          WE'RE GONNA STRAIN IT.
STRAIN IT.                      

398
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:12,209
(inhales sharply)               
          IS THAT CHICKEN-RIFIC,
               OR WHAT, MAN?    

399
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:15,546
  I'VE HAD PORK-TASTIC,         
BUT THAT'S CHICKEN-RIFIC.       

400
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,548
           ADD THE COFFEE TO IT,
              AND REDUCE THAT   

401
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,083
               UNTIL IT'S THICK 
                AND GRAVY-LIKE. 

402
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,085
ALL OF THAT FOR A SAUCE         
    FOR HAM STEAK.              
                        EXACTLY.

403
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:23,087
THAT'S GOOD.                    
               A DELICIOUS SAUCE
                FOR A HAM STEAK.

404
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,588
THIS GUY--OUT OF BOUNDS.        

405
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:27,624
HAM STEAK GOES FLAT TOP.        
                 PUT THAT DOWN  
                ON THE FLAT TOP.

406
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:30,561
          A LITTLE BLACK PEPPER.
    AND WHAT DO WE SERVE ON     
THE HIGH SIDE OF THE HAM STEAK? 

407
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,563
     POTATOES--NICE HASH BROWNS.
      THAT HAM STEAK ON THERE.  

408
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,033
      SOME OF THAT REDEYE GRAVY.
DON'T BE SHY WITH THAT.         

409
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,035
OH, I'M NOT GOING TO.           
                            MMM.

410
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:39,037
             THAT'S REALLY GOOD.
THANK YOU.                      

411
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,039
     THAT REALLY HAS SOME DEPTH.
        THAT'S LIKE A SAUCE.    

412
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,975
  YEAH, YOU GET                 
ANOTHER DIMENSION.              
      IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT
            HARD TO ADMIT,      

413
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,043
             BUT THAT'S BETTER  
           THAN MY REDEYE GRAVY.

414
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,445
        IT'S DELICIOUS.         
OH, IT'S REALLY GOOD.           

415
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,447
                   THREE EGGS,  
                STEAK AND CHILI.
GOT IT.                         

416
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,848
    THE MENU IS VERY UNIQUE,    

417
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,850
    AND THEY HAVE SOMETHING     
         FOR EVERYONE.          
                2-EGG BREAKFAST.

418
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,252
        EGGS, HASH BROWN, BACON.
    BACON'S DELICIOUS HERE.     

419
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,254
      <i> 'CAUSE AARON'S TAKEN</i>     
  <i> THE EXTRA STEPS TO BRING IN</i>  

420
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,457
        <i> WHAT HE LOVES.</i>         
BACON FROM WISCONSIN.           

421
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,658
SAUSAGE THAT'S                  
MADE LOCALLY.                   
    (speaking indistinctly)     

422
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,728
  <i> AND THE TIME TO MAKE ALMOST</i>  
    <i> EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH.</i>   

423
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,731
BAKING OUR OWN SCONES,          
THE WHOLE NINE YARDS.           

424
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,266
       BLUEBERRY MUFFINS        
      WITH THE LEMON CURD.      
     SO IT'S THE REAL DEAL HERE?

425
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,068
WE THINK SO.                    
      CHICKEN-FRIED STEAK       
           COMING UP.           

426
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,137
 MAKE OUR OWN CHICKEN-FRIED     
STEAK, WE MAKE OUR OWN GRAVY.   

427
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:15,073
    WE TAKE A LOT OF PRIDE IN   
 DOING ALL OF THAT FROM SCRATCH.

428
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:16,740
          REALLY GOOD,          
           REAL JUICY.          

429
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:19,143
 WE'RE MAKING COUNTRY GRAVY     
FOR THE CHICKEN-FRIED STEAK.    

430
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,145
 SO I'M GONNA START             
WITH A LITTLE BUTTER.           

431
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,680
DUMP THAT BACON IN THERE.       
         HE'S TRYING TO GIVE ME 
        DIET PLATE OR SOMETHING.

432
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:25,682
 THIS IS SOME OF OUR CHOPPED-UP 
       BREAKFAST SAUSAGE.       

433
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,684
YOU PUT A LITTLE MORE           
CRISP ON THAT BACON,            

434
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,620
          AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA 
         HIT IT WITH SOME FLOUR?
EXACTLY.                        

435
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,622
     COOK THAT OUT A LITTLE BIT,
         ADD A LITTLE MILK.     

436
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:34,091
              WE'RE GONNA LET IT
              COME UP TO A BOIL.
YOU DON'T MAKE YOURS            
    VERY TIGHT.                 

437
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:36,694
            NO, WE DON'T MAKE IT
             SUPER TIGHT AT ALL.
AND THEN WHAT ARE YOU           
GONNA SEASON IT WITH?           

438
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,230
   SALT AND PEPPER AND I'M GONNA
         ADD FRESH HERBS--      

439
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:42,233
             CHIVES AND PARSLEY.
BUTTER, BACON, SAUSAGE,         
     FLOUR, MILK--              

440
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,569
    A CHICKEN-FRIED FLIP-FLOP   
 WOULD BE FINE WITH THAT ON IT. 

441
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:47,171
YUM. YUM. OKAY, NOW LET'S DO    
  THE CHICKEN-FRIED STEAK.      

442
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,706
            GRANULATED GARLIC...
CUMIN.                          

443
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,908
...A LITTLE CAYENNE,            
 HUNGARIAN PAPRIKA.             

444
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:53,710
    OOH, SO YOU GOT A LITTLE BIT
           OF SPICE ON IT.      
ONION POWDER--                  
 REALLY GOOD.                   

445
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,246
                          ONION.
REALLY NICE.                    

446
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:57,248
          A LITTLE BLACK PEPPER.
    SEASON IT UP                
WITH A LITTLE SALT              

447
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,184
AND THEN FLOUR.                 
        BOY, THAT'S GONNA BE    
   A PRETTY BOUNTIFUL SEASONING.

448
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,186
YEAH. SO NOW WE'RE GONNA        
   POUND OUT A STEAK.           

449
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:05,256
THIS IS CUBE STEAK.             
LIGHTLY, GINGERLY...            

450
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,658
 THERE--IT'S NICE AND THIN.     
LET'S MAKE A LITTLE EGG WASH.   

451
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,528
 A LITTLE MILK,                 
SALT AND PEPPER.                
                  I LOVE YOUR   
              PRECISE MEASURING.

452
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:13,063
IT'S VERY, VERY PRECISE         
      OVER HERE.                

453
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,799
   A LITTLE BIT                 
OF SALT AND PEPPER.             

454
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,401
   DREDGE IT IN                 
THE SEASONED FLOUR.             
                  FLOUR STICKS  
                TO THE WET MEAT,

455
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,436
               THE EGG WASH     
           STICKS TO THE FLOUR, 

456
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,405
           AND THEN THE FLOUR   
         STICKS TO THE EGG WASH 

457
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:23,407
               THAT WAS STICKING
                TO THE WET MEAT 

458
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,144
         THAT LIVES IN THE HOUSE
            THAT AARON BUILT.   
DROP IT RIGHT                   
IN THE FRYER.                   

459
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:29,013
        350 DEGREES, CANOLA OIL.
              CRAZY TASTY.      
HOOK THAT UP WITH AN EGG.       
    HASH BROWNS DOWN.           

460
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:31,015
 CHICKEN-FRIED STEAK            
RIGHT ON TOP OF THAT.           

461
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:33,017
             GET A LITTLE EGG   
           RIGHT THERE FOR YOU, 

462
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,419
            AND THEN WE'RE GONNA
              GO FOR THE GRAVY. 
THERE YOU GO.                   

463
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,421
               HERE'S A LITTLE  
             HOMEMADE TOMATO JAM

464
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,023
                   TO GO WITH   
                 THOSE POTATOES.

465
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:41,292
           MMM. IT DOESN'T LACK 
                IN FLAVOR.      

466
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:44,228
    IT REALLY DOESN'T. I THINK  
   THE FRIED STEAK IS DYNAMITE. 

467
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:47,865
          MMM. IT'S REALLY GOOD.
               IT'S TENDER.     
SUPER TENDER.                   

468
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,366
         MMM. HANG ON A SECOND. 

469
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,569
       THE HASH BROWNS WITH SOME
        OF THAT TOMATO RELISH-- 

470
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,171
      THIS IS JUST OUT OF BOUNDS
              RIGHT HERE.       

471
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:56,507
                     MMM. OKAY. 
                     (mumbling) 

472
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,509
           THE GRAVY--          
       IT COMPLEMENTED IT,      

473
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,511
     SO IT MADE EVERYTHING      
     JUST THAT MUCH BETTER.     
VERY, VERY GOOD.                

474
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,579
  THEY HAVE REALLY UNIQUE FOOD  
         ON THEIR MENU.         

475
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:05,382

                 THAT IS BANANA.

478
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,922
                  REALLY,       
          THERE'S BANANAS IN IT.

479
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,124
      <i> WHEN WE COME BACK.</i>       
BANANAS IS GOOD.

482
