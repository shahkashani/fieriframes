00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,397
   It's not soggy.              
   Not too sweet.               

118
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:30,869
  The whipped cream             
with the ricotta in it...       

119
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,804
 gives it a richness            
and a little bit of tang        

120
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,072
   with the zest                
   of the orange.               

121
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,340
It's a great balance.           

122
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:36,474
  Good job, buddy.              
                  Thanks, Guy.  

123
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,676
               Appreciate it.   
  I'm impressed.                

124
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,744
                Crème brûlée    
              French toast up.  

125
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,546
               Have you tried   
  the crème brûlée French toast?

126
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:42,647
           Absolutely.          
                  Ridiculous.   

127
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,416
       I can't get enough of it.

128
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,817
          We never rest         
         on our laurels.        

129
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:46,952
      I always like to try      
           new things,          

130
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,287
     and then I have to see     

131
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,355
        if he would like        
         to execute it.         

132
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:51,757
       FIERI: The results?      
          You got it --         

133
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,626
      more outrageousness,      
       like this monster.       

134
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,495
             I have             
       your butter burger.      

135
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,698
   It's the juiciest hamburger  
      you can ever imagine.     

136
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,965
     All right,                 
 what are we making?            

137
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,268
         We're making the butter
         for the butter burger. 

138
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,036
   So, literally,               
there's butter in a burger?     

139
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,372
               Yes. One block.  

140
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,574
                Fresh basil,    
               fresh parsley.   

141
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,577
               Fresh tarragon,  
                fresh garlic.   

142
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,578
                  Cayenne.      

143
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,180
                A little salt   
                 and pepper.    

144
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,250
              Then we're gonna  
              whisk it all up.  

145
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:20,652
So, the butter's got to be      
  room temperature.             

146
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,320
     Otherwise,                 
you got yourself a big mess.    
                   That's right.

147
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,855
So, we'll let this set up?      

148
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,590
               I'm gonna grab   
             some plastic wrap. 

149
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,927
               Put the butter   
            on the plastic wrap,

150
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,662
           and you just roll it.

151
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,864
            And then you put it 
 in the refrigerator so it sets.

152
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:33,799
Right, so it hardens up.        

153
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,103
Now we're going to stuff butter 
    in a burger.                

154
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,005
This is our herb butter.        
                        Yes.    

155
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,073
      Take off                  
  some of the meat.             

156
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,875
   Put the butter               
   in the burger.               

157
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:44,876
              Yeah, the butter. 

158
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,078
                And hide it.    

159
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,546
And you're gonna cook this      
   on the flattop?              

160
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,814
             No, on the broiler.

161
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:50,882
       Really?                  
                     Yeah.      

162
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:51,883
  This is gonna be              
    interesting.                

163
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,889
A little more butter?           

164
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:58,823
                    Yep,        
       a little bit more butter.

165
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,692
            And then the cheese.

166
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,693
          Once the cheese melts,

167
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,428
    then we'll put it on the bun
                 like that.     

168
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,498
           Then we're gonna add 
  the garlic mayo to the cheese.

169
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:09,367
        Whoa!                   

170
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,969
     Watch this,                
ladies and gentlemen.           

171
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:11,903
This is a level of juice        

172
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,438
you probably haven't seen       
    on a burger.                

173
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,840
   Making it rain               
     up in here.

                [ Chuckles ]    

175

                   Where's      
              the umbrellas at? 

176

                [ Chuckles ]    

177
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,451
        Wow.                    

178
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,386
   That is juicy.               

179
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,621
It has tons of flavor.          

180
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,592
 That's ridiculous,             
 what you're doing.             

181
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:38,196
When it says, "butter burger,"  
take the dude's word for it.    

182
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,130
      Nice job.                 
                   Thanks.      

183
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,332
  Excellent burger.             
                 Thanks, Guy.   

184
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,804
Ends up being the juiciest thing
         you'd ever had.        

185
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,005
            Got a butter burger.

186
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,407
        Did they give you, like,
            a poncho or a parka 

187
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,476
         that you could just...?
   [ Laughs ]                   

188
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,146
           You're scratch-making
                 your food.     

189
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,748
    You take a tremendous amount
                  of pride.     

190
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,483
The only thing that you're gonna
         have a concern with is 

191
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,818
you're gonna need a [Whispering]
     little bit larger place -- 

192
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,853
                a little bit    
                   bigger.      

193
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,154
           You think?           
                        Yeah.   

194
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,890
          I don't know.         
     Small's kind of sweet.     
                      Oh, yeah? 

195
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:07,492
       FIERI: Coming up...      

196
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,626
      Let's get                 
 into this sandwich.            

197
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,761
         ...we're headed        

198
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,962
        to San Francisco,       
          California...         

199
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,931
                 Real-deal dogs.
     for the old hot dog...     

200
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,300
                         Whoa!  
        and chicken show.       

201
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:16,701
    It should say               
   "Show Chicken."              

202
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,779
 So, I'm here in the Tenderloin 
   district of San Francisco,   

203
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,981
       right on the corner      
   of Market and Golden Gate,   

204
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,984
 to check out a hot dog-joint --
   Not just any hot dog joint.  

205
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,185
             I mean,            
     this is San Francisco.     

206
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,653
  They love food in this town.  

207
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,923
       This place, they're      
   scratch-making the mustard,  

208
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,390
          the ketchup,          
      and the gourmet dogs.     

209
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,792
       This is Show Dogs.       

210
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,729
             Wild-boar sausage. 

211
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:47,232
I love hot dogs, so finding     
a place like this was awesome.  

212
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,801
      And the all-beef dog.     

213
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,870
       This is definitely       
    not your average hot dog.   

214
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,339
         Every dish has         
    a different twist to it.

       just a businessman.

   He's a flat-out food dude.   

217
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,949
My background as a chef is      
to make everything in-house.    

218
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:05,950
              It's the opposite

219
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,219
        So, he brought in       
       Chef Seth Carter...      

220
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,420

   full of scratch-made sodas,  
        sauces, and sides       

223
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,895
       to pair with their       
  gourmet dogs and sandwiches,  

224
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,631
   like this high-end clucker.

         Fried-chicken sandwich.
                  Order up.     

226

341
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,026
      We've got                 
our house-made mustard.

  our fig chutney.

And top it off with a little bit
  of wild arugula.

             and saves the day.

  and an open mind,

  the local workers are eating.
