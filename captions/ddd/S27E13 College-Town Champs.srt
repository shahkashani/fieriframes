00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:49,500
     Instant mashed potato.     
           -Of course.          

84
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,902
             It makes the dough 
           a little bit lighter.

85
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,637
              Like, think kind  
              of gnocchi dough. 

86
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,705
           Water, baking powder.

87
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,707
 Add a little salt.

      a pepperoni pizza pierogi.

91
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,380
 Now, then you just             
    took my idea.               

92
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,915
  That's fine, man!             

93
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,051
        And we're gonna stick it
  in the refrigerator for, like,

94
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,119
             at least 15 minutes
          just to let it set up.

95
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,121
   -Start making the filling.   
  -We got some boiled potatoes, 

96
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,923
                 then we got    
           some al dente lentil.

97
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:12,857
          Onion powder.         
             -Okay.             

98
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,858
         -Garlic powder.        
             -Right.            

99
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,193
               Berbere spice.   

100
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,661
   Losing my mind               
    a little bit.               

101
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,729
              I like to keep it

102
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,065
                Kosher salt.

103
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,733
 We're gonna mix it,            
  not over-mix it,              

104
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,068
'cause you want to have all     
your textures of your lentils.  

105
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,470
               Gonna let this

 the misir wot done.            

107
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,073
  The biggest thing             
that you gotta deal with        

108
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,207
     is rolling                 
   this dough out.              

109
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,142

These are the molds that we use.

110
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,278
So this is gonna make six.      
  I'm good at math.             

111
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,679
          We got the vegan dough
                 right here.    

112
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,481
             I'm gonna put that 
                in the flour.

 cheese, sour cream.            

338
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,346
             Any particular way 
           you like to eat this?

339
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,747
             -Fast.             
          -Okay, good.          

340
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,583
  What number am I running right
               now, one to 10?  

341
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,152
   You're usually               
     about a 10.                

342
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,955
     [ Laughs ]                 
    Running hot.                

343
00:10:56,957 --> 00:11:00,258
    The fat, it's like it almost
basted the meat while it cooked.

344
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,494
              Love the crunch.  

345
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,829
            I thought it was way
             too much dressing, 

346
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,698
              but you're right, 
     it makes that instant slaw.

347
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,366
         It's juicy, it's moist.

348
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,834
     Thank you.                 

349
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,237
        This tastes like someone
      went to make mac & cheese,

350
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,839
    and then, "Oh, we don't have
               any macaroni."   

351
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,574
      -Throw some potatoes.     
    -Throw potatoes in there.   

352
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:19,243
But it was raising your own hogs
              to make a patty,  

353
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,278
             it's kind of crazy.

354
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,181
       But I sure appreciate you
                being crazy.    

355
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,249
   Crazy on five?               

356
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:25,316
             Can I get a t-shirt
               that says that?  

357
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:27,118
                Ray Ray's --    
               crazy on five.   

358
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,586
    Five minutes                
 on the brat burger.            

359
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,321
                 Every town     
        that I visit "Triple D,"

360
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,323
       Jeff Ruby happens to open
             a restaurant there.

361
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,858
             He's getting ready 
   to open one here in Columbus,

362
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,460
       and I figure we would see
               what he thinks   

363
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,328
            about this pig patty
                  sandwich.     

364
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,663
The flavor, the texture,        
   it's not dry --              

365
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,933
   it's delicious.              
    It's perfect.               

366
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,601
             WOMAN:             
   The cabbage and the onions,  
     it just gives a really     

367
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,136
      nice crunch and bite.     

368
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,805
      So you come to Ohio,      
 you know that you're gonna get 

369
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,739
   your cousins from all over   
        Ohio showing up.        

370
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,608
     This is my Aunt Polly,     
    you know my mom and dad,    

371
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,478
        my cousin Tonya,        
     my cousin Heidi, Ellis,    

372
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,213
            it's Ian,           
      and of course, Carol.     

373
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,215
     The pig patty sandwich,    
           you try it?          

374
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,083
           -Fabulous.           
     -Real hamburger, yeah.     

375
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,885
      No, it wasn't burger,     
         that was pork.         

376
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,221
  -That's why I say, hamburger. 
          -Pork burger.         

377
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,022
      A ham -- ham burger.      
           Ba dum dum.          

378
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,157
     Sorry I didn't get it.     

379
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,826
All the food on Ray Ray's truck,

380
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,093
      it never disappoints.     

381
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,895
     Where does the name Ray Ray
                 come from?     

382
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,931
Ray is my middle name.          
Ray Ray is my nickname.         

383
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,165
It's a good barbecue name.      

384
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,566
               That is a great  
               barbecue name.   

385
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,302
        I didn't know what I was
       gonna get when I drove up

386
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,502
             and the dude's name
                was Ray Ray.    

387
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,904
                  I'm like,     
         this could go anywhere.

388
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,972
   Some people call him Jamie,  
   some people call him James,  

389
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,241
  some people call him Ray Ray. 

390
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,909
        Call it delicious       
         is what it is.         

391
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,312
   Got a full rack              
of St. Louis spare ribs.        

392
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:28,379
  Hot on the side.              

393
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,047
   You can't get a better rib   
            in Ohio.            

394
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,649
    MAN: They got the perfect   
         amount of bark.        

395
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,317
     It's got a little pull.    

396
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,453
    -What else you gonna do?    
   -St. Louis spare ribs here.  

397
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,321
      -Okay. Salt, pepper?      
            -Nothing.           

398
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,657
   These are going in the smoker
           with nothing on them?

399
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:40,859
  Nothing on them.              

400
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,259
            Am I getting punk'd?

401
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,795
You want to taste the pork      
or do you want to taste         

402
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,196
 cumin and cinnamon?            

403
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,464
           I mean, at least salt
                 and pepper.    

404
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:49,133
If I dry rub it now,            
then it's already salty.        

405
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,002
But if I put it on at the end,  
   I can go heavy,              

406
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,137
   then it's gonna              
   coat your lips.              
            Let's see it, buddy.

407
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,339
We're gonna put them            
in the smoker for about         

408
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:55,940
four and a half hours,          
        225.                    

409
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,275
         All right, where we at?

410
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,409
   We're gonna do               
 our house dry rub.             

411
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,745
                      Okay.     
    Salt, garlic,               
chili powder, sugar.            

412
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,815
        -And the paprika.       
      -That's the dry rub.      

413
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,483
        Next up, barbecue sauce.

414
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,718
             -Sugar.            
  -Some of the dry rug we made. 

415
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,355
Worcestershire sauce,           
apple cider vinegar,            

416
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:11,222
 and white vinegar.             

417
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,957
             A tub of molasses. 

418
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,827
      -Ketchup. Mix her up.     
             -Okay.             

419
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,161
   So we're gonna               
take these ribs off,            

420
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,362
   put them right               
   onto the grill.              

421
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:19,897
We're just cook that rub        
  on a little bit.              

422
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,365
  And I'm gonna try             
  to burn that fat.             

423
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,568
I like a little bit of black    
crunchy fat on the bottom.      

424
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,503
         There's something about
                 hard char.     

425
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,376
                  Nice fat.     

426
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,711
               Lots of juice,   
              dynamite dry rub. 

427
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,313
          For a guy that doesn't
               dry rib at all,  

428
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,847
               you go generous  
         with the dry rib after.
That's my whole point.          

429
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,783
That's why I don't put them     
on early, I want to...          

430
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,518
       That's you're all smooth,
                 I got you.     

431
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
                 Tasty, man.    

432
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:43,888
    Interest you                
   in some sauce?               

433
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,991
         I'll tell you what I do
            really like the most

434
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,860
                 is the char    
                on that skin.   

435
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:50,261
               That's a really  
               good rib, man.   

436
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,396
  Half a slab dry,              
  half a slab wet.              

437
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,332
       The ribs are great.      
   They're big, they're juicy.  

438
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,067
       And I'm a picky rib eater
            because I don't want

439
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,668
         to fight to get my meat
                off the bone.   

440
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,670
             -Right.            
     -Just comes right off.     

441
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,073
   I would probably half these  
     every day if I could.      
Jerk chicken.                   

442
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,474
  The best barbecue             
  on planet earth.              

443
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,542
        I don't think we've ever
       heard that on "Triple D."

444
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,811
               Best barbecue,   
                planet earth.
