00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,717
      DID YOU GET SOMETHING     
             TO EAT?            

201
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,786
      <i> AND HIS WIFE TERESA</i>      
 <i> BOUGHT THIS BAR 19 YEARS AGO,</i> 

202
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,321
     <i> THERE WAS NO QUESTION</i>     

203
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,657
   <i> WHAT THE MENU WOULD BE.</i>     
                       MEATBALL!

204
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,325
     EVERYTHING TASTES FRESH    
          AND HOMEMADE.         

205
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:43,394
                          PIZZA.
THE BEST PIE THAT I'VE HAD--    
   ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.        

206
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:44,863
       THE CRUST IS GREAT.      

207
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,198
       WHAT ARE WE MAKING FIRST?
PIZZA DOUGH.                    

208
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,000
FLOUR, ACTIVE DRY YEAST,        
         SALT...                

209
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,169
          SUGAR'S WHAT THE YEAST
                  NEEDS.        
RIGHT. BROWN SUGAR.             

210
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:53,338
             AND NOW WE'RE GONNA
                  MIX IT UP.    
ADD OUR WATER.                  

211
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,674
WE'LL LET THAT MIX FOR A MINUTE 
    BEFORE WE ADD THE OIL.      

212
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,275
WE USE A GARLIC-INFUSED OIL.    

213
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:00,011
I'LL ROAST MY GARLIC            
    IN THIS OIL.                
                      I LOVE IT.

214
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,213
           SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA 
          GO STRAIGHT FROM THIS.
GONNA BENCH IT,                 

215
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,015
  LET IT REST                   
FOR TEN MINUTES.                
                           OKAY.

216
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,152
     FOLD IT                    
A COUPLE OF TIMES.              
                  JUST TO GET   
              SOME OF THAT FLOUR

217
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,087
          SO IT'S NOT SO--RIGHT.
GET THAT AIR OUT OF IT.         

218
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,022
WE PORTION IT OUT               
TO 24 OUNCES EACH.              

219
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,891
           OKAY, SO WE ROLL THEM
              INTO THEMSELVES   

220
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,693
       AND SEAL OFF THE BOTTOMS.
THAT'S IT.                      

221
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,695
PUT IT INTO PROOFING BOXES      
      FOR THREE DAYS            

222
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,897
UNTIL WE'RE GONNA USE THEM.     
                      ALL RIGHT.

223
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,832
WE'RE GONNA MAKE

                GONNA COOK THIS?

226
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:26,705
THIS IS A NON-COOK SAUCE.       
                         REALLY?

230
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,913
NOW WE GRIND IT UP.             

231
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,715
             YOU SHOULD HAVE    
         SOME SAFETY GOGGLES ON!

232

   AND THE FRESH INGREDIENTS.

         HOW WE GONNA MAKE THAT?

242
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,809

              BRINE THE CHICKEN.

243
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,811

THIS IS SEMOLINA.

PEPPER FLAVOR...

00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,779
                        MM-HMM. 
AND THEN THE SWEETNESS          
    OF THE MANGO,

00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:43,781
  AND THAT'S GONNA              
GO ON FRIED CHICKEN.            
                            YEP.

393
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,251
       I CAN'T WAIT             
TO SEE THIS FRIED CHICKEN.      
                 WE'RE GONNA CUT
                  OUR CHICKEN.  

394
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,919
BONELESS, SKINLESS.             
                         MM-HMM.

395
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,454
AND NOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE        
  A MARINADE FOR THIS?          
              A MARINADE FOR IT.

396
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:51,989

            COARSE BLACK PEPPER,

397
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,525

          MIX IT TOGETHER.      

398
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,527
      SO THIS IS DONE.          
NOW WE GO MAKE THE WET BATTER   

399
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,529
AND THE DRY BATTER AND WE'LL    
    BE READY TO FRY 'EM.        

400
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,531

             BREADCRUMBS,       

401
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,600
 A LITTLE BIT MORE BLACK PEPPER,
         SEASONING SALT,        

402
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,335
       PAPRIKA, AND SOME WATER. 

403
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,403
OKAY.                           
    I'M GONNA WHISK IT TOGETHER.

404
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,539
OKAY. AND THE DRY?              
      IT'S THE SAME EXACT THING.

405
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,007
JUST WITHOUT THE WET.           
                            YES.

406
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,009
AND THEN WE'LL GET              
INTO BREADING IT.               
                 THAT'S CORRECT.

407
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:14,012
GOT IT.

           YEAH, WE PAN-FRY IT. 

413
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:26,224
      THAT IS SOME              
CRISPY CRUNCHY ON THERE.        

414
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,226
    HOW MANY DO YOU             
NORMALLY PUT ON A PLATE?        
                          THREE.

 AND WE'RE GONNA ADD SOME       
MANGO CHUTNEY SAUCE TO IT.      
              JUST RIGHT ON TOP.

   LOOK AT THOSE COLORS ON THAT.
       LOOK AT THAT CHICKEN.

419
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,903
 FIRST, I'M GONNA TELL YOU THAT 
    THE CRUNCH ON THIS THING    

420
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:41,172
           IS "CRUNCHINTACIOUS."
          (crunching)           

421

    TO FLAVOR TOWN PHONE COMPANY

422
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,176

         CRUNCH RING-BACK TONE, 

423

424
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,979
          (crunching)           
           THE CHICKEN'S TENDER,

425
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,248
   BUT IT'S GOT GREAT SEASONING 
          UNDERNEATH IT.        

426
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,050
               HUGE FLAVOR      
         WITH THE MANGO CHUTNEY,

427
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,252

        FROM THE SCOTCH BONNET. 

428

445

        <i> WITH SALTFISH...</i>

447
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,964

            SOME HOT, HOT WATER.

450
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:47,037
PULL OUT SOME OF THE SALT,      

451
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,507
AND HOW LONG WILL THIS SIT      
     HERE AND, UH...            
                ABOUT TWO HOURS.

452
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:52,043
SO HOW DO YOU KNOW              
 WHEN IT'S READY?               
             'CAUSE IT'S FALLING
                EASILY APART.   

453
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:55,112
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO  
NOW IS TAKE IT OUT OF THE WATER 

454
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,714
AND CRUMBLE IT?                 
                           YEAH.

   SO THIS IS ALL READY.        
NOW WE'RE GONNA COOK IT UP?     
                       YES, SIR.

456
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,185
SUNSHINE, I DON'T KNOW HOW      
    TO SAY THIS TO YOU,         

457
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,187
  BUT THE ACKEE                 
LOOKS LIKE EGG-EE.              
                       IT'S NOT.

458
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,123
                 THE FIRST THING
                  I'M GONNA DO  

459
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,125
             IS I'M GONNA HAVE  
           A NICE HOT SKILLET...
OKAY.                           

460
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,126
            AND I'M GONNA ADD   
         SOME COOKING OIL TO IT.

461
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,395
      ADD GARLIC. THIS IS THYME.
JAMAICAN THYME. WHOA!           

462
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,264
I WASN'T HIDING BEHIND HER.     

463
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,600
                  YES, YOU WERE.
I WAS JUST MAKING SURE I HAD    
   HER PERSPECTIVE ON IT.       

464
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,134
                 SHREDDED ONION.
ONION.                          

465
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,336
THYME IS JUST COMING OUT        
       BIG-TIME.                
                  GREEN PEPPERS,

466
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,539
           YELLOW BELL PEPPERS, 
               RED PEPPERS,     

467
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:23,941
              SOME GREEN ONIONS,
                STIR IT ALL IN. 

468
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,677
          WHAT I'M GONNA DO NOW 
          IS TO ADD MY CODFISH, 

469
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:29,147
        A LITTLE BLACK PEPPER,  
       PAPRIKA, AND THEN ACKEE. 

470
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,881
ACKEE, THE EGG FRUIT.           
                          ACKEE.

471
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,883
                           LOOK.
IT LOOKS INTERESTING.           

472
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:34,418
                   BON APPéTIT. 

473
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:37,088
              IT'S THE ATTACK-EE
                 OF THE ACKEE.  

474
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,689
                         MMM.   

475
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,224
  IT'S A VERY PLEASANT TEXTURE. 

476
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,960
         I MEAN, IT'S VERY SOFT 
               AND SILKY.       

477
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:44,896
       YOU GET THE TANGY, BRINY,
             AND SALTINESS      

478
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,830
             OF THE FISH--MMM-- 

479
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,499
                ALL THAT GREAT  
               VEGETABLE FLAVOR,

480
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:49,901
       SLAM IT WITH SOME THYME, 

481
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,170
                 I SEE HOW      
          IT ALL COMES TOGETHER.

482
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,172
      NOW WHAT I'M EXCITED TO DO
           IS GO TO JAMAICAN    

483
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,107
          AND TRY THEIR VERSION.
(laughs) OKAY.                  

484
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:58,109
                  I KNOW        
          SHE MAKES IT THE BEST.
ACKEE AND SALTFISH.             

485
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,377
       JUST TONS OF FLAVOR      
         GOING ON HERE.         

486
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,580
 IT'S SPICY, THE WAY I LIKE IT. 
         IT'S VERY NICE.        

487
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:05,183
          SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? 
         HOW DOES THIS STACK UP?

UH, COCONUT TIME.               

505
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:49,293
 FIRST OF ALL, WE'RE GONNA TAKE 
  THE WATER OUT OF THE COCONUT. 

506
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,362
SO NOW...                       
     I'M GONNA BREAK MY COCONUT,
            SO WHAT I DO,       

507
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,164
       I HOLD A TOWEL AROUND IT.
OKAY.                           

508
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,966
           IT'S EASIER, AND THEN
             I SMASH IT. SEE?   

509
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:59,236
              AND NOW MY COCONUT
                IS ALL SMASHED. 

510
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,239
SO HOW DO WE GET THE SKIN       
       OFF OF IT?               

511
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,507
   ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS A SHARP
      KNIFE AND GO LIKE THIS.   

512
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,376
ALL RIGHT.                      
   THIS IS AN EXCELLENT COCONUT,
            BY THE WAY.         

513
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,178
IT DOESN'T TASTE                
LIKE THE COCONUT                

514
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,180
 THAT COMES OUT                 
OF THE PACKAGE.                 
                IT TASTES FRESH.

515
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,782
OH, YEAH. TASTES JUST LIKE      
      SUNTAN LOTION.            
                        (laughs)

516
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,651
OKAY, SO WE CHOP ALL THIS UP.   
 THEN WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?     
            WE'RE GONNA BOIL IT.

517
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:18,055
        SO THE FIRST THING WE DO
         IS TO TAKE SOME WATER. 
OKAY.                           

518
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,324
   HERE'S A SKILLET. WE'RE GONNA
      ADD SOME CUBED COCONUT.   

519
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:23,194
        AND THEN WE'RE GONNA ADD
            SOME BROWN SUGAR.   
WHOA! A LOT.                    

520
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,262
              AND THEN WE HAVE  
             SOME CUBED GINGER, 

521
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,231
          AND I'M GONNA JUST    
       STIR EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

522
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:30,067
SO YOU JUST LET THIS SIT HERE   
AND CARAMELIZE AND REDUCE...    
                         UH-HUH.

523
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:32,936
UNTIL IT JUST KIND OF MAKES IT  
     LIKE A STICKY PASTE?       
                   THAT'S RIGHT.

524
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,805
                 SO I THINK     
             IT'S READY TO DROP.

525
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,541
      DROP THEM ON A SHEET PAN. 

526
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,743
IT'S LIKE JAMAICAN              
  PEANUT BRITTLE,               

527
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:41,412
EXCEPT IT HAS COCONUT           
  AND GINGER, YEAH.             
                  I LOVE GINGER.

528
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,214
SO THAT'S ALL GONNA STICK       
        TOGETHER?               
                            YES.

529
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,882
AND LET THEM COOL.              
      IT TAKES ABOUT 15 MINUTES.

530
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,019
AND YOU TAKE IT OFF             
    AND EAT IT.                 
              HOW DO YOU EAT IT?

531
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:52,022
        JUST BITE INTO IT       
  OR YOU CAN BREAK A PIECE OFF. 

532
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:55,025
     THAT'S NUTS. COCONUT GINGER
