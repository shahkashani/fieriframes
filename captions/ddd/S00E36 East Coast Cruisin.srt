1
00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:02,301
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:02,303 --> 00:00:03,769
I'm Guy Fieri,
  and we're rolling out

3
00:00:03,771 --> 00:00:06,638
looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,473
This trip...

5
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:08,741
All aboard.

6
00:00:08,743 --> 00:00:11,310
We're putting it in gear
 and hitting the highway...

7
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:12,845
- I can feel the magic.
  -It's so exciting.

8
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:15,848
...heading back East
 for a culinary road trip.

9
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,316
16 tickets
    to Flavortown.

10
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:18,751
In New York City...

11
00:00:18,753 --> 00:00:19,885
You got to check this out.

12
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:22,388
...Neapolitan pizza
 straight out of Italy...

13
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,089
That's a different level, baby.

14
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:27,793
...and legit barbecue
 in the middle of the Bronx?

15
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,728
In the world of dives,
     my friend,

16
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,130
this is Culinary Dive 101.

17
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:33,665
Then, an all-American diner
   in Philly...

18
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:34,833
You're teasing me.

19
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,002
...and real-deal Italian
   in Baltimore.

20
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,271
If I was taught
how to make those at home,

21
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:40,739
I never would've left home.

22
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,041
Plus, in Rhode Island...

23
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:43,208
We're watching.

24
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,245
...a family joint dishing it out
   for decades...

25
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:47,346
Off the hook.

26
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:50,049
...and a burger joint
   gone bananas.

27
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,684
And bananas is good.

28
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:53,986
That's really nice.

29
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:55,587
So buckle up and dig in...

30
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,790
I could have
6 to 12 pounds of that.

31
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:01,060
...'cause this is gonna be
 a righteous feast in the East.

32
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:03,295
I can't get it in my mouth
   fast enough.

33
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,330
That's all right here,
   right now,

34
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:07,699
on "Diners, Drive-ins,
   and Dives."

35
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,516
So, I'm here in New York City
   on 50th Street,

36
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,285
right between
  8th and 9th Avenue.

37
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:27,486
I mean, this place is busy.

38
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:30,089
I'm here to check out
 a real-deal pizza joint.

39
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:32,524
Now, when I say "real-deal,"
 I'm talking from Naples.

40
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:34,293
I'm talking the owner
  of this place --

41
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:35,527
I mean, he's the president

42
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:37,563
of the Association
 of Neapolitan Pizza Makers!

43
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:39,865
This...
Fieri, you're late.

44
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,767
...is Iron Chef
  Geoffrey Zakarian,

45
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,669
and this is Don Antonio.

46
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:49,741
I've never had pizza like this
  ever in my entire life.

47
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:53,579
This pizza is as authentic
   as it comes.

48
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:54,880
Margherita's ready.

49
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,415
I came from Italy.

50
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:58,550
I can say that this
 is one of the best pizza

51
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,185
that I eat in my life.

52
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:03,422
So, when New Yorkers and
 Italians swear it's the best,

53
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:06,892
you know renowned pizza master
  Roberto Caporuscio

54
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:09,228
is doing it right.

55
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,563
Kind of helps that he was born
 and raised on a dairy farm

56
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,999
in the heart
 of Italy's pizza country,

57
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,034
right between
  Rome and Naples.

58
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,369
I was cheese maker
  before.

59
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,037
You were
   a cheese maker?
 Yes.

60
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,607
In 2012, he partnered up
  with his mentor,

61
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,775
<i> his</i> don, Antonio Starita,

62
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:27,679
to school Americans
 on true Neapolitan pizza.

63
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:31,917
Chef Roberto, Iron Chef
 Geoffrey Zakarian, okay?

64
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,419
You guys know
   each other?
Yeah, he was,
before, here.

65
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,721
Yeah, he's been
   here before.

66
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:37,723
Break it down for me
  from the beginning --

67
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:40,859
What makes
  true Neapolitan pizza?

68
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:43,295
The most important start
 for the dough.

69
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,164
Hit it.
Okay, water.

70
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,366
This is
     so exciting.
   I can feel
   the magic.

71
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:49,434
So exciting.
  Keep notes on this,
   by the way.

72
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,203
I am.
  Salt.

73
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:52,804
And we start
 with a flour,

74
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:58,277
So, you're just gonna add the
 flour to the water and the salt

75
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:01,313
in your own vision
  and touch-by-feel?

76
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:04,049
Yes.
  You don't have to worry
 about ripping this recipe off.

77
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:08,754
This is fresh yeast.
    Okay,
  this is fresh yeast.

78
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,724
Okay, so, really, you're just
 looking at this...

79
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,594
When we started over 20 years
ago, there was no machine.

80
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:18,130
Just put that
     anywhere.

81
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,765
You're gonna clean that.

82
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,704
After that, we need to
let it rest for one hour.

83
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,673
Then we start making
 the dough balls.

84
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,778
So, you're
   tucking it in.
     Look at that.

85
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,112
Looks so easy.

86
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:36,014
Pinching it off.
    Wow.

87
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,716
Can you do it both hands?

88
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,318
I used to be able
  to do both hands.

89
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,386
That's nice.

90
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:49,328
We let it rise
 for at least --

91
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,763
between 24 and 36 hours
 before using.

92
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:55,534
What is the next key step
in making true Neapolitan pizza?

93
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:56,368
The stretching part.

94
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,569
The stretching part?
  Yes.

95
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,137
The method in
  which you stretch it?
 Yes.

96
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,372
Table?

97
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:02,241
Table, very, very --
 no, no, no, no.
   No throw?

98
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:04,810
Very delicate
because it's very soft.
    Okay.

99
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:07,145
Don Antonio tell you,
you touch your dough

100
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,547
like how you
 touch your wife.

101
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,349
If you touch
very tough...

102
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:12,384
Hang on a second.

103
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:15,387
I'm gonna make a note
  of that one. Okay.

104
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:22,327
That gentle?
  Yes.

105
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,863
It's always
   the same size, Robert?
  Yes,
all the same size.

106
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,898
'Cause I just went

107
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,300
It's done.

108
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:30,969
And the last component, the most
 key, important piece is...?

109
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,237
The oven.

110
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,009
It comes from Naples,
a wood-fire oven -- That's all.

111
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:38,677
It's volcanic stone.

112
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:42,147
Its mouth is very small.
This dome is very low.

113
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,483
Cook the pizza
in one minute and a half.

114
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:45,951
And it's a good thing
  it only takes a minute

115
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,553
because Don Antonio's
  has -- Count 'em! --

116
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:52,691
60 pizzas on the menu,
 including the Pizza del Papa

117
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:54,092
with butternut squash
   and zucchini,

118
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:57,296
custom made
  for Pope John Paul II.

119
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:01,800
And then there's this savory pie
 that's literally going nuts.

120
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,636
This, right here, is amazing.
 This is pistachio and sausage.

121
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:08,006
So, these are pistachio we
 make here in-house.

122
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:11,810
Pistachio with
Parmigiano-Reggiano and oil.

123
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,250
It's like a pesto
    without garlic.
  Yes.

124
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,853
Oh, man,
    that looks good.

125
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:25,524
The sausage, we cook here
 with Chianti wine.

126
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,260
Fresh basil...

127
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:31,029
and extra virgin oil,
 of course, on top.

128
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:34,333
And fresh mozzarella.
And it go inside the oven.

129
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:37,269
Whoa!

130
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,403
That was scary.

131
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,405
You almost took that one
  to the teeth, homey.

132
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,341
He's already ready
     to turn it.

133
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,343
Yeah,
 I check the bottom.

134
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:46,178
It's almost done.
 I need to just...

135
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,346
That is so fast.

136
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,948
A little brûlée
    on top.
 Done.

137
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:56,888
Please.

138
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,624
Go ahead, 'cause it's gonna be
 9,000 degrees, Geoffrey.

139
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,060
Yeah, go ahead
 and burn your mouth right off.
     I don't care.

140
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,065
The fresh mozzarella.

141
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:10,969
And the dough.
  Look at how thin
   that is.

142
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,672
My favorite part
  of wood-fired pizza

143
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,742
is the little char
 that you get on the bottom.

144
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:19,578
It really just adds
  such depth of flavor.

145
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,747
That action going on
 with this dough is outstanding.

146
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:22,581
What do you think?

147
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,982
It's light.

148
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,351
I mean, it's just -- You can eat
 a whole pizza and feel great.

149
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:27,686
Yeah.
       Yeah.

150
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,922
Life-changing pizza.

151
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,759
Fluffy, but it's still crisp.
 It's got great texture to it.

152
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:35,193
It's great.

153
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,828
Great wasn't good enough
  for these dudes,

154
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,898
so they took that crust
  to the next level.

155
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,467
All right, guys.
Montanara Starita.
Thank you.

156
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:45,504
It's a fried pizza,
  which is amazing.

157
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,173
Let's see it.

158
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,976
He's giving it the claw.

159
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:55,580
We make a hole because
then it will be -- puff up.

160
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,651
How long are we gonna be
   in the fryer?
      35 seconds.

161
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,386
What temperature?
  We at 350 on that?

162
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,321
400.
    400.

163
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:06,491
These are
 the sauces now.

164
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:11,029
This, we cook with little bit
of extra virgin oil and garlic.

165
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,165
San Marzano tomatoes?
San Marzano.

166
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:15,200
The plum tomatoes?
Yes, the plum tomatoes.

167
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:17,436
Little basil, Parmesan.

168
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,438
Smoke mozzarella
 comes from Italy.

169
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,006
Here.
  Go ahead. I got it.
  I got it. I got it.

170
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,607
Whoa!

171
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,511
Wow!
     That is smoke.

172
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,814
Smoke and salt.
       Mmm.

173
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,182
Mmm!

174
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,850
And now...
   That's it?

175
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:33,652
...inside the oven.

176
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:35,754
How long?
  For another 30 seconds.

177
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:37,255
Be careful with that thing.
   He's gonna kill you.

178
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,890
Oh, God.

179
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,204
Please.
    Okay.

180
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,346
I just want to smear this
   all over me.

181
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,283
I can't get it
 in my mouth fast enough.

182
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,585
And no grease.
   Unh-unh.

183
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,119
Zero grease.

184
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,622
That's
 a different level, baby.

185
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,025
Who's got
  the extra two pieces?

186
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,196
The smoked flavor,
    the crust --

187
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,598
I mean, you do not
    leave this crust.

188
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,033
I'm gonna finish
    all of this up.

189
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,771
This experience
  is overwhelming.

190
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,306
I mean, this has been
   outstanding.

191
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:29,207
Thank you very much.

192
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,609
Chef.
Thank you
very much.

193
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,344
Don't leave me hanging.
   Nice job.

194
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,545
You got to check this out,

195
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:35,714
and while you're in town,
 stop by Geoffrey's place!

196
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,215
He's always available.

197
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,418
Did you
 just throw that? Rock on.

198
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:44,489
Up next...

199
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,024
- Bada-bing?
    -Yeah.

200
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,059
On a street corner
   in the Bronx...

201
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,060
Low and slow, baby.

202
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,462
...true-blue barbecue...

203
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:53,031
That would challenge any good
  Texas brisket right there.

204
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:57,035
...in one of the most unlikely
 places ever on "Triple D."

205
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,203
It's a funky joint.

206
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,305
Great barbecue
    out of a auto shop.

207
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,343
On "Diners, Drive-ins,
   and Dives,"

208
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,078
we'll go anywhere in any weather

209
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,881
to find you the joints
 that you want to know about,

210
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,449
like this place, MoGridder's,

211
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:14,085
stuck in the parking lot
  of an auto repair show

212
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,387
in the Bronx, New York.

213
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,188
Gloria!

214
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,657
Inside a 35-foot trailer,

215
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,692
they're serving up
  some barbecue so good

216
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:23,028
you'll think you're in Texas
  or maybe Memphis...

217
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,529
Here's some
    pig candy, baby.

218
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:25,463
...not...

219
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,465
The Bronx.

220
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,000
And check out
  the Bronx brisket.

221
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:31,069
The brisket, it just falls apart
   in your mouth.

222
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:35,874
Ribs, pulled pork, and chicken
 slow-cooked in a massive smoker

223
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,275
and pulling in the crowds.

224
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,010
Barbecue's the best
  over here.

225
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:42,280
In even the lousiest weather,
  it's just that good.

226
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,682
Two racks of ribs.

227
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:44,583
Two racks?

228
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:45,517
Two racks.

229
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,218
Two separate containers.

230
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,853
Pulled up at the light
  and looked to my right

231
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,255
and saw the truck and said,
    "What?"

232
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,525
Had my first order of ribs,
 and I've been hooked since.

233
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:55,026
It's only in the Bronx

234
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,896
where you can watch your truck
  get a front windshield

235
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,065
and get some mean barbecue ribs
   out here.

236
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,866
Getting a tune-up
    and some ribs.

237
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,502
And you can order that
 on the menu?
     On the menu.

238
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:09,474
Today's special is ribs, oil,
and a filter special for $34.95.

239
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,878
Anything I should try?

240
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,614
We're doing a three-meat combo
   to go home.

241
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,349
Oh, no. I said,
  anything else I should try

242
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:18,516
when I bring
    my car here?

243
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:19,951
Oh, when you bring
   your car here?

244
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,786
Get a windshield.
 I've done that many times.

245
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,222
Do you have any background
  in the restaurant business?

246
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,256
Nah.

247
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,591
The guy behind all of this

248
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,493
is auto shop owner
   Fred Donnelly.
What's next?

249
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:31,096
A few years back, he took up
  barbecuing as a hobby.

250
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:32,430
Grab my ribs.

251
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,666
He started bringing in
 samples for the customers

252
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,635
and ended up
 with a trailer out front

253
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,337
and a dining room where
 he used to have service bays.

254
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,405
MoGridder's.

255
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:43,274
MoGridder's
was a childhood nickname

256
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,243
my cousin used to call me.

257
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,044
What is a MoGridder?

258
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:46,945
We don't know.

259
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,079
How did he come up
     with it?

260
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,581
- You could be a MoGridder.
  -I'm a MoGridder.

261
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,615
You could be a MoGridder.

262
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:51,916
Hey, MoGridder,
 what's happenin'?

263
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,151
Ribs are happenin'.

264
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,021
In the East Coast, I don't
  hear so much about ribs.

265
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:58,423
In the South,
  I hear all about St. Louis

266
00:10:58,425 --> 00:10:59,791
or spare ribs.

267
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,427
And then on the West Coast,
  it's all about baby backs.

268
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,596
Why'd you pick up
    on the St. Louis?

269
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:07,632
I think it has a little more
meat than the baby back.

270
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,068
You think?
 I think it has tons more meat.

271
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,570
Okay, we rub 'em down
 in a dry rub,

272
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,105
MoGridder's seasoning.

273
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,841
It's got salt, pepper,
  garlic, paprika,

274
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,711
and a few things
 he's keeping to himself.

275
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,646
He dry-rubs the brisket, too.

276
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,348
We're gonna use garlic
  first.

277
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,450
Then we're gonna put
 some black pepper.

278
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:27,485
Do you not notice that
 a windshield just went through?

279
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:28,620
No.

280
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:31,289
We do about 40 to 50 windshields
  here a day.

281
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,626
So a windshield coming through
  here in the middle of lunch

282
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,361
is not really
    that big of a deal.

283
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,263
It's not a problem.
 You won't taste it.

284
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,398
All right.
  So these are rubbed down.

285
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,933
Gonna have
    a nice bark.

286
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,402
These'll go on 225 degrees,
    about 10 hours.

287
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,704
- Bada-bing?
    -Yeah.

288
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,539
Never get tired
    of that smell.

289
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,840
Nope. That's beautiful.

290
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,375
Okay.

291
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,242
Whoa.

292
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:54,412
Are you there? Fred?
     Auntie Em?

293
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:57,615
Here you go, Guy.
There's some brisket.

294
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,684
Look at that.
     Oh, boy.

295
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,152
Always load
 the bottom first.

296
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,221
Otherwise, it'll tip,
and we'll have a mess.

297
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,189
Okay.

298
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:05,423
But we don't want 'em
     touching

299
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,325
because we got to let smoke
    go up between 'em.

300
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,027
And put that one
 on the other side.

301
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,261
That one on the other side.

302
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,096
Pork butts?

303
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,163
Yeah. Here you go.

304
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,665
Okay. Pork butt.
     Fat up?

305
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:14,799
Fat up.

306
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,735
We've got our brisket on.
We've got our pork on.

307
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,837
We've got our ribs on.
Let's throw some chicken on.

308
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,138
All in together,

309
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,807
but each item will smoke
 for a different length of time.

310
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,677
Now, where are you getting
    your wood from?

311
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,878
Don't say trees.

312
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,447
We get it
from the suburbs of Jersey.

313
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,649
They have
a lot of cherrywood.

314
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:34,285
They had a lot of apple orchards
  out there.

315
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,354
I tell you, my team,
     Motley Que,

316
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,256
I think they're gonna think
    I'm a traitor.

317
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,991
I'm out here barbecuing
    with this cat

318
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,126
on a corner in the Bronx.

319
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:42,460
This is odd.

320
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,532
Oh.
    Now, the test.

321
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:51,102
Shouldn't come off the bone.
People say, "Fall off the bone."

322
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,037
Well, it falls off
     in a spot.

323
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:58,143
You should be able to tell
  where you just took a bite.

324
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,111
Nice bark,
    nice crust up top.

325
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,748
Low and slow, baby.

326
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,451
That's great.

327
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:07,585
What do we pull next?

328
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:08,953
We'll pull the brisket off.

329
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,021
Check those out.

330
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,756
Man, that's great-looking bark
  on there.

331
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,424
Look at that,
 all nice and black.

332
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,093
That's not burned.
 That's flavor.

333
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,594
If you cut it
 with the grain,

334
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:17,862
then it's gonna be stringy
     and chewy.

335
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,164
So you got to cut it
    against the grain.

336
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,231
Right.

337
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:23,101
Oh. Look at that smoke ring
     on that.

338
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:28,039
Nice and tender,
  and the rub, the dry rub...

339
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,440
That would, uh...

340
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,342
That would challenge any good
  Texas brisket right there.

341
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:32,877
- That's good stuff.
   -Thank you.

342
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,179
So's the pork butt...

343
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:35,380
It just slips right out.

344
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:37,649
...which makes a mean
  pulled pork sandwich,

345
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:38,983
and the chicken,

346
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,386
rubbed with salt, pepper,
 and olive oil before smoking.

347
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,388
It comes
 with a barbecue sauce glaze,

348
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,455
same with the ribs,

349
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,324
but they're killer
  all by themselves.

350
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:51,696
You can get that
    on the corner of...

351
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,431
Hunts Point and Randall.

352
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:56,167
Hunts Point and Randall
    in the Bronx.

353
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,670
Which makes it
 one popular intersection.

354
00:13:58,672 --> 00:13:59,904
What are you gettin', Joey?

355
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:01,172
What are we havin'?

356
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,307
Two rib platters.

357
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,008
Two rib platters?

358
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,244
We do between
150 and 200 lunches.

359
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,246
This place rules.
Everything is good here.

360
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,615
The pulled pork, the ribs,
everything is delicious.

361
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:13,218
The sodas are
in the cooler on the side.

362
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,154
Don't go taking any more
like this guy Gene did.

363
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,555
- Okay.

364
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:18,723
Can you eat all that?

365
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,458
You gonna be able to finish
   all the ribs?

366
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,393
And I think I could eat
    a little bit more.

367
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,195
- Oh, you think you could?
  -It's that good.

368
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,230
- Really?
    -Yeah.

369
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:28,032
No commercial background
    in doing this,

370
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,767
no restaurant experience.

371
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:32,570
You're knocking it out, man.
     Good stuff.

372
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:33,504
Thank you.

373
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,673
I mean,
    it's a funky joint.

374
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:39,577
I mean, we're eating great
 barbecue out of an auto shop

375
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:42,547
and cooking it all
   out of a monster rig.

376
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,650
I mean, in the world of dives,
     my friend,

377
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,552
this is Culinary Dive 101.

378
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,720
Ultimate dive.

379
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,121
Coming up...

380
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:50,989
Look at that.

381
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,857
We're filling up
   in Philly...

382
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,559
Who's the cook,
     King Kong?

383
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,561
...at a spot
  rocking the retro...

384
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:57,896
That's funkadelic, man.

385
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:01,199
...with a menu filled
 with classic diner favorites.

386
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,034
Get it away from me
or I'm gonna eat it all.

387
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,506
In a world of 24/7,
 when the sun's coming up,

388
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,541
well, that means
  the end of a late night

389
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,477
or the beginning
  of an early morning.

390
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,512
Either way,
 you're gonna need some grub.

391
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:17,081
And the folks here at
 The Dining Car in Philadelphia,

392
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,416
well, they got you covered.

393
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,919
Turkey --
    whole wheat, mayo.

394
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:21,953
Thank you.

395
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,054
- Veil Parmesan?
   -Mm-hmm.

396
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,455
I often have this
    in the morning.

397
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,758
Creamed chipped beef.
   It's good.

398
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,960
- You're gonna like everything.
  -That's delicious.

399
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,762
Let me show you this
 all-world chicken Caesar.

400
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,730
- Come on with me.
 -First thing I think of is,

401
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,332
"What am I gonna get
   at the diner?"

402
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,566
That's a tough call

403
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,635
'cause at this joint,
  they've got it all...

404
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:40,104
They're always delicious.
 They're always different.

405
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,339
...at any hour...

406
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,807
- Here you go.
   -Thank you.

407
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,742
...with local favorites
 like chicken croquette...

408
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,010
It's very good.

409
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:49,580
...and pot roast, Reubens,
  cinnamon French toast,

410
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,316
even homemade bagels...

411
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:52,850
We have a night out,

412
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,720
and we always stop here
   for breakfast.

413
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:56,688
Wow.

414
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,723
You girls roll hard
     in Philly.

415
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:01,025
Oh, this is what time I normally
  roll in for breakfast.

416
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,327
We had a long night
     last night.

417
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:03,494
- Did you?
   -We did.

418
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,264
If a customer wants to eat,
   day or night,

419
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,166
he knows he can come
  to The Dining Car.

420
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,802
Joe Morozin's been running
  restaurants for years.

421
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,070
There you are, ladies.

422
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,572
He bought the original
  Dining Car in 1961

423
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,107
and almost 20 years later,

424
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,843
replaced it with a bigger one
  right next door,

425
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:22,046
now run by his three kids,
 including daughter Nancy.

426
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:25,483
A lot of the customers came in,
like, 6:00 in the morning

427
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,551
'cause they wanted to be

428
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:27,885
the last one to eat
 in the old diner

429
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,687
and then the first one to eat
 in the new diner.

430
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,255
So, have you
    been here before?

431
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:32,924
Oh, my God.
  We come every Sunday.

432
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:33,725
Every Sunday?

433
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:34,926
Yeah.
 We made it today.

434
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:36,427
- Today's not Sunday.
   -I know.

435
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:37,261
Two times.

436
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,129
Two times.

437
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:38,963
Every day?

438
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,498
Every day on weekdays.

439
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,632
Five days a week?

440
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:42,567
Five days.

441
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,102
Now, how long have you
  been here?

442
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:45,203
32 years.

443
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,572
Long enough for Chef Larry Thum

444
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:50,808
to know exactly what folks
 around here are looking for,

445
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,710
like this classic from the '40s.

446
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:53,711
- What is that?
   -Chipped beef.

447
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:54,779
- Is it chipped beef?
    -Yes.

448
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:56,981
My dad talked about it
 when I was a kid,

449
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,816
about having it
 in the military,

450
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,051
having it in the Navy,

451
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:01,753
but this is gonna be
  a first.

452
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:02,920
What are we gonna do?

453
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,889
We're gonna put in some oil,

454
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,725
and then we're gonna put in
  the flour, in the hot oil.

455
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,093
This is like a hot paste.

456
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,029
We're gonna pour the hot milk
    into the roux,

457
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,097
and that usually thickens it
    almost immediately.

458
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,365
All right.
 So that's done.

459
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,734
So, what was this?
This was the eye of the round?

460
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,302
That was actually
    a top round.

461
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,004
Okay.
So now we thin-slice this.

462
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,906
That's got a little kick.

463
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,108
I cut it in squares,
 little cubes.

464
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,510
Now, remember,
we're gonna frizzle it up.

465
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,311
You're gonna what it
     it up?
We're gonna frizzle it.

466
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,247
- Is that a cooking term?
    -Yeah.

467
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,982
- Frizzling?
   -Frizzled beef.

468
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:33,251
So this is just gonna put
a little crisp on it?

469
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:34,252
Yep.

470
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:35,620
Now, we're frizzlin'.

471
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:36,687
Chef McFrizzle.

472
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,322
And people
 order this a lot?

473
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:39,524
70, 80 gallons a week.

474
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:41,292
You make 20 of those
  in a week?

475
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:44,228
Sometimes, toward the weekend,
  we'll make a bigger batch.

476
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,597
You have that smooth blandness
    of the sauce,

477
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,200
and then you have the meat
   that gives it the kick.

478
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:52,236
You know, the old standby
   is always white toast.

479
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,939
Look at that.

480
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,140
Mm.

481
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,775
Oh, the toast makes it.

482
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,977
I used to hear people
complain about that.

483
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,979
It's gotten a bad rap,
 but not when it's made right.

484
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,114
Not when it's made here.

485
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:06,050
Get it away from me
or I'm gonna eat it all.

486
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:06,884
All right.

487
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:07,985
Mm. Delicious.

488
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:10,555
Around here,
  it's still a favorite.

489
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:12,423
And so's this local flavor.

490
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,724
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
 What's that?

491
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:14,826
That is scrapple.

492
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:15,993
Is it meat?

493
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,261
It's meat.

494
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,832
Actually, it's deep-fried
 pork scraps in cornmeal.

495
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,634
The locals love
 to talk you into trying it.

496
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,104
You're gonna be surprised.

497
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:31,075
I was born and raised
     on it.

498
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,311
That's funkadelic, man.

499
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,179
Today is your birthday?

500
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,314
Yes.

501
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:39,083
How about a piece
   of scrapple a la mode?

502
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:40,585
And it isn't just the scrapple.

503
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:43,621
At this joint, they're totally
on top of all the local flavors.

504
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,190
It's exactly what I used to have
  when I was little.

505
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,493
Chicken croquettes,
 we call 'em in Philadelphia.

506
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,627
Croquettes?

507
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,362
It's a very old
   traditional diner item.

508
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:52,563
People years ago,

509
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,866
they would take their scraps
    from their chicken,

510
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:56,834
roll it up, bread it,
    and fry it up

511
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,669
and get an extra meal
     out of it.

512
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,906
So it's making, like, a little
chicken-and-dough dumpling.

513
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,374
We just use cracker meal.

514
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:06,077
We use a milk egg wash,
   and we use breadcrumbs.

515
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:08,312
So, now, what do we do?
 Go fry these?

516
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,447
Gonna fry 'em up.

517
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:12,049
These go down, but they
got to be made in cones.

518
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,585
The traditional diner one
 that's around here

519
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:16,087
is usually made in a cone.

520
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,523
You place 'em
on a bed of mashed potatoes.

521
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:21,025
Milk, chicken stock,
    and parsley.
Right.

522
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,460
Hot, I bet.

523
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:25,396
It looks like
  a volcano.

524
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,365
Bro, that is rich and big.

525
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,833
The sauce
 brings it home.

526
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,668
- It's a filling Philly meal.
    -Yes.

527
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,104
It's, you know,
 one of those comfort foods.

528
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,739
Who's the cook,
     King Kong?

529
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,707
But comfort food
   at this joint

530
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,176
is more than just the basics.

531
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,177
Crepes Florentine.

532
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,078
It's one of their
  specialties here.

533
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,782
This is one of the first menus
that we've ever come across

534
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,350
that we've seen crepes,

535
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,052
or crepes.

536
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:49,820
How do you say it?

537
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,489
Crepes,
  but we don't make crepes.

538
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,524
We make crepes in Philadelphia.

539
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,593
What do people think?
I mean, you're in a diner.

540
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,028
It started off slow,

541
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,829
but then it started to catch on
   a little bit at a time.

542
00:19:58,831 --> 00:19:59,897
Let's get our crepe on.

543
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:03,100
So six eggs
and six extra yolks.

544
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,001
Right.

545
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,803
- Some milk.
  -3 cups of flour.

546
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,038
Exactly 3 cups of flour.

547
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,706
Exactly 3 cups.
 See that eagle eye?

548
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,907
Good eye, good eye.

549
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,109
So on the crepes,
this is called Supreme Sauce?

550
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,277
That's correct.

551
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,246
Okay, so chicken stock
going into some blond roux.

552
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:18,649
So that's gonna tighten up
and make, like, a chicken gravy.
     That's right.

553
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,484
Sauté up
  a little bit of mushrooms.

554
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,520
Now, this is not
traditional diner fare.

555
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:24,889
One of philosophies
 is that when people come in,

556
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,724
we have a little bit
    for everybody.

557
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,125
Cold crepe batter,
  hot pans.

558
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:28,993
Clarified butter.

559
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,294
Little bit
of clarified butter.

560
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,529
Clarified butter.

561
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:32,863
I'd rather have
 a little extra butter in 'em,

562
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:35,032
and you're gonna put in
two ladles full of crepe batter.

563
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,434
With that much butter,

564
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,803
I'm a little gnarly
 about flippin'.

565
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,104
I mean, I didn't...

566
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:42,506
You bring it up and over.

567
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:43,641
Yeah, no.

568
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,977
Okay.
    Want an apron?

569
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,478
- Ready?
   -Looking good.

570
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,479
Wonderful!

571
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,381
Almost a nice-looking
    omelet there.

572
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:53,584
This is crazy crepe.

573
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,119
It's crazy crepe!

574
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,721
Now what?
  Sliced ham.

575
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:59,056
This ham,
what does this taste like?

576
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:01,225
Try a piece.
    It's baked, smoked.

577
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:02,660
- Mm.
  -Virginia baked ham.

578
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,595
I could have
6 to 12 pounds of that.

579
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,131
Natural, pure cheddar cheese.
   Fresh-cooked spinach.

580
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,933
And we're just gonna
    roll 'em up.

581
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,801
This is how
 we roll sushi, too.

582
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,603
But then we'll just give 'em
   a little bit of that --

583
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,005
You're just teasing me
  with that.

584
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:14,839
That's all.

585
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:16,107
Mm.

586
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,409
That's really nice.

587
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:22,046
The kicker
is that Supreme Sauce.

588
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,347
Mmm.

589
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:26,150
We try to take crepes and make
  comfort food out of 'em.

590
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,652
Welcome
 to comfort crepe.

591
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,153
Welcome
    to comfort crepe.

592
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,856
And the real comfort
  for folks around here

593
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:34,725
is knowing they can count on
  this joint 24/7.

594
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:36,527
Oh, the food's always been good,

595
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,496
and you can always
  count on it being good.

596
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,331
This diner here
is gonna take care of you.

597
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,533
And they know me,
  and it makes it nice.

598
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,568
You know,
 you feel comfortable here.

599
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,936
Oh, I'm here all the time.

600
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,705
Get whatever you want
   whenever you need it.
Right.

601
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:49,407
- Hanging in there.
   -Yeah, not bad.

602
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:50,508
No. Not bad.

603
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,709
So, what are you gonna do now,
    go to sleep?

604
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:53,010
Oh, my god. Yes.

605
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:56,514
Up next on this full hour
 of East Coast cruising...

606
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:57,715
A little...

607
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:59,417
In Narragansett, Rhode Island...

608
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:01,152
You know what
 you're doin', man.

609
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,287
...a place so crazy
  about their burgers...

610
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,989
Whee!

611
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,691
...they just keep
  the combos comin'.

612
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,893
That could be served on, like,
a grilled flip-flop.

613
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,266
Every other year,
  the family and I vaca

614
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:17,768
here in Rhode Island, down at
 the beaches with the in-laws.

615
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,470
Now, about 5 years ago,
  we rented a house

616
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:21,839
here in Narragansett
 about two blocks that way.

617
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,709
Now, I must have passed by
 this place a half a dozen times

618
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:26,477
early in the morning,
   and finally,

619
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,012
I'm gonna do
 what I tell you guys to do --

620
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,081
That's slow down
  and take a look around.

621
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,083
It's time I check out
   Crazy Burger.

622
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:33,050
Fire Burger.

623
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,452
The Homemade Burger -- Awesome.

624
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:35,586
Moo-moo medium.

625
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:37,288
A new sensation
  for your taste buds.

626
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,589
Chicken Marsala Burger.

627
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:40,024
My favorite is
the Goofy Gorgonzola.

628
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,592
Goofy Gorgonzola Burger.

629
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:42,560
Mushroom Burger.

630
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:43,961
Whassupy Burger,
     coming up.

631
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:45,930
The owner has
  a creative flair.

632
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,331
Chika-pow!

633
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,033
You think?
  Whee!

634
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,736
But this is serious stuff
  to owner Michael Maxon.

635
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,003
31 different burgers.

636
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,939
31 -- All these
  different kinds of meats,

637
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:56,874
different kinds of breads,
    funky sauces.

638
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,142
What's your first burger
 we're gonna make?

639
00:22:58,144 --> 00:22:59,310
The Whassupy Burger.

640
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:02,046
We have your 5 pounds
    of Grade A beef.

641
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,314
We're gonna make
   a little rub for it.

642
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:05,616
Roasted garlic, sesame oil,

643
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:07,418
Worcester-shis-shish-shire
     sauce,

644
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,853
horseradish,

645
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:12,123
barbecue sauce,
  and ground roasted fennel,

646
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:15,326
crushed red pepper, celery salt,
   coarse ground pepper.

647
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:17,261
All right,
  we're gonna grind this up.

648
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:18,496
Uhhhhh...

649
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:19,530
You made your own noise.

650
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:20,965
Just in case
    it wasn't working.

651
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:23,534
Then we'll add it to the beef,
    mix this all up.

652
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:24,735
You're really trying
 to convince me

653
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,270
that you do that
 with that spatula?

654
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:27,505
Thank you.
     No, I do it.

655
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:29,340
Okay, this guy gets
a foot in there, I bet.

656
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:30,608
Okay, we're gonna
    portion them out.

657
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,810
Seven ounces, cover them up,
hold them in the cooler,

658
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,178
and then
they're ready to go.

659
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,113
Next, we're gonna make
 the wasabi mayo.

660
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:39,617
Correct. Add a few
  little chipotle flakes...

661
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,218
to that.

662
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,653
A little...

663
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:45,089
Can I get
the Crazy Burger dictionary?

664
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,224
We're gonna
   come out with that one.

665
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,326
This is prepared wasabi,
    stir-fry sauce.

666
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:50,428
There's rice vinegar.

667
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,562
Mix this all up.

668
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:52,897
Wa-da-la-da-
    la-da-la-da-la.

669
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:55,733
Wa-da-la-da-
 la-da-la-da-la.

670
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:57,601
We've got the burgers done,
we got the sauce done,

671
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,203
let's go cook the burger.
      All right.

672
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,771
We are going to
    charbroil it.

673
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,039
Put a little dimple
     in the top

674
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,474
to keep it
   from getting to, um...

675
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:05,376
- Too...
- You know what I'm saying.

676
00:24:05,378 --> 00:24:07,077
We got a nice
 whole wheat bread.

677
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,379
Brush it with butter.

678
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:09,747
Slap it down here.

679
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:11,982
For this burger,
we make fresh onion rings.

680
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:14,618
These are red onions
marinated with buttermilk,

681
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,655
flour, salt and pepper,
and then breadcrumbs.

682
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:19,523
Okay, so, we fry these up.
   So, now what do we do?

683
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:21,091
Flip this one more time.

684
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:23,427
Melt some Brie cheese.

685
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:24,562
Ooh, I like it.

686
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:25,863
Throw a little water
  for steam.

687
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:27,398
Ooh, wa-wa!

688
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,034
Bep-bop, kshew!

689
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:32,536
All right,
I think we got the melty Brie.

690
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:35,406
We'll just place it
lovingly on the bun.

691
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:37,141
You want me to get
 those onion rings?
    Could you please?

692
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,642
There we go.
     All right.

693
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,578
Those will go
    right over the top.

694
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,112
A little ba-da-choom.

695
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:43,214
A little ba-da-choom?

696
00:24:43,216 --> 00:24:44,615
And there we go,
   the sauce on the side.

697
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:47,318
Now, this is the wasabi sauce
 that we made.
      Correct.

698
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,153
The whole-grain bun's
  really nice

699
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,621
'cause you need something
that's got some strength.

700
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:52,923
Really good burger.

701
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,158
Nice Asian flavor.

702
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,459
Oh, and then the Brie.

703
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:56,794
Totally works.
 Look at that.

704
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:58,062
Good flavor.
  Oh, yeah.

705
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:01,065
Now I'm just gonna get
a little dip on the wasabi mayo.

706
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:03,133
That's really nice. Nothing
I would change on that burger.

707
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:04,034
Nice.

708
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:05,102
The Whassupy Burger.

709
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:06,070
Phenomenal.

710
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:07,404
Mmm. Wow.
  It's just great.

711
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:09,240
It's got a really nice
  wasabi kick to it.

712
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:11,308
The onions, the cheese --
   It's amazing.

713
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,577
It's unlike anything
   I've ever had.

714
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:15,212
But don't let
  the name fool you...

715
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:16,380
'Cause it's not
    just burgers.

716
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,616
The food is
  absolute excellent.

717
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:19,850
What's so good about it?

718
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,252
You just know you're getting
  fresh ingredients.

719
00:25:21,254 --> 00:25:23,187
Making the food ourselves...

720
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,655
Bringing out the flavor
     in things.

721
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:26,423
Like these...
Pacific Rim rolls.

722
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:28,092
...filled with
  fresh roasted chicken

723
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:31,629
and a ginger-cilantro slaw,
 hand-rolled and deep-fried.

724
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:34,698
Ah! I'd like to order
9,000 for a wedding.

725
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,666
And their fish burger...

726
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:37,301
The Luna-Sea Burger,
   delicious.

727
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:38,402
Talk to me, Goose.

728
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:39,803
The Luna-Sea begins
    with salmon.

729
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:41,105
Check for bones.

730
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:43,240
Take the skin off
    in one fell swoop.

731
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:45,442
We're gonna cut it up
  into grinder-size pieces.

732
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:46,911
You chop it up,
now you're gonna grind it.

733
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:50,414
Grinding makes a much better
 mouthfeel at the end product.

734
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:51,649
Really?
So, we bring it back,

735
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:53,551
and then we're gonna mix it
with the pistachio pesto.

736
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:56,186
This part, we have basil,
   roasted pistachios...

737
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:57,521
Roasted garlic.

738
00:25:57,523 --> 00:26:00,724
Parmesan cheese, a little
  orange juice, hot sauce...

739
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,459
So just some
regular, ol' hot sauce.

740
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:04,061
And we've got
  a little salt and pepper,

741
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,096
which we're going to
    throw in the pesto.

742
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:08,198
Put a little in the salmon.

743
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,500
While we're pulsing,

744
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:11,735
we're going to loosen this up
  with a little olive oil.

745
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,504
So, we want a little bit
 of texture in that?

746
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:14,705
We want some crunch.

747
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:16,874
I want to try this.
  All right, try the pesto.

748
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:18,108
Mmm!

749
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,311
That could be served on, like,
a grilled flip-flop.

750
00:26:20,313 --> 00:26:22,313
You have to mix it
    with the salmon.

751
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:24,348
Throw some breadcrumbs
     in here...
To bind it.

752
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,083
So now, we have this
 all mixed up.

753
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,251
This is mixed up,
     the burger.

754
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,786
I mean, this is mixed up.

755
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:30,821
So now
you portion them up.

756
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:31,922
And when we press down,

757
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,424
we don't care
  if they're perfectly round.

758
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:34,558
Okay, now
 we go to the oven.

759
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,493
We're gonna pop them
    at 500 degrees.

760
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:38,295
Hot and fast.
   Just barely cook them.

761
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:39,897
And then hit right to
the walk-in and cool them down.

762
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:41,031
Ba-choom!

763
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,866
I wrap it in some phyllo dough,

764
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:46,637
and we're gonna
  griselle iatta casa bonay.

765
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:48,872
You just
made those words up.

766
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:50,140
Yes.

767
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:52,343
So we're gonna take
a couple sheets of phyllo dough.

768
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:54,511
We're gonna fold them
    not quite in half.

769
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:56,146
Fold it
  not quite in half again.

770
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:57,548
And no basting it
 with any butter?

771
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,682
We use garlic oil.

772
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:00,184
Get that burger
    in the middle,

773
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:03,454
and then wrap around it
   nice and tighty-whitey.

774
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:06,423
Place it on a tray to cook it
   for the second time.

775
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,659
500 again,
    another 7 minutes.

776
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:11,328
Dough gets brown. Pull it out.
   Cool it off quickly.

777
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,563
How do we heat it
 for service?

778
00:27:12,565 --> 00:27:13,731
Put a little butter
    on the griddle.

779
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:15,032
This side down.

780
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:16,300
Put a little brown
 on that side.

781
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,468
Little flippy-flip.

782
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,502
Just so
it's cooked through.

783
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:20,537
There we go.
We're gonna turn it over,

784
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,973
cut it in half, make it
look pretty on the plate.

785
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,008
Voilà.

786
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,210
That gets the orange
    chili mayonnaise.

787
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:29,346
The flavor profile is huge.

788
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,048
The pistachio,
  the crunch,

789
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,317
and the texture, and the bite
that gives you -- Great.

790
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,618
You know what
 you're doing, man.

791
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,053
Thanks, sir.
    Appreciate it.

792
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:37,054
You really know
 what you're doing.

793
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:38,422
Luna-Sea Burger?

794
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:40,858
Delicately seasoned,
 and with the sauce, it's great.

795
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,226
Good texture.

796
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:44,094
It's crunchy, and it's, like,
  light. It's very good.

797
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:45,963
Four, five, six,
    seven burgers.

798
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:46,797
This place is great.

799
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:47,831
Freaky Fajita Burger.

800
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:48,999
Everything's different.

801
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,901
You could do breakfast, lunch,
  dinner, dessert,

802
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,136
and really anything
   in between.

803
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:54,571
Nice job. I give this a
whap, whap, whap, whap, whap!

804
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:56,774
Aww, that's better than

805
00:27:56,776 --> 00:28:00,044
a pah-bah-niki-nah
  that you gave it before.

806
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:01,245
Coming up...

807
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,081
In Providence,
   Rhode Island...

808
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,182
What a neat place.

809
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,051
...a 24/7 local landmark...

810
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:09,453
It'll be interesting.
like everything here is.

811
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:11,722
...serving their own spin
  for over 60 years.

812
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:13,457
Yeah. Coming. Every day.
    See you every time.

813
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:21,532
I so dig doing "Triple D"
  on the East Coast.

814
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,567
One of the main reasons is
  all the history.

815
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:25,202
Here I am, Providence,
   Rhode Island,

816
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,603
at a family-owned restaurant

817
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:28,505
that's been open
  for more than 62 years.

818
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,974
Now, a lot of businesses
have come and gone in this area,

819
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:32,342
but not this joint.

820
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:34,912
They're still serving great food
  at reasonable prices

821
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:37,047
to college students
  because that's what

822
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,716
Louis Family Restaurant
   is all about.

823
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,184
Meatloaf dinner!

824
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:41,185
Everyone knows about this.

825
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:42,553
It's kind of, like, a tradition.

826
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:43,987
Coming here is like family.

827
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:45,723
It's like having breakfast
  or dinner in your home.

828
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:46,757
A number one over hard.

829
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,691
It's cheap. It's huge.

830
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:48,859
Good food?
   Great food.

831
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:50,527
Thanks to John Gianfrancesco...

832
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:51,929
Western with cheese up.

833
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:53,163
And his brother, Albert...
      Good.

834
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:55,099
Louis is Louis,
 the way it's always been.

835
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:56,300
And Louis was your dad?

836
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:57,701
Yeah, he was a cook
    in the Army.

837
00:28:57,703 --> 00:29:00,270
And when he got out,
  he opened this joint.

838
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:02,606
53 years later,
  the boys took over...

839
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:03,841
Turkey dinner up!

840
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:05,242
...serving
 scratch-made favorites...

841
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,344
The same as the first time
  I walked in the door.

842
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:09,446
...and old standards
  done John's way.

843
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:11,448
Barbecue-chicken ravioli!

844
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,417
Johnny always
 gives us surprises. It's fun.

845
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,486
I've never had
  a barbecue-chicken ravioli.

846
00:29:15,488 --> 00:29:16,820
Today you will.

847
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:18,522
We need to make
 a barbecue sauce.

848
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:19,690
Tomato sauce
     and onions.

849
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:22,226
Honey, vinegar,
 orange juice.

850
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:24,661
Garlic, the paprika,
    red chili flake.

851
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:26,830
Coriander, sage.

852
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:29,266
The oregano.
 Pepper, salt.

853
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,901
Rosemary, parsley,

854
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:33,003
and then caramel coloring
  that makes it dark brown.

855
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:34,104
That's it.
      Whoo!

856
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,640
16 items,
  16 tickets to Flavortown.

857
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:38,542
All aboard!

858
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:40,544
Can't believe I just said
   the "all aboard" part.

859
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:42,179
Okay, so,
    the sauce is done.

860
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:43,514
We're gonna put it
 on the chicken.

861
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:45,983
So we make sure that the sauce
    gets on the flesh.

862
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:48,285
And we want to make sure
that they're gonna taste it.

863
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,053
Now we're gonna
  go to the oven with this?
 Yes.

864
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:51,021
How long?
 Two hours.

865
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:52,623
What temperature?
 About 300.

866
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,658
Maybe we'll
 raise it up later.

867
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,727
If we're feeling wild.

868
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:59,863
The chicken ready?
Yeah. A little warm.

869
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:01,298
Let it cool down
    and then shred it?

870
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,267
We're gonna
cut it in little chunks.

871
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:04,635
Chicken in the bowl.

872
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:05,602
Ricotta cheese.

873
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:06,670
Frozen spinach.

874
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:08,839
Parsley, prosciutto
 that we made.

875
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:11,341
Oh! A whole bunch
   of cheddar and jack.

876
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,544
Some Parmesan.
Just easier if I say it for you.

877
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:14,545
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

878
00:30:14,547 --> 00:30:16,446
White onions
   and some mozzarella.

879
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:17,714
And then
we're gonna put six eggs.

880
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:19,316
What are we gonna mix all this
    in there, Johnny?

881
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,051
It seems like, uh...

882
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:22,486
Tell us what we've got,
     Johnny.

883
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:23,921
A bowl.
It's a little small.

884
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:25,189
Yeah. Whoo!

885
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:27,057
Wow. That's
 a good-size bowl.

886
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,458
Okay, so, the eggs go in.

887
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,427
You whisk those up.
    Whisk which?

888
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:31,428
Or just use a spoon?

889
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,429
We're gonna
 use our hand.

890
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:33,697
We kind of have to
 work it a bit.

891
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:34,798
Whose recipe is this?

892
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,533
Father had
 a cheese ravioli

893
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:37,968
without the chicken
 and the prosciutto.

894
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,169
Now we grab the dough...

895
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,038
That we made,
put flour everywhere.

896
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,207
You start it out
 on the highest number first.

897
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:44,942
You got to do it a couple times
    the big way.

898
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:47,177
Dial it down to --
Whoa, you're gonna go that fast?

899
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,212
Living on the edge.

900
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:50,981
I can play that.

901
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,152
Wow.

902
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:56,453
All right,
 now it's your turn.

903
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:58,455
You want me to do
  the doling out of the...
 Yes.

904
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:00,390
Okay, I just know that we can't
   have it on the edges.

905
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:01,725
Looking good.

906
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:02,793
And how many
    come with an order?

907
00:31:02,795 --> 00:31:04,828
12.
 That's one order.

908
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,096
Get after it, Rocky.

909
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:07,831
So, now these are done?
 Yes.

910
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,900
Now that is
    a stuffed ravioli.

911
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:11,802
Boil them in a little saltwater
    till they float.

912
00:31:11,804 --> 00:31:13,403
There you go.
    They're ready.

913
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:14,905
That's your 12.

914
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:16,406
And top them
 with some marinara?

915
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:17,507
Hey, that's only 10.

916
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,009
Ah, make sure
    I had enough dough.

917
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:20,477
You only gave me 10!

918
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,246
Look at that.

919
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:23,847
Mmm!
    Oh, my gosh.

920
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:26,216
Look at the huge pieces
 of chicken that are in there.

921
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:30,087
That right there is as good
 as any ravioli you will find.

922
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:31,655
Off the hook.

923
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:33,790
The spinach, the cheese,
    stuffed full.

924
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,125
That's just awesome.

925
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,227
Made the barbecue sauce,
   barbecued the chicken,

926
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,096
made the marinara
  and handmade the ravioli.

927
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:40,364
Mmm!

928
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,032
Uh-huh. Yeah. Coming. Every day.
    See you every time.

929
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:43,100
They're really good.

930
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:44,201
It's one of my favorites.

931
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:45,636
It tastes like he knows
  what he's doing.

932
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:46,803
Spinach pie,
     going out!

933
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:48,639
Everything's meant
  to please the customer.

934
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:50,440
I like how you can get
  a turkey dinner at 11:00.

935
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:52,542
Or if you need lasagna
  at 5:00 in the morning.

936
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:53,644
Hash up!

937
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:55,045
Corned beef hash from scratch.

938
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:56,980
Grilled pumpkin muffin.
  You just know it's golden.

939
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:58,548
Totally delicious.
   Totally.

940
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,850
Blueberry pancakes.

941
00:31:59,852 --> 00:32:02,519
Pumpkin pancakes.
 There's just so many options.

942
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:03,754
I got the granola pancakes.

943
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:05,789
Yep, with homemade granola.

944
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,124
These are so good.

945
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:09,226
Granola pancakes?
It'll be interesting.

946
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:10,861
Like everything here is.

947
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:13,463
Some old-fashioned oats,
 some wheat germ.

948
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:15,165
Oh, you're getting healthy
     on this.

949
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:16,533
Now some bran.

950
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:20,070
It's gonna make a nice strudel-y
kind of thing when it's done.

951
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:21,471
Strudel-y?
  Yeah.

952
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:22,773
Sesame seed.

953
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:23,840
I'm gonna
put this in the oven

954
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:26,276
about a half-hour
 at 250, 300.

955
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,211
It smells toasty,
  doesn't it?

956
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:29,646
It does smell toasty.

957
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:30,814
I'm gonna
 add some fruit.

958
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:31,915
Blueberries
    and cranberries?

959
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:33,951
Yeah. Just another
10 minutes in the oven.

960
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:35,886
Just for granola.
    Smells good.

961
00:32:35,888 --> 00:32:39,356
We're gonna add some cinnamon,
honey, and some maple syrup.

962
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:40,891
Raisins, too.

963
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:42,092
You're gonna
    stir it into this?
 Yes.

964
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:43,260
A little more honey.
 Yeah.

965
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:45,162
Do you like my drizzling
     technique?
  Yes.

966
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:46,496
That's it.
Now we're gonna make

967
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:49,333
Louis' pancake batter
from his Army cookbook.

968
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:50,734
Eggs and sugar.

969
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:53,170
Instead of lard,
we're gonna use corn oil.

970
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:54,137
Milk.

971
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,973
I didn't bring
   my Gallagher shield.

972
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,841
Now we're gonna add some spice.

973
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:59,543
Nutmeg --
That's how little, actually.

974
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:00,777
Turmeric.

975
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,112
Turmeric
    in pancake batter.

976
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:04,247
Vanilla, with
a little touch of rum in it.

977
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:05,349
Vanilla with rum?

978
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:06,650
Louis liked rum.

979
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:09,052
And now, our dry ingredients,

980
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:12,656
Flour and cake flour
 and baking powder.

981
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:14,291
Instead of sifting,
 we're rubbing.

982
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:16,460
He's rubbing.
    We're watching.

983
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:18,028
And this goes in there.

984
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,929
Gonna whisk?

985
00:33:18,931 --> 00:33:20,297
Go ahead.
  Go ahead.

986
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:21,798
There you go. Don't let me
 get ahead of it or anything.

987
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,367
Just dump it right in.

988
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:25,168
Then we're gonna dump
  the granola right in this?

989
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,603
Yes, probably slowly.

990
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:28,138
How about I dump it all in,
 and then you try to whisk it?

991
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:31,308
That's it.
 We're ready to go.

992
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,743
Put it on the grill.

993
00:33:32,745 --> 00:33:34,044
How many pancakes
    come with an order?

994
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:35,712
Three pancakes
 with an order.

995
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:37,381
That's a lot of pancake.
    Aren't you hungry?

996
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:39,216
I think that's it.

997
00:33:39,218 --> 00:33:40,817
Your order's
    already ready.

998
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,819
I'm intrigued
with these granola pancakes.

999
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:45,188
Good pancake.
 Oh, good.

1000
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,256
It's got texture.

1001
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:47,457
You get some of the oat
     in there.

1002
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,625
You get some of
    the fresh fruit,

1003
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:50,394
some of the raisin,

1004
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:52,229
some of the hot pancake
    on your flip-flop.

1005
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:54,564
It's not super sweet.
   A really good pancake.

1006
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:57,601
It's so moist
 and so much flavor in it.

1007
00:33:57,603 --> 00:33:59,703
Can you eat
all those pancakes?
   Oh, yeah.

1008
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,204
Big portions
 of really delicious food.

1009
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,140
Poached passion
    Florentine up!

1010
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:05,175
Whatever he's doing back there,
  he's got it down.

1011
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:06,610
Loaf of Johnny bread!

1012
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:08,011
It's cheap,
    and it's so good.

1013
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:09,846
I love you guys
 sticking to it,

1014
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,048
Keeping the business open,

1015
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,816
having it available
to the college students.

1016
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:14,618
Congratulations.
What a neat place, man.

1017
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,586
Up next...
 Ah!

1018
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:18,088
...on Baltimore, Maryland...

1019
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,489
Winner, winner,
 rice-ball dinner.

1020
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:21,358
...an old-school
  Italian market...

1021
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,260
Is this
    one of the best?
This is the best.

1022
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:25,996
...keeping tradition alive
   in the kitchen.

1023
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:27,297
This is how
  its supposed to be done.
 Yeah.

1024
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:28,832
This is
    what your mom said?
That's right.

1025
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:35,872
With a name like Guy Fieri,
 you know I love Italian food.

1026
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:37,240
If you find yourself
   in Baltimore,

1027
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,842
and you're looking
  for some good Italian.

1028
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:41,645
Check out this, DiPasquale's,
  making their own pasta,

1029
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:44,481
doing their own mozzarella,
 casing their own sausage,

1030
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:46,583
and doing it old-school
 in the back of a market.

1031
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,118
Is that gonna be
 for here or to go?

1032
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,538
Can I have
    a honey-glazed ham?

1033
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,073
It started wh,
"You make me a sandwich,"

1034
00:34:53,075 --> 00:34:54,107
There you go.

1035
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:55,675
Then add more tables
    and more tables.

1036
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:56,943
And that led into this.

1037
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:58,044
A full-menu...

1038
00:34:58,046 --> 00:34:59,212
Do you want that
 heated or cold?

1039
00:34:59,214 --> 00:35:00,514
...of home-made Italian.

1040
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:01,681
I'm having the lasagna.

1041
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,084
The spices, the sauce --
  absolutely delicious.

1042
00:35:04,086 --> 00:35:05,719
The arancini, I've never had it
  like this before.

1043
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:06,987
It's always good.

1044
00:35:06,989 --> 00:35:08,355
- The kind of cooking...
- That's good.

1045
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:10,724
...Joe DiPasquale and his wife,
  Sabrina, grew up with.

1046
00:35:10,726 --> 00:35:13,527
I use what my mother
 and my parents have taught me,

1047
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:16,263
what my husband and I learned,
and put it all together.

1048
00:35:16,265 --> 00:35:17,898
- The food is amazing.
- Very authentic.

1049
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,332
More like old-school.

1050
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:20,734
When I walked in,
    I could smell it --

1051
00:35:20,736 --> 00:35:22,502
from the fresh mozzarella
    to the sausage.

1052
00:35:22,504 --> 00:35:23,804
This is all home made.

1053
00:35:23,806 --> 00:35:26,039
So, you make your pasta noodles
    for every lasagna?

1054
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,007
Mm-hmm.
     Oh!

1055
00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:28,041
Now, why do you
    make the moat?

1056
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,476
Well, because
I'm gonna scramble the egg.

1057
00:35:29,478 --> 00:35:31,111
Why not scramble them
    ahead of time?

1058
00:35:31,113 --> 00:35:32,646
I like doing it this way.
     This is how
  it's supposed to be done?

1059
00:35:32,648 --> 00:35:34,047
This is
    what your mom said?
That's right.

1060
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,383
Pound of flour, five eggs,
    a little salt,

1061
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:37,884
and a lot of love.
 Yes.

1062
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,452
Then, actually, just
a little drizzle of olive oil.

1063
00:35:39,454 --> 00:35:40,620
Just about a teaspoon?
 Yeah.

1064
00:35:40,622 --> 00:35:42,255
You want to get it
     to where

1065
00:35:42,257 --> 00:35:44,257
it just stars to form together
   and then grab it out.
That's right.

1066
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:46,193
You're gonna let it rest
    for about, what --

1067
00:35:46,195 --> 00:35:47,894
20 minutes, 30 minutes?
About 20 minutes.

1068
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,696
You cover yours with, like,
   a little damp towel?

1069
00:35:49,698 --> 00:35:51,231
Yes, I do.
   So it doesn't dry out.

1070
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:52,532
This will be enough
   to make our lasagna.

1071
00:35:52,534 --> 00:35:54,100
Yes.
We're gonna quarter this.

1072
00:35:54,102 --> 00:35:55,535
We knead them down
 a little bit.

1073
00:35:55,537 --> 00:35:57,604
Well, then let me play.
Okay. Not too wide.

1074
00:35:57,606 --> 00:35:59,606
Because it won't fit
    in the machine.
Yeah, that's good.

1075
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:01,007
Take it...

1076
00:36:01,009 --> 00:36:02,509
Let it
   draw through itself.

1077
00:36:02,511 --> 00:36:04,778
And it's a nice,
 thick pasta sheet.

1078
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,879
Now fold it into itself.

1079
00:36:05,881 --> 00:36:06,980
Back to the press.

1080
00:36:08,784 --> 00:36:10,584
Change the notch,
 press again.

1081
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:13,019
Seven times just to get us
    to this stage.

1082
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:14,654
These'll just get a chance
  to kind of hang out a bit

1083
00:36:14,656 --> 00:36:15,956
until we're all done,

1084
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:18,291
and then we'll use
 a little salted, boiled water.

1085
00:36:18,293 --> 00:36:20,794
And a little bit of olive oil.
Give them about 2 minutes.

1086
00:36:20,796 --> 00:36:22,896
I'm just gonna grease the pan
 a little bit

1087
00:36:22,898 --> 00:36:24,931
with some butter,
a little bit of marinara.

1088
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,166
Marinara that we made.

1089
00:36:26,168 --> 00:36:27,634
Look at the color
    on that. Mmm!

1090
00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:29,102
Go over to
 our pasta sheets.

1091
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,871
Look at that!
Lay it down in here.

1092
00:36:30,873 --> 00:36:33,440
Right, and you overlap it
   because that helps it

1093
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:35,075
stay together when you come out
    with the spatula.

1094
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:37,110
That's right. A little bit
of sauce. Parmigiano first.

1095
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,479
This adds a little bit
    of saltiness to it.

1096
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:40,881
Then I go
for the ground beef.

1097
00:36:40,883 --> 00:36:42,249
Now fresh ground
     that we do,

1098
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:43,717
a little garlic,
  a little salt and pepper.

1099
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:45,619
Parsley, a little bit
 of the Mozzarella.

1100
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,087
Nice and melt down.

1101
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:49,155
And that'll melt
  and spread a little bit.
It will spread out.

1102
00:36:49,157 --> 00:36:51,057
And then we're gonna go
for the Ricotta cheese.

1103
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:52,525
- Nice and light.
   -Mm-hmm.

1104
00:36:52,527 --> 00:36:53,560
How many layers of this,
     three?

1105
00:36:53,562 --> 00:36:54,694
Three should work.

1106
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:57,230
So we go back down
  with the noodles, sauce,

1107
00:36:57,232 --> 00:37:00,333
Parmesan, ground beef,
   Mozzarella, Ricotta,

1108
00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:01,468
and then again.
   -And again.

1109
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,570
- We bake open on the top layer.
    -Yes.

1110
00:37:03,572 --> 00:37:05,105
350
for about 45 minutes.

1111
00:37:05,107 --> 00:37:07,374
Fantastic.
    A-ha, look at that.

1112
00:37:07,376 --> 00:37:08,942
See those layers
     in there?

1113
00:37:08,944 --> 00:37:10,510
Oh. Mmm.

1114
00:37:10,512 --> 00:37:13,113
That's delicious, exactly
 how it's supposed to be done.

1115
00:37:13,115 --> 00:37:14,381
Nothing's pouring out.

1116
00:37:14,383 --> 00:37:17,083
You can taste the meat.
   The Ricotta stands out.

1117
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:19,252
That's up there with any
 of the best lasagnas there are.

1118
00:37:19,254 --> 00:37:20,587
- Great job.
   -Thank you.

1119
00:37:20,589 --> 00:37:23,223
I can't get enough
of the filling, a lot of flavor.

1120
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:24,925
This is where
 I get authentic lasagna.

1121
00:37:24,927 --> 00:37:27,127
I've never had a lasagna
 like this, out of this world.

1122
00:37:27,129 --> 00:37:29,763
All that they serve here is done
 in a traditional setting.

1123
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:32,299
You can come here and do
 your grocery shopping, also.

1124
00:37:32,301 --> 00:37:34,601
Not only can they shop,
 they get a bite.

1125
00:37:34,603 --> 00:37:36,636
They get an espresso,
 a glass of wine.

1126
00:37:36,638 --> 00:37:38,104
They do everything wonderfully.

1127
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:39,272
I love their sandwiches.

1128
00:37:39,274 --> 00:37:41,675
Homemade Italian subs
  are just excellent.

1129
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:43,710
This one stacked
  with Prosciutto,

1130
00:37:43,712 --> 00:37:44,978
capicola, and soppressata,

1131
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,780
and they've got
  their own sausage...

1132
00:37:46,782 --> 00:37:48,315
You can definitely tell
  that this is authentic,

1133
00:37:48,317 --> 00:37:49,449
sweet Italian sausage.

1134
00:37:49,451 --> 00:37:50,684
...handmade from scratch.

1135
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:53,019
It really mixes well
 with the fresh Mozzarella.

1136
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,721
Yep, they're doing that
   fresh, too.

1137
00:37:54,723 --> 00:37:56,790
How many pounds of Mozzarella
do you guys make a week?

1138
00:37:56,792 --> 00:37:58,124
200 pounds.

1139
00:37:58,126 --> 00:38:00,060
Because they're using it
 on just about everything

1140
00:38:00,062 --> 00:38:03,163
from lasagna to sandwiches
  and for the bocconcini,

1141
00:38:03,165 --> 00:38:05,365
the little ones,
  in caprese salad.

1142
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,000
It's not a recipe.
    It's a technique.

1143
00:38:07,002 --> 00:38:08,868
You have to make
 a lot of batches in order to...

1144
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,003
To really
 get it straight.

1145
00:38:10,005 --> 00:38:11,071
Starting off
 with the curds.

1146
00:38:11,073 --> 00:38:12,439
Small batch of curds,
     submerged.

1147
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:13,940
No salt or anything
 in this, right?

1148
00:38:13,942 --> 00:38:14,941
No.

1149
00:38:14,943 --> 00:38:16,576
- It's regular hot water.
    -Yes.

1150
00:38:16,578 --> 00:38:17,577
You want them all
to kind of soften up

1151
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:19,079
and start
 to break down.

1152
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:20,347
Yeah,
    so I can work it.

1153
00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:21,348
Look at that.

1154
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,116
Make sure
   all the lumps are out.

1155
00:38:23,118 --> 00:38:25,285
Okay. Didn't I see this
 in "Gladiator"?

1156
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:27,287
The sacred
 Mozzarella oar.

1157
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:29,589
We want to eventually get it
  to a ball.

1158
00:38:29,591 --> 00:38:30,991
Kind of like
  I'm working pizza dough.

1159
00:38:30,993 --> 00:38:32,759
Now we want to go
   into the salt water.

1160
00:38:32,761 --> 00:38:34,894
Yeah, this solution gives it
 its salty outside

1161
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,429
but a sweetness inside.
    -Right.

1162
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:37,897
It also helps
  in the preservation of it.

1163
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:39,132
Yes.

1164
00:38:39,134 --> 00:38:41,067
Cover them, and they sit in here
for about 40 minutes.

1165
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,168
And then
    we eat them.

1166
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,436
Mozzarella is so fresh.

1167
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:45,939
When you pull it up,
 cheese just keeps coming.

1168
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:47,307
You can taste
  all the fresh flavors.

1169
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:49,376
So this is the Mozzarella
    that we made.

1170
00:38:49,378 --> 00:38:50,744
You need
 to taste it.

1171
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:53,013
Mmm, nice, little salty
 exterior, firm on the inside.

1172
00:38:53,015 --> 00:38:54,581
Mmm,
   it melts in your mouth.

1173
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,316
Definitely a little richer,
   more flavorful.

1174
00:38:56,318 --> 00:38:58,451
You can't find this
  in any restaurant.

1175
00:38:58,453 --> 00:38:59,786
This is the real-deal Italian.

1176
00:38:59,788 --> 00:39:00,854
Everything you'd expect.

1177
00:39:00,856 --> 00:39:02,022
Lasagna.

1178
00:39:02,024 --> 00:39:03,490
I come here
 to get some nice pastas,

1179
00:39:03,492 --> 00:39:04,691
salads,
  and things like that.

1180
00:39:04,693 --> 00:39:06,459
Definitely some of the best food
   I've ever had.

1181
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:08,061
I feel like
     I'm at...

1182
00:39:08,063 --> 00:39:09,329
- In Italy.
   -Yeah, Italy.

1183
00:39:09,331 --> 00:39:11,031
We're down at Sicily
   for this one.

1184
00:39:11,033 --> 00:39:13,633
The arancini -- it's delicious,
 and it's all melted together.

1185
00:39:13,635 --> 00:39:14,901
Amazing in the center.

1186
00:39:14,903 --> 00:39:16,469
Are we gonna fry these
 or bake them?

1187
00:39:16,471 --> 00:39:17,470
We are gonna fry them.

1188
00:39:17,472 --> 00:39:18,838
Ha.

1189
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,540
- My favorite word.
    -"Fry."

1190
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:22,342
- No, ha.

1191
00:39:22,344 --> 00:39:24,010
- Let's begin this.
 -This is actually beef stock.

1192
00:39:24,012 --> 00:39:26,546
Half gallon,
and we make that here?

1193
00:39:26,548 --> 00:39:28,181
Yes, we do.
 Gonna wait for that to boil.

1194
00:39:28,183 --> 00:39:29,449
We're using
 the arborio rice,

1195
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:31,618
which is a nice, big,
thick, short-grain rice.

1196
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,619
Mm-hmm.

1197
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:33,787
Great to work with

1198
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,221
when you're making
   some kind of rice ball.

1199
00:39:35,223 --> 00:39:36,656
It's easy to mold.

1200
00:39:36,658 --> 00:39:38,191
Going to give this
    a quick stir.

1201
00:39:38,193 --> 00:39:39,292
Just let
 this simmer.

1202
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,660
When are we gonna add in
 our ingredients?

1203
00:39:40,662 --> 00:39:42,128
I'm gonna add in
  a little bit of sea salt.

1204
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,463
Okay.
A little white pepper.

1205
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,465
Some white pepper,
   a teaspoon of butter.

1206
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:47,634
- All right.
 -When it's halfway cooked...

1207
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:48,635
We throw in
 the saffron.

1208
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:49,869
- Look at that.
  -It's beautiful.

1209
00:39:49,871 --> 00:39:51,471
The saffron
can't last that long.

1210
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:54,007
- That's right.
 -Let it bloom and then boom.

1211
00:39:54,009 --> 00:39:55,575
So we let that finish cooking,
and then what's gonna happen?

1212
00:39:55,577 --> 00:39:57,844
Let it cool down
   for about 20 minutes.

1213
00:39:57,846 --> 00:40:00,246
Now are we doing this
    traditional style?

1214
00:40:00,248 --> 00:40:01,347
Yes.

1215
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:02,615
- I'm learning it the right way?
    -Yes.

1216
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:04,017
Grab some rice there.

1217
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:05,552
- Make a little ball.
   -Little?

1218
00:40:05,554 --> 00:40:07,220
Now we're going to press down
  on it,

1219
00:40:07,222 --> 00:40:08,888
make, like,
a little well in there.

1220
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,623
- My well of friendship there.
    -Sure.

1221
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:13,059
We're gonna grab a little bit
of this ground-meat mixture

1222
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:14,160
that we made earlier.

1223
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,162
Beef and pork
 with marinara and veggies.

1224
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,764
- A little Mozzarella.
   -Mm-hmm.

1225
00:40:17,766 --> 00:40:19,966
Now we kind of bring the top
 over, so we've got to get --

1226
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,768
So that gets buried
    in the center.

1227
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,937
Then you're gonna dip it
in your little flour and water.

1228
00:40:23,939 --> 00:40:25,338
- Then into the bread crumbs.
   -That's right.

1229
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,140
- Just putting a crust on them?
    -Yes.

1230
00:40:27,142 --> 00:40:29,042
- 350-degree oil?
    -Yes.

1231
00:40:29,044 --> 00:40:31,444
Okay, and then we'll serve
them with a little bit
of this warm marinara...

1232
00:40:31,446 --> 00:40:33,446
- Marinara sauce.
  -...or tomato sauce.

1233
00:40:33,448 --> 00:40:34,881
Just 'til they're nice
 and golden-brown.

1234
00:40:34,883 --> 00:40:37,250
- Which one you like?
 -I think that one's perfect.

1235
00:40:37,252 --> 00:40:39,619
Okay.

1236
00:40:39,621 --> 00:40:41,888
The melted Mozzarella.
 It's beautiful.

1237
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,623
Pour a little sauce
     over it.

1238
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,024
Mmm.

1239
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,626
If I was taught
how to make those at home,

1240
00:40:46,628 --> 00:40:47,861
I never
would have left home.

1241
00:40:48,997 --> 00:40:51,364
The rice has got a nice,
little firm center to it

1242
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,800
but a nice creaminess
 on the outside.

1243
00:40:53,802 --> 00:40:54,968
Mmm.

1244
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:56,302
That is
 just fantastic.

1245
00:40:56,304 --> 00:40:57,437
I love the peas
 in there, too.

1246
00:40:57,439 --> 00:40:58,438
Mm-hmm.

1247
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,073
That's about it
 right there.

1248
00:41:00,075 --> 00:41:01,908
Winner winner,
 rice-ball dinner.

1249
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,477
First thing that hits me is the
 crispiness of the outer crust.

1250
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:06,513
The meat and the rice and the
 Mozzarella all blend together.

1251
00:41:06,515 --> 00:41:07,614
It's really good.

1252
00:41:07,616 --> 00:41:08,982
One meat lasagna.

1253
00:41:08,984 --> 00:41:11,317
The best home-cooked
 Italian meal you'll ever have.

1254
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:13,820
On a scale of one to 10,
  I'd give it a 12.

1255
00:41:13,822 --> 00:41:15,321
In the world
   of Baltimore Italians,

1256
00:41:15,323 --> 00:41:17,757
is this one of the best?
  -This is<i> the</i> best.

1257
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:20,560
I would recommend it
  to everybody. It has an
  authentic Italian feel.

1258
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:21,794
Look at
 the portions.

1259
00:41:21,796 --> 00:41:24,097
They give you the portions
 on how big you are.

1260
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:25,865
Is that what you do,
    you scale in?

1261
00:41:25,867 --> 00:41:27,934
- And then they serve you...
   -Right, yeah.

1262
00:41:27,936 --> 00:41:29,802
I don't come back here
   just for the Mozzarella

1263
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:31,771
and the pasta and the sausage
   and the whole thing,

1264
00:41:31,773 --> 00:41:33,206
just to hang out
    with these cats.

1265
00:41:34,676 --> 00:41:37,710
So that's it for this edition of
"Triple D," but don't you worry.

1266
00:41:37,712 --> 00:41:39,078
There's plenty more to enjoy.

1267
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,413
It's all over this country.

1268
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,115
I'll be looking for you
   next time

1269
00:41:42,117 --> 00:41:44,751
on "Diners, Drive-ins,
   and Dives."

1270
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:46,686
- I'm hungry.
   -I'm starving.

1271
00:41:46,688 --> 00:41:48,922
I know
 it doesn't look like that.

1272
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:50,790
I have
  my Barney shirt on.
