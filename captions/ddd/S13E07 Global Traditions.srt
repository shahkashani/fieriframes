KOSHER SALT IN THERE.           

297
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,274
AND A LITTLE PEPPER.            
          READY TO GO.          

298
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,211
  NOW THE STAR OF THE SHOW.     
WE USE WILD ALASKAN COD.        
   SUPER SUSTAINABLE.           

299
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:29,414
   HOW MANY PIECES DO YOU GET   
         WITH AN ORDER?         
ONE WHOLE FILLET,               

300
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:32,083
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT AROUND      
 AN 8-OUNCE PIECE OF FISH.      
            NICE.               

301
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,085
   WE'RE GONNA DROP IT          
INTO THE SEASONED FLOUR,        

302
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,753
 MAKE SURE IT GETS              
COMPLETELY COVERED,             

303
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,355
  DROP IT INTO THE BATTER,      
POP IT IN, LET IT FLOAT AWAY.   

304
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,492
    HOW LONG DOES THIS TAKE?    
THREE OR FOUR MINUTES.          

305
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,427
THESE FISH ARE PRETTY CLOSE     
      TO BEING READY,           

306
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,362
WE DEFINITELY WANT TO GET       
THESE CHIPS DROPPED NOW.        

307
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,398
  SO YOU DON'T CALL 'EM FRIES,  
         YOU CALL 'EM--         
WE CALL 'EM CHIPS, YEAH.        

308
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,100
THEY'RE A MUCH                  
 THICKER CUT.                   

309
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,901
ALL RIGHT, SO THESE FRIES       
     ARE READY NOW.             

310
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,903
OH, I'M CALLING 'EM FRIES.      
    I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.       

311
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,905
YOU'RE AMERICANIZING ME.        
      GO AHEAD AND PULL         
      THOSE FRIES OUT.          

312
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,574
ALL RIGHT, THESE CHIPS          
       ARE DONE.                

313
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,576
OUR FISH ARE THERE RESTING      
   READY FOR US AS WELL,        

314
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,912
AND LET'S GET THIS              
PLATED UP. DIG IN.              

315
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,580
   FRESH FISH, HAND BATTERED.   

316
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,782
    CHIPS YOU MAKE YOURSELF.    
  LOOK HOW THIN THAT BATTER IS. 

317
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,383
               YEAH, I LIKE THAT
                 A LOT BETTER,  

318
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,052
             'CAUSE YOU GO TO   
          A FISH AND CHIP PLACE,

319
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,854
     AND THE BATTER WILL BE LIKE
           2 INCHES THICK.      

320
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,589
      I WENT TO, UH, LONDON     
        WHEN I WAS A KID,       

321
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,591
     WHEN I WAS AN EXCHANGE     
       STUDENT IN FRANCE,       

322
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,127
  HAD SOME FISH AND CHIPS--THE  
WHOLE EXPERIENCE IS COMIN' BACK.

323
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,129
      MY FRIEND, THAT'S         
       THE REAL DEAL.           
I APPRECIATE THAT.              
  THANK YOU, MAN.               

324
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,864
       WHAT DO YOU THINK?       
                    AWESOME JOB.

325
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,799
            AWESOME.            
      (woman) FISH, CHIPS,      
         AND COLE SLAW.         

326
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,002
   WHAT IS IT ABOUT             
THE FISH AND CHIPS HERE         

327
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,004
THAT MAKE 'EM SO GOOD?          
            IT'S JUST THAT FRESH
             SORT OF CRISPINESS,

328
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,273
           BUT YOU STILL GET    
      THE LIGHTNESS OF THE FISH.

329
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,208
      A NICE PIECE OF COD,      
        NICE AND TENDER.        

330
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:32,944
 IT'S THE FIRST MEAL THAT I HAD 
    WHEN I WALKED INTO MAC'S.   

331
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,612
      THIS IS AS AUTHENTIC      
        AS IT GETS HERE.        

332
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,347
    THERE ISN'T ANYTHING ELSE   
        LIKE THAT AROUND.       

333
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,082
        <i> EXACTLY WHAT MAC</i>       
   <i> AND HIS WIFE KATE THOUGHT</i>   

334
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,084
<i>AFTER LANDING IN SANTA BARBARA.</i> 

335
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,152
    WE WENT ON A ROAD TRIP.     
WE WERE AWAY FOR SEVEN MONTHS.  

336
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,355
THIS WAS PRETTY MUCH THE MOST   
  BEAUTIFUL PLACE WE FOUND.     

337
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:47,158
WE THOUGHT, THERE'S NO GOOD     
   FISH AND CHIPS HERE--        

338
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:49,160
LET'S OPEN ONE.                 

339
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,496
      (man) ♪ I DON'T CARE,     
     AND YOU DON'T MATTER ♪     

340
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,831
        THE MENU IS 100%        
       AUTHENTIC BRITISH.       

341
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,568
MY FAVORITE THING ON THE MENU   
  IS THE TOAD IN THE HOLE.      

342
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:59,437
 (woman) IT'S YORKSHIRE PUDDING 
      WITH MASHED POTATOES      

343
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:03,107
    AND GRAVY, AND THEN FRIED   
 SAUSAGE ON TOP. IT'S FANTASTIC.

344
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:06,511
<i>AND IT STARTS OFF WITH A RECIPE</i> 
       <i> THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN</i>      

345
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,179

       <i> YORKSHIRE PUDDING.</i>      
                         HIT IT.

347
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,184
ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S GET         
    OUR EGGS DOWN.              

348
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,252
LET'S GIVE 'EM A LITTLE WHISK,  
     BREAK THOSE YOLKS UP.      

349
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,188
STIR IT UP, LET'S PUT           
SOME FLOUR IN THERE,            

350
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:18,923
LET'S GET SOME                  
MILK IN THERE.                  
           SO IT IS EQUAL PARTS?

351
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:20,724
YEAH, IT'S SUPPOSED             
TO BE EQUAL PARTS,              

352
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,393
BY MEASUREMENT,                 
NOT BY WEIGHT.                  

353
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,395
I LIKE TO TRY AND JUST DO       
 THE MILK BY EYE THOUGH.        
                 THAT HELPED ME.

354
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,196
               I CAN'T MAKE IT  
             IN THE FIRST PLACE,

355
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,399
      AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA SAY, 
    "EQUAL PARTS, AND THEN NOT."

356
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,401
IF YOU NEED THE RECIPE,         
YOU CAN WATCH THE SHOW.         

357
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,604
IT WILL BE ON THERE.            
                     GOOD NIGHT!

358
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,940
PROBLEM WITH THIS RIGHT NOW--   
 HAVE SOME BUBBLES IN THERE,    

359
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,675
AND WE NEED TO LET THOSE        
       SETTLE OFF,              

360
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,477
SO I'M GONNA SHOVE IT           
DOWN INTO A PITCHER,            

361
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,879
  AND WE'RE JUST GONNA LEAVE IT 
 TO REST FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR.

362
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,881
              WHAT'S THE PROBLEM
               WITH THE BUBBLES?
THOSE BUBBLES IN THERE,         

363
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,750
IF IT'S NOT BEEN ALLOWED        
       TO SETTLE,               

364
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,752
THEN THEY DON'T RISE            
AS WELL IN THE OVEN.            

365
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,754
     SO NOW WE'VE GOT           
THE YORKSHIRE PUDDING PANS,     

366
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:52,624
HAVE PREHEATED IN THERE.        
SO WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE
   SERVING YORKSHIRE PUDDING,   

367
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,758
           YOU HAVE 'EM IN THERE
               READY TO GO.     
ABSOLUTELY.                     

368
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:57,695
                SO YOU GOTTA GET
                  THE PAN HOT.  
   YOU WANT TO GET SOME OIL IN  
THERE, GET THAT OIL SMOKING HOT.

369
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,697
      BACK IN FOR 15 MINUTES,   
   THEN WE HIT THE BATTER TO IT?

370
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,200
EXACTLY. GET IT DONE.           
                        AND--GO!

371
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,040
               SOMEONE COULD GET
              BURNED DOING THIS.

372
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,042
          NICE. OKAY, HOW LONG'S
           THIS GONNA COOK OFF? 

373
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,044
WE NEED THESE, LIKE,            
     20 MINUTES,                

374
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,046
 AND WE DON'T WANT              
TO OPEN THAT DOOR.              

375
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,115
THEY'RE JUST GONNA DEFLATE.     
               WHY DID HE SAY IT
                   THAT WAY?    

376
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,851
                 'CAUSE YOU KNOW
                 I WANT TO LOOK.

377
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:23,187
              OKAY, IS IT READY?
   YEAH, I THINK                
WE SHOULD BE GOOD.              

378
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,189
                             OH!

379
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,725
           AND WHAT ARE WE GONNA
             SERVE WITH THIS?   
BANGERS AND MASH                
   WITH GRAVY.                  

380
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,727
         YOU CALL THIS A BANGER?
THE NAME COMES FROM, UH,        

381
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,530
DURING THE WORLD WAR, THEY WOULD
   LITERALLY POP ON THE FIRE.   

382
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,199
THESE ARE MADE BY A LOCAL       
 BUTCHER TO OUR RECIPE.         

383
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,668
                 HOW WILL IT GET
                    FINISHED?   
   SO IT'S GONNA GET            
FINISHED IN THE FRYER.          

384
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,670
THAT'S GONNA GIVE IT            
 A LITTLE CRISPINESS            

385
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,672
AND A LITTLE COLOR              
  ON THE OUTSIDE.               
                 AND THE GRAVY--

386
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:43,274
             MIREPOIX, DRIPPINGS
              FROM THE SAUSAGE? 

387
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,877
YEAH, NO, NONE OF THAT.         
      UM, SO WE--               

388
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:48,946
                   NONE OF THAT?
WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO MAKE       
   THAT KIND OF GRAVY.          

389
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,883
    WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR      
IS A FISH AND CHIP SHOP GRAVY,  

390
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,952
AND THE BEST WAY WE'VE BEEN     
  ABLE TO REPLICATE THAT,       

391
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,688
   WITH NO SHAME,               
IS A POWDERED GRAVY.            
                      SERIOUSLY?

392
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:59,690
SERIOUSLY.                      
                            YES!

393
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:01,892
 START PLATING.                 
THAT ONE'S YOURS.               

394
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,828
SO WE GET A WHOLE BUNCH         
 OF OUR MASHED POTATO.

       CROSS 'EM ON TOP.

00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:08,566

THIS OFF--GOURMET GRAVY.        

397
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,568
THAT'S A MEAL THERE.            

398
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,703
                   AWESOME, MAN.

399
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,705

            A THANKSGIVING MEAL.

400
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,707
          THE YORKSHIRE PUDDING 
         IS SO LIGHT AND FLUFFY,

401
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,776

              NICE FLAVOR TO IT.

00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,850
THANK YOU, MAN.                 
                 YOU'RE THE MAC.

405
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,852
   (woman) THE YORKSHIRE PUDDING
     IS REALLY NICE AND FLAKY.  

406
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:29,854

PEPPERY SPICINESS IN THERE.     

407
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:32,924
       IT IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.
       DEFINITELY COMFORT FOOD. 

408
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:35,926
      SO WE'VE DONE IT, MAN.    
   WE'VE HAD THE FISH AND CHIPS.

409
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,928
                 WE'VE HAD      
           THE TOAD IN THE HOLE.

410
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:40,398
      THERE'S ONE THING THAT    
   I'M REALLY KINDA ON THE FENCE

411
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,333
             ABOUT TRYING,      
      AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

412
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,403
               IT'S ON THE MENU.
                    HAGGIS.     

413
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:47,405
(laughs)                        

414
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,407
                  WE'LL SEE WHEN
                   WE GET BACK. 

415
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,076
                     I'M SCARED.

416
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,112
                  I CAN DO THIS,
                  I CAN DO THIS.

417
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,518
        WELCOME BACK. WE'RE HERE
           AT MAC'S FISH SHOP   

418
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,253
               IN SANTA BARBARA,
                  CALIFORNIA,   

419
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,255
          AND IT IS THAT TIME   
       THAT I HAVE BEEN AVOIDING

420
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,924
     FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS,

421
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,527
       AND THAT WAS THAT WE WERE
      GONNA STUMBLE UPON A PLACE

422
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,729
                    THAT MADE...
HAGGIS!                         

423
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,798
           I'M GONNA TRY HAGGIS.
              WHAT IS HAGGIS?   

424
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,801
 SO HAGGIS IS THE STUFF         
THEY NORMALLY THROW AWAY.       

425
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,803
                   MMM, HEART...
YEAH!                           

426
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,471
                       TONGUE...
 YEAH!                          

427
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,940
          MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE--
YUM-O LIVER.                    

428
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:25,342
      YEAH. OKAY, AND THEN SUET,
        AND THEN THE BEEF FAT.  

429
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,145
AND IT'S ALL BOILED UP          
   INSIDE A STOMACH.            
         INSIDE A SHEEP STOMACH.

430
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:30,081
TRADITIONALLY, THAT'S HOW       
 IT WOULD BE DONE, YEAH.        

431
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,083
           WE'RE NOT GONNA DO IT
          TRADITIONALLY THAT WAY

432
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:34,085
    BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE
         THE SHEEP STOMACH,     

433
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:36,087
        AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE
           THE LUNG BECAUSE...  
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO            
     IN THE U.S.                

434
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:38,956
          WE'RE JUST SO TIGHT   
      ON THOSE RULES, AREN'T WE?

435
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:41,893
             WHY DO YOU PUT THIS
                ON THE MENU?    
MY DAD'S SIDE OF THE FAMILY     
     ARE ALL SCOTTISH,          

436
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:44,495
SO IT'S A VERY TRADITIONAL      
      SCOTTISH DISH.            

437
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,363
             LET'S GO, SO LIVER,
               HEART, TONGUE.   

438
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,299
      ABSOLUTELY.               
ALL CHOPPED UP NEATLY.          

439
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,768
THE HEART AND THE TONGUE        
ARE GONNA GET BOILED AWAY       

440
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,369
FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES,           

441
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,906
THEN WE'RE GONNA PUT THE LIVER  
   IN FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES.     

442
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,841
      NOW WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD  
    AND ADD SOME FLAVOR TO THIS?

443
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,910
YEAH, WE'RE GONNA               
 PUT ONIONS IN.                 

444
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,911
               YOU COULDN'T PUT 
               ENOUGH ONIONS IN.

445
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,913
SO NOW THAT THIS IS ALL         
    COOKED THROUGH,             

446
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:04,915
WE WANT TO STRAIN               
   IT ALL OFF.                  

447
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:07,918
      A LITTLE OF THE BEEF SUET,
       A LITTLE OF THE BEEF FAT.
YEAH.                           

448
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,520
AND A LITTLE LAYERED EFFECT,    

449
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,522
A BIT OF AN ORGAN LASAGNA       
       ON THE GO.               

450
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,591
                           WHEW.

451
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,593
PUNGENT.                        
                      YEAH. NOW?

452
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:18,663
ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE JUST GONNA  
  RESERVE SOME OF THE STOCK,    

453
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:21,566
AND THEN WE CAN USE THAT        
 TO MOISTEN IT UP LATER.        

454
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,871
AND THAT'S READY                
  FOR GRINDING.                 

455
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:29,407
                  I CAN DO THIS,
                  I CAN DO THIS.
MIND OVER MATTER.               

456
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:32,476
                    SMALL MIND, 
                  LOT OF MATTER.
LET'S GRIND IT UP.              

457
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:35,346
AND THERE SHE BLOWS.            
              NO, THAT'LL BE ME.

458
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,348
       THE NEXT STEP            
IS WE'RE GONNA MIX THIS UP      

459
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,883
WITH ALL OUR DRY INGREDIENTS.   

460
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,885
WE'VE GOT SOME OATS             
 THAT GET ROASTED,              

461
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,554
AND WE HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH       
  OF HERBS AND SPICES--         

462
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,823
ROSEMARY, WE'RE GONNA ADD       
A BUNCH OF THYME INTO IT,       

463
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,225
TARRAGON, PAPRIKA,              
  CAYENNE PEPPER,               

464
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:51,162
 A LITTLE CUMIN GOING DOWN,     
SALT AND GROUND BLACK PEPPER.   

465
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,097
GONNA GIVE IT A GOOD MIX UP,    

466
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,832
  AND THEN WE ADD IN            
THE GROUND ORGAN MEAT.          

467
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,834
SO NOW WE COVER IT WITH         
   THE ALUMINUM FOIL            

468
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:59,637
AND BAKE IT OFF AT 350          
     FOR 2 HOURS.               

469
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,639
                  READY TO ROCK.
ALL RIGHT, SO THIS              
CAME OUT THE OVEN.              

470
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,641
UNVEILED. WE'RE GONNA           
TAKE A GOOD PORTION,            

471
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,711
WE'RE GONNA CREATE              
A NICE LITTLE, UH--             
                DON'T--YOU KNOW,
                  I HAD A BIG-- 

472
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,913
              I HAD A BIG LUNCH.

473
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:10,848
GOES INTO THE SEASON            
   DREDGING FLOUR,              

474
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,651
  GONNA COME ACROSS INTO        
OUR BATTER, GIVE IT A SPIN.     

475
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,119
JUST GET THE BATTER             
 NICE AND CRISPY.               

476
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:19,456
       THERE IS NO WAY YOU COULD
      EVER FRY THAT LONG ENOUGH.

477
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,093
WE'RE THERE NOW. GIVE YOU       
THE STRAIGHT-UP VERSION.        
                    HERE WE ARE.

478
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:30,601
I'LL DO THE TALKING BIT--       

479
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,337
MMM, THAT WAS                   
 DELICIOUS.                     

480
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,606
THAT WAS MONEY.                 

481
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,808
       I MEAN, TO BE VERY HONEST
               ABOUT IT,        

482
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,810
             THIS IS BROKEN DOWN
              SO THERE'S ALMOST 

483
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,812
          NO RECOGNIZING ANY    
      OF THE ORGAN MEAT TEXTURE.

484
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,213
                  THERE IS GOOD 
                SEASONING TO IT.

485
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,349
     IS IT AS CRAZY AND SCARY   
   AS I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE?

486
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:48,685
          NO. UM, WILL IT BE FUN
          TO HAVE HUNTER TRY IT?

487
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,687
                    YES. HUNTER!

488
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,689

         IT'S A SCOTTISH        
            McNUGGET.

        FOR A VENTRICLE.

       WHAT DO YOU THINK?       
            AWESOME?            

491
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,032

              WOW.

 IN THE WINDOW.                 

493
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,569
    THIS IS JUST LIKE PERFECT   
      THROUGH AND THROUGH.      

494
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,370

          FLAVOR TO IT.

00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,773
          SORT OF GOT THIS SPICY
           SAVORY FLAVOR TO IT.
