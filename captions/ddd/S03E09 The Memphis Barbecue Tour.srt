197
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,282
          I DON'T KNOW          
        WHAT CUT IT IS.         
IT'S A CUT FROM THE LOIN.       

198
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:41,553
   ST. LOUIS-STYLE              
BUTTON BONE RIB TIPS.           
                  I'LL HAVE TO  
                WRITE THAT DOWN.

199
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,955
SO THIS IS THE LOIN             
AND THIS IS THE RIB.            

200
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:47,225
WHERE IS THIS TIP               
  COMING FROM?                  
            IT'S SHAVED RIGHT   
         ON THE TOP AT AN ANGLE.

201
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,694
I LIKE IT. YOU GET THESE        
   SPECIALLY CUT THEN?          

202
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,296
          IT'S NOT EASY TO GET. 

203
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,098
                   IT'S NOT VERY
                    EASY TO GET.
YOU GOTTA KNOW SOMEBODY.        

204
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:57,035
SO NOW TO SEASON IT. NOW HOW    
DO PEOPLE TAKE TO THIS IDEA     

205
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,304
OF DOING--TAKING BARBECUE       
 AND KIND OF TWEAKING IT        

206
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,440
A LITTLE BIT AND THROWING       
   A GREEK SPIN ON IT?          
              IT'S BEEN WORKING.

207
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,909
         WE START OFF WITH A CUP
            OF SEASONING SALT.  
OKAY.                           

208
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,978
REGULAR SALT.                   
                 WE NEED PLENTY 
               OF THYME IN THIS.

209
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,513
                   LIKE I SAID, 

210
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,715
       THIS IS A GREEK-STYLE RUB
          THAT WE'RE MAKING.    

211
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,784
                  CHILI POWDER, 
                 GROUND OREGANO.

212
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:16,988
SO WE REALLY<i> DO</i> TAKE IT         
INTO THE GREEK FACTOR.          
                YES, SIR.       
          WE GOT PICKLING SPICE.

213
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:20,525
THAT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING       
 I HAVEN'T SEEN IN RUBS.        
                 IT'S A BIG     
           MEDITERRANEAN THING. 

214
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,326
                    CELERY SALT.
I LIKE IT.                      

215
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:25,330
           GOT SOME CELERY SALT.
A LITTLE SWEETNESS, AS WELL     
 AS A LITTLE SALT FACTOR.       

216
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:27,865
         WE GOT SOME PAPRIKA.   
       WE GOT SOME GARLIC SALT. 

217
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,801
         WE GOT SOME RED PEPPER,
         AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, 

218
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:33,471
            WE GOT SOME NUTMEG  
          AND SOME BLACK PEPPER.
OKAY, MIX IT UP,                
  GOOD TO GO?                   

219
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,740
GREAT COLORS.                   
           THAT'S MEDITERRANEAN.

220
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,676
   WE DON'T LIKE TO USE IT RIGHT
    AWAY. WE LIKE TO LET IT SIT.
LET IT SIT AND MARRY            
    A LITTLE BIT?               

221
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,611
YEAH.                           
           MARINATE A LITTLE BIT
                 TOGETHER.      

222
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,947
       WE USE IT ON THE BOLOGNA,
          THE PORK SHOULDER,    

223
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,683
           THE BEEF BRISKET.    
      WE DO IT ON THE CHICKEN...

224
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,752
      <i> AND THE SPARE RIBS,</i>      
          <i> BABY BACKS,</i>          

225
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,689
       <i> SMOKED TURKEY LEGS</i>      
      <i> AND THOSE RIB TIPS.</i>      

226
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:54,091
JUST THE DRY SEASONING          
       ON TOP?                  
              WE WANT TO KEEP IT
                A LITTLE MOIST, 

227
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,227
             SO WE JUST ADD     
         A LITTLE BIT OF WATER. 

228
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:58,162
                 TAKE THE RUB...
OKAY.                           

229
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,832
 JUST ENOUGH TO THROW           
A LITTLE FLAVOR ON IT?          
                        EXACTLY.

230
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,768
     WE DON'T WANT IT TOO SPICY,
      'CAUSE IT'LL DRY IT OUT.  

231
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,370
             BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? 

232
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,505
   A LOT OF PEOPLE COME IN HERE,
    AND EVEN AFTER WE COOK 'EM, 

233
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,507
            THEY WANT US TO PUT 
           THE RUB ON TOP OF IT.
REALLY?                         

234
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:12,977
NOW THIS IS GONNA MARINATE      
  FOR ANOTHER 24 HOURS?         
              THIS WILL MARINATE
                FOR 24 HOURS.   

235
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:16,247
LET'S PUT IT NIGHT-NIGHT.       
    THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.           
                OPEN THE PIT UP,

236
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,983
                   THROW 'EM ON.
YOU KNOW THAT'S                 
 A HOT GRILL.                   

237
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,519
   NOW HOW LONG DOES            
IT TAKE TO COOK THESE?          

238
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,655
             AN HOUR AND A HALF,
                  TWO HOURS.    
LOOK AT THAT.                   

239
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,856
NOW IS THERE AN ART             
  TO DOING THIS?                

240
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,591
        JUST PICK OUT THE BONE. 

241
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,995
MMM. IT'S SUPER TENDER.         

242
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,263
                 IT'S NOT A RIB.
IT'S NOT RIB MEAT.              

243
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,432
                             NO.
IT'S LOIN MEAT WITH RIB.        
      GREAT SPICE.              

244
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,802

                          GREAT.
