And I told my wife about it,    
and she just about died.        

114
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,077
           They showed it to me,
   and I couldn't stop laughing.

115
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,946
       And then, other customers
           in the restaurant    

116
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,014
  came over and looked, and they
         couldn't stop laughing.

117
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:45,350
     I gotta tell you, Cody,    
      you crushed it, bro,      

118
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,552
      and when you guys get     
      a chance to go there,     

119
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,553
         if you haven't         
        been up to Juneau       

120
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,289
      and you haven't come      
         to V's Cellar,         

121
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:53,291
        it's restaurant,        
      it show, it's energy,     

122
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:56,761
          and a lot of          
      really excited fans.      

123
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,563
Okay, Korean short ribs.        

124
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,098
   Bowl of pozole.              

125
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,233
      Let's go!                 

126
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,334
   When you first hear          
"Mexican-Korean fusion,"        

127
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,969
      you're like,              
"Oh, like, I don't know."       

128
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,438
      And then,                 
 my mind was blown.             

129
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,439
           Tinga fusion burrito.

130
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,242
          WOMAN: Everything here
             is really fresh.   

131
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:11,910
              The flavors go    
           really well together.

132
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,378
          It's always enjoyable.

133
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:14,780
       GUY: The good times      
          come courtesy         

134
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,315
   of Chef Venietia Santana...  

135
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,382
            Order up!           

136
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,983
              GUY:              
    ...a Sicilian Irish chef    

137
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,853
      who ended up tackling     
      Asian-Mexican flavor.     

138
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23,621
  My ex-husband is              
  from Mexico City,             

139
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,257
and we would go there,          
and the food was amazing.       

140
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,726
It's just a really good         
feeling being around V.         

141
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,529
She's got so much energy,       
    so much attitude,           

142
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,864
and it really shines through    
each dish that she makes.       

143
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:33,998
            What's your favorite
             thing on the menu? 

144
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:35,533
WOMAN: It would have to be      
    the fusion nachos.          

145
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,669
         Korean chicken         
          fusion nacho.         

146
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,338
  WOMAN: There's melted cheddar 
   cheese and Korean chicken,   

147
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:42,206
         and there's her        
          fusion sauce.         

148
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,742
      Everything in a nacho     
       that you could want      

149
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,210
   but never knew you wanted.   

150
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,678
      GUY: Let's get into it, V.
             What are we making?

151
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:49,481
Korean chicken that's           
   gonna go on top              

152
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,416
of our Korean chicken           
   fusion nachos.               

153
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,151
     Chop up our                
   chicken thighs.              

154
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,286
             Next up, marinade. 

155
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:57,756
Ginger, green onions,           
 pear, sesame seeds,            

156
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,691
 garlic, soy sauce.             

157
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,626
                  Sesame oil.   
    Good job, Dad.              

158
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,694
                 Thank you.     

159
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,296
    Brown sugar,                
    sweet onions.               

160
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,631
          And gochujang --      
     my favorite Korean ketchup.

161
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,032
         How long's this chicken
             gonna marinade?    

162
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:09,301
   15, 20 minutes.              

163
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:10,635
                 Next up, V.    
               What do we got?  

164
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:11,969
  Our fusion sauce.             

165
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,238
            Soy and brown sugar,
                 gochujang.     

166
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:17,509
     Sesame oil,                
 rice wine vinegar.             

167
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:18,577
                   Hunter.      

168
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:22,514
                     ♪♪         

169
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,182
         Oh, yeah, I'd have that
             on cold cereal.    

170
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,850
   I would take a cup of that   
          with a straw,         

171
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,318
                 Let's build    
                these nachos.   

172
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:29,087
     We're gonna                
 saute the chicken.             

173
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,388
 Little bit of salt             
     and pepper.                

174
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:33,925
    Chips, beans,               
  and then cheese.              

175
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,326
   Do that again.               

176
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,795
      What happens when the rest
 of the people are ordering food

177
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,397
             and we're spending 
               all day making   

178
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,131
           Magic Nacho Mountain?

179
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,134
 Well, I'm a woman,             
 so I can multitask.            

180
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,335
                      Got it.   
              Ooh.              

181
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,470
We're gonna put this            
    in the oven.                

182
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,071
Cilantro-onion relish,          

183
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,073
      tomatoes,                 
   Korean chicken.              

184
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,142
      I'm gonna go with the idea

185
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,276
            that the plate might
               be a bit small.  

186
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:55,547
Guacamole, sour cream,          
     fusion sauce.              

187
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,750
    So, if you want to get this,
 order on a Thursday for Sunday.

188
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,818
    Sesame seeds.               

189
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,619
   This is the salsa            
that's served with it.          

190
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:02,554
                    And?        

191
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,023
   And a partridge              
   in a pear tree.              

192
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,057
Would you like a fork?          

193
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,091
        Can't eat nachos        
          with a fork.          

194
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,294
            You can't eat nachos
                with a fork.    

195
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:11,429
           You were putting     
       so many flavors together,

196
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:12,630
          I was a bit worried...

197
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,165
Say good.                       
                ...they were    
               gonna compete.   

198
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:15,700
               They're playing  
               well together.   

199
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:17,836
            This is like a      
       multicultural playground,

200
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,938
            and there's a lot of
       different games going on.

201
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:24,175
            That right there was
            dodgeball-hopscotch.

202
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,510
                      [ Laughs ]
              Mmm.              

203
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:27,646
             When you look up   
           Mexican-Korean fusion

204
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,048
      in the Flavortown library,

205
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,050
             that's the picture 
                 you'll see.    

206
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,784
          Four minutes          
         on the chicken!        

207
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:35,720
                We get nachos   
             about once a week, 

208
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,656
             so all the goodness
             that goes with it. 

209
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,858
   Nachos with a fork?          
Is that legal in Juneau?        

210
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,459
              I don't know,     
         but the problem is that

211
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,528
             I want to put more 
             of this in my mouth

212
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,730
                    than I can  
                  with my hands.
    Okay, okay.                 

213
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:46,731
SANTANA: Nice and neat.         

214
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:47,666
We eat with our eyes            

215
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,933
  way before we eat             
  with our mouths.              

216
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,268
             Everything is made 
                 with love,     

217
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,603
    and that's one of the things
     I love about the food here.

218
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,073
    If I had my way, I would    
    simply order one of each,   

219
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,576
  put it on the table, and eat  
    off of everybody's plate.   

220
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,344
   Congratulations on winning!  

221
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,147
       Congratulations on       
          1,000 bucks!          

222

Let's get started.              
          Hawaiian octopus.     

1207
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:18,214
                First, we're    
               gonna clean it.  

1208
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:19,282
                So, a little    
             Hawaiian sea salt, 

1209
00:40:19,284 --> 00:40:20,549
              'cause that just  
            takes off the slime.

1210
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,819
          Just give them a rinse
          with some fresh water.

1211
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:23,887
   How long are we              
    gonna simmer?               

1212
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:26,890
              One hour with one 
             can of local beer.

1217
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:33,830
                and they cook   
               really quickly.  

1218
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:34,898

1225
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:44,841
               And give that    
               a quick stir.    
     Okay.                      

1226
