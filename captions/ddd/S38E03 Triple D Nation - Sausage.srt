    -Okay, 2 hours? How long?   
           -Two hours.          

114
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,058
         You want me to         
      stand here and guard?     

115
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,261
          I'm with you.         

116
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:25,931
        I just remembered       
     that experience of you     
    bringing the hotdogs out.   

117
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:26,598
           Holy Moly!           

118
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,801
       That is so awesome.      

119
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,670
          -How long in          
       the hot water for?       
        -Fifteen minutes.       

120
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,938
    Just to get the internal    
       temperature to 155.      

121
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,606
     Meet<i> chiquita</i> bananas.     

122
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,875
     -And then you put them     
       in the cold waters.      
   -Chill them off real quick.  

123
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,344
      So, this is done and      
         ready to rock?         

124
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:40,545
    -Done and ready to rock.    
             -Okay.             

125
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,114
         -That's a snap.        
              -Oh.              

126
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,150
     Tender, creamy, juicy.     

127
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,419
       Right to the grill.      
         Just enough to         
     give it a little mark.     

128
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:51,289
        I saw everything        
       that went in there.      

129
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,325
 That's as real as you can get. 
          You the man.          

130
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,296
      You folks are making      
        the legit grits.        

131
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,365
      What's the number one     
        selling sausage?        
         Still the same?        

132
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,301
        -[man] Hot dogs.        
    -[woman] And pepperonis.    

133
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,038
     Oh, the pepperoni here     
          is excellent.         

134
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,706
     We never have a problem    
         eating it all.         

135
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:12,110
  People love to get 10 stick,  
           20 sticks,           

136
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,445
        a hundred sticks.       

137
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,446
         Pork pig neck,         

138
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,647
         cayenne pepper,        

139
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,648
         ground pepper,         
        a little garlic,        

140
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:18,917
        red pepper flakes       

141
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,285
        and curing salt.        

142
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:24,323
     Now, we're gonna put it    
         in the stuffer.        

143
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:27,459
  -[Guy] In the Turbo Max 9000? 
     -In the Turbo Max 9000.    

144
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,394
  Probably not the exact words  
         but it's close.        

145
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:30,462
 [chuckling] This guy kills me. 

146
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:36,068
    Now we are going to take    
    these pepperoni sticks in   
  the smoke house for 2 hours.  

147
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:40,738
     Take them out, put them    
     in a hot water bath at     
     160 degrees for 1 hour.    

148
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,208
   And then, we will put them   
      in a cold water bath      

149
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,076
 to get their temperature down. 

150
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,345
      We'll take it out and     
       it's ready to eat.       

151
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,748
         I don't want to        
        like this, okay?        

152
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,616
         This only says,        
        "trouble" for me.       

153
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,951
           Fantastic.           
        How many of these       
         we make a week?        

154
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,487
        [laughing] A lot.       

155
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:56,388
      These are dynamites.      

156
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,158
  Here's your pepperoni sticks. 

157
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,360
        The pepperoni is        
   one of my favorite things.   

158
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:03,694
    Perfect amount of crunch.   

159
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,830
     When you bite into it,     
      you get a nice snap.      

160
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,566
         Not too spicy.         

161
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:10,335
     Smells really good when    
       they take it out of      
         the smoker too.        

162
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,573
           All right,           
     so give me the rundown.    

163
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:16,808
    Tell me where things are.   

164
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,044
     Seems like everything's    
       pretty much stayed       
         the same here.         

165
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,180
     Still the same volume?     
       or more volume from      
        back in the day?        

166
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,115
     We expected a big hit.     

167
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,517
    And all heck broke loose.   

168
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,719
        We couldn't make        
      sausages fast enough.     

169
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,721
      That's 11 years ago.      

170
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,124
     -Hasn't stopped since.     
         -That's great.         

171
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,728
    [narrator] And coming up,   
   time is really flying by...  

172
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,329
    Fifth generation actually   
     starting to work here?     

173
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,931
              -Yup.             
         -That's crazy.         

174
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,401
   [narrator] Plus, a sandwich  
       taking me way back.      

175
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,602
       My favorite thing,       
    since I was a little kid.   

176
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,471
  How I missed this last time,  
      it's all your fault.      

177
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,676
    [narrator] Back in 2009,    

178
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:56,047
    I went to this family-run   
        meat emporium for       
        a Triple D first.       

179
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,549
        One of the things       
        we've never seen,       

180
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,417
         something that         
     we all love and admire,    

181
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,886
        the kid pleasing,       

182
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:02,354
          grill loving,         

183
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:03,754
      old fashioned hotdog.     

184
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,423
    So that brings us here to   
        Portland, Oregon,       

185
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:08,393
    to the fourth generation    
   sausage kitchen, at Otto's.  

186
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,232
      So, who had the baby?     

187
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,568
    -How old is the baby now?   
            -Eleven.            

188
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,703
   -Do we have any other kids   
        working here yet?       
              -Yup.             

189
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,172
   -So, we have 5th generation  
     starting to work here?     
              -Yup.             

190
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,374
         -That's crazy.         
              -Yup.             

191
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:25,443
        I've never seen a       
     more close-knit family.    

192
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,379
      They're all involved,     
          all the time.         

193
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,249
      Everything they make      
          is wonderful.         

194
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:34,119
       They basically have      
      any kind of deli meat     
        that you'd want.        

195
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:38,122
         Everything from        
     the hard stuff to find     
       to just the basics.      

196
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,991
         Okay, pastrami.        

197
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:43,061
   -Give me the rundown here.   
   -We've got the bottom round  
  trimmed off a bit of the fat. 

198
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,264
 We're going to mix it in salt, 
        nitrate solution.       

199
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,333
    Take our pickling spice,    
     mustard seeds, peppers.    

200
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:52,003
        Some peppercorns,       
      you've got some herbs     
      in there, coriander.      

201
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,872
   How long are we gonna leave  
       this rub on there?       

202
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,673
          -Three weeks.         
            -Really?            

203
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:58,477
  -The curing process is done.  
   -We'll just rinse her off.   

204
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,678
        -[Guy] Over here.       
    -Then we're going to take   
    our coarse black pepper.    

205
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,280
        [Guy] You pack it       
     in there a little bit.     

206
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:03,882
         -It looks like         
        it's ready to go.       
             -Yeah.             

207
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,817
  [Guy] And now we're going to  
    put these in the smoker?    

208
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,087
     -They've been in there     
           overnight.           
              -Wow.             

209
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,655
    -Now, we're just gonna...   
      -Do you have to talk?     

210
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,158
  Just look at it for a second. 

211
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:18,964
      -Open up the hot tub.     
      Just lay it in there.     
 -For about 3 and a half hours. 

212
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,899
    [Guy] Wow, look at that.    

213
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,434
         -[Guy laughing]        
           -Think he's          
      running off with it.      

214
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,836
    -So you hand in the meat    
           and me off?          
        -Handing it off.        

215
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:27,972
       We're going to make      
  a pastrami sandwich for you.  

216
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,707
     -Do you like pastrami?     
            -Uh-huh.            

217
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,576
  -You like a lot of pastrami?  
            -Uh-huh.            

218
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,244
       [Gretchen] This is       
    melt-in-your-mouth good.    

219
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,180
      There you are. Ready?     

220
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,584
        That is awesome.        
     That's killer pastrami.    

221
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,920
    All thriller, no filler.    

222
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:44,256
           Now we have          
     the Guy Fieri sandwich,    

223
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,958
         with rye bread,        
      mustard and pastrami.     

224
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:48,927
       It's a top seller.       

225
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:54,265
     Otto's has all kind of     
       sandwiches that are      
     homemade and delicious.    

226
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,267
        Orchard sandwich        
         is my favorite.        

227
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,470
         The Orchard is         
     the community sandwich     

228
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,138
   that the whole area loves.   

229
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,007
  This is what everybody loves, 
     so give me the rundown.    

230
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,009
         -What's in it?         
  -So, it's got honey mustard,  

231
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,811
      Granny Smith apples,      
       our hunter sausage.      

232
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,014
      The hunter sausage is     
       boneless bull meat,      

233
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:10,615
  pork cheeks, mustard powder,  

234
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,149
      paprika, fine pepper,     

235
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,818
     coriander, ground mace,    

236
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,921
       ground celery seed       
      and our curing salt.      

237
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,358
       We are going to add      
        some pork loins,        

238
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,627
  garlic powder and turn it on. 

239
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,297
      The hunter sausage is     
      a bigger sized salami     

240
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:29,034
  that we'll slice deli-style.  

241
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:32,704
    -We use havarti cheese...   
   -Was this one the menu when  
    I was here the last time?   

242
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,372
              -Yes.             
   -This has always been here?  

243
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,908
         -I missed this         
    the last time I was here?   
            -Uh-huh.            

244
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,377
   Okay, so I'm gonna tell you  
      something very funny      
           about this.          

245
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,579
    Let me take a bit first.    

246
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,448
      Outstanding sandwich.     

247
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:47,118
           All right,           
    since I was a little kid,   

248
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:51,922
  my favorite thing was to eat  
       sliced green apple       
           and salami.          

249
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:55,326
  So, the fact that you make a  
   sandwich with my favorite,   
     which is honey mustard,    

250
00:09:55,328 --> 00:10:00,198
  and you put green apples and  
 the salami that you guys make, 
       the hunter sausage.      

251
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,300
 How'd I miss it the last time? 
      It's all your fault.      

252
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,208
     The sausage is amazing,    
    and you get plenty of it.   

253
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,144
 A little tang, a little sweet, 
 and a little tart of the meat, 

254
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,879
       that was just like       
     an instant hit with me.    

255
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,614
         The sausage is         
        my favorite part.       

256
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,684
 It's got that burst of flavors 
     but it's not too heavy.    

257
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,053
    And then the apple crunch   
   at the finish is delicious.  

258
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,090
        Every time I'm on       
     this side of the town,     

259
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,226
          I stock it up         
        and take it home.       

260
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:32,097
  Do you ever mail or send food 
    to California, to people    
    that've done shows here?    

261
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,899
  [woman] I guess we will now.  

262
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,635
      I mean, I don't know      
      where that came from?     

263
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,836
       For a while there,       
  every time around Christmas,  

264
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:42,306
     a little jerky package,    
       which got, somehow,      
    somebody lost my address.   

265
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,775
    I'm gonna get them there.   

266
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:48,413
        Oh, we're getting       
   our FedEx number organized   
   real quick before I leave.   

267
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,385
      [narrator] Coming up,     
        a soul food spot        
        in Oklahoma City.       

268
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:57,255
          Off the hook          
     in the culinary church.    

269
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,056

    their fans everything...

        [woman] Oxtails.        

271
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,392
  [narrator] from head to toe.  

272
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,429
     -The hoof is the best.     
   -It is melt-in-your-mouth.   

273
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,968
    [narrator] Back in 2009,    
         I found myself         
       in a familiar spot.      

274
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,238
    Couple of years ago, when   
    we were cruising Triple D   
     through Oklahoma City,     

275
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,973
       we had a chance to       
    eat some killer barbecue    

276
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,375
   at this place called Leo's.  

277
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:21,179
     Now, believe it or not,    
  right across the intersection 
           from Leo's,          

278
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:25,049
     is another great place,    
    serving up 3 generations    
          of soul food.         

279
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,986
  And they're still dishing up  
       the same classics.       

280
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,521
     It's time to check out     
            Mama E's.           

281
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,390

     <i> ♪ Will make you see ♪</i>     

283
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,199
   Triple D showed everybody,   

284
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,800
        what a phenomenal       
        restaurant it is,       

285
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,937
        and if he didn't        
      know about it before,     
    he needs me on your list.   

286
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:49,940
           Mama E's is          
       one of the greatest      
      soul food restaurants     

287

     that you will ever find    
     in these United States.    

288
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:56,147
         This is Grandma        
     inside of a restaurant.

292
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,557
          -Now this is          
     your grandson, correct?    
      -That's my grandson.      

293
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,025
    Not only rockin' it here,   

294
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,161
    -but he's a pastor across

    -That so beats my record.   

299
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,840
        When Guy was here       
         the last time,         
        he had pig feet.        

300
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,109
       I don't think he's       
      ever had a pig hoof.      

301
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:28,246
     -I don't know that I've    
  ever got down with the hoof.  
     -The hoof is the best.

           -[laughing]          
       -Hmm. Oh, I got it.

    That's one of our staples   
        in the community,       
      the black community.

       -Gimme a high hoof.      
   -Yeah, high hoof. [laughs]   

306
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,726
       [hoots] So, anyhow,      
          water first.          

307

       cracked red peppers      

310

        Oh, I like this.        

311
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,669
     -Mama E's secret blend.    
        -You're not gonna       
      tell me what that is?     

312
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:53,304
  -Can't tell you what that is. 
       -Hang on a second.       

313
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,875
         Let me ask you         
     if this is what it is.

 He's good with knowing spices.

            -[laughs]           
           -High hoof.          

318
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,550
          Black pepper,         
   added the vinegar to this.   

319
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,819
      Vinegar's gonna take      
     some of that swiny out.    

320
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,554
      -Wait, wait, wait...      
   -Did I say swiny? [laughs]   

321
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,022
        [Guy] Wrap it up.       
        Hour and a half.        

322
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,959
  Hour and a half. Pullin' 'em  
        out of the oven.        
     Pull that off of there.    

323
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,629
  [Guy] Make sure you'll get me 
   an al dente tape pig feet.   

324
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:22,634
  If you've never had pig feet, 
    you might not understand    
         pig feet, okay?        

325
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:26,871
  -So, that looks like a ratio  
  of, like, 50% fat, 50% meat.  
    -Fat and meat. That's it.   

326
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,174
        Mm, really good.        

327
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:33,911
  The flavor's money. But then, 
     the fat is like butter.    

328
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,181
    We still serve pig feet.    
  We serve 'em every Thursday,  
      and they sell great.      

329
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,050
   It melts in your mouth. Mm.  

330

     [upbeat music playing]     

331
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:44,455
         They have a lot        
   of different types of meat.  

332
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:47,992
     <i> Pig feet, neck bones,</i>     
     <i> the fried chicken...</i>      

333
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:51,663
       If you like to eat,      
     you will find something    
      that you will enjoy.      

334
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:54,933
   We have different entrees,   
   and those change out daily.  

335
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,334
  <i> Thursday, we have pig feet.</i>  

336
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,736
      <i> Mainly on Fridays,</i>       
     <i> we do these oxtails.</i>      

337
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,605
      And this is our take      
           on oxtails.          

338
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:04,008
 <i> White pepper, seasoning salt,</i> 
  <i> soy sauce, a little garlic.</i>  

339
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,878
 Get the flavor's all on there, 
    we marinate it real good.   

340
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,813
  Drop 'em into the hot butter, 
    allow them to get a sear.   

341
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:12,016
    You don't wanna cook 'em,   
          you just want         
       a nice sear on 'em.      

342
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,819
   If you cook them too fast,   
     they're gonna be tough.    

343
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:19,090
      We're gonna start now     
    with carrots, red onions,   
    celery, and white onions,   

344
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:23,094
   then we're gonna add green   
  bell peppers, minced garlic,  
    chicken base, beef base,    

345
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:26,097
    a little seasoning salt,    
       Italian seasoning,       
          wheat basil,          

346
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,698
  parsley, a little red wine... 

347
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,501
        Once you ger 'em        
  a little tender, you can add  
      just a little water,      

348
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,102
     that'll glaze your pan.    

349
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:35,640
  Now that our stock is ready,  
       we're gonna load it      
     on top of the oxtails,     

350
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,509
    come back with that wine,   
      then we're gonna add      
        your bay leaves.        

351
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:41,913
        Them we're gonna        
       cover it in water,       
       wrap them in foil,       

352
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:44,381
       and we're gonna let      
        the magic happen.       

353
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,050
        Now, we're gonna        
     show you the goodness.     

354
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,919
        After we finish,        
    we put that juice there.    

355
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:52,457
          And those are         
      oxtails at Mama E's.      

356
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,692
        [waitress] Here's       
  your oxtails with three sides 
       and a dinner roll.       

357
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:58,062
        The oxtails, man,       
     it was one of the most     
      absolute tender meat,     

358
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,065
      like, perfect cooked,     
       seasoned perfectly.      

359
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:05,536
        It's super juicy,       
   it just falls off the bone,  
         it's delicious.

365
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,818
     You heard my local boy.    
    You know, nobody knew me,   
    but now, hey, guess what?   

366
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:24,889
  This show took me to a status 
   where a lot of people come   
   and say, "Hey, I know you."  

367
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,891
       [Guy] And they know      
         his fried ribs.        

368
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,961
     They start out looking     
       like this and then,      
 they end up looking like that. 

369
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:32,430
         We can make 'em        
    marinade and the dredge.    

370
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,632
         And basically,         
      the same ingredients      
           go in both.          

371
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,301
   [man] We'll add the cumin,

         barbecue spice,        

372

374
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,174
          Then we have

375
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,176

     a couple cups of water,    

376
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,045
   then we cut all of the ribs

    Comes three to an order.    

379
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,853

        this was probably       
        one of the first        
       ethnic restaurants       

435
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:53,737
     that they ever came to.    

436
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,339
    <i> That was 12 years ago.</i>     

437
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:57,375
    <i> My husband still here.</i>     
        <i> I'm still here.</i>        

438
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,010
     <i> Alfred's still here?</i>      

439
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,312
    Alfred is our main chef.    

440
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:02,947
       He's the early man.      

441
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,216
         He starts here         
     at 5:30 every morning.     

442
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,351
  So, Alfred, you're in charge? 

443
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,154
     They work hard. I mean,    
      this is hard to make      
         all this food.         

444
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:13,023
        When you come in.       
       If you like spicy,       
    if you don't like spicy,    

445
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,792
     <i> there's a little bit</i>      
         <i> of everything</i>         
      <i> for everyone here.</i>       

446
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,428
    I gotta tell you, Alfred,   

447
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:21,032
     this is the most unique    
    layout of food I've seen.   

448
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,366
        -[Alfred] Really?       
        -[Guy] Oh, yeah.        

449
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,101
        The never-ending        
          pot symphony.         

450
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,136
   [Cheryl] Pork and Ham choy.  

451
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:27,271
               Mm.              

452
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,673
        That's a pigtail.       

453
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:29,807
            Pigtail.            

454
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:31,909
           Very nice.           

455
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,310
          Oxtail stew?          

456
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:34,846
     This looks outstanding.    

457
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:35,913
               Mm.              

458
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,114
          That's sour.          

459
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,117
   We also have a combination,  
  curry goat and curry oxtail.  

460
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,252
     -We have curry oxtail?     
             -We do.            

461
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:43,988
               Mm.              

462
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,656
   This I could get goin' on.   

463
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,792
       Curry goat, oxtail,      
    jerk chicken, jerk pork.    

464
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:52,196
    Those are heavier dishes,   
      a bit heavier dishes,     

465
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,598
 and we also have lighter fare, 

466
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,734
        like the cabbage        
          and saltfish.         

467
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,670
    The cabbage and saltfish    
           is amazin'.          

468
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,205
 It's one of our favorite dish. 

469
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,941
    We'll start with garlic,    
      scotch bonnet pepper,     

470
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,009
           and butter.          

471
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:09,280
       Scallions, onions,       
          some tomatoes         
        and black pepper.       

472
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,282
         Now we're gonna        
      put in the saltfish.      

473
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:13,817
      We boil the cod twice     
      to get the salt out,      

474
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,353
      and then we shred it.     

475
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,288
       And now we're ready      
        for the cabbage.        

476
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,555
          Is this time?         

477
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,258
        Yeah, we're gonna       
    let this cook for another   
          four minutes,         

478
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,361
  and then it's ready to serve. 

479
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,596
         And this is our        
      cabbage and saltfish.     

480
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,435
  Full of flavor, it's creamy,  
    a little bit of richness.   

481
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,739
      It was very peppery,      
 and garlic was really complex. 

482
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,841
    [man]<i> It's so authentic,</i>    

483
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,711
       the food is so true      
      to Jamaican culture.      

484
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,114
       [man]<i> Jamaican food</i>      
      <i> is a lot of spices</i>       

485
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,049
       and flavors you've       
      never tasted before.      

486
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,385
      Jamaican food doesn't     
        have to be spicy,       

487
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:50,588
        <i> but when it is,</i>        
     <i> it's so much better.</i>      

488
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,590
        Don't be a wuss,        
       get a super spicy.       

489
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,192
       -Gimme super spicy!      
          -Super spicy.         

490
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,260
         That's got like        
        45 peppers in it.       

491
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,862
        That's fantastic.       

492
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,396
        And in the little       
         red dots mean?         

493
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,232
         -Four red dots         
        means super hot.        
         -Means trouble.        

494
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,533
               Mm.              

495
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,535
     Where was I on this...     

496
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,806
       I think Guy met his      
     match there with spicy.    

497
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,275
    45 scotch bonnets in that   
         batch of beef.

499
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:14,845
               Oh!              

500
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:17,248
          That's legit.         

501
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:18,216
               Mm.              

502
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,884
 [Cheryl] Cabbage and saltfish. 

503
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,653
      [man]<i> I have no idea</i>      
   <i> how he found this place.</i>    

504
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:23,553
              Wow.              

505
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,155
        I thought it was        
      our best kept secret,     

506
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,290
    but somehow Guy found it.   

507
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,361
   <i> And, I mean, it's packed.</i>   

508
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,097
    It's packed all the time,   
       but it's worth it.       

509
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,432
       You don't see this

 <i> Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.</i>
