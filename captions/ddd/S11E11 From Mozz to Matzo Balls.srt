    FRESH TAKE ON A CLASSIC.    

205
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,810
   THEY ALWAYS HAVE A SPECIAL   
   INGREDIENT THAT COMPLETES    

206
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,947
 THE DISH, BUT YOU CAN'T QUITE  
     FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS.     

207
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,615

WE CAN'T GET THE KIND OF CHILIES
 THAT THEY USE IN NORTH AFRICA, 

210
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,822
       SO I USE                 
A BLACK PASILLA PEPPER,         

211
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,226
WHICH I TOAST

215
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:24,235
PIQUILLO PEPPER--THE SWEET      
FLAVOR, TOASTED CORIANDER.      

216
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,372
                 YOU GOTTA TOAST
                   YOUR HERBS.

IF THEY'RE NOT TOASTED...       

217
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,908
   YOU JUST DON'T REALLY GET ALL
  THE GREAT FLAVOR THEY POSSESS.

   A LITTLE SPIKE...            

221
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,782
          DUDE, YOU ARE ALL OVER
            THE BOARD ON THIS.

GRIND THIS PUPPY UP.            

223
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,254
           YOU DIDN'T PUT ANY   
        PUPPY IN THERE, DID YOU?
A LITTLE OIL                    
 IN THERE.                      

224
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,789
         IT'S LIKE MAD SCIENTIST
                BACK HERE.      

225
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,725
 ALL RIGHT, LET'S CHECK         
TO SEE IF IT'S BALANCED.        

226
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,794
                             OH.
KIND OF WILD, HUH?              

227
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,863
          KIND OF AWESOME.      
   TALK ABOUT GREAT, BIG FLAVOR.

228
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:55,066
NOW YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A 1, 2, 3,
  4--15-INGREDIENT CHIMICHURRI. 

229
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,736
YEAH. THIS SAUCE                
IS PRETTY ACIDIC.               

230
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:00,805
      CHAMPAGNE VINEGAR,        
SOME LEMON JUICE, DRY OREGANO.  

231
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,541
I'M GONNA PUT A LITTLE          
   GARLIC IN THERE,             

232
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,342
   JALAPEÑOS--                  
GRIND ALL THIS UP.              

233
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,145
SOME ITALIAN FLAT-LEAF PARSLEY  
      AND SOME CILANTRO.        
                       CILANTRO.

234
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:10,882
      I'M A BIG FAN OF THE GREEN
       AND THE GARLIC, THE ACID.

235
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,752
I WANT TO TURN THIS             
ALMOST INTO A PASTE.            

236
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:16,555
 OKAY. CHECK OUT                
THE GREEN IN THAT.              

237
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:19,757
    LET THIS KIND OF STEEP IN   
THE VINEGAR AND THE LEMON JUICE.

238
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,958
YELLOW ONION HERE.              

239
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,094
SO THESE WILL GO IN HERE.       
     FRESH TOMATOES.            

240
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:26,831
  AND NOT DO IT ALL AT ONE TIME,
    OR IT WON'T HOLD THE COLOR. 
RIGHT.                          

241
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,567
                         REALLY?
THIS WILL MAKE IT               
    LIQUID-Y.                   

242
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,968
SEE HOW IT'S HOLDING            
  ITS GREEN COLOR,              

243
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,904
  EVEN THOUGH I PUT             
ALL THAT RED IN THERE?          
                       OH, YEAH.

244
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,906
SALT AND SOME OLIVE OIL,        
    AND, OF COURSE,             

245
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,642
   I HAVE TO TASTE IT           
TO MAKE SURE IT'S RIGHT.        
            I'M IN THIS WITH YA.

246
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:40,511
           MMM. NICE AND BRIGHT 
          AND FRESH AND VIBRANT.

247
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,781
  CHIMICHURRI'S DONE. LAST THING
     TO DO IS THE LAMB BURGER.  

248

250
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,987
        SINCE WE HAVE TWO LITTLE
         PROPANE BURNER STOVES, 

251
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:52,857
           THE MAGIC OVEN--     
     WHERE DOES THIS GET COOKED?

252
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:53,924

OF BLACK PEPPER ON HERE.        

254
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,862
 I'M GONNA RUB IT               
WITH THIS HARISSA.              
             NICE COLOR ON THAT.

    BALANCE EVERYTHING OUT.     

271
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,839
   EVERYTHING HAS WONDERFUL,

306
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:04,656
PUT A LITTLE SEAR

               CONGEALED ENOUGH 

369
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,001
