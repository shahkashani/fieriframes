         Hey, everybody.

00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:03,802
         I'm Guy Fieri,

 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,340
          This trip...          

5
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,741
        If you don't come here, 
      you're totally missing it.

00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:13,011
      ...we're digging into     
      a festival of flavor.     

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,380
                Off the hook.

 In San Francisco, California...

   Now you're getting taco truck

   ...the funky food truck...

              mad ninja skills. 

12
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:25,490
   ...rolling out some Mexican  
   flair with a Filipino flip.  

13
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,092
               That's packing   
                 big flavor.    

14
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:29,227

 Wow. This is great.            

19
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,371
   Then in Portland, Oregon...  

20
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,573
         Dude, I have eaten food
            all over the world.

  ...we're feasting on a first  
    that will blow your mind.   

22
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:45,977
            How have I never had
                    this?       

23
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,446
      I'll give you a hint.

30
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,736
  So, I'm here in San Francisco 

31
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,205
    in the "SoMa" District --   
      "South of Market" --      

32
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:14,472
    to look for a food truck.   

33
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,942
     Now, I hear these guys     
    are doing a cross between   

34
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:19,344

36

   so you got to check 'em out  
        on their Website.       

37
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:24,716
        And I found them.       
      This is Señor Sisig.      

38
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,022
           This is a pork sisig,

39
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:31,490
 I love the way the pork tastes.

40

       please.

      I plan my entire day      
           around it.

  I keep coming back 'cause it's
    the best food in the city.  

44
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,099
 FIERI: With a dynamic pedigree 

45
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,235
    dreamt up by high-school    
  buddies, owner Evan Kidera... 

46
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,438
     Pork sisig                 
 with steamed rice.             

47
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,639
    ...and Chef Gil Payumo...   

48
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,441
               Order for Dave.  
                 Hey, Dave.     

49
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,778
        ...back in 2010,        
   they started mixing Mexican  

50
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,182
 with -- get this -- a sour pork
  Filipino dish called "sisig." 

51
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,852
Originally, it's the pork head, 
   cheeks, snout.               

52
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:02,054
We do a little cleaner version  
with the pork shoulder.         

53
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:04,990
     And Gil stayed true to     
 his grandfather's sisig recipe 

54
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,325
 for the truck's signature dish.

55
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,594
           Two pork sisig tacos.

56
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:10,862
       It's just so good.       

57
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,197
               All right, man.  
     Well, give me the low down.

58
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,332
First, we're gonna start off    
with the pork shoulder,         

59
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,401
sliced up 1/4-inch thin.        

60
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:20,205
We got some soy sauce over here,
some sugarcane vinegar.         

61
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,940
It's a little bit different,    
a little bit stronger.          

62
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:25,544
Now we got that pineapple juice 
just for that sweetness,        

63
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:26,878
incorporates in the meat.       

64
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,747
We've got our minced garlic,    
  some bay leaves,              

65
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,282
  some white sugar.             

66
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:33,085
    Black pepper,               
and we've got some salt.        

67
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:35,621
Mix it up a little bit, and     
we're just gonna cover it up.   

68
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,422
        And how long we let this
                marinate for?   

69
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,090
So, usually overnight.          

70
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,160
       Charbroiled ahead of time
             at the commissary? 
Yeah.                           

71
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,229
                 All right.     
            Now where are we at?

72
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:47,032
We're making our final marinade 
   for our sisig.               

73
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,567
       First,                   
we're gonna take our soy sauce, 

74
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:52,771
lemon juice, red chili flakes,  
and some black pepper.          

75
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,107
Then we just whisk this         
      together.                 

76
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:57,376
And then we've got our          
charbroiled pork right here.    

77
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:00,579
We're just gonna chop this up   
  into a fine dice.             

78
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,381
                There we go.    

79
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:04,048
   Now you're getting taco truck
                   on me.       

80
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,584
So, once you got that           
     chopped up,                

81
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:08,253
we're gonna throw it in         
    our marinade.               

82
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:09,588
            Now, that's gonna go
               to the flattop?  

83
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,323
That's gonna go to the flattop  
to reheat it once again         

84
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,658
   before it gets               
   into our tacos.              

85
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,127
               That soy sauce,  
               I can smell it.  

86
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,596
         Is that a normal order?

87
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,799
Yeah, for two tacos.            
                            Wow.

    on the grill.               

90
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,405
  We're gonna take              
both of our warm tortillas,     

91

       of Filipino flair.       

124
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,479
      It's very reminiscent     
of what we used to have at home.

125
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,948
       Adobo is a Filipino dish?

126
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,349
Yeah, chicken adobo.

A little bit of salt,           
    yeah.

            that gonna marinate?

  About five hours.             

136
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,700
              You marinate 'em, 
then how are you gonna cook 'em?

137
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,769
    So, usually,                
I part bake them halfway        

138
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:06,237
just so I don't burn all that   
soy sauce in the deep fryer.

a lot of that flavor.           

140
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,174
    And then what kind of sauce 
    will you put on the outside?

     We're going                
   a double glaze.

We got the olive oil.           
  Coat that pan up.

Bay leaves.

   A little salt.

We got our seasoning right here.

170
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,505
 They're still hot,             
so it soaks it right up.        

171
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,641
     All right.                 

172

Put these down as a bed

Squirt 'em in there.

              All of a sudden,  
              I got soy sauce,  

183
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:48,473
            then I get chipotle.

184
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:51,142
         Then I get a little bit
               of the garlic,   

185
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,543
           and then I get sweet.

               not to spicy.

           honey-mustard sauce. 

342
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,703
        Here.                   

343
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,639
        Mmm.                    
See, I love cabbage.            

344
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,073
I don't know about you,         
but I'm a cabbage junkie.       

345
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,776
You've done an excellent job    
      on this.                  

346
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,045
You get that cabbage            
just cooked down super-tender.  

347
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,614
  It just dissolves             
right into the meat.            

348
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,920
This dough that you make        
   is outrageous.               

349
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:42,987
   Excellent job.               

350
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,022
                    Thank you.  
Delicious.                      

351
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,125
Just a good, solid, hearty meal.

352
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,595
You're not gonna go away hungry.

353
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:52,931
       My kitchen's clean.      
  I don't have to cook anymore. 

354
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:53,865
 Not a bad tradeoff.            

355
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,935
   We drive around the country. 
We check out these funky joints.

356
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,336
          But believe it or not,

357
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,407
        I haven't seen this girl
                for 25 years.   

358
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,208
               Peggy Dilishan.  
  We lived in Ferndale together.

359
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,143
Everybody at home would probably
                love to hear    

360
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,812
   some real great juicy details

361
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:10,081
     of what I was like as a kid
                 from Peggy,    

362
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,615
          but Peggy doesn't want
            to talk about that! 

363
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,884
Oh, yes, I do!                  
            Oh, no, she doesn't!

364
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,285
              No, she doesn't!  
           Thanks for tuning in.

365
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,687
              Have a great day. 
                   Goodbye.     
[ Laughs ]

 FIERI: Coming up, we're headed 
     to Portland, Oregon...     

367
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,159
    You are turnin' and burnin'.

368
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,427
     ...for a food truck...     
                             Oh!

369
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,297
          ...serving up         
       a "Triple D" first.      

370
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,298
          The bomb-Guam-dot-com.

371
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,609
            I'm here            
 in beautiful Portland, Oregon, 

372
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,678
     about five minutes east    
           of downtown          

373
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,948
  in the Rose City Neighborhood 
   at the Rose City Food Park.  

374
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,616
      With these trailers,      
          you can find          

375
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,084
  just about anything you want. 
          You name it.          

376
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,087
But one that stands out for sure
          is serving up         

377
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,289
 a type of food that we haven't 
  seen on "Triple D" before --  

378
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,957
           Guamanian.           

379
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,226
         That's right --        
   recipes straight from Guam.  

380
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,662
   This is PDX Six Seven One.   

381
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,566
      The food is amazing.      

382
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:02,834
                    MAN:        
           Some shrimp fritters.

383
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,436
   I've never had               
  Guam food before.             

384
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,171
             FIERI:             
 Not until Ed Sablan's food cart

385
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:11,109
 became the culinary ambassador 
        of Guam in 2010.        

386
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,177
SABLAN: It's Chamorro food.     
                       Chamorro?

387
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,646
The indigenous people, the      
culture of the Mariana islands. 

388
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,915
       Guam's                   
the largest southernmost island 

389
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,217
of the group of islands.        

390
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,520
     My absolute favorite is    
      the kélaguen mannok.      

391
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,123
           Kélaguen and titiyas.

392
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,426
       Cold chicken salad.      
         It's fantastic.        

393
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,263
          What are we gonna make
                         here?  
The kélaguen mannok.            

394
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,597
"Mannok" means "chicken,"       

395
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,466
and then kélaguen is            
the way it's prepared.          

396
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:36,601
Chopped, grilled chicken.       

397
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,803
                    Okay.       
            Let's get into this.

398
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:41,940
So, what we're gonna do         
is take the bone out.           

399
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,607
        Dude, I got to give you 
    some props on the technique.

400
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,944
Hey, thanks.                    
                 You are turnin'
                   and burnin'. 

401
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,781
                What up next?   
The marinade.                   

402
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,285
   Chopped onions.              

403
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,420
   Ground pepper.               

404
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,822
      Vinegar.                  

405
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,423
I use cane vinegar.             
                   Cane vinegar.

406
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,293
     Soy sauce.                 
     Some water.                

407
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,494
              How long is this  
              gonna marinate?   

408
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,763
So, we'll cover this,           
put it into the fridge,         

409
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,498
and then we'll grill it         
   in the morning.              

410
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,499
                  Awesome.      

411
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,573
                Okay, hit it.   
All right.                      

412
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:16,707
              What kind of wood 
              we cooking with?  

413
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,576
It's a natural mesquite         
      charcoal.                 

414
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:21,112
           We're gonna cook this
           all the way through. 

415
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:24,182
 I let it sit there             
for about 10 minutes,           

416
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,849
     rearrange,                 
 another 10 minutes.            

417
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,252
    Flip it over,               
 another 10 minutes.            

418
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,587
So about half an hour.          

419
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:32,824
And so now we're gonna          
take the chicken, cut it up.    

420
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:37,929
             I got to try this. 

421
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,100
                 Even cold,     
      the chicken is outrageous.

422
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,002
    Green onions.               

423
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,138
Got some yellow onions.         

424
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,539
Some Thai chili peppers.        

425
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,008
   So, it does have a little bit
                  of spice.     

426
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,077
Some grated coconut.            

427
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,745
Then we're gonna put            
  some lemon juice,             

428
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,148
and it's gonna bring it all     
      together.                 

429
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,217
      What are we gonna serve it
                    with?       

430
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:03,354
It's called titiyas,            
or coconut-milk flatbread.      

431
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,689
        Okay.                   

432
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,692
 Flip it over again.            

433
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,993
     Fan it out.                

434
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:15,666
 And there you go --            
kélaguen mannok with titiyas.   

435
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,906
                     Oh!        

436
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:25,709
         Dude, I have eaten food
            all over the world. 

437
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,644
        Yeah.                   

438
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,779
            How have I never had
                    this?       

439
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,915
    That soy kick coming through
                the chicken,    

440
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,984
      a little bit of the spice,
                 the bread.     

441
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:35,719
You get a touch of that coconut,
     the green onions in there, 

442
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,655
a little bit of that lemon juice
               coming through.  

443
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,990
                  Oh! Mmm!      

444
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,993
  That's one of the best chicken
  salads that you will ever try.

445
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,795
                Off the hook.   

446
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,463
                I mean that.    

447
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,699
          The bomb-Guam-dot-com.

448
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,269
   It's so packed with flavor.  

449
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:56,474
 You can imagine a street vendor
 on an island out in the Pacific

450
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,609
 grilling this up on their grill
    and serving it up to you.   

451
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,411
             FIERI:             
    And when we come back...    

452
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,947
All right, so here are          
the shrimp fritters,            

453
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,350
boñelos uhang.                  
          U-hang around tonight?

00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,886
  It's more-o of the Chamorro.  

455
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,287
            The background music
             for this should be 

456
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,123

 Food Park in Portland, Oregon, 

458
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:25,269
     they've got food trucks    
     for every type of food.    

459
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,470
There's a lot of variety.

 And they've got one named after

and crack 'em a little          

489

just to make sure that inside   
gets nice, light, airy.

  and the sweetness of the corn.
