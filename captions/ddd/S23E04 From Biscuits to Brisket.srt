    Was that silent grunting?

Yeah, that's what we do         
    in the South.               

130
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:49,227
When you like something,        
 you just go, "Mmm."

Just let it come up to temp and 
simmer for about 30, 40 minutes.

What are we making now?         

136
00:03:58,638 --> 00:03:59,971
  We're making pimento cheese.  

137
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,039
 Let's get into it.

00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,908
         Cheddar cheese.        
       Pepper Jack cheese.      

139
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,175
        You know what, if you're
                gonna try it,   

140
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,443
             I just feel like I 
             should try it, too.

141
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,778
   You better get               
   right in there.              

142
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,380
           Mayonnaise.          
            Pimentos.           

143
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:09,514
        A little pepper.        

144
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,316
       And, for some heat,      
         Cayenne pepper.

       Mix it up by hand.       

146
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,520
       Let's make a patty       
    for our Fox Bros. burger.   

147
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:18,389
     All right,                 
let's make the burger.          

148
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,659
    So, we're gonna take this   
           brisket...           

149
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:23,194
Oh, my gosh, that's good.       

150
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,930
Get after it, Zorro.            

151
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,000
  We got some of our house-made 
    jalapeño mayo right here.   

152
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,268
      Pimento-cheese patty.     

153
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,670
    And we're gonna take this   
         beautiful thing        

154
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,338
          and throw it          
      under the salamander.     

155
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,006
 We got to hurry up             
and get this burger out         

156
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,476
      before Rutledge eats      
all of the other brisket that --
          [ Clatters ]

00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,144
           -Rutledge!           
           -I'm sorry.          

158
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,345
     Here we go.                
       Hit it.                  

159
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,813
      Take our toasted bun.     

160
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,283
           We got some          
     of our peppered bacon,     

161
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,952
a couple pickles, tomato, onion.

162
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,887
That's a chopped-beef sandwich, 
 called it a burger.            

163
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,023
      -Called it a burger.      
           -I like it.          

164
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,094
         Oh!                    
That's a great burger.

     like a lion                
that just ate a gazelle.        

167
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,498
                I don't know    
               what happened.

         I -- I went after mine.

169
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,369
It's super-tender brisket.      

170
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,570
When you chop that brisket up,  

171
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,906
        -you get a chance       
    to incorporate that fat.    
             -Yeah.             

172
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:09,907
 So it makes it even            
a little bit more unctuous.     

173
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:10,976
But adding the pimento cheese   

174
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,510
and adding the veggies          
    on top of it                

175
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,846
brings that burger element      
       to it.                   

176
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,247
        Mmm.

                  Come on.      

179

  full-speed, man.

              to come back for.

  and a lox plate?              

338
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,142
...bought this joint and started
   making breakfast and lunch   

339
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,076
        for her hometown.       

340
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,411
                 She's doing    
              something magic.  

341
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,879
  They care a lot about the food
             that they put out, 

342
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,080
           and you can taste it.

343
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,415
  Chicken biscuit.              

344
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,750
   It's a true drop buttermilk  
             biscuit            

345
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:20,952
   just like my grandma make.   

346
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,953
      Has a little bit of sweet,
            salty, and crunchy. 

347
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,355
                   FIERI:       
                Biscuit time.   

348
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,090
So, we're gonna start           
  with A.P. flour.              

349
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,758
       Sugar.                   
   Baking powder.               

350
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,094
        Salt.                   

351
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,562
Mix the dry ingredients.        

352
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,230
   Add the butter.              

353
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,297
We make our own buttermilk.     

354
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,766
        Okay.                   
    We're ready.                

355
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:37,068
        -So, just tacky.        
      -Yeah. We're making,      
         like, a batter.        

356
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,170
 Okay. Are we just pinching them
     off on the side like this? 

357
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,371
     Absolutely.                

358
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,173
           And how many of these
           are you making a day?

359
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,975
    We sell about               
1,200 biscuits a week.          

360
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,112
        This is 12 of the 1,200.

361
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,582
     I'm already gonna be asking
                for time off.   

362
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,050
          -Okay. Oven?          
             -Oven.             

363
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,852
350, about 30 minutes.          

364
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,920
We brush them at the very end   
 with melted butter.            

365
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,188
                    Okay.       
        What are we making next?

366
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,057
  So, we're making              
our red-pepper jelly,           

367
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,326
       -which is gonna go       
   with our chicken biscuits.   
             -Okay.             

368
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,928
We're gonna start with          
roasted red peppers, sugar...   

369
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,863
                   Whoa!        
                   Ho-ho!       

370
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:06,998
Apple cider vinegar.            

371
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,533
  Then some butter.             

372
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:09,834
And then we're gonna            
bring this to a boil.           

373
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,670
We slowly add in the pectin.    

374
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:12,804
                Let it cool?    

375
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,072
       Mm-hmm.                  
It's ready to go after that.    

376
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,473
                 All right.     
         What are we making now?

377
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,609
 Our sweet-tea brine            
for our fried chicken.          

378
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:19,944
It's gonna start off            
  with sugar. Salt.             

379
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:22,613
And then we're gonna pour       
 some hot water in.             

380
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,882
Stir that up a little bit.      

381
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,351
       Garlic.                  
    Black pepper.               

382
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,952
                I like that.    

383
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:29,287
            -Lemons.            
        -Squeezing them?        

384
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,756
         -Just lightly.         
 -This brine goes for how long? 

385
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,091
           -Two days.           
              -Wow.             

386
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,560
Bay leaves, parsley,            
    and iced tea.               

387
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,294
Now we put our chicken          
   into the brine.              

388
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,529
    We only have                
 our chicken biscuit            

389
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,698
on the weekends for brunch,     
 and on Wednesdays.             

390
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,099
        Otherwise you're chicken
                out of luck.    

391
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,234
             -Yes.              
             -Okay.             

392
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,569
           And then what are we 
           gonna batter this in?

393
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,704
We're gonna use our day-old     
   pancake batter.              

394
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,772
                  I dig it.     

395
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,174
    So, we dredge               
in the pancake first,           

396
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:50,641
then in a flour dredge.         

397
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,110
              Let that chicken  
                cook through.   

398
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:53,778
         -Low and slow.         
       -See, I like that.       

399
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,780
     -Gives the extra crust     
         on the outside.        
            -Mm-hmm.            

400
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:57,915
     -So, here's our biscuit    
      that we made earlier.     
             -Okay.             

401
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,517
     -The red-pepper jelly.     
            -Mm-hmm.            

402
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,585
And this is our chicken.        

403
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,253
Little bit of parsley           
    for garnish.                

404
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:05,189
  We serve it with              
our homemade hash brown         

405
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,391
 and house pickles.             

406
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,992
              I like the little 
              hash brown puck.  

407
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,961
        Nothing wrong with that.

408
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,464
Oh, that's a good bite.         

409
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,066
          The biscuit's spot-on.

410
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,401
            But, boy, the crunch
              on that chicken.  

411
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,803
         -That batter...        
            -Mm-hmm.            

412
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:19,938
                Really tasty.   

413
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,473
     The little pickle makes it.

414
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:25,009
          The jelly's beautiful.

415
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,344
               I get a little   
        bright note of that tea.

416
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,879
          Kind of comes through 
    a little bit on the chicken.

417
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,214
             I love the energy. 

418
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,282
        I love the scratch-made.

419
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,217
             I love the refined 
                 simplicity.    

420
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,285
     Thank you.                 

421
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,420
The biscuit melts in your mouth.

422
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,556
      It's just incredible.     

423
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,024
            You think it's gonna
                be too much,    

424
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,560
     but by the time it's gone, 
   you wish you had another one.

425
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:45,163
FIERI: Which is what keeps folks
      coming back for more,     

426
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,564
      like regular customer     

427
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,833
      all-pro running back      
          Jamal Lewis.          

428
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:51,836
Jamal, you've been all over     
the world playing football,     

429
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,238
so you've eaten everywhere.     

430
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,572
How does this stack up?         

431
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,707
     It took me all the way back
          down to south Georgia 

432
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,509
             to Grandma's house.

433
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,311
              And Grandma lives 
             on Buttermilk Road.

434
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:01,846
    Grandma lives               
 on Buttermilk Road?            

435
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,447
                Grandma lives   
             on Buttermilk Road.

436
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,316
You can't make that up.         
   You know that.               

437
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:06,384
         Fried-egg BLT.         

438
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,519
 Buttermilk Kitchen             
   ranks up there               

439
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,520
  as true Southern              
    hospitality.                

440
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,056
             The food is always 
            homey and delicious,

441
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,525
             but still creative 
               and different.   

442
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:15,994
           -Lox plate.          
  -The lox plate is very fresh. 

443
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,930
           The salmon is buttery
                 and smooth.    

444
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,731
    -What are we making now?    
         -Our lox plate.        

445
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,200
So, this is the cure            
    that we make,               

446
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:24,268
and we're gonna put this        
 on top of our fish.            

447
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,738
       -What kind of fish?      
     -We use a salmon trout.    

448
