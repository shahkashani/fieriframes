00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,369
                   OKAY, MIX IT 
                   ALL TOGETHER.

216
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:07,172
        AND THIS WILL GET ADDED 
       INTO THE RED BEANS & RICE

217
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,973
                 IN THE COOKER? 
YES, SIR.

     ALL RIGHT, SO THIS IS DONE.
            WHAT'S NEXT?        

219
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,244
      WE'RE GONNA PUT           
THE HAM HOCKS IN THE WATER.     

220
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,246
       SO THE SMOKED HAM HOCKS--
            AFTER YOU TAKE      

221
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,782
     THE BOTTOM OF THE SHOULDER,
      IT GETS CUT IN TWO SPOTS. 

222
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,318
 THIS AREA--DON'T USE MY FAT ARM
     AS AN EXAMPLE, THOUGH.     

223
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,587
     SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO     
 IS WE'RE GONNA TAKE THIS HOCK--

224
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,322
       IT'S GOT TONS OF FLAVOR. 

225
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,725
     SO YOU GOT BONE. YOU GOT   
   A LOT OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE-- 

226
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:29,194
 AND THIS WILL WORK AS THE BASIS
    OF THE RED BEANS & RICE.    

227
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,196
                       CORRECT? 
CORRECT.

00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:34,132
    SO INTO THE WATER. HOW LONG 
   ARE WE GONNA LET THESE BOIL? 
FOR FIVE HOURS.                 

229
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,534
WHEN THEY COME OUT, THEY'LL JUST
     BE KIND OF FORK TENDER.    

230
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,936
   AND I ASSUME--NOW I JUST GOT

231
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,406

394
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,012
     I'M HANGING OUT            
WITH THE SUPER VIOLETTE.        

395
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:03,747
 <i> THE QUEEN OF LEBANESE COOKING</i> 

396
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:06,017
      <i> IN UPSTATE NEW YORK.</i>     

397
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:09,420
        AND NOW                 
WHAT ARE WE GONNA MAKE?         
       WE'RE GONNA MAKE BAKLAVA 
             WITH WALNUTS.      

398
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,889
   ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.         
SO WE GOT CRUSHED WALNUTS.      

399
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,225
       CINNAMON, AND NOW WE ADD 
            SOME SUGAR TO IT.   

400
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:17,161
               THEN WE MIX THEM 
                  ALL TOGETHER. 

401
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,097
                  THEN WE GET   
               THE PHYLLO DOUGH.

402
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:22,299
 WHO WAS MAKING DOUGH THAT THIN 
         100 YEARS AGO?         

403
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,768
WHOA.                           

404
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:27,204
                  NOW WE HAVE   
             TO ADD THE BUTTER. 

405
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,906
                THEN WE PUT     
         THE PHYLLO DOUGH DOWN. 

406
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:32,109
                I PUT, LIKE,    
          TWO, THREE PIECES IN. 
VERY NICE.                      

407
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,845
         THEN I BUTTER IT, TOO. 

408
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:37,014
               THEN WE PUT MORE 
                   ON THE TOP.  

409
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:40,718
                   NOW WE'LL ADD
                   THE WALNUTS. 

410
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,787
WHOA. THAT THICK?               
                            YES.

411
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,923
THAT'S LIKE A DUMP TRUCK        
       OF WALNUTS.              

412
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,193
HOW MANY MORE SHEETS            
      ON TOP?                   
               LIKE, 15 SHEETS, 
                    15, 16.     

413
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,662
OH, CUT IT AHEAD OF TIME,       
    SO IT DOESN'T...            

414
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:54,665
(imitates explosion)            
    EVERYWHERE.                 
               THEN WE ADD      
        THE REST OF THE BUTTER. 

415
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,267
   AND NOBODY HAS ANY TYPE OF   
A CHOLESTEROL ISSUE AROUND HERE.

416
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,737
♪ ROLL OUT THE BUTTER ♪         

417
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,806
AND WHERE ARE WE GOING NOW?     
                   IN THE OVEN. 

418
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:04,041
        IT COOKS FOR 30 MINUTES 
        FOR, LIKE, 400 DEGREES. 

419
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,679
                    HERE WE GO. 

420
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,082
         NOW WE'RE READY TO ADD 
               THE SYRUP.       

421
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:14,218
          SO WE TAKE THE SUGAR. 

422
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,554
                 ADD THE WATER. 
AND WE'RE MAKING                
A SIMPLE SYRUP.                 

423
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:18,089
                         RIGHT. 
GOT IT.                         

424
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,758
        THEN WE'LL LET IT BOIL  
     FOR, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES... 
OKAY.                           

425
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,227
      THEN ADD THE LEMON JUICE. 
  OKAY.                         

426
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:25,363
              THEN LET IT BOIL  
             FOR 15 MORE MINUTES

427
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,731
             TILL IT GETS THICK 
                  LIKE HONEY.   
NICE AND THICK,                 
 LIKE A HONEY?                  

428
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,634
             YES. LIKE A HONEY. 
REALLY?                         

429
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,569
OH, IT GOES ON TOP.             
                    ABSOLUTELY. 

430
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:34,104
         GOT IT.                
JUST GOOD OLD SUGAR WATER.      
                       (laughs) 

431
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,307
              NOW WE HAVE TO ADD
              THE PISTACHIO.    

432
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:41,912
OKAY, SERVE IT UP.              

433
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:44,081
LOOK AT THAT.                   

434
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:49,453
MMM.                            
                       (laughs) 

435
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:52,856
              WOW!              
 DO YOU OWN A SUGAR PLANTATION? 

436
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:55,058
                      NO.       

437
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:58,663
IT'S KIND OF LIKE WALNUT BRITTLE
       IN THE MIDDLE. MMM.      

438
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,932
THIS IS THE MOST WALNUTS        

439
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,067
AND THE MOST SUGAR              

440
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,003
 THAT I'VE EVER SEEN IN BAKLAVA 
       IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.       

441
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,273
    I LIKE TO SEE THINGS DONE   
  IN EXTREMES. THIS IS EXTREME. 

442
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:12,476
NICE JOB.                       
      YOUR WALNUT BAKLAVA.      

443
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,745
      YOU GET A GREAT CRUNCH    
      WITH THE NUTS,            

444
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,281
  BUT THEN THE PHYLLO DOUGH KIND
  OF JUST MELTS ON YOUR TONGUE. 

445
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,750
 I HAVE SUCH A SWEET TOOTH,     
 AND THIS IS SO PERFECTLY SWEET.

446
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,618
      IT'S DELICIOUS.           

447
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,688
      DOWNTOWN SYRACUSE         
      IS ON ITS WAY BACK,       

448
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,890
      AND THE REASON WHY PEOPLE 
      ARE COMING BACK DOWNTOWN  

449
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,159
      ARE BECAUSE OF BYBLOS.    

450
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,361
      I CAN NEVER COME IN       
      JUST TO SAY HELLO.        

451
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,029
  IT'S ALWAYS, "ARE YOU HUNGRY?"

452
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,432
NICE TO MEET YOU.               
                     THANK YOU. 

453
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,335
MAKE SURE THAT YOU PAY ATTENTION
      TO THE BOSS, RIGHT.       
      THANK YOU VERY MUCH.      

454
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:40,771
SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS ROAD TRIP,
BUT DON'T WORRY.                

455
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,640
  WE GOT PLENTY MORE JOINTS     
  TO FIND ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY.

456
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,843
     I'LL BE LOOKING FOR YOU    
            NEXT TIME           

457
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,245
               ON               
 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

458
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,981
                 WE'RE HERE     
           IN ST. LOUIS, MISS-- 
MISSOURI.                       

459
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:53,251
I WANTED TO SEE IF IT'S MISSOURI
         OR "MISSOUR-A."        

460
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,853
          SEE, I SAY MISSOUR-A. 
YOU DON'T HAVE "BROCCOL-A,"     
          DO YOU?               

461
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,422
         I DO HAVE A BROCCOL-A. 
        GIVE ME SOME BROCCOL-A. 
GIVE ME SOME BROCCOL-A.
