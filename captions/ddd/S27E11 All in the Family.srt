1
00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:03,402
 Hey, everybody. I'm Guy Fieri, 
     and we're rolling out,     

2
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:07,272
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins and dives.  

3
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:09,675
          This trip...          
 You guys ready for this? Watch.

4
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:11,076
          We're hitting         
      righteous restaurants     

5
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:13,145
       keeping things all       
         in the family.         

6
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:15,080
       Everybody, from the      
       aunts to your mom,       

7
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:16,348
 your wife to your daughters... 

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,617
     From a husband-and-wife    
       duo in Santa Fe...       

9
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,018
      This is crazy tasty.      

10
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,021
      To multigenerational      
   joints still going strong.   

11
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:23,955
       This is how you've       
         always done it?        

12
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,357
                   Always.      

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,625
         Like a pancake         
      paradise in Jersey...     

14
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,227
        Like pigs in the        
       blanket gone wild?       

15
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,362
                    Yeah.       

16
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,897
          Off the chain         
       chili in Seattle...      

17
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,033
    There's like 85 different   
    spices going on in there.   

18
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,835
     Bomb burgers in Utah...    

19
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:38,436
    Gosh. That's really good.   

20
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,238
  Real-deal Chicago Italian...  

21
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,107
       Can I get a gallon       
         of that to go?         

22
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,376
       And a meat lover's       
       dream in Vancouver.      

23
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,710
     You are the beefinator.    

24
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,580
      So get ready for this     
  full hour of food and family. 

25
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,782
     That's what I'm talking    
       about, right there!      

26
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,452
     That's all right here,     
          right now on          

27
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:55,587
 "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives." 

28
00:00:55,589 --> 00:01:04,863
                     ♪♪         

29
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,999
        Seattle is known        
      for its killer food,      

30
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:08,534
     and there's this joint     
        we've just got to       

31
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:10,202
      check out in Ballard,     

32
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:13,472
 an industrial area right across
    the bridge from downtown.   

33
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:15,940
      This third-generation     
       father-and-son team      

34
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:19,011
   run a one-of-a-kind parlor   
    filled with local flavor.   

35
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:20,879
  You stirring that             
  chili over there?             

36
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,480
               Stir the chili?  
Stir the chili, Big Phil.       

37
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:23,748
Come on. Get to work.           

38
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,883
         Phil Semandiris        
       and his son, Mike,       

39
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:27,352
        take their chili        
        very seriously...       

40
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:30,556
            I love it in a chili
             burger, chili dog. 

41
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:31,890
              I love my chili.  

42
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:33,358
      And so do the locals.     

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,693
           How was it?          
                        Perfect.

44
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,962
         Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.        
     It's got a little kick?    

45
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,029
                  Oh, yeah.     

46
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,699
                   Tasty.       
             This defines chili.

47
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,968
        And chili defines       
    everything at this joint.   

48
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,370
  You see, Mike's Chili Parlor  
     is true to its name...     

49
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,772
                This is your    
           standard Mike's bowl.

50
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,308
     On whatever you order.     

51
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,909
Chili fries, very good.         

52
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,044
What are you having?            
                      Chili dog.

53
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,780
Chili dog?                      
  Mike's chili burger, perfect. 

54
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,917
 Why is the grilled cheese $54? 

55
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:01,186
             You got to really, 
 really want the grilled cheese.

56
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,388
       Okay. It's a joke,       
          but trust me,         

57
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,057
   it ain't the grilled cheese  
       they're coming for.      

58
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,324
 I like Mike's chili            

59
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,860
just a plain bowl of chili      
with cheese and onions.         

60
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,528
              There's something 
            just magic about it.

61
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,932
        I'm not sure what it is.
             Phil won't tell us.

62
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:16,935
   Because the recipe has been  
 a closely-guarded family secret

63
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,737
          for 85 years.         

64
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,139
            Is it written down? 
Not written down.               

65
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,941
               Not written down?
   Not written down anywhere.   

66
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:26,211
 Instead, it's been passed down 
 from Mike's great-grandfather, 

67
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:27,345
        also named Mike.        

68
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,680
        Your grandfather,       
     your great-grandfather,    

69
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,082
     came here from Greece.     
Right.                          

70
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:32,751
   And, like a lot of Greeks,   
  he decides to start cooking.  

71
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:33,752
         So he's cooking        
        in a restaurant,        

72
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,687
       comes up with this       
       great chili recipe,      

73
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,956
    decides he wants to leave   
  and open his own restaurant.  

74
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,626
             FIERI:             
  In 1939, he built this place. 

75
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:43,028
  When you were 21, you and your
      dad took it over together?

76
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,896
  Right.                        
             In '66,            

77
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,631
          Phil started          
   running the place himself.   

78
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,099
    Twenty years later, Mike    
           jumped in.           

79
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,167
Suck it in, big guy.            

80
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,836
        Together, they're       
        proud to tell you       

81
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,771
         they've changed        
      virtually nothing...      

82
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,307
Where are my crackers, Mike?    

83
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:56,308
                There we go.    

84
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,709
           Especially           
       what's in the bowl.      

85
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:58,843
  We don't make it with beans.  

86
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,245
        We don't make it        
       with anything else       

87
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,447
      that I've always kind     
     of called filler stuff.    

88
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:03,915
          Then we serve         
         it over beans.         

89
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,517
     I think that really is     
     what makes it special.     

90
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,854
    We just put the meat and    
the secret spice recipe that my,

91
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,991
   you know, great-grandfather  
      started in the '20s.      

92
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,260
  FIERI: It's also the all-day  
         cooking process        

93
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,795
      that starts with beef     
    stock, onions and garlic.   

94
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,332
We didn't saute them. We just   
throw everybody in the pool?    

95
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:22,267
                   That's right.
    Now the meat.               

96
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,801
Okay, so mix, mix, mix...       

97
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,537
           Until it breaks down.
Until it all breaks down.       

98
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,940
      This is like your own     
    little athletic workout.    

99
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:29,540
Do you want to arm wrestle?     

100
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,343
     Maybe. So we're making     
    what we're calling sauce?   

101
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,544
We're making the sauce.         

102
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,947
 You see, our chili             
   and our beans,               

103
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:39,284
they never get mixed together   

104
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,153
unless you want them            
 together in a bowl.            

105
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:43,955
       Because true chili,      
   by most people's standards,  

106
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,424
          is meat only.         
That's it.                      

107
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,092
       This is how you've       
         always done it?        

108
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,426
                   Always.      

109
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,028
         And with it all        
     right out in the open,     

110
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,698
  everyone can watch these guys 
      make it from scratch.     

111
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,098
    I think people would get    
     scared if they walk in     

112
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,768
       and they don't see       
        that pot cooking.       

113
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,371
 Yeah. That's true.             
 Sometimes they do.             

114
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,106
       After several hours      
          of simmering,         

115
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:04,509
   the sauce is finally ready   
   for the big bag of spices.   

116
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,045
    There's like 85 different   
    spices going on in there.   

117
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,448
        What is in this?        

118
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,916
Oh, a whole bunch of stuff.     

119
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,784
        There's got to be       
      some chili powder...      

120
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,453
That's what it is.              
          And oregano.          

121
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,588
     I don't think you have     
  any intention of telling me.  

122
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,790
  No. You're right.             

123
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,325
         No. Absolutely.        

124
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,126
That's more than I've ever      
done for anybody else.          

125
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,461
        For anybody else?       

126
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,397
        Hey, I'm Italian.       
   Greeks are almost Italians.  

127
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,533
       No. No.                  
       No. No.                  

128
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,735
       So how much longer       
   is this going to hang out?   

129
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:35,273
   Well, actually,              
just a little while now.        

130
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,077
Be careful.                     
              Why?              

131
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,612
         It's addicting?        

132
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,813
           Be careful.          
         He'll warn you.        

133
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,883
That's the only bad thing       
  about this chili.             

134
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:48,086
        Mm, that's tasty.       
Isn't it?                       

135
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:51,156
   You guys should call this,   
      like, a chili parlor.     

136
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,624
      It'd be a good name.      

137
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,493
     While lots of folks go     
      for the basic bowl...     

138
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,828
         We got oyster crackers.
               That's a must.   

139
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,029
      It's the chili combos     

140
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,831
      that will really spin     
        your head around.       

141
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,501
My favorite way to eat Mike's   
chili is in a chili burger,     

142
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,636
right down the middle.          
   Feed a family.               

143
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,038
     Come on down to Mike's     
       Chili Parlor and...      

144
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,307
         Cheese first?          
             Yeah, cheese first.

145
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,276
  All right. We're going onions.

146
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:14,712
            That's a little soft
             for a guy like you.

147
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,783
        Okay. Now we're talking.
             Now we're talking. 

148
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,851
   You want me to do the peppers
             for you this time? 

149
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,252
           No.                  
                     You got it?

150
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:24,055
You've been ridiculous on all of
the other volume portions.      

151
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,991
Is that enough?                 
           I think it's perfect.

152
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,925
        Okay.                   
Can someone really eat that?    

153
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,194
           Oh, yeah, definitely.

154
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,929
You want a deep breath,         
take a deep breath or something?

155
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,333
  That's a primo chili burger.  

156
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,070
        Nice spice to it.       
       It's very flavor...      

157
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:40,338
  The cheese melts really quick 
     because it's cut thin.     

158
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,473
        Yep.                    

159
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,076
   Then you get the real meaty  
      texture of the patty.     

160
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,078
       Right.                   

161
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,281
    Now, I don't know anybody   
 that can do a gourmet breakdown

162
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,949
on such thing as a chili burger,

163
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,486
     but I got to tell you,     

164
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:56,621
      that burger is in it      
     to win it right there.     

165
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,623
        And if the burger       
    is not enough of a meal,    

166
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,760
   check out the chili pasta.   

167
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:02,761
 That's what I'm talking about. 

168
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,563
              Looks good, huh?  
                 Looks good?    

169
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:08,033
              For you Italians, 
       that's the Italian chili.

170
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,969
 Oh, yeah. No. This is where we 
    start getting into this.    

171
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,504
         I mean, I know         
         a few things...        

172
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,039
                About pasta?    

173
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,040
   What do you think about that?
               You like that?   

174
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,577
       Because I like the       
    little jalapeno nuggets.    

175
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,445
   That's the kicker on this.   

176
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:21,780
       The food is great.       

177
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:24,382
       It feels like home.      
      Nothing beats Mike's.     

178
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,184
   FIERI: Because Mike's Chili  
    Parlor is still doing it    

179
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,787
     the way it's been done     
      since the beginning.      

180
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,188
              That's the stuff. 

181
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,323
      Isn't it nice to have     
   a place like this so close?  

182
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,658
           Beats the heck out of
        all the fast food stuff.

183
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,193
   Life is short.               

184
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,662
  What a better way             
to spend a lot of it?           

185
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,397
       You know, you can't      
    create a place like this.   

186
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,865
   It has to happen over time.  

187
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,867
This is my oldest customers.    

188
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,403
We've been going here           
    for 37, 38...               

189
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,005
          They said...          
You know what they just told me?

190
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,740
      They said "We didn't      
   even know he served chili.   

191
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,276
         We just come in        
         for the abuse."        

192
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,610
    That's true.                

193
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,746
           Coming up,           
      talk about tradition.     

194
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,014
 That's what I was looking for. 

195
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,216
   We're headed to the oldest   
      family-run restaurant     

196
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,552
         in Vancouver...        
   This place is an institution.

197
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:03,021
           Also known           
      as food coma central.     

198
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,690
    This kind young lady here   
    has been feeding me beef    

199
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:06,825
       six ways to Sunday.      

200
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:15,333
                     ♪♪         

201
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,869
      On triple D, we love      
       visiting the joints      

202
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,337
    that are part of history.   

203
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,672
 We're here in North Vancouver, 
        British Columbia,       

204
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,609
      about over the Lion's     
Gate Bridge to check out a joint

205
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,813
  that is the oldest family-run 
    restaurant in Vancouver.    

206
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:30,949
      This is the Tomahawk.     
     Steak and mushroom pie.    

207
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,551
This place is an institution.   

208
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,619
                       Beef dip.
      It's where I grew up.     

209
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,354
    It's just become an icon.   

210
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:39,957
       Yorkshire pudding.       

211
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,294
        FIERI: And so is        
    second-generation owner,    

212
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,963
      Chuck Chamberlain...      
 -Chuck is the Tomahawk, period.

213
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,898
   ...who took over the joint   
        after his parents       

214
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,234
     opened it back in 1926.    

215
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:51,703
 MAN: When mom and dad started, 
they had no idea on how to cook,

216
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:52,904
but it wasn't a restaurant.     

217
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,506
It was more of a meeting        
 place at that time.            

218
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:56,975
      But today, folks come     
         for the food...        

219
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,510
                Eggs fill-up.   

220
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:01,379
      And that's all thanks     
   to Head Chef Ann Zubaidi...  

221
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,181
     Steak and mushroom pie, up.

222
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,183
    Who cooked in restaurants   
        around the world        

223
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,651
    before moving to Canada.    

224
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,254
Because I wanted to learn       
  Canadian cooking.             

225
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:12,323
    Eh. That's what you say,    
          right, "Eh?"          

226
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,659
       Eh. Eh.                  

227
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,260
         And she brought        
       an English favorite      

228
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,997
that people here go bananas for,

229
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,732
 and, you know, bananas is good.

230
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,333
             Yorkshire pudding. 

231
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,803
        Served alongside        
    their roast beef dinner.    

232
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:26,137
      What's your favorite      
       thing on the menu?       

233
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,206
  Beside the Yorkshire pudding? 

234
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,607
      I know it's going to      
       be good every time.      

235
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,876
    I've been waiting to make   
  Yorkshire pudding for years.  

236
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,744
          As my career          
      went on being a chef,     

237
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,479
I had to make Yorkshire pudding.

238
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,149
        I suck at making        
       Yorkshire pudding.       

239
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:41,886
 It just always has been, like, 
    really flat bread muffins   

240
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,288
  that don't taste good at all. 

241
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,690
     I am now your disciple.    

242
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:46,958
  So we have flour.             

243
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,760
We've got four eggs,            
and we give them a little whisk,

244
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:52,497
      and then we're adding     
      milk and plain water.     

245
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:55,366
      We've got that mixed,     
   pinch of salt to the flour.  

246
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,835
     We start that whisking,    

247
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:59,304
     and we pour the liquid     
        in slowly, so...        

248
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,772
                Is this where   
             the magic happens? 

249
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:04,642
   This is when magic happens.  
 It mixes until it's not lumpy. 

250
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,846
       Okay. That's done,       
     and so we have our pan.    

251
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,780
   This is about 50 years old.  

252
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,250
       Well, this is going to be
        leaving in a red Camaro.

253
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:15,387
If this is the magic muffin tin,
               I'm taking it.   

254
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,322
We're putting beef drippings in.

255
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:18,923
           Beautiful.           

256
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,592
    This goes into the oven.    

257
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:24,195
I've come to understand         
a certain level of depression   

258
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,663
when I've tried to do these,    

259
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,400
and they have not come out      
   Puffy McMagic.               

260
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:31,202
They've come out Flat McTragic. 

261
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,871
  I'm just going to             
 leave on that one.             

262
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:36,073
     So we've got Yorkshire     
       pudding, pan ready,      

263
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,410
    and it's going to sizzle.   

264
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,346
 Then they go back in the oven. 

265
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,348
What temp are we at?            
          Four-hundred.         

266
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,216
And they will be Puffy McMagic? 

267
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,352
     In about half an hour.     
Next.                           

268
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,154
        We're going to do       
         the roast beef,        

269
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:51,356
       so I make a little       
       scoring on the top,      

270
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,625
      and then we're going      
     to put grainy mustard,     

271
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:57,028
      Montreal steak spice,     
   and we just massage it in.   

272
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,563
Roast off in the oven           
    at what temp?               

273
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:02,367
       Three-fifty, about       
       an hour and a half.      

274
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,969
  We've got the beef drippings. 

275
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,370
         Going to scrape        
        all this goodness       

276
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,906
 from the pan into my stock pot,

277
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:11,042
   and we're bringing that up   
 to a nice sizzle, adding flour.

278
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,711
          So we're making gravy?
       We're making gravy.      

279
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,312
              Where did the au  
               jus come from?   

280
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,582
   We make our own beef stock.  
       We brown the bones.      

281
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,918
   Of course we brown the bones,
         and we make dip from...

282
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,920
     Ugh. Look how dark and rich
          and beautiful that is.

283
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,322
               That's the back  
             of the Camaro too. 

284
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,924
   It's doing its thickening,   
         and it's done.         

285
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,394
                           Okay.
    Here, Yorkshire puddings.   

286
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:30,729
        Okay. Here we go.       

287
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:34,131
  Are you guys ready for this?  
             Watch.             

288
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,268
          There we go.          
    That's what I'm looking for.

289
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,404
  Absolutely not how mine look. 

290
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:40,872
  Quickly, they're puffing down!

291
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:43,474
               Now do we start  
                slicing meat?   

292
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,342
   Would you like the big one?  

293
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:48,412
         Beautiful gravy        
        over everything.        

294
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,482
         Two knives and forks...

295
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,952
            Go ahead.           

296
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:56,087
         Oh. That's outstanding.

297
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,490

 On the homemade mashed potatoes

00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,831
                 a little of    
        the whole-grain mustard,

301
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:11,035
    and then you get that really
    tender puff from the pastry.

302
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,938
               It's really...

 in there, a touch of olive oil,

     a freshly whole lemon,

           It's ready.          
Look at the way that's roasted  

471
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,873
down like that.                 
   Really holds in the juices.  

472
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,407
Just take a few of the potatoes.

473
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,476
     Add it to the chicken,     
and we sprinkle it with the oil,

474
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:26,944
         and it gives it        
         a great taste.         

475
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,479
And that's all she wrote?       
      That's all she wrote.     

476
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:29,814
 Want to arm wrestle            
   for the thigh?               

477
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:31,415
       I don't want to embarrass
             you on the camera. 

478
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,551
    Look at that.               

479
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,820
      Melts in your mouth,      
          super crispy.         

480
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,288
       Now, I get a little      
        bit of the lemon,       

481
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,956
      definitely picking up     
      some of the oregano.      

482
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,493
 Look at that breast meat right 
  there, nice and super juicy.  

483
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:45,029
   I'm starting to understand,  
  Joey, why you're so popular.  

484
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:46,097
  We'll, I'm going to tell you, 

485
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,565
          that is some          
    bodacious bird, brother.    

486
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:51,902
  That's triple B on triple D.  
  I could eat that whole bird.  

487
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,437
           You're doing a pretty
              good job, there.  

488
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,306
I know!                         
    Well done on the outside    

489
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:56,840
 and very tender on the inside. 

490
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,376
          -It's spicy.          
          -It's juice.          

491
00:17:58,378 --> 00:17:59,644
It's one of my favorites, here. 

492
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,712
        It's a wonderful        
        dish, delicious.        

493
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,581
       Something I've been      
    having here for 25 years.   

494
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,848
Can't forget where you came from

495
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,183
           and what's worked for
            you all these years.

496
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,518
   You think you have enough?   

497
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,253
             FIERI:             
   The Italian family cooking   

498
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,521
   has become a local legend.   

499
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,590
           All right. Thank you.
My parents grew up here.        

500
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,392
My grandparents...              
  I was brought here as a kid.  

501
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:16,127
      My ma has been coming     
       here for 60 years.       

502
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,194
          How long have you been
                coming here?    

503
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,063
        -Seventeen years.       
   -Twelve or thirteen years.   

504
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,464
  Shells, broccoli and shrimp.  

505
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,065
    We always come back here,   
        the old favorite.       

506
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,534
        They remember you       
        when you come in.       

507
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,002
      -Just for you, Mike.      
       -They talk to you.       

508
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,405
    Is it all right here so far?
Oh, excellent, excellent.       

509
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:32,210
How does it feel to be a legacy 
in Italian food in Chicago?     

510
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,545
   I'm honored. I'm honored that
          my grandma and grandpa

511
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,347
        were able to start this.
         It's a great tradition.

512
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,149
       A lot of people come here
      from all over the country.

513
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,150
  Let's talk about              
 who is on the wall.            

514
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:41,552
Dick Vitale, Phil Jackson,      
     Bob Costas.                

515
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:42,686
          Who's this cat?       
Rocky Marciano.                 

516
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,621
         Rocky Marciano.        
And this was my grandpa, here.  

517
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,691
And making everyone feel at home
      is a family tradition     

518
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,093
  Joey is proud to carry on...  
        How are you doing there?

519
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,296
     with food straight from    
  his grandparents' kitchen...  

520
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,598
We got in the meatball?         

521
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,700
    right down to the tomato    
 sauce grandma called red gravy.

522
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:57,968
   This is the way              
 we were brought up.            

523
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,570
This is what my grandma         
and my grandpa taught us.       

524
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,240
            Sausage, I see.     
Beef, couple pieces of pork too.

525
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:04,308
We got neck bones.              
           Neck bones?          

526
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,043
     That doesn't look like     
      any rib right there.      

527
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,912
       So you get a bunch       
     of marrow out of there.    

528
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:09,180
      You got to get a ton      
     of flavor out of that.     

529
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,381
     Everybody in the pool.     

530
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,449
 Saporito tomatoes,             
add a little basil to it.       

531
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:16,053
And then you just let it go down
     for about 3 1/2 hours.     

532
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:18,455
    How about you do the rest   
    of the show by yourself,    

533
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,123
      and I'll watch this?      

534
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,060
   Look at that, just getting   
      it going right here.      

535
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:27,398
         I have a thing         
   about gravy, tomato sauce,   

536
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,732
 and that is just make it right.

537
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,669
     Just make it righteous,    
         and, my friend,        

538
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,003
mm, this is right and righteous.

539
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,538
For that, you get a hug.        
           I get a...           

540
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,941
         Their sauce is         
       out of this world.       

541
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,942
    FIERI: Whatever it's on,    
        the mostaccioli,        

542
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,345
       the eggplant parm,       
     and this heavy hitter.     

543
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,147
                  Chicken parm. 
Thank you.                      

544
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:45,082
          Look at that.         
           Mm, winner.          

545
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:46,751
Is this their big order?        

546
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,886
     I've tried the chicken.    
    I've tried the raviolis.    

547
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,221
             I get the rigatoni.

548
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,089
   The meatballs, pretty much   
    everything is real good.    

549
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,890
        -Fried calamari.        
      -Shells and broccoli.     

550
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,960
Veal picante.                   
                   Veal picante?

551
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:59,096
       Joey says this one       
 is a newcomer, his own recipe, 

552
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:01,165
   on the menu only 10 years.   

553
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,900
          Bring it on.          
        -Inside round...        

554
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,569
You do the veal top round       
and everything here?            

555
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:06,303
        Yeah. We trim it,       
    and we cut it ourselves.    

556
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,173
That's old-school. Tenderize it 
a little bit, now we're talking.

557
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,575
    Put them in the flour...    
Straight egg wash.              

558
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,711
      And the bread crumbs.     
  I use the white bread crumbs. 

559
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,379
    I don't use the regular,    
       hard bread crumbs.       

560
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,515
  That's what makes it so good. 
   Start with a little butter,  

561
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:19,317
    and the veal doesn't take   
        too long to cook.       

562
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,652
                No, it doesn't. 
   I use a little lemon juice.  

563
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:25,322
         A little chicken stock,
       and that's all she wrote.

564
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,590
          That's a nice portion.

565
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,926
     Sprinkle a little juice    
      on there, pine nuts.      

566
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,262
               Yeah. That's a   
             nice-looking round.

567
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:33,864
 There's tons of flavor in that.

568
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:36,734
  Mm, I could do damage on this.

569
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:40,871
                Super tender,   
            it's nice and light.

570
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:43,941
          You know what that is?
   That's a real deal Holy-veal.

571
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,010
                     ♪♪         

572
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,745
     I'll be here all week.     
    You should try the veal.    

573
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:52,283
         Don't forget to        
       tip your waitress.       

574
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,418
       How many years I've      
    wanted to use that line,    

575
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,956
     and it finally worked.     
            I'm out!            

576
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,759
  Veal is the best in the city, 
   almost melts in your mouth.  

577
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,761
        -It's very good.        
   -Everything is good, fresh.  

578
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,563
    -Here's your bruschetta.    
-It couldn't be done any better.

579
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,698
Bon appetit.                    
    It's just a family place.   

580
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,433
   You can tell a lot of love   
       was put into this.       

581
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,302
 You've got to love what you're 
      doing. Jill, pick up.     

582
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:12,369
    And that's what do here.    

583
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,637
It tastes like homemade cooking.

584
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,172
  There's the dough             
with the vodka sauce.           

585
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:16,640
         There's nothing        
      more you can ask for.     

586
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,775
        This is the best        
       Italian restaurant       

587
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,711
         in the city of         
       Chicago, bar none.       

588
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:23,581
  Joey, I can see why everybody 
   from the aunts to your mom,  

589
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,650
  your wife to your daughters,  
    why everybody loves Joey.   

590
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,052
        Yeah.                   

591
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:30,587
   Coming up on this full hour  
  of family-owned treasures...  

592
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,323
         I like the way         
     this is looking, boss.     

593
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,725
     A sibling-run standout     
        in Jersey City...       

594
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:36,660
            Just shovel it in.  
             Shovel.            

595
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,862
       Where pancakes are       
      the star of the show.     

596
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:42,199
    That is, like, adult warm   
      strawberry shortcake.     

597
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:48,873
     You know, you can find     
       an average pancake       

598
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:49,940
      just about anywhere,      

599
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:52,609
      but finding a really      
         killer pancake,        

600
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,878
         well, that's a         
       whole another deal,      

601
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,080
      and that's why I'm in     
    Jersey City, New Jersey,    

602
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:58,416
      at this family-owned      
 joint that's doing them right, 

603
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:00,684
        doing them right        
       31 different ways.       

604
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,220
      -Honky-tonk pancakes.     
      -Cran-apple pancake.      

605
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:04,421
    Meat pancake.               

606
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,223
        -Oh, my goodness.       
        -Beautiful, guys.       

607
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,825
   Nutty pancakes,              
   berry pancakes.              

608
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,626
That's a winner, winner         
chicken dinner right there.     

609
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,028
        They're awesome.        

610
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,030
  Throw in just about anything  
    else you could ask for...   

611
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,631
   They make a killer breakfast.

612
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,434
         And you've got         
      the Brownstone Diner,     

613
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:19,303
    a one-stop breakfast shop   
     they're lining up for.     

614
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:20,771
      It's always crowded.      

615
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:21,906
          And whole-wheat toast?

616
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,040
            Exactly.            
                     Let's rock.

617
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,508
        It's a tradition        
       the Bournias family      

618
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,576
       has kept going for       
       more than 40 years.      

619
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,311
               You guys ready?  
                 Follow me.     

620
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:30,114
      The first generation      
     came here from Greece.     

621
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:33,383
My mom came here with           
her father and siblings.        

622
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,585
                   There you go.
     Thank you.                 

623
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:35,920
    The kids all started out    
   in different professions...  

624
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:38,322
              All right, Debbie.
   ...but couldn't stay away.   

625
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:40,057
      We all wanted to work     
       as a family again.       

626
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,725
        I wanted to keep        
      the tradition going.      

627
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:42,993
      WOMAN: I love working     
         with my family.        

628
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,462
       I wouldn't have it       
         any other way.         

629
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:45,729
 FIERI: Neither would the folks 

630
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,131
       lining up for their      
        killer pancakes.        

631
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,732
        Now, who did this       
        recipe come from?       

632
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,201
  It's my father's.             

633
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:52,737
I don't know that I've ever seen
a 5-gallon bucket of buttermilk.

634
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,138
        Vegetable oil...        
Yep.                            

635
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,607
We do another gallon of eggs.   
It gets a little messy.         

636
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,876
             I got to say flour 
         comes in at some point.

637
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,211
   And we just do pretty much   
     six containers of this.    

638
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,214
              Yeah. You keep it 
                 scientific.    

639
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,015
         That's three.          
                  That was four.

640
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,751
          Here is six.          

641
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,753
 Okay. That's going to be seven.
             This will be seven.

642
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,088
   And that's pretty much it.   
                   And that's...

643
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,425
       I think you owe one more.
   Huh? We got one more to go?  

644
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:19,363
      Man, you're throwing      
          off my count.         

645
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:21,698
           We just add          
    a touch of vanilla syrup.   

646
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,434
      The secret ingredient     
           is in here.          

647
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:25,369
              You're hiding it  
         in confectionery sugar?

648
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:28,572
        How long will the batter
         last, for a day or two?

649
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,507
         Our batters are        
       only for that day.       

650
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,710
     This size, we do about     
       12 on the weekend.       

651
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:37,982
What, did they give me          
the Easy-Bake Oven spatula?     

652
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,050
      That's how we do it.      

653
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:43,120
Berry, meat, honky-tonk.        
 Want to make those?            

654
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:44,988
    Yeah. I'll even give you    
        a nut and honey.        

655
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,190
       That's another big       
    favorite, if you'd like.    

656
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,459
   Nut and honey.               

657
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:50,260
       And you see the way      
 this batter is nice and thick? 

658
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,329
       It's going to give       
       it a nice texture.       

659
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:54,331
   Before we put the toppings,  

660
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,533
     I just want it to cook     
       just a little bit,       

661
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,536
     just to kind of create     
       that little pearl.       

662
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:01,271
       Now, this is specifically
       just the pancake section?

663
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,006
       There is nothing on      
    this grill but pancakes.    

664
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,875
         If you're going to call
       yourself Pancake Factory,

665
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:07,611
you better have a precisionially
   -tuned griddle just for this.

666
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:10,014
       Griddle, that's it.      
       This is the meat pancake?

667
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:12,750
      Fresh bacon, cooked,      
  just throw that right there.  

668
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:15,286
       The nut is almonds,      
          some walnuts.         

669
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:16,686
   The honey goes at the end.   

670
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:19,423
  For the honky-tonk, these are 
   peanut butter, really good.  

671
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:21,024
      You see the way it's      
    getting that nice height?   

672
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,226
                Right. Right.   

673
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:24,028
            Now, how do you know
             which one is which?

674
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,829
       We're going to have      
       to turn them over.       

675
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,030
  Now, you would get, seriously,

676
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,699
       on an order you would get
          three nutty like that?

677
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:31,769
  Yeah. Nuts and honey, just do 
    a little powdered sugar.    

678
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:34,037
       Just shovel it in.       
Oh, I -- Shovel?                

679
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,240
      Just shovel it, yeah.     
It's my middle name.            

680
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,110
  Mm, I would order             
    that pancake.               

681
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:41,578
    How does this               
  pancake stack up?             

682
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,980
Get it?                         
     Actually, it's awesome.    

683
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,449
   And this is our honky-tonk.  

684
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,851
Good peanut butter flavor,      

685
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,853
I like that the banana          
  goes on not-hot.              

686
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,989
  They're nice. They're fluffy. 
      They're always fresh.     

687
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,857

688
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,926
        And we just take

689

  It's the country pancake wrap.

 It's like an oversized pancake,

     A little bit of white wine.

758
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:36,687

              bechamel sauce.   
          Still do it.          

763

  No. It's for one.

     the cream sauce on top,    

771
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:06,249
   the bechamel, really nice.

    anything wrong with that.

       That's money, dude.

   A husband and wife dishing   
    out rockstar rellenos...    

794
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,299
     I'm a huge fan of that.    
    And pupusas with a punch.   

795
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,135
       You have completely      
     train-wrecked me, man.     

796

      Santa Fe, New Mexico,     

797
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,976
       and I'm taking you       
        to a little joint       

798
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,977
      that's probably like      
        a perfect example

   FIERI: El Salvador native,   
         Jesus Rivera...        

811
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,302
Corn tortilla.                  
    ...and his wife, Charlotte, 

812
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:34,071
        bought this place       
      less than a year ago.     

813
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:36,673
Jesus was working at two        
restaurants at the same time,   

814
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:38,541
   and I thought,               
if he's working that hard,      

815
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:39,876
he should have his own place.   

816
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,945
      So now he's cranking      
       out comfort food...      

817
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,280
        Stuffed French toast has
   a little bit of cream cheese.

818
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,150
   -Southwestern favorites...   
     -The chile rellenos...     

819
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:48,886
      Chili pepper stuffed      
          with cheese.          

820
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:50,353
           -Delicious.          
            -Pupusas.           

821
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:53,223
  FIERI: And this El Salvadoran 
    dish Jesus grew up with.    

822
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:56,626
   Cornmeal stuffed with flank  
 steak, corn and green chilies. 

823
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,364
  It starts out very mild, and  
 then there's a burst of flavor.

824
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:01,832
    This is going               
   to be the beef               

825
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:03,099
  that is going to              
  go in the pupusa?             

826
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,568
              Yeah.             
Okay. So now a little bit       

827
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,702
of oil down?                    
              Yeah.             

828
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,170
So you saute the onions         
 down a little bit?             

829
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,439
     Yeah. And next, garlic.    

830
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,308
      Okay. So those are sauteed
               for 10 minutes.  

831
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,043
                       Now what?
    This is the flank steak.    

832
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:15,712
        Wow. We're making a lot.
  Yeah. I love flank steak, too.

833
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:17,113
        So that'll all brown up.

834
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,383
      Now it's time for the     
    tomatoes and the peppers.   

835
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:21,418
                   Chile pasado.
     Yeah, salt and pepper.     

836
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,188
      So then, cook all that up?
   Oh. I can't wait to try this.

837
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,056
   How long is it going to take?
       One hour is enough.      

838
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,658
 I don't think that             
I've ever had pupusa.           

839
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,994
          Okay. Only one?       
All right. Okay.                

840
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,596
     Masa, salt, oil, water.    

841
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:34,130
So, masa.                       
              Masa.             

842
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:35,399
    Just like we                
make a tortilla with.           

843
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,134
           Tortilla masa.       
Okay.                           

844
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:38,869
        This is for you.        

845
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:40,938
 It's how he did it.            

846
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,073
                Next.           
 Jesus, my brother,             

847
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:45,075
they have these things          
called tortilla press.          

848
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,010
I'm going to get you            
one for your birthday.          

849
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:47,878
              Okay.             
Okay?                           

850
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,412
I do like the method, though.   

851
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,281
We're making a thicker-than-an- 
  average tortilla.             

852
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:52,549
   You don't skimp              
  on the portions.              

853
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:54,951
You give a lot.                 
          Yeah, enough.         

854
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,087
          Next is corn,         
        Monterey cheese.        

855
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,321
Monterey Jack cheese...         
              Yeah.             

856
00:30:58,323 --> 00:30:59,689
With the El Salvadorean dish?   

857
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,091
              Yeah.             
Yeah. Okay.                     

858
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:05,295
        This is for you.        
      Start it right here.      

859
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:06,763
Little bit of corn.             
       You're doing good.       

860
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:08,131
Okay. I'm all right, so far?    

861
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,432
              Yeah.             
I'm graduating here             

862
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,501
at the Tune-up Culinary         
  Education Center?             

863
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:13,637
Now what happens?               
         Fold the pusa.         

864
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:15,706
 Put it in the middle like that.
All right.                      

865
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:18,175
So that's why you don't         
use the tortilla press          

866
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:19,575
because you've got to           
have them on the paper.         

867
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,446
You want to just kind of        
make it into a round patty.     

868
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:23,914
I wrap this in tin foil,        

869
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,516
and I could cook it on the      
manifold of my '67 out there.   

870
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:28,051
    Look at that!               

871
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,320
  We cook the pupusa with oil.  
We don't want the heat too high.

872
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:31,722
       We don't want it to brown
       too fast without cooking.

873
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,390
              Yeah.             
       So now we flip them over.

874
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,392
           Like this.           

875
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,995
               Oh. Like this.   

876
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:40,330
         Perfect. Look.         

877
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:41,665
       This is the cheese       
         melting inside.        

878
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,333
           Uh-huh. I can see it.
         This is ready.         

879
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,068
        Let's go putting        
      tomato sauce on top.      

880
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,936
        The roasted tomato sauce
             of salt and pepper,

881
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,339
             onions, jalapenos, 
        cilantro and the garlic.

882
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:53,076
       Look at that!            
             Try it.            

883
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,344
     Crazy good.                

884
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:56,279
 If the meat wasn't             
good enough just by itself,     

885
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:59,883
the crispy, crunchy masa        
on the outside with the corn    

886
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:03,153
and the cheese oozing out of it.
    That does it.               

887
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:04,821
 You guys completely            
train-wrecked me, man.          

888
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:06,089
That's awesome, man, seriously. 

889
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:09,559
      It's nice and crispy,     
     crunchy on the outside.    

890
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,361
          Really light,         
     has a different flavor     

891
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:13,964
     than anything else that    
    I've eaten here in town.    

892
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:15,231
                  Oh. That's me.
      FIERI: And the locals     

893
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,366
  just can't get enough of it.  

894
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:17,834
 I'm here a couple times a week.

895
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:19,703
      Sometimes I've eaten      
        here twice a day.       

896
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:20,570
                There you go.   

897
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:22,772
            The food            
     is fabulous every time.    

898
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,041
 That's great, yeah.            

899
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:26,510
  And everybody is just having  
    a great time being here.    

900
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:27,844
It feels so comfortable.        

901
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:30,046
  You can sit at the community  
   table, and meet new people.  

902
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:35,118
Get whatever you're looking for.
  Make me a banana leaf tamale. 

903
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,519
Wow. This is crazy tasty.       

904
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,389
          -Fish tacos.          
      -Watermelon gazpacho.     

905
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:40,991
         Oh, is it good.        
           -A relleno?          

906
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:43,126
    FIERI: Even the classics    
      get a tune-up twist.      

907
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,661
      The chile relleno is      
   a common dish in Santa Fe,   

908
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,697
    but here it's different.    
            -Amazing.           

909
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,666
   They're so lightly breaded,  

910
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,934
    and it really brings out    
        the chile flavor.       

911
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,003
  So we're going to             
 take the Anaheims,             

912
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,604
and this is going to be         
for our chile rellenos?         

913
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:55,872
           Yeah, chile rellenos.

914
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:57,140
      We're not                 
going to put anything on them?  

915
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,342
Just throw it on the grill?     
   Light them up.               

916
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,478
Let them roast, and when they   
get done, you'll sweat them.    

917
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,413
   They cool down.              
Now you take the skin off?      

918
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,348
So now I just give it           
a little tear into there?       

919
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,683
 Pull the seeds out             
 as much as you can.            

920
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:08,084
    We're making                
a little pocket, here.          

921
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,353
       We add onions and cheese.

922
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,022
Monterey Jack cheese,           
this is all mixed together?     

923
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:13,890
    Make a little               
   cheese torpedo.              

924
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:16,826
Well, frankly, I don't...       
   Okay, so now...              

925
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,628
Put the cheese inside the chile.

926
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,430
Look at that.                   
                 You got it.    

927
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:22,299
So we got it done.              
        We put in the freezer...

928
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:23,433
       Really?                  

929
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:24,835
               for 20 minutes   
             until they're firm.

930
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,636
Now we make the batter?         
               The batter, yeah.

931
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:28,038
           We separate the eggs.

932
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,372
   Okay. So we got              
 all the whites in.             

933
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:32,909
          When this is plopping,
  I put in the egg yolks, flour.

934
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:34,243
This is going to become         
   a really nice,               

935
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:36,046
   light batter on              
the outside of this.            

936
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:37,581
         I'll mix by hand. Yeah.

937
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:40,583
Okay. So now we grab all of this
and go over here and fry them?  

938
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,719
You need a little flour so      
the batter will stick to them.  

939
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:44,787
         Now it's ready.        
                            Wow.

940
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:47,390
             Those go fast, huh?

941
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,526
           Yeah.                
 Look at those. Beautiful, baby.

942
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,127
              So they're done.  
    Now, how do we make a plate?

943
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,263
             So a little bit of 
       the roasted tomato salsa,

944
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:54,865
cheese, put a little melt on it.

945
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,466
                Look at that!   

946
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:58,468
  Refritos, the tortilla, here. 
And that's how she comes?       

947
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:02,606
With the cheeses oozing out like
lava over in Flavortown Volcano.

948
00:34:02,608 --> 00:34:03,940
          Got issues...         

949
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:10,213
            Mm. Mmm!            

950
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,282
 That's money, dude.            
I'm going to tell you something.

951
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:14,918
I've never been that much       
of a chile relleno fan,         

952
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,954
  typically because             
the batter is too eggy.         

953
00:34:17,956 --> 00:34:21,291
    This is light               
and creamy and tender.          

954
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:24,560
 I mean, just cut it            
 with a fork and...             

955
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,829
      On point.                 
I'm a huge fan of that.         

956
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,031
   The rellenos are excellent.  

957
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:29,699
      It's nice and spicy.      
        It's like, "Woo!"       

958
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:33,703
   Inside, the cheese is just   
   oozing and it's delicious.   

959
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:35,505
       This is the place to come
             for fantastic food.

960
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:36,773
          Burrito, red.         

961
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,775
       Someone who's happy      
     and loves making food,     

962
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:41,110
   it comes out in the taste.   

963
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:42,846
      This is the American      
       dream, right here,       

964
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:44,448
  and look at you doing it now, 
  but I'll tell you something.  

965
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,849
      This guy is a working     
       machine, isn't he?       

966
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:47,184
There's none better.            

967
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:48,384
     I think you might want     
    to think about expanding.   

968
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,187
      A few walls are going     
    to need to be pushed out.   

969
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:52,522
  You got to come check it out. 
      I'm not kidding you.      

970
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:55,458
   Coming up, in Roy, Utah...   
       He is in the zone.       

971
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,594
       A three-generation       
       burger sensation...      

972
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,096
      Is that how you roll?     
   Serving up the standards...  

973
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,531
Look at that.                   
       And some surprises.      

974
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:02,532
Let's try the elk.              
                Okay.           

975
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,804
        So I'm kicking it       
       here in Roy, Utah.       

976
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:11,908
     Now, Salt Lake City is,    
    like, 35 miles that way.    

977
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,344
     Fifteen miles that way,    
       some killer skiing,      

978
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:17,147
    but for a lot of people,    
    this is the destination.    

979
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:19,082
      A little burger joint     
      that's been doing it      

980
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:21,083
    right for over 52 years.    

981
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:23,753
      You got to check out      
         the Burger Bar.        

982
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:25,021
    Two singles and a double.   

983
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:26,423
             Small fry, please. 
                There you go.   

984
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:28,558
   You can't get a burger that  
 tastes like this anywhere else.

985
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,960
       It's big, and it's       
       got a lot of meat.       

986
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,561
         And I need that        
      burger pretty quick.      

987
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:33,229
      FIERI: The single is      
        a quarter-pound,        

988
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,164
     and they'll stack them.    

989
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:35,565
     Three double cheeseburgers.

990
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:38,501
      from double to quad,      
        and even bigger.        

991
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:39,969
       Look at that, huh?       

992
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,171
           That's a good burger.

993
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:42,505
        And all the other       
       drive-in classics.       

994
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:43,706
   Can you get me a foot-long?  

995
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,107
The onion rings are my favorite.

996
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:47,043
           Definitely the fries,
             they're delicious. 

997
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:49,112
    FIERI: And all served up    
      with a Utah favorite.     

998
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:50,447
 Would you like extra fry sauce?

999
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,382
   It's amazing, but fry sauce  
       goes with anything.      

1000
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,651
 We make it with salad dressing 
          and ketchup.          

1001
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:57,187
 Where we come from,            
we call this thousand island.   

1002
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:58,655
        But around here,        
         it's fry sauce.        

1003
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,323
    Good old Utah               
 with our fry sauce.            

1004
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,926
        A local favorite,       
   like the Burger Bar itself.  

1005
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:04,127
             Now, how long have 
           you been coming here?

1006
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:05,394
          A few years.          

1007
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,264
It's been here a long time.     
I think it's tradition.         

1008
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:08,331
 I built it myself.             

1009
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,400
        And I was working       
    with the baby on my back.   

1010
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:12,868
       Ben and Rita Fowler      
   opened the joint in '56...   

1011
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,204
 Did you want sauce             
   with your fry?               

1012
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:16,873
  and the next two generations  
followed them into the business.

1013
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,942
             Thank you.         
   So everybody has worked here?

1014
00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:20,076
                  Everybody.    
           We had to.           

1015
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:22,278
     It was the family farm.    
       You got to chip in.      

1016
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,013
          There you go.         
       Hi. May I help you?      

1017
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,416
      It's a family place,      
    and we take pride in it.    

1018
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:28,952
Of the siblings that work here, 
  you're kind of...             

1019
00:36:28,954 --> 00:36:29,952
              I'm the top dog.  

1020
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:32,088
You're top dog.                 
                 That's correct.

1021
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,090
      And Jessica's top job     

1022
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,491
  is keeping everything the way 

1023
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:37,093
   everyone expects it to be.   

1024
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:39,161
   Here you go, Brent.          
     Everything is so fresh.    

1025
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:40,497
              It's better than  
            any fast food joint.

1026
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:42,766
           Are they shake-shakes
    or they kind of puny shakes?

1027
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:44,834
          -They're big.         
 -About that much over the rim. 

1028
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,970
                     No kidding?
       Everyone likes it.       

1029
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:48,505
        Especially their        
       signature burger...      

1030
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:49,973
            I want a cheese Ben.

1031
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:52,242
       The quarter-pounder      
       called the Big Ben.      

1032
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:53,910
  It's just a great hamburger.  

1033
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:56,179
               The Ben is our   
           speciality hamburger.

1034
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:57,914
It's named after my grandfather.

1035
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,049
    What is that?               

1036
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,450
             This is            
    our round-sliced bacon...   

1037
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:03,319
 Round-sliced bacon,            
and where's the meat come from? 

1038
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,655
   They grind the meat daily.   
 So it's never frozen?          

1039
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:07,857
   No. And we like to put our   
    cheese on so it's melted,   

1040
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,927
      and we toast our bun.     
   All right. Come over here.   

1041
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:12,862
         You want to add        
         the fry sauce?         

1042
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:15,031
  Oh. Do it the way             
 you normally do it.            

1043
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:16,333
                 All right.     

1044
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:18,868
             We have our pickle.

1045
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,537
     Throw some tomato on there.

1046
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:23,273
     Big burger.                

1047
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:25,474
                That's great.   
And then, in the summer months, 

1048
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:28,878
   those tomatoes               
come out of our garden.         

1049
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,681
     The burger is really juicy.

1050
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:33,750
             The bacon is money.

1051
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:37,954
          The cheese melts nice,
       and then the fry sauce...

1052
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:41,091
   You know, the thing that ties
    it all together is that bun.

1053
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:43,159
       My favorite part is      
      the homemade Ben bun.     

1054
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:45,561
    Gosh. That's really good.   
    Do single, we can do double.

1055
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,697
         We can go up to triples
               and quads, too.  

1056
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:48,965
         The cheese Ben         
      and the quad burgers      

1057
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:50,567
   are what we've been eating.  

1058
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:53,236
That's a full pound of beef, but
it's nothing to this cat, Tyler.

1059
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:55,572
We've got the record of eating  
the biggest burger here?        

1060
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:57,239
                 Yes. I do.     
How many?                       

1061
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:00,309
               Twelve patties.  
Twelve patties?                 

1062
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,578
How long'd it take you.         
             Hour and 5 minutes.

1063
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,114
  But today, he's cutting back, 
      just going for eight.     

1064
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,315
          You want to wrap this?

1065
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,583
 I don't even think             
I could sing about it.          

1066
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,118
       Oh, and we got some      
      cheese on there, too.     

1067
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,187
Well, cheese and some of        
     the sauce.                 

1068
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:13,523
Where's your cheering crew?     
Oh. My wife is right over there.

1069
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:15,125
              Are you condoning 
               this behavior?   

1070
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:16,192
           Absolutely.          

1071
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:18,194
            You think your daddy
            can eat all of that?

1072
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:19,863
              -Yes.             
           -How long?           

1073
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:21,531
               Forty minutes.   

1074
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:22,998
Go!                             
                    Okay.       

1075
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,801
           That's a good burger.
 We'll check back a little later

1076
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,336
     and see how he's doing     
       with the big beef.       

1077
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,071
               He's in the zone.
 He is in the zone.             

1078
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:29,539
  But it's not just beef here.  

1079
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,074
    We need two buffalo burgers.

1080
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:32,142
          Two buffalo!          

1081
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:34,410
              Our exotic meats  
        are buffalo and our elk.

1082
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,145
Like, real buffalo?             
                           Yeah.

1083
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,614
 Usually put a lid on it just to
 kind of keep the moisture in it

1084
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:39,883
          so it doesn't dry out.

1085
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:42,885
             All right. Go with 
           the fry sauce, again.

1086
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:47,090
 At least you don't             
 hold back on that.             

1087
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:48,358
              I'll take a bite. 

1088
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,093
I think I like the buffalo      
better than the regular.        

1089
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:54,097
                      Do you?   
Yeah. It's got a meatier flavor.

1090
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,965
It's got great texture.         
    That's good.                

1091
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:57,901
 It really is good.             

1092
00:38:57,903 --> 00:38:59,969
    I'd say it's a lot better   
  than just a normal hamburger, 

1093
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:01,438
      a little bit leaner.      

1094
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,641
  We have fans of the buffalo,  
  and we have fans of the elk.  

1095
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:06,509
         I am having the        
        elk burger today.       

1096
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:07,977
Let's try the elk.              
                    Okay.       

1097
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:09,478
   And where does               
 the elk come from?             

1098
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,381
          Utah elk, gourmet elk.

1099
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:12,849
  Do you eat a lot              
 of the elk burger?             

1100
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,250
                   Uh-huh.      

1101
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:15,584
So I think this I want to do    
just a little bit of sauce on.  

1102
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,787
            Light?              
 I don't want... Oh.            

1103
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,390
There is such a thing.          

1104
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:23,460
               Man, that's good.
You like it?                    

1105
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:25,594
   It's less than               
2 grams of fat, so...           

1106
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:27,130
                    Seriously?  
     Seriously.                 

1107
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:32,735
    Not gamey, got great flavor,
  incredible texture, excellent.

1108
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:34,337
        It's just a nice        
        break from beef.        

1109
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:36,205
    -And speaking of beef...    
      -I feel pretty good.      

1110
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,942
      Remember Tyler, who's     
 slamming an eight-patty burger?

1111
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:40,009
       He's not done yet.       

1112
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:41,744
        So while Tyler is       
        trying to finish,       

1113
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,479
      we'll check out what      
    he's having on the side.    

1114
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,681
Can I get a Ben fry, please?    
           Definitely the fries.

1115
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:46,749
             They're delicious. 

1116
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,685
        You can even get        
       them triple-fried.       

1117
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:49,886
Fry them once in the morning?   

1118
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,488
     Uh-huh. We blanch them     
       just for a minute,       

1119
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,423
         just do, like,         
      part of the cooking,      

1120
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:56,425
      and so it'll cook up      
     faster and more crisp.     

1121
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:57,761
 Now, how long will             
  they go down now?             

1122
00:39:57,763 --> 00:39:59,229
       These will go down       
         for 2 minutes.         

1123
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:00,363
So they'll go for 2 minutes.    

1124
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:01,664
 Then what happens?             
Then you pull them out?         

1125
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,766
      And we pull them up,      
   and we let them actually...  

1126
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:04,834
     Rest again.                

1127
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:06,369
         Right, and then        
       drop them back down      

1128
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,370
  when they're ready to go out, 

1129
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:11,241
      and they stay crispy      
        for a lot longer.       

1130
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:12,842
That has great crunch.          

1131
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:15,178
  Excellent fries.              
Same with the rings.            

1132
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,846
         The onion rings        
         are fantastic.         

1133
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:18,314
        You can tell they       
       make them by hand.       

1134
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:20,183
Any particular type of onion    
that we're working with?        

1135
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:23,285
  The yellow onion, these have  
     been soaked overnight.     

1136
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,522
        We put them just        
       in our flour, here.      

1137
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:27,423
     Give it a little shake     
         off the excess,        

1138
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,991
   and then we put buttermilk.  

1139
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:32,461
   We just put this over here   
    in our cracker, coat it.    

1140
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:33,596
   These are our onion rings.   

1141
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,865
        This is the boat        
    we'll use to put them in.   

1142
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:38,868
That's your measuring system?   
              Yeah.             

1143
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,670
How long?                       
       About 2, 3 minutes.      

1144
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:42,471
That about done?                
              Yep.              

1145
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,740
    Look at that.               

1146
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,943
Crispy, crunchy, excellent.     

1147
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,077
That fry sauce, that's...       
                          Money?

1148
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,612
                You like it?    

1149
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,147
You just throw out "Money?"

00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:53,216
                   I don't know.
Is that how you roll?           

1151
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:54,750
             That's how I roll. 

1152
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:58,220
  They're handmade, and so you  
     can tell they're fresh.    

1153
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,622
 FIERI: So are the huge shakes. 

1154
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,157
        Here's your Butterfinger
             and your raspberry.

1155
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,092
     That's why I come here,    
       is the milkshakes.       

1156
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:05,695
FIERI: And they're doing a local
     take on a lime rickey.     

1157
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:08,431
         Grape, lime and Sprite.

1158
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,500
 That's refreshing.             

1159
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:12,435
    But it is the Burger Bar.   

1160
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:13,903
   You want to go               
 for another eight?             

1161
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:16,772
 And how's my buddy Tyler doing?
  One bite for the rest of it?  

1162
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:19,909
            Okay. Are you ready?

00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:22,445
     [ LAUGHS ]                 
    Look at that!               

1164
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:24,380
      And after predicting      
          40 minutes...         

1165
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:28,517
    What was the time on it?    
  ...he did it in less than 15. 

1166
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,787
     I got to tell you, man,    
     fair and square, baby.     

1167
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,589
       What do you think?       
        He didn't do bad.       

1168
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,792
    Making Roy, Utah, proud.    

1169
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:38,795
        Jump. I got you.        

1170
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:41,197
       So was this a great      
       road trip or what?       

1171
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,599
      But don't you worry.      

1172
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:45,201
    I got plenty more joints    
 to find all over this country. 

1173
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:46,736
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time

              You have to wait

1176
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:53,343
Look. See if they're ready.     
                 No peeking.    

1177

      Set your watch, Mr. Bling.
