slightly ground thyme.

          Is there an attachment
          for "slightly ground"?

499
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:12,303
    Course basil,

503

        The dry milk is the key.

00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,643
     -It retains moisture...

      And beer.                 
I use a kolsch yeast.           

507
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:23,714
That's top fermenting,          

508
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,650
and then when they chill it,    
it drops to the bottom,         

509
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,051
      and it's                  
a bottom-fermenting yeast.      

510
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,519
   So it's kind of              
 a different yeast,             

511
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:29,854
   and that's what              
  makes it unique.              

512
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,589

546
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:37,488
           It's juicy,          
   and it's got a great bite.   

547
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,723
 The tzatziki really highlights 
            the meat.           

548
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,458
  GUY: But what really matters  
          at this joint         

549
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,594
       is how the flavors       
       highlight the beer.      

550
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,197
       Usually the server       
 will pair beer with your food. 

551
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,733
 They'll help you find something
    that you enjoy drinking.    

552
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,135
        I expected with the beer
           being such the focus,

553
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,203
         the food would be good.

554
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,604
                 But they go    
        above and beyond, right?

555
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,473
    -That's why we come back.   
     -That's the best part.     

556
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:56,741
 Brats on the sharp!            

557
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,108
       You can't go wrong       
       with anything here.      

558
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,543
   I loved their smoked brat.   

559
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,944
 Chili on the brat!             

560
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,948
 The brat is great and just goes
    perfectly with the chili.   

561
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,117
     It tastes like Heaven.     

562
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,152
     Starts with                
 the chili paste --             

563
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,354
 New Mexico chilies,            
 California chilies.            

564
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:11,689
            -Pasilla?           
             -Water.            

565
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,357
    -A little beer -- I.P.A.?   
              -No.              

566
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,758
               He said I.P.A.   
           went with everything.

567
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,227
Not when you're cooking.        
I.P.A.s make things bitter.     

568
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,096
   So we're using               
   a Scottish ale.              

569
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,898
  And a little bit              
 of tomato bouillon.            

570
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,366
          This is the foundation
                of the chili?   

571
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,968
     -The secret ingredient.    
       -Secret ingredient?      

572
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,569
   -It's not a secret anymore.  
     -I won't tell anybody.     

573
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,372
We are now doing the chili --   
rendered bacon and onions.      

574
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,574
          -Ground beef.         
      -House-made chorizo.      

575
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,444
         So, this is all getting
   a pre-cook before it goes in.

576
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,647
Ground thyme, ground oregano,   
 table ground salt,

             -Cumin?            
-Fresh toasted and fresh ground.

579
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,520
        -Nice. I like it.       
 -It really makes a difference. 

580
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,455

      -This is a Scottish.      
   -Ah, see? I'm catching on.

The chili cheese brat.          
This is the chili part.
