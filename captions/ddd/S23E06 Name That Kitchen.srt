          flavors come together.

116
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,908
        Okay.                   

117
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,444
                 Here we go.    

118
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:06,578
          This is what          
       I'm really good at.      

119
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,779
        I'm like research       
        and development.        

120
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:08,913
              Green chili pork. 

121
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,850
        Top it with a little bit
          of this jalapeño jack.

122
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,386
         I've got some blistered
           serrano chilies here.

123

Oh, that'll be nice.            

124
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:17,389
All just dig right in.          

125
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:19,124
     This is --                 
  is this a huddle?             

126
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,058
                Ready, break.   

127
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,260
             Cheers.            

128

  Jared, I'm gonna              
   default to you.              

129
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:25,731
What are you tasting?           

130
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,465
     The texture of the pork    
         is just great.         

131
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,067
     It kind of falls apart     
         in your mouth.         

132
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,936
        Little creaminess       
      of the cheese, right,     

133
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,739
  as it's slowly melting 'cause 
 the temperature is just right. 

134
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:36,407
    You get just enough spice   
   to keep you right in there   

135
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,009
     and keep you diving in     
            for more.           

136

138

 I'll tell you what             
the kicker really is,           

139
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,215

  is all the beer.

right underneath it.

         Don't mind me.
