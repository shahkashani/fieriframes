92
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:26,004

 THE ONE SECRET WE DO IS THIS-- 

93
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:28,073
     IS WE DO THE GUINNESS.

97
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:35,080
       AND THEN WHAT WE'RE      
          GONNA DO IS,          

98
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,215
 ANY REMAINDER WE'RE GONNA HAVE,
WE'RE GONNA POUR WATER IN THERE.

99
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:39,217
     AND THE REASON FOR THAT    
   IS 'CAUSE THE ALCOHOL ALONE  

100

  WILL BURN OFF LIKE THAT.      
   <i> ONCE THEY'RE DONE SMOKING,</i>
