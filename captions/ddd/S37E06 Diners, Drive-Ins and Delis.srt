00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,768
     and to be able to pass     
    my grandmother's recipes    

457
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,036
        out to the world,       
      that's been fabulous.     

458
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,305
      It's such                 
  fabulous brisket,             

459
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:42,039
     we decided                 
to make a knish out of it.      

460
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,708
            It's a delish knish.
 Hey, that's good.              

461
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,242
               Okay, first in?  
Carrots in.                     

462
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,244
           Just whole like that?

463
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:47,378
  Whole like that.              
     Celery in.                 

464
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,579
  Whole like that.              
              Whole like that.  

465
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,180
Then we put these lovely        
peeled yellow onions in.        

466
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,116
               Thank goodness   
      we cut the onion at least.

467
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,918
       I know.                  
             Semi-cut the onion.

468
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,919
                       Now?     
The pepper, garlic powder.      

469
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,588
Yummy. And then this            
   an au jus mix.               

470
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,524
                      Beef base.
    Yeah, we just               
cover it with water.            

471
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:00,992
                    Okay,       
     so everybody's in the pool.

472
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,260
And it's really important       
     to cover it                

473
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:03,394
really really tight.            

474
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,196
           Throw it in the oven,
                 what temp?     

475
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:06,664
This goes in the oven,          
  400, 5 1/2 hours.             

476
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,666
            Juicy, juicy, juicy.

477
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,601
      Perfect.                  
    Thanks, dear.               

478
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:11,936
                I better get    
              a Hanukkah card.  

479
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:13,404
      And then                  
we're going to make the mix     

480
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:14,872
for the meat knishes            
    out of that.                

481
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,607
  Don't you think we should pick
       at it and eat some first?

482
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,009
     Well, yeah.                

483
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:20,078
         Mmm. Now, this all goes
         in the buffalo chopper.

484
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,413
            Go. Nothing like big
             kitchen equipment. 

485
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:23,881
    That's about                
  the consistency.              

486
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,216
Now we're going to take this    
    out of here.                

487
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,885
On goes the gloves because this 
gets kind of messy now.         

488
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,687
    White pepper.               
 Garlic. Season-all.            

489
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,555
        Eggs.                   
    Little chicken binder there.

490
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:32,823
Yep, sautéed onions.            

491
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,026
That gets all mixed up          
    really good.                

492
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:36,427
                  And then      
            these pastries here?

493
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,362
Put them here on the middle.    
Then we're going to paint.      

494
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,631
This is just eggs and milk,     
 a little egg wash.             

495
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:43,634
Scoop it in, bring the ends up, 
 twist it, smash it             

496
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:44,502
  so it looks about             
      like that                 

497
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,837
                  Oh, wow.      
More -- Yeah, yeah, yeah.       

498
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,106
      Put this                  
on that cookie sheet.           

499
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,440
               A little bit of  
             the same egg wash. 

500
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:50,441
     Bake them off at what, 350?

501
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:53,244
       350 for                  
about 35, 40 minutes.           

502
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,845
   That's a knish.              
                        Mmm.    

503
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,380
  Smells good, huh?             

504
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,448
             Mmm. That's great. 

505
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,050
              Not overly salty. 

506
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:00,250
     So this is                 
  red horseradish.              

507
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,419
                            Mmm.
     Good stuff                 
that red horseradish, huh?      

508
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,121
              That is the bite  
                right there,    

509
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,923
          when you complement it
                with the two.   

510
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,258
                    Mmm!        
                 Great job.     

511
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,061
                     ♪♪         

512
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:13,197
  We went from maybe 50 knishes 
      a month to like 500.      

513
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,399
        And so we thought       
  we're going to get creative.  

514
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,535
          I always ate          
       the brisket knish,       

515
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,937
  and then when they introduced 
          this new one,         

516
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,806
  it's become my new favorite.  

517
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,607
Jalapeño cheddar knish up!      

518
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,911
      The jalapeño cheddar      
       cream cheese knish.      

519
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:29,947
  Well, the first step is that  
 I get our whipped cream cheese.

520
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:32,417
        We add jalapeños,       
         cheddar cheese,        

521
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:35,152
       and we'll just mix       
  this up really, really good.  

522
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,755
      And that's ready now      
 to put into our pastry shells. 

523
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,256
    We're going to fold these   
          the same way          

524
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,558
   we folded the meat knishes.  

525
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,560
          Push it down,         
        and there you go.       

526
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,429
     Put some more egg wash     
   on them, some more cheese,   

527
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:48,165
      and then we pick out      
    a really pretty jalapeño.   

528
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,501
        Bake them at 400        
         for 15 minutes.        

529
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:53,304
     We put it on the plate,    
        and there you go.       

530
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,606
     And here's                 
our jalapeño cheddar knish.     

531
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:59,510
      A little bit savory,      
    a little bit traditional.   

532
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,712
        Kind of goes pop        
         in your mouth.         

533
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:02,980
        It was excellent.       

534
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:04,182
     MAN: And it has a kick.    

535
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:09,053
     Any time I get a chance    
       to eat it, I will.       

536
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:13,057
   I had a grandmother who was  
   a wonderful cook and baker.  

537
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:16,060
   I'm immediately transported  
      back to her kitchen.      

538
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,862
         I only knew how        
     to make matzo ball soup    

539
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:19,864
      from being taught by      
         my grandmother.        

540
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,465
MAN: Matzo ball soup.           

541
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,467
              What are we into? 
 Eggs. White pepper.            

542
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,402
  Ginger.                       
               Are matzo balls  
             always with ginger?

543
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,603
   They should be.              

544
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,939
         You do not know        
  how many people have come in  

545
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,874
         and said to me,        
   "I've started adding ginger  

546
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:32,143
        to my matzo balls       
and it makes a huge difference."

547
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,411
     Salt, oil.                 
                          Okay. 

548
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:34,946
 Mix this real good.            
                     Very nice. 

549
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,348
Now, matzo meal. You have to mix
  really carefully.             

550
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,615
               Or you'll get?   
  Lumps.                        

551
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,017
 We put that in the refrigerator
                for how long?   

552
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,151
 Four to five hours.            

553
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,686
             So it's chilled up,
              congealed enough  

554
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,021
    that it'll be able to scoop.
Correct.                        

555
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,556
                         Okay.  
So now we're going to roll      
   the matzo balls.             

556
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:46,891
Put your hands in the oil       
     like that.                 

557
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,025
             Smoothing them out.
That's it.                      

558
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:48,892
           How long do they take
                  to cook?      

559
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:49,960
  About 35 minutes.             

560
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,295
We'll take the stock,           

561
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,497
  add a little bit              
of a chicken base, carrots.     
                          Yep.

Now we take the matzo balls.

00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,569

             do you go through? 

567
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:02,840

               This is killer.

 Originally, my parents started 
         this business,         

571
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,251
     and then our son Jared,    

572
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:16,920
         he's been here         
  for about 14 years full-time. 

573
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,323
        And so that means       
     what my parents started    

574
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,925
    is going to continue on.    

575
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,793
     I've known Jared since     
          he was a tot.

We normally get, like,          
the matzo ball soup.

   we're gonna take the eggs,

     the milk, flour, water,    

583
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,209
  little bit of powdered sugar  
         for sweetness.         

584
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,278
       Then we mix it up.       

585
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,679
  Now we will make the Crepes.  

586
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,147
         Roll it around.        
   3 to 4 minutes on one side,  

587
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,683
        then you flip it,       
       turn off the heat,       

588
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:46,884
    and then they'll be done.   

589
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:47,818
       Next thing we'll do      
       is we'll fill them       

590
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,687
    with the ricotta filling.   

591
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:53,424
  Cream cheese, ricotta, eggs,  
  powdered sugar, and vanilla.  

592
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,693
   We're going to take a scoop  
    in each one, fold it in,    

593
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,029
         and pull it out        
 with our fingers, fold it over.

594
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,697
      We want to make sure      
     the edges stay inside.     

595
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:00,965
     We're going to put them    
           in the pan.          

596
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,234
    5 to 7 minutes each side.   

597
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:04,701
     And then we serve them     
          traditionally         

598
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,438

   and homemade cherry sauce.

Sweet on the inside, very light.
 You just want to get in there.

604
