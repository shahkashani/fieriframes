00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:02,067
 Hey, everybody, I'm Guy Fieri. 

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,068
     And we're rolling out,     

3
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,469
      looking for America's     
        greatest diners,        

4
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:07,005
      drive-ins and dives.      

5
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:07,673
          This trip...          

6
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:09,141
  [ Laughing ] Yes!             

7
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:10,876
   ...we're grabbing burgers,   

8
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:11,543
            bagels...           

9
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:12,444
         This should be illegal.

10
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:13,211
             buns...            

11
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,613
      Sun's out, buns out.      

12
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:17,149
         Please get me a T-shirt
               that says that.  

13
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:19,284
        ...and something        
         called bacorn?         

14
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:22,087
     I swear, I have never heard
             of this in my life.

15
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,889
     That's at a Los Angeles    
        joint mashing up        

16
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,157
           Korean with          
      a little bit of Cali.     

17
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:29,027
      There's nothing about this
that I don't think is fantastic.

18
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,896
              Plus,             
   two New Jersey brothers...   

19
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:32,631
      This dude                 
   gets after it.               

20
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,032
       ...who really know       
          their dough.          

21
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,301
               There's no way   
              I could keep up.  

22
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:38,236
        And a Portsmouth,       
      New Hampshire deli...     

23
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,305
 It's a small place             
  with big flavor.              

24
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:42,374
   ...amped up and lights out.  

25
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,775
That is outstanding.            

26
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,978
     That's all right here,     
            right now           

27

 on "Diners, Drive-ins & Dives."

28
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:04,262
   You go to Texas, you better  
  find some real-deal brisket.  

29
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,798
     You head up to Seattle,    
  better be some fresh seafood. 

30
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,601
        Over to Chicago,        
  it's gotta be the bomb pizza. 

31
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,669
     So when you end up here    
       on the East Coast,       

32
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:12,871
     what should you expect?    

33
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,673
         That's right --        
        righteous bagels.       

34
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,207
    We're here in Plainsboro,   
           New Jersey.          

35
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,877
 And this is Bagel Street Grill.

36
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,546
  Chicken Ruffino,              
      order up.                 

37
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,614
      New Jersey definitely     
       knows good bagels.       

38
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,549
    SERVER: Turkey, lettuce,    
        tomato on sesame.       

39
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:25,950
           Everything           
       with cream cheese.       

40
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,753
     -That's a legit bagel?     
             -Legit.            

41
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,287
       -Best in the state.      
           -Seriously?          

42
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,622
     Absolutely,                
    100 percent.                

43
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,424
   FIERI: That's 'cause owners  
          and brothers          

44
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,093
    Jimmy and Doug Rohr have    
     been busting out bagels    

45
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,562
   since they were teenagers.   

46
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:38,630
          Part-time job         
    while we were in college.   

47
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:40,365
        And we were like,       
 "Wow, this is a great business.

48
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,300
          Let's do it.          
     Let's do it ourselves."    

49
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,504
             FIERI:             
So they opened their first joint
     together back in 1988.     

50
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:46,905
              WOMAN: Can I help 
              the next person?  

51
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:49,241
   And they're still sticking   
    with the tried and true.    

52
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:50,508
                  You have      
              to boil a bagel.  

53
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,110
                  We do it      
          the old-fashioned way.

54
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,313
     And they're putting out    
          some volume.          

55
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:57,449
    We do about 15,000 bagels   
      a week, 20 varieties.     

56
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,318
Are there four other brothers   
  that do the work?             

57
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,387
  Two jalapeño cheddar bagels,  
            order up.           

58
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:05,123
   The jalapeño cheddar bagel   
         is my favorite.        

59
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,393
      A little bit spiced,      
     gotta be ready for it.     

60
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,795
         Okay, You've got, like,
      the legit bagel equipment.

61
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,931
JIMMY: Yes. This is what you    
need to produce a lot of them.  

62
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,065
            Give me the rundown,
                   Holmes.      

63
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,001
First, we're gonna start        
with a basic plain dough.       

64
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:18,536
We start off with some sugar,   
  some salt there.              

65
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,871
   We're gonna put              
  our water in now.             

66
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:20,538
                  "Watuh."      

67
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,606
  With some yeast.              

68
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,874
And then turn around,           

69
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,544
  we're gonna grab              
a bag of flour here.            

70
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,145
     [ Laughs ]                 

71
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,414
       This is                  
  a 50-pound dough.             

72
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,215
          How long will this go?

73
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,583
    We got about                
     15 minutes.                

74
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:32,617
In about 10 minutes,            

75
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,286
we'll start throwing in         
  our jalapeños --              

76
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:35,420
                The jalapeños   
              and the cheddar.  

77
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,822
And cheddar cheese.             
                          Okay. 

78
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,289
             That thing's huge. 

79
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,292
       And you didn't even roast
      the jalapeños or anything?

80
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:41,693
   No, we want it               
      to kick.                  

81
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,762
 -Yeah, the Jersey style, right?
        -Yeah, that's it.       

82
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:44,696
            So now what happens?

83
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,231
I'm gonna cut equal strips      

84
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,767
    to put right                
in this machine right here.     

85
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:49,835
      This first section's gonna

86
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,970
              divide the dough  
            into equal portions.

87
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,972
               It's gonna drop  
             onto this conveyor 

88
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,641
             and form the bagel.

89
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:57,175
          Do they have          
     a home version of this?    

90

 [ Laughing ] Right?            

92
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,246
We're gonna run this            
   a little slow.               

93
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,048
       It goes faster than this?
Oh, yeah.                       

94
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,916

  You got like 18 fingers, dude.
      I'm already watching this.

I've done a few bagels          
     in my life.                

99
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,391
               No, you think?   
              And from here --  

100
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,593
   These'll proof               
    for 3 hours.                

101
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:15,727
              Then they go dark 
               for the night.   

102
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:16,862

00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,083
                  3 minutes     
              on these boards.  

115
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,351
What temp are we running at?    

116
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:40,552
                 About 495.     

117
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,554
  Four ninety-five?             
These are ready to flip?        

118
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,690
The plastic gloves, again,      
are gonna be your only --       

119
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,424
                 No problem.    

120
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,293
     No fingers.                

121
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,367
And how long are they gonna ride
the carousel of heat?           

122
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,436
                For about 20,   
         25 minutes in here now.

123
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,371
                And we can do   
             12 dozen per shelf,

124
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,839
                five shelves    
                in that oven.   

125
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,243
              That's 60 dozen.  
   Keep them going all day long.

126
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:05,443
              [ Laughing ] Yep. 

127
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,711
    You're crazy.               

128
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:07,578
              [ Laughing ] Yes. 

129
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,381
  [ Laughing ] Yes!             

130
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:11,516
    There we go.                

131
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:14,052
             Look at that crust 
                   on it.       

132
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,320
  We should cut it              
       first.                   

133
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,120
               Do we toast it?  

134
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,455
I like them toasted.            

135
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,857
              I wanna toast it. 

136
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,392
          I'll go veggie spread.

137
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:21,660
Vegetable cream cheese.         

138
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:22,728
                What's in it?   

139
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,063
 Scallions, carrots,            
      broccoli,                 

140
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,865
little bit of onion powder      
      in there.                 

141
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,206
              Brother, I've had 
       a lot of jalapeño bagels.

142
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,741
         And all they do is waft
      the jalapeño over the top.

143
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,810
              You get serious.  
           There's heat in that.

144
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,612
           I mean, you can smell
                the jalapeño.   

145
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,680
              That's dynamite.  

146
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,014
        To see the whole process
                 go through,    

147
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,816
         it makes you appreciate
              it so much more.  

148
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:48,086
          That crust, that chew,
             soft in the middle,

149
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,554
                nice texture    
               on the outside.  

150
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,423
             Real deal, brother.
                 Real deal.     

151
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,425
            Jalapeño            
       with cream cheese.       

152
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:55,093
      It's got the perfect      
       crunch on the top.       

153
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,095
  WOMAN: The cheddar has, like, 
      a nice mildness to it     

154
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,830
        that counteracts        
       with the jalapeño.       

155
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,698
             I need             
   two Asiago bagels grilled.   

156
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,102
So, probably my favorite        
Neapolitan pizza chef           

157
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,905
in the world is Roberto         
 from Don Antonio's             

158
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,573
    and Raphael,                
   his son-in-law.              

159
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:11,176
So, brother, you lived          
in New York City long enough.   

160
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,443
You know good bagels.           
                        Yes.    

161
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,045
How are these bagels?           
                       Amazing. 

162
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,313
A bagel is very simple          

163
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,382
  but very similar              
to Neapolitan pizza.            

164
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,050
                 Absolutely.    
Really good ingredients,        

165
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,452
      handle it                 
   the right way,               

166
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:22,120
have the right equipment        
     to cook it.                

167
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,122
And if you don't mess with it,  
  it'll be perfect.             

168
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,457
              Oh, you're right. 
              It's very simple. 

169
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,660
             FIERI:             
 But A simple start doesn't mean
    there isn't a big finish.   

170
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,529
 JIMMY: Pork roll loaded burger.
            Order up.           

171
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,598
      Tater tots are on top     
       on an Asiago bagel.      

172
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,668
   The burger, it's got chunks  
   of pork roll built into it.  

173
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,404
    Pork roll's a type of ham   
  you can't get anywhere else.  

174
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:42,341
  It's a staple of New Jersey,  
 so why not put it in a burger? 

175
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,742
           You can't go anywhere

176
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,477
                in New Jersey   
        and not find a breakfast

177
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,811
               or lunch place   
    that doesn't have pork roll.

178
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,012
Everybody loves this.           

179
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,414
       All right, so what are we
              gonna do with it? 

180
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,682
  We're gonna open              
 this thing up here             

181
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,684
    and dig into                
    that canvas.                

182
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,686
             You know it's good 
           when it's got canvas.

183
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,487
We're gonna cut about           
a pound of this off.            

184
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,289
                It is cooked?   

185
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,357
    It is cooked.               

186
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,292
     We're going                
   to cube it up.               

187
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:01,827
                  And then,     
          you're gonna fry it...
Yes.                            

188
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:04,363
            ...and then stuff it
              into the burger?  
  Yes.                          

189
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:06,164
       That's                   
deep-fried pork roll.           

190
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,568
          It tastes like a cross
     between salami and bologna.

191
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,702
              It's like bologna 
                with texture.   

192
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,636
   You nailed it.               

193
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:12,704
                 All right.     
          Let's see what you do.

194
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,573
    We start with               
  our chopped meat.             

195
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,308
 Gonna load it with             
our pork roll, two eggs.        

196
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,577
   Minced garlic.               

197
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:19,444
               A bunch of it.   

198
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:20,912
Worcestershire sauce.           

199
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,114
      Oh, yeah.                 

200
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:25,250
Onion powder, salt and pepper,  
  and bread crumbs.             

201
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,853
                    Mix this up.
    Patty it up.                
      Flattop.                  

202
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:28,920
And right alongside of it,      

203
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,923
  we're gonna grill             
  our Asiago bagel.             

204
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:32,991
     All right.                 

205
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,926
  Top that with our             
pork roll-loaded burger.        

206
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,662
Gonna add our tater tots,       
fresh outta the fryer,          

207
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:40,132
   our house-made               
Thousand Island dressing.       

208
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:41,833
                What is wrong   
                  with you?     

209
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,671
         This should be illegal.

210
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,039
               But it's good.   

211
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,210
           You got salty, fatty,
              an awesome bagel. 

212
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,879
             The little nuggets,
               the pork roll,   

213
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:56,214
         you get your French fry
          already built into it.

214
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,615
                When you have   
                a bagel joint   

215
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,951
and you wanna play mad scientist
  and make something for people,

216
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,219
         in the New Jersey area,

217
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,488
             you love pork roll,
             that's your burger.

218
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,822
    SERVER: Pork roll burger.   

219
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,691
         The bagels make        
      the sandwich better.      

220
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:07,758
FIERI: Have you ever had        
     pork roll?                 

221
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,626
          Yeah, I have.         

222
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,695
          But it never          
        tasted like this.       

223
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,096
         Morning, guys.         

224
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,565
       It's very nice food      
       all the way around.      

225
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,033
             Just one more bite,
                  just one.     

226
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,236
            Just for the flavor.

227
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,437
               Yeah. Nice job.  

228
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,104
       Thanks.                  

229
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,540
              Wrap that to go.  

230
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:28,379
 FIERI: Coming up, a Los Angeles
   spot loading up the buns...  

231
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,981
        You got people lining up
                for that one.   

232
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,583
       ...and putting out       
      one funky bar snack.      

233
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,153
    Where have I been that I did
     not know about corn cheese?

234
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,824
       And we were, like,       
         working in a --        

235
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,092
     a -- part -- uh, in --     
       for a bagel store.       

236
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,160
    Were you guys               
   in karate, too?              

237
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,762
                Yeah!           
What was going on there?        

238
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,767
    So, I'm here in Koreatown   
         in Los Angeles         

239
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,902
   to check out a funky joint   
     called the Biergarten.     

240
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,236
       Wait, wait, wait --      
         the Biergarten?        

241
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,705
     No, that was years ago.    
       What am I thinking?      

242
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,373
        No, I'm directly        
        across the street       

243
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,375
      to check out a place      
  that started as a food truck  

244
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,110
    and then went full-blown    
        brick and mortar.       

245
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,812
      This is the Bun Shop.     

246
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,449
      It is delicious, man.     

247
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:05,784
        All right, guys.        
           You hungry?          

248
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:10,188
 It is a very cool, contemporary
      take on Korean food.      

249
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,389
          Korean tacos.         

250
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,657
    WOMAN: Feels almost like    
     you're eating something    

251
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,926
     you shouldn't be eating    
    'cause it tastes so good.   

252
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,260
         Spicy pig buns         
          for service.          

253
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,796
     The food truck started     
   from two guys from Detroit.  

254
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:22,533
 James went to culinary school. 
    Brian was a businessman.    

255
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,135
        I was here first,       
       working corporate.       

256
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,336
           And he was           
          in New York.          

257
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,072
      I just called him up      
       on a whim and said,      

258
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,673
        "Would you wanna        
        start the truck?"       

259
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,942
             FIERI:             
  After a few years of earning  
   their cred on the streets,   

260
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:33,411
       high-school buddies      
    James Seok and Brian Yeun   

261
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:36,548
     set up a permanent shop    
            in 2014.            

262
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,815
      SERVER: Temp veg bun.     

263
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,217
   WOMAN: Not many food trucks  
        make it to brick.       

264
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,485
         But Bun Shop is        
            the place           

265
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:41,753
       that you chase down      
      because of the food.      

266
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,555
   Can we fire up               
 five buns, please?             

267
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:46,358
   The bun is actually, like,   
    super-soft Wonder Bread.    

268
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,559
       It's light, sticky.      

269
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:48,960
              YEUN:             
     It's a Chinese bao bun.    

270
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,095
           So you bring the buns
         in from a Chinese baker

271
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,630
               that knows how   
             to make great bun. 

272
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,499
   -And you don't reinvent it.  
         -That's right.         

273
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,567
  FIERI: You just get to decide 
       what to put it in.       

274
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:57,836
Kalbi buns for service.         

275
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:58,970
   WOMAN: The kalbi beef bun,   

276
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,105
      it's got such a good      
    traditional Korean taste.   

277
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:04,042
      Very sweet and savory     
        at the same time.       

278
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,710
             All right, brother.
    Where are we at? Talk to me.

279
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,178
  We're here to do              
   our kalbi bun.               

280
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,446
We start with the onion         
  and garlic purée.             

281
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,848
           And what type of meat
               are you using?   

282
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,316
It's a nice beef strip.         

283
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,785
We let this sit for about       
an hour to tenderize it.        

284
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,053
                Now we'll go    
             into the marinade. 

285
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,988
   Puréed ginger,               
   puréed garlic,               

286
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,856
    white sugar,                
    brown sugar.                

287
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,391
       This is                  
 our cider vinegar.             

288
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,260
So this is not too traditional  
of a kalbi marinade.            

289
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,662
          -Oh, really?          
              -Yes.             

290
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,330
             No, I didn't know, 
    with the apple cider vinegar

291
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:26,431
              jumping in there. 

292
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,333
We got toasted sesame oil,      
  some corn syrup,              

293
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:31,069
soy sauce, room-temp water,     
     apple soda.                

294
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,071
                  Apple soda?   
And then some cola.             

295
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,539
                 Some cola?     
Yes, sir.                       

296
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,741
                 Very, very     
                traditional.    

297
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,943
     Mix it up.                 

298
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:41,012
 Make sure the sugar            
somewhat dissolves in there.    

299
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,683
                 Put that on    
                 a bath mat.    

300
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,484
               That pours over  
            the tenderized meat.

301
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,619
 After the marinade             
      has been                  

302
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:48,953
  sitting in there              
 for about 24 hours,            

303
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:52,089
take some canola oil,           
kalbi beef that we marinated.   

304
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,626
Let it go here a solid minute,  
 minute and a half.             

305
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:55,627
               What's up next?  

306
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:56,628
    Spicy aioli.                

307
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,362
We'll start with our mayo,      
    sour cream --               

308
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,430
                 Corn syrup?    

309
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,765
        You don't see corn syrup
                much anymore.   

310
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,633
It's a Korean thing,            
      I think.                  

311
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:02,767
                   Sambal?      

312
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,370
Yep, Sambal, Sriracha,          
garlic paste, honey.            

313
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,239
        And a little sesame oil?
Toasted sesame oil.             

314
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,840
     Looks like Thousand Island,

315
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,576
               tastes like...   

316
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:12,711
        <i> Korean</i> Thousand Island.

317
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:13,845
     [ Laughs ]                 

318
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,380
                 All right.     
               Steam the bun.   

319
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:16,715
  About 3 minutes.              

320
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,916
So we take our steamed buns     
here, line the bottom           

321
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,919
  with our homemade             
     spicy aioli                

322
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,920
    with a layer                
of our mixed greens.            

323
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,089
Put our freshly cooked          
     kalbi beef.                

324
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,058
   -My mouth's starting to --   
           -Oh, yeah.           

325
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,160
And then we have a tempura fried
  onion over here.              

326
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,261
              Of course you do. 

327
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,463
      Yes, sir.                 

328
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,068
              Oh, that's good.  
    The bun is not super-doughy.

329
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,402
            It's a great vessel.

330
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,272
        Kinda like a really good
        handmade flour tortilla.

331
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,941
     Marinade on the meat is not
     too sweet, not too gingery.

332
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,578
          The spicy aioli really
     counterbalances everything.

333
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,416
        Has a good yin and yang.

334
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,017
             I can see why it's 
 your signature. It's fantastic.

335
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,285
Thank you, sir.                 
                   Really good. 

336
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,687
           Kalbi buns           
          for service.          

337
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,356
     That beef has just got that
   great Korean barbecue flavor.

338
00:10:58,358 --> 00:10:59,090
             What about the bun?

339
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,358
MAN: It's very soft.            

340
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,360
 It really blends it            
    all together.               

341
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,628
            Katsu bun           
         in the window.         

342
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,097
     The Bun Shop has a lot     
 of different options for people

343
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:09,033
        who may not know        
  that much about Korean food.  

344
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,769
         Spicy pig buns         
          for service.          

345
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:14,038
  The spicy pig is really good. 
       It has a nice kick.      

346
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,639
  All right, Chef.              
We got our spicy pig.           

347
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,842
This is the one with that       
tzatziki sauce in it, homemade. 

348
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:18,843
                Korean Greek.   

349
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,044
       Oh, it's nice and tender.

350
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,112
         Nice spice, great pork.

351
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,380
        -Thank you, sir.        
   -So tell me about this one.  

352
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,783
 Two temp veg buns.             

353
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:27,918
    The tempura vegetable one   
      is more veggie-style.     

354
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,386
           And I love           
       the fried avocado.       

355
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,856
We've got a jalapeño cilantro   
aioli inside the bottom,        

356
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,658
    fresh tomato,               
 our grilled onions,            

357
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,461
and then our tempura fried      
avocado with cilantro.          

358
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:37,995
               You got people   
         lining up for that one.

359
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,063
       I mean,                  
we're in California.            

360
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,197
We gotta do something           
    with avocado.               

361
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:40,865
                 Delicious.     

362
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,067
   Thank you, sir.              

363
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,069
          The temp veg          
      is truly my favorite.     

364
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:45,936
    The tempura and the avocado,
        throwing it with veggies

365
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,205
       and wrapping it in a bun.

366
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,606
 Only in California.            

367
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,809
  FIERI: But I don't know where 
   <i> this</i> dish is coming from.   

368
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,276
             Service            
       for bacorn cheese.       

369
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,745
               FIERI: Bacorn?   

370
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,413
             So that's your play
             on bacon and corn. 

371
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,948
Yeah. Corn cheese is, like,     
a pretty traditional bar snack. 

372
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,484
                Corn cheese?    
      Yes, sir.                 

373
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:02,286
We add our bacon to it.         
     We have to.                

374
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,622
        Where have I been that I
  do not know about corn cheese?

375
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,891
       If they're serving       
      cheesy corn, I'm in.      

376
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,028
  FIERI: Definitely sign me up, 
     too, when we come back.    

377
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,938
             FIERI:             
   "Triple D" is at full steam  
   in Koreatown, Los Angeles,   

378
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,741
     at a neighborhood spot,    
          the Bun Shop.         

379
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,876
       Katsu and temp veg       
          for service.          

380
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,412
  FIERI: When people are looking
               for good buns,   

381
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,079
        this is where they come?

382
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,214
      Sun's out, buns out.      

383
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:32,016
         Please get me a T-shirt
               that says that.  

384
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,284
  FIERI: But despite the name,  

385
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,820
   buns aren't the only thing   
        on the menu here.       

386
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,822
    Bacorn cheese right here.   

387
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,558
  Bacon and corn and cheese --  
       it's really unique.      

388
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,094
   I've never seen the bacorn   
    in any other restaurant.    

389
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,830
      FIERI: But Chef James     
      tells me corn cheese      

390
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:48,232
           is a common          
     Korean bar food snack.     

391
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,101
       They traditionally       
        call it an anju.        

392
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,237
   And they put their own spin  
           on it here.          

393
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,572
           I swear, I have never
       heard of this in my life.

394
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:58,042
     It is a little skillet     
       full of yumminess.       

395
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,710
      -Okay, bacorn cheese.     
             -Okay.             

396
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:00,778
     Wok is on.                 

397
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,447
                  This wok,     
              just so you know, 

398
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,249
              we are, like, at  
            60,000, 80,000 BTUs.

399
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,517
So we're gonna start off        
with some butter here.          

400
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,920
Throw our chopped bacon in,     
 chopped jalapeños.             

401
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:09,988
            Another Korean item.

402
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,789
Yeah. Well, you know...         
    We're in L.A.               

403
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,057
Go with our sweet corn,         

404
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:15,126
a little bit of garlic here,    
     scallions.                 

405
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:15,927
               Bacorn cheese.   

406
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:16,861
   Bacorn cheese.               

407
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:18,663
  Salt and pepper.              
     Toss it up.                

408
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:19,998
            Oh, look at you work
                  the wok.      

409
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,865
      Yes, sir.                 

410
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,934
              That's just sexy  
                 in itself.     

411
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,803
               Can I get that   
             in slo-mo, please? 

412
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,742
              Yeah, that's what 
             I'm talking about. 

413
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:32,944
This is condensed milk          
      and mayo.                 

414
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,412
               Condensed milk   
               and mayonnaise?  

415
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,480
This is like a bar food snack   
   type of thing.               

416
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,682
  So mozzarella --              

417
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,151
              Another one of my 
     favorite fine Korean items.

418
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,085
     Of course.                 

419
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,887
      Get this                  
well incorporated here.         

420
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:43,955
And then, we'll top it off      

421
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,491
  with the rest of              
our mozzarella here.            

422
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,692
               Then it goes in  
               the salamander?  

423
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,561
Goes in the salamander,         
get a nice color on there.      

424
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:51,629
30, 45 seconds.                 
                    Korean dish.

425
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:52,563
     [ Laughs ]                 

426
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:53,832
     Come out of                
the salamander here.            

427
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,568
   Scallions here.              
And it's ready to go.           

428
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,970
               When did Korea   
                hit Alabama?    

429
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,673
     [ Laughs ]                 

430
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,444
               There's nothing  
                 about this     

431
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,647
           that I don't think is
                 fantastic.     

432
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,182
                It's creamy,    
               a little sweet,  

433
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,718
     a little salt to the bacon,
              really good corn. 

434
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,786
                  It pops.      

435
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:16,787
             Not overly cheesy, 
              not overly salty. 

436
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,456
            Not overly anything.
             It's a great dish. 

437
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,591
             But I've never seen
              anything like it. 

438
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:21,593
             Do you know a chef 
         named Damaris Phillips?

439
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:23,595
          She's one of my judges
       on "Guy's Grocery Games,"

440
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:25,462
        quite the Southern chef.

441
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,498
               If this is not   
                Damaris 101,    

442
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,267
           Louisville, Kentucky,
                 corn dish,     

443
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,534
               I wouldn't know  
                  what is.      

444
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,203
                 Excellent.     
Thank you, Chef.

00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,338
       Bacorn for service.      

446
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,339
       I have never, ever,      
   ever had anything like it.   

447
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,808
         Very flavorful         
        and really good.        

448
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,342
     Mama wings for service.    

449
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,145
 The Bun Shop allows you to have
 a new, contemporary experience 

450
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,281
         but also enjoy         
     the traditional flavors    

451
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:44,749
       of Korean culture.       

452
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,484
                  Awesome.      
              Congratulations.  

453
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:47,619
                  Happy for you.
Thank you, sir.                 

454
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,289
         FIERI: Up next,        
      a New Hampshire spot      

455
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,490
     claiming to be a deli.     

456
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,158
  You guys have got             
a lot going on here.            

457
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,361
  But what I'm finding here --  
  well, it's a whole lot more.  

458
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,629
The only thing wrong            
   with that dish,              

459
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,365
there's not another nine ribs   
  connected to it.              

460
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,941
     So I'm here in downtown    
   Portsmouth, New Hampshire,   

461
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:12,009
     about a third of a mile    
    from the Piscataqua River   

462
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,611
      to check out a joint      
  where a chef from New Jersey  

463
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,081
  and a chef from Connecticut,  
    well, they migrated north   

464
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,550
          and opened up         
      a not-so-common deli.     

465
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,886
      This is the Kitchen.      

466
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,956
      The Meatball Diavolo.     

467
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,024
      The food's delicious.     

468
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,092
      Just amazing flavor.      

469
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,294
           Plating the Angelina.

470
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,696
      It's hard to walk by      
       without coming in.       

471
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:34,098
             FIERI:             
    Been that way since 2011,   

472
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,368
 when owners and restaurant vets
    Matt Greco and Mike Prete   

473
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,039
    brought some bold flavors   
   into this little port town.  

474
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,573
               Bolognese pizza  
               in the window.   

475
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:45,777
   It's a New York-style deli   
          on steroids.          

476
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,111
                 Tuscan up.     

477
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,980
 FIERI: 'Cause while the menu's 
    loaded with sandwiches...   

478
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:49,914
SERVER: Turkey club.            

479
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,382
...they aren't serving this dish

480
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,783
       at any deli I know.      

481
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,851
    Kitchen ribs.               

482
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,386
              This, right here, 
              is a meal for me. 

483
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,722
 They fall off the bone, melt in
 your mouth. They're delicious. 

484
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:58,723
  What are we into?             

485
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:00,458
               So we're gonna   
               brine our ribs.  

486
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,528
             First up -- water, 
              red wine vinegar, 

487
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,795
              juniper berries,  

488
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,997
                kosher salt,    
               black pepper --  

489
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:07,799
   Fresh-ground?                
                 Fresh-ground.  

490
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,934
       Brown sugar, dried thyme,
                 dried dill,    

491
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:13,604
             star anise, garlic,
              red pepper flake. 

492
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,072
     Then we mix                
    this all up.                

493
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,607
St. Louis-style rib.            

494
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,142
  So what we did is             
  took a spare rib.             

495
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,010
It's cut down so it's           
 in a uniform shape.            

496
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,745
And I see you got a little      
flap meat on there, too?        

497
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:22,747
                     Yep.       
All right.                      

498
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,014
           We leave that all on.

499
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,816
     Fantastic.                 
   Love the brine.              

500
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,020
Pork and vinegar just           
 go so hand-in-hand.            

501
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:30,354
             This is gonna brine
                 overnight.     

502
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,423
     Next step, we're gonna make
              our barbecue rub. 

503
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:35,159
       So we got smoked paprika,
               seasoning salt,  

504
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,562
            ground black pepper,
                brown sugar,    

505
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,097
     get a little caramelization
                   on it,       

506
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,432
        chili powder and ginger,
               ground ginger.   

507
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:42,900
              Just mix that up. 

508
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,769
 So these have been             
 down for 24 hours.             

509
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:45,903
                  24 hours.     

510
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,438
     I'm gonna need a little bit
               of that brine.   

511
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,572
       Just so                  
there's some liquid.            

512
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,174
           Then we're gonna take
              our barbecue rub  

513
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,575
         and just rub them down.

514
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,311
 So you're building             
a little bit of the bark.       

515
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,245
              And this will go  
             into the oven, 350,

516
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,114
             for about 2 hours. 

517
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,450
      I'm gonna portion them up,
                single bone.    

518
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,350
Little more of the rub.         

519
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,585
               Put those right  
                on our grill.   

520
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,920
   That's a nice,               
     meaty rib.                 

521
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,355
              They get a nice,  
  little caramelization to them,

522
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,656
           heated right through.

523
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,992
            We're gonna put some
   of our agrodolce sauce on it.

524
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,660
    Agrodolce --                
a little sweet and sour.        

525
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:12,130
              Actually, ours is 
  a little more sweet and spicy.

526
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,331
              Little molasses.  

527
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,632
           We'll plate these up.

528
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,069
    Give you a little more sauce
   because if you're eating ribs

529
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:20,404
          and you're not licking
          your fingers, there's 
          something wrong.      

530
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,040
               We'll give you   
               a little green.  

531
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,943
I'm a big vinegar fan.          

532
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,945
So when I saw that on the menu, 
     I thought,                 

533
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:31,816
       "Okay.                   
I wanna get after this."        

534
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:33,484
 It totally delivers            
       there.                   

535
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:36,821
 The dry rub is also            
  really on point.              

536
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:40,625
   But the kicker               
is this agrodolce sauce.        

537
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:44,028
You have your red pepper        
 and vinegar and...             

538
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,897
                  Little garlic.
    Garlicky.                   

539
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,164
The only thing wrong            
   with that dish,              

540
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,967
there's not another nine ribs   
  connected to it.              

541
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,669
That is outstanding.            

542
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,105
              Kitchen ribs up.  

543
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,440
    Nice little bark on top,    
         great flavors.         

544
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,842
   MAN: Anybody that tells you  
    you have to go down south   

545
00:17:57,844 --> 00:17:59,443
          for good ribs         
       is sadly mistaken.       

546
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,879
        All the food here       
         is super-fresh.        

547
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,847
         And the flavors        
        are very unique.        

548
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,316
    FIERI: So are the names.    

549
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:08,118
  Franky Boom Bahtz             
and the Eh Yo Mikey burger.     

550
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,388
 Plus, there's this lamb burger 
      with an Indian twist.     

551
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,723
     SERVER: The Apu burger.    

552
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:13,724
         The Apu burger.        

553
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:14,659
                  The what?     

554
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:16,594
    Apu from "The Simpsons."    

555
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,663
 WOMAN: The mix of the chutneys 
         and the cheese         

556
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:21,265
    and the Indian spices --    
           so amazing.          

557
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,666
       FIERI:                   
What are we making first?       

558
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,402
      We're gonna make the mango
     chutney for the Apu burger.

559
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,937
              Put a little oil  
                 in our pan.    

560
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,941
  We're gonna throw in shallots,
      jalapeño, red bell pepper,

561
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,276
        crushed fennel in there.

562
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,010
       Great.                   

563
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:34,011
                Kosher salt,    

564
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,614
              some curry powder 
              and black pepper. 

565
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,082
               We're gonna add  
                 our mango.     

566
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:39,684
 Canned?                        
         These are frozen mango.

567
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:40,951
              Sweat these down  
                a little bit,   

568
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,820
       get some of those flavors
             coming outta there.

569
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,288
          Got some orange juice.

570
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,756
            Apple cider vinegar,
                brown sugar.    

571
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,024
                Cook down for   
              about 15 minutes. 

572
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,159
     I love it.                 

573
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:51,162
      Then we're gonna finish it
             with chopped lychee

574
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:53,431
            and some poppy seed,
         just to add some color.

575
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:54,298
         Let that sit overnight.

576
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,365
     All right.                 
    Lamb burger.                

577
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,833
                Pat it down.    

578
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,502
                We season it    
        with our lamb seasoning,

579
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,705
          which is garam masala,
              salt and pepper.  

580
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:01,639
    Got it. Okay.               

581
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,707
               We're gonna let  
                  that go.      

582
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:03,841
  What temperature              
are we cooking that to?         

583
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,243
          We're gonna go medium.

584
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,244
             While that's going,
        we'll get our bun going.

585
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,512
                   This is      
             our brioche onion. 

586
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,913
Locally made?                   
                      Yep.      

587
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,183
              We're gonna take  
         our cilantro lime mayo,

588
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,784
                  put this      
        right on top of the bun,

589
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,253
            the mango chutney --

590
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:16,787
             Ground pistachios. 

591
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,055
That's a nice touch.            

592
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:19,390
                  Come over     
             to our feta cheese.

593
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,791
Funky with the feta.            

594
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,459
               We just give it  
  a little dusting on the cheese

595
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,460
        with our lamb seasoning.

596
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,930
              Our lamb burger's 
                ready to go.    

597
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,666
               Finish it with   
        a little fresh cilantro.

598
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,867
              And there you go. 

599
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,134
  Heck of a burger.             

600
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:34,005
 Lots of great juice            
 coming out of that.            

601
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:37,275
It's a picture-perfect          
 funky lamb burger.             

602
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:42,012
     It's rich,                 
 perfectly seasoned.            

603
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,615
 The garam masala --            
      spot-on.                  

604
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:47,885
I thought it was gonna be       
too much feta. By no means.     

605
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,420
Chutney adds that --            

606
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,622
that big array of sweetness     
   that you need,               

607
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,423
     the balance                
    to the feta.                

608
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,693
Mmm. That's one of the better   
lamb burgers I've ever had.     

609
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,963
   It's a great mix of flavors  
         that, usually,         

610
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,331
      you wouldn't expect.      

611
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,965
                Have you had    
        this lamb burger before?

612
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,434
         -It's amazing.         
       -It's redunkulous.       

613
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,969
     So a couple of our partners
    in crime with No Kid Hungry,

614
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,505
       this is Alisha and Emily.

615
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,306
     As great as a super country
                 as we are,     

616
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:13,010
     we still have kids going to
 school hungry every single day.

617
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,378
     About one in five kids     

618
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,113
    in this country struggle    
          with hunger.          

619
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,781
     Here in the Northeast,     
     we work really closely     

620
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,383
     with the New Hampshire     
           Food Bank.           

621
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,918
       And there are sites      
        where kids can go       

622
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,186
        and they can get        
         a healthy meal.        

623
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,320
               How do they get  
              more information? 

624
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,389
  Nokidhungry.org,              
and everyone can go.            

625
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,657
  And everyone has              
the strength to share.          

626
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:27,925
               That's awesome,  
        what you guys are doing.

627
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,193
                Have you been   
          to the Kitchen before?

628
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:32,196
I come here literally           
every time I come to Portsmouth.

629
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:33,464
             WOMAN:             
     It's wholesome, fresh.     

630
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:36,667
          And it's what         
      I really love to eat.     

631
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,069
  You guys have got             
a lot going on here.            

632
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,003
I mean, it's a small place      
  with big flavor.              

633
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:40,804
 Outstanding, Chef.             

634
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,073
                 Thank you.     
     Well done.                 

635
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,941
  Was that a road trip or what? 

636
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,277
        But don't worry.        

637
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:49,013
   There's plenty more joints   
  all over this great country.  

638
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,983
     I'll be looking for you    
    next time on "Triple D."    

639
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:56,020
      Anybody drop 5 bucks?     

640
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:57,288
           Five bucks?          

641
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,089
           Five bucks?          
      You dropped 5 bucks?      

642
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,391
          There you go.
