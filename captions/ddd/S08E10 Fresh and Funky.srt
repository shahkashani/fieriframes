WHY IODIZED?                    
     IT'S JUST MORE CONCENTRATED
     SALT FLAVOR. ITALIAN HERBS.

THE ONLY QUESTION I HAVE IS     

218
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:54,299
  I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE  
DOING IT ON THESE PANINI GRILLS.

MMM.                            

235
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,605

   THAT IS AWESOME.             

239
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,548
     WE'RE GONNA GET OUR BREAD--
             SOURDOUGH--        

240

 AND THEN WE'RE GONNA JUST START
BUILDING--A LITTLE BIG OF DIJON.

241
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,086
            SO THEN GOAT CHEESE.
SOUR CREAM.                     

242
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,688
       DIJON, SALT AND PEPPER-- 
             BLEND IT UP.       

243
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,757
                BLEND IT UP--   
             GOAT CHEESE SPREAD.
(whistles)                      

244
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,759
              AND THEN WE PUT   
          SOME TRI-TIP ON THERE.

245
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,628
             I'M GONNA MAKE     
         THE CARAMELIZED ONIONS.

246
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,163
     WE START WITH SOME BUTTER, 
             OLIVE OIL,         

247
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,031
   SOME SLICED SPANISH ONIONS,  
          KOSHER SALT,          

248
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,833
               THEN SOME CRACKED
                 BLACK PEPPER.  

249
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,635
       AND WE'RE GONNA COOK THAT
         FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES,  

250
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,203
    SO IT'S REALLY CARAMELIZED. 

251
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,905
            THEN WE'RE GONNA ADD
              SOME FRESH THYME, 

252
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:08,506
             AND WE'RE NOT GONNA
                COOK THAT IN,   

253
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,775
 BECAUSE THAT COOKS WHEN WE MAKE
    THE PANINI ON THE GRILL.    

254
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,311
              PUT THE LID ON IT.
              TIME TO GRILL IT. 
RUN THE TEMPERATURE             
     AT WHAT?                   

255
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,647
                 450. IT TAKES  
               ABOUT 10 MINUTES.

256
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,582
                     HERE WE GO.
SEE, THAT'S WHAT I LIKE--       
     REALLY CRUSTY.             

257
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,851
     WE DON'T PUT BUTTER OR OIL.
      SO WE'RE READY TO EAT IT. 

258
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,254
        JUST GIVE IT A BIG CHOP.
               HERE WE GO.      

259
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,690
MMM, GREAT SANDWICH.            

260

BUT IT'S PACKED.                
                         MM-HMM.

261
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:31,662
 YOU GOT THE NICE, SWEET FLAVOR 
   OF THE CARAMELIZED ONIONS,   

262
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,998

GRILLED MEAT TASTE.

00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,401
YOU GET A LITTLE BIT OF THAT    
 GOAT CHEESE BITTERNESS...      
          MM-HMM.               

264
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,203
 WITHOUT IT BEING OVERPOWERING. 
        IT'S DONE RIGHT.        

265
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,672
    (woman)                     
COWGIRL PANINI.                 
        IT'S WONDERFUL.         

266
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:44,609
    THE GOAT CHEESE ON THERE    
  MAKES IT VERY, VERY CREAMY.   
               (woman) IT'S GOT 
               THE SMOKY FLAVOR.

267

00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,764
              HOW ARE WE GONNA  
           PREPARE THIS BAD BOY?
BY BOILING IT.                  

356
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,900
          A LITTLE BIT OF SALT--
                THAT'S IT.      
THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE.           

357
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,102
NOW HOW LONG IS THIS GONNA      
   GO DOWN FOR, ALLAN?          
               ABOUT 18 MINUTES.

358
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,172
COOL THING ABOUT THIS IS        
   AFTER WE COOK THIS,          

359
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:35,906
IT'S GONNA TURN                 
BRIGHT ORANGE.                  
                    AND THEN WE 
                    PULL IT OUT.

360
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,575
WE'LL ICE-BATH IT.              
             TO STOP THE COOKING
             PROCESS. (whistles)

361
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,577
               LOOK AT THE COLOR
                   ON THAT.     

362
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:43,047
                  ARE YOU A BODY
                  OR A LEG MAN? 
A LEG MAN, MYSELF.              

363
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,182
                 ARE YOU REALLY?
OH, YEAH.                       

364
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:45,516
            SEE, I'M A BODY GUY.
ALL RIGHT.                      

365
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,452
        SO LET IT HANG OUT WHAT?
THREE TO FIVE MINUTES.          

366
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,454
                  AND THEN, UH, 
                 WE'LL CLEAN IT.
AND WE'RE READY                 
   TO ROLL.                     

367
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,522
     OKAY, SO THIS IS THE CLAWS,
              THE LEGS,         

368
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,724
       THE BODY MEAT, AND NOW   
     IT'S GONNA GO TO A HOT PAN.

369
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,460
A LITTLE BIT OF OLIVE OIL,      
     GET HER STARTED.           

370
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:57,928
                  A LITTLE SALT.
SO YOU SEASON THE OIL           
    A LITTLE BIT.               

371
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:00,064
               A LITTLE PEPPER. 
               ONCE IT HEATS UP,

372
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,800
         A LITTLE BIT OF GARLIC.
    FORGET IT THEN.             
I WON'T HOLD THE CRAB.          

373
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,669
              (laughs) GARLIC'S 
             THE KEY, YOU KNOW. 

374
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,737
     WITH THIS DISH,            
I WOULD EXPECT IT TO BE.        

375
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:10,141
           A LITTLE BIT OF CRAB.
 SO THE CRAB'S                  
ALREADY COOKED.                 

376
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:13,544
AND NOW IT'S TIME TO KIND OF    
   FORTIFY IT WITH FLAVOR.      

377
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,081
YOU SHOULD SMELL THIS           
   RIGHT NOW. WOW.              
               IT'S ALMOST LIKE 
                A HOT MARINADE. 

378
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,617
OKAY.                           
                    A LITTLE BIT
                    OF PARSLEY. 

379
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,952
                    WHITE WINE. 

380
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:25,890
               A SPLASH OF LEMON
                    OR TWO.     
A NICE, BIG OL' PAT             
    OF BUTTER.                  

381
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,625
I MEAN, CAN YOU COOK IT         
      ANY FASTER?               
      YES. THEN YOU JUST GIVE IT
        A LITTLE BIT OF A SET.  

382
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:32,030
WHAT ARE WE GONNA               
SERVE THAT WITH?                
                SOURDOUGH BREAD.

383
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:33,564
          GET HER TO THE PLATE. 

384
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,633
        (exhales sharply) WHOA. 

385
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:38,102
GET CARRIED AWAY THERE.         
                SO YOU SAY      
          THAT YOU'RE A LEG MAN.

386
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:40,104
      GO AHEAD AND SPEND ALL DAY
               ON THOSE.        

387

           THE, UH, LEMON JUICE,

390
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,448
        BUT IT'S ALSO GOT SOME  
      OF THAT GREAT CRAB FLAVOR.
AND THE WHITE WINE.             

391
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,784
         THIS IS GETTIN' MESSY. 

392
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,920

 WITH HAVING JALAPEÑO INVOLVED. 

474

475
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,188
