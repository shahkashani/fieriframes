1
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:02,801
          I'm Guy Fieri         
     and we're rolling out,     

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:04,202
      looking for America's     
        greatest diners,        

3
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:06,738
      drive-ins and dives.      

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,740
          This trip...          
             Suwee!             

5
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,275
 We're headed into the smoker...

6
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,444
              Wow.              
      Onto the flat top...      

7
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,546
             Mm-hmm.            
   And down into the fryer...   

8
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:16,548
   That's fried chicken city.   
            In Miami.           

9
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,617
       See, he didn't take      
any television bite right there.

10
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,219
     A legit charcuterie...     

11
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:21,420
 Where's this been all my life? 

12
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:23,755
          House-makin'          
       some meaty magic...      

13
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:25,223
 We've got life-changing bacon. 

14
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,426
     In Modesto, California.    
              Cut.              

15
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:29,428
   A monster taco trifecta...   

16
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,029
        We've just about        
        gone ridiculous.        

17
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,699
      Alongside a breakfast     
          lunch mashup.         

18
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,501
     We're making a sandwich    
       out of the waffle?       

19
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:36,568
     And over in Stockton...    

20
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,902
    Oh, look at her go, now.    

21
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,304
    A sporty husband-and-wife   

22
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:40,506
             team...            
           All right.           

23
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:42,974
           We're good.          
  Gets saucy with their wings.  

24
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,911
      This is just a funky,     
          crunchy wing.         

25
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:49,581
     That's all right here,     
     right now, on Triple D.    

26
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,195
 So, I'm here in Miami, Florida 

27
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,931
        in an area known        
        as Little Havana.       

28
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:08,199
       And I haven't been       
     here since, like, 2009.    

29
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,334
       It's been too long.      

30
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:10,736
    Here to check out a joint   

31
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,405
  where two high school buddies 
  took a wild catering project  

32
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,006
    and turned it, literally,   

33
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,209
  into an artisan pig emporium. 

34
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,611
    So we got Miami Smokers.    

35
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:22,047
     You're gonna dig this.     

36
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,484
         MAN: These are         
    bacon-wrapped plantains.    

37
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,620
    From a block away you can   
    actually smell the smoke.   

38
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,488
      And it just leads you     
  right into the front doorway. 

39
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,690
  MAN: Barbecue Boar, order up. 

40
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,091
  We don't have a lot of, like, 

41
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,693
       smokehouses here in      
         south Florida.         

42
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:35,960
     So to smell that smell,    

43
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,563
     it reminds me of being     
  in somewhere like Tennessee.  

44
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:40,432
             FIERI:             
 That's where Andres Barrientos 
        and James Bowers        

45
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,701
   picked up their mad curing   
       and smoking skills       

46
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:45,103
         before bringin'        
        it back to Miami.       

47
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,840
 MAN: It started off as a pop-up
  brunch, started making bacon. 

48
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:51,376
       Before long, we're       
  in full-on bacon production.  

49
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:53,912
       FIERI: Which led to      
       a charcuterie joint      

50
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:55,780
 servin' up sandwiches in 2014. 

51
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,115
      Order up,                 
   two Floridians.              

52
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,785
     The Floridian sandwich     
     is absolutely amazing.     

53
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,119
       It's made from wild boar.

54
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,520
  MAN: Grind 'em in-house into  
            sausage.            

55
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,389
   It's a delicious sandwich.   

56
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:05,657
       What kinda sausage       
         are we makin'?         

57
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,592
So this is what we call         
our Floridian sausage.          

58
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,461
   I am Floridian.              
I was born and raised here.     

59
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,796
              You are a Flor... 
              Born and raised?  

60
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,931
                   Represent.   
Sea salt, fresh sage...         

61
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:16,134
                  'Kay.         
     Garlic, cayenne pepper,    

62
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,137
paprika, fresh thyme,           
   toasted anise,               

63
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,406
   toasted fennel,              
toasted peppercorns,            

64
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,341
tricolored pepper melange...    

65
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,677
            Pepper melange.     
Yeah?                           

66
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,212
       I feel like I should have
                  an ascot      

67
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,413
      when I say pepper melange,

68
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,149
                with a pipe.    

69
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,749
     And these citrus zests.    

70
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,085
   We use wild boar for this.   
       Seasoning in here.       

71
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,087
                   Got it.      
                 All right.     

72
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:36,421
         So this thing's        
       pretty well mixed.       

73
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,890
         We go grinder.         

74
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:39,958
     Then, we bring it over here

75
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,426
            and mix it together.
             Right.             

76
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,494
  You need to mix it to achieve 
  primary bind, in other words, 

77
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,163
         to get the meat        
     to stick back together.    

78
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,632
      You can smell that fennel.

79
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,967
    You can pick all that citrus
             comin' outta there.

80
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,702
   These are pretubed casings.  

81
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,371
                    Wow.        

82
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:55,240
     Off we go to the races.    

83
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,376
  Allow a little bit of that air
                to come out.    

84
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,044
Not explode the sausage.        

85
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:01,779
        So this will get twisted
                by hand now?    

86
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:02,848
              We're ready to go.
Mm-hmm.                         

87
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,384
   Sausage goes in              
the oven for a little bit...    

88
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:07,518
 And then finished on a flat top
 and then assemble the sandwich.

89
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,189
     Start off with a little    
   baguette, avocado purée...   

90
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:12,124
             Floridian sausage. 

91
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:14,059
 Spicy mayo, pickled peppers... 
                Pickled peppers.

92
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:17,129
         Pickled onions,        
    a couple orange segments.   

93
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:18,463
          I've had a lot of dogs
             around the country.

94
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:19,932
         I've never seen anybody
             put orange on 'em. 

95
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:21,667
   First time for everything.   

96
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,739
       Nicely done, chef.       

97
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,308
   Nice little spice on that.   

98
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:32,944
         You definitely         
       get the wild boar.       

99
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,279
      You get a little bit      
        of that gaminess,       

100
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,480
       a little more lean       

101
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:36,882
    than the typical sausage    
  I think people would expect.  

102
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,084
     You get tons of citrus     
  coming through from the zest. 

103
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:43,088
   Love the citrus that you do  
 with the fresh orange on there.

104
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,756
        That's a dynamite       
        sausage sandwich.       

105
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,024
           Fantastic.           

106
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,159
             Floridian sausage. 

107
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:48,760
        That rich flavor        
         in the sausage         

108
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:51,363
 and then the pickled vegetables
   just add a lightness to it.  

109
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:53,465
    FIERI: Even former Miami    
         Marlins catcher        

110
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:56,701
         Charles Johnson        
  goes to bat for this big dog. 

111
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,570
       See, he didn't take      
any television bite right there,

112
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,705
        ladies and gentlemen.   
Mm.                             

113
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,106
  I really love it.             
That sausage is really good.    

114
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,575
      Best sausage sandwich     
 you can have in south Florida. 

115
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:07,245
    So I've had the fortunate   
  opportunity to be associated  

116
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,047
    with a great organization   
     known as Best Buddies.     

117
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,316
   And it was formed by a good  
friend of mine, Anthony Shriver.

118
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,185
         This is Chris.         
       And this is Aaron.       

119
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:15,053
          And I thought         
      these two characters,     

120
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,588
       they made some time      
       in their schedule,       

121
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,056
   would come down and tell me  
       what they thought.       

122
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,458
  So, first, how was the slaw?  

123
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,527
I think it's really tasty,      
   and I like it.               

124
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,930
 Put him in a chef coat, and now
   he's tryin' to take my job.  

125
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,265
    If you bleach your hair,    
 we're gonna have a big problem.

126
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,002
 Okay? Did you try the plantains
      wrapped in the bacon?     

127
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:32,938
                    Yeah.       
              That's delicious. 

128
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,407
       That was delicious.      

129
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,941
    MAN: The sweet plantains    
        and the guava...        

130
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,344
      Guava's a huge thing      
         here in Miami.         

131
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:40,812
    So we're doin' bacon now.   

132
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,014
   And I see no nitrate here.   

133
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:43,948
Only nitrate's gonna come       
   from sea salt,               

134
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,484
naturally occurring in sea salt.
             Got it.            

135
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47,486
    We start off                
with our evaporated cane juice, 

136
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,421
        sea salt, cumin,        

137
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,022
       red pepper flakes,       
        makes it so good.       

138
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,024
     So we use an antibiotic    
           hormone...           

139
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,628
              Can you say suwee?
             Suwee!             

140
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,297
    Hormone-free pork belly.    
        Cures right here.       

141
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,900
Just gonna draw out the moisture
 from the pork, create a brine. 

142
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,268
                And how long    
             is this gonna cure?

143
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,435
           Two weeks.           

144
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,570
    And then they get hung up   

145
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,372
       in our aging cooler      
        another 2 weeks.        

146
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,976
     And how long in the smoker?
       48 hours.                

147
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,044
                    Whoa.       

148
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:13,378
              So these will now 
              go in the freezer 

149
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,446
 so they tighten up a little bit

150
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,048
       so they're easy to slice?
    Correct.                    

151
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,449
       And then we're gonna make
a plantain wrapped in the bacon?

152
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,985
            Correct.            
        Sweet plantains,        

153
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,386
   let them ripen all the way.  

154
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,788
     Roast 'em, turns black,    
        and then it pops.       

155
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,789
             Pop it like it's...

156
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,857
              Hot.              
                      Thank you.

157
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,125
          Pretty much.          
                    Bacon first.

158
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,593
            Plantain.           
                   There you go.

159
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,528
              This is the bacon 
            without the nitrate.

160
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,730
              A little bit more 
           of the natural color.

161
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,133
      For people that have never
             had artisan bacon, 

162
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,534
         they don't really quite
               understand it.   

163
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,669
 The moment that they taste it, 

164
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,871
         and they taste         
real smoke flavor, life changes.

165
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,206
  We've got life-changing bacon.

166
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,742
   Cook 'em right in the oven,  
           10 minutes.          

167
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,877
        Five to an order,       
         queso fresco...        

168
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,747
                    Guava paste?
   This is a very Latin thing.  

169
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,419
      Oh, where's this been     
          all my life?          

170
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,387
  The combo between the salty,  
           the cheese,          

171
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,357
         the great smoke        
    of the bacon: ridiculous.   

172
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,026
  The plantain is not as sweet  
    as I thought it would be.   

173
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:04,362
      But this guava purée      
  that you guys make, dynamite. 

174
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,932
  It's a really great platform  
  to present your bacon 'cause  

175
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:08,299
          you can taste         
       the bacon in there.      

176
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,834
    Cool.                       
                 Well done, man.

177
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,570
  Here you guys go. Here's our  
    bacon-wrapped plantains.    

178
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,838
 The bacon was my favorite part.
        Like, I loved it.       

179
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,240
 Had a little taste             
of a little guava to it.        

180
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:16,240
                           Yeah.
   Outstanding.                 

181
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,643
        You played ball in Miami
                for how long?   

182
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,312
 Five to six years.             
Won the World Series in 1997.   

183
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,981
   How'd you find Miami Smokers?

184
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,082
 We have a contest,             
   Taste of Miami.              

185
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,317
Andres was our chef,            

186
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,519
and he put on this nice         
little barbecue sauce of mine.  

187
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,654
And it's called Catch This.     

188
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,989
A portion of my proceeds        
   go back to, um,              

189
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,325
trying to really revive baseball

190
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:35,060
 in a lot of places             
 like inner cities.             

191
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,394
        You're awesome, brother.
            Thank you very much.

192
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,663
     Thank you.                 

193
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,999
     No other place in Miami    
       like Miami Smokers.      

194
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,334
         Car is backed up there.

195
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:44,069
      You can just start loadin'
              up that bacon now 

196
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,737
                and the sausage.
All right. Gotcha.              

197
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,206
Got it.                         
          Just load it over top.

198
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,609
      Up next, we're headed     
          to Modesto...         

199
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:53,344
            Oh, boy.            
 To a funky craft beer joint... 

200
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,746
    It's everything you want.   
             Pumpin'            

201
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,815
   up their scratch-made menu.  
              Yeah.             

202
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,683
         Well, it's only        
    about 17 pounds of food.    

203
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,725
                     ♪♪         

204
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,061
I'm here in Modesto, California,

205
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,663
          about an hour         
      south of Sacramento.      

206
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:12,730
  You're gonna love this story. 

207
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:13,998
     Two high school buddies    

208
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,001
   who live in separate parts   
       of the state decide      

209
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:17,669
 to move back to Modesto 'cause 

210
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,203
       it's a great place       
    to raise their families.    

211
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,605
   And they also decide, "Hey.  

212
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,541
      Why don't we open up      
       a craft beer joint       

213
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,075
  and make scratch-made food?"  

214
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,677
         You gotta love         
       the American dream.      

215
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,345
      This is Commonwealth.     

216
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:31,749
  I get cravings of this place  
          all the time.         

217
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,418
                Barbecue nachos?
    Wow.                        

218
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,220
 I'm here multiple times a week.

219
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:39,291
     Beer is often the draw,    
but the food will keep you here.

220
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,359
     FIERI: Which is exactly    
      how owners Jeff Brown     

221
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,161
  and Blake Humble drew it up.  

222
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,629
          Kinda started         
       as a craft beer bar      

223
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,364
      but we wanted people      
     to leave saying, "Damn.    

224
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,699
       That food's good."       

225
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,434
    FIERI: So they signed up    
        chef Brian Lien.        

226
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,169
 You got the meat for tacos yet?

227
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,838
FIERI: Another hometown dude who
     turned Jeff and Blake's    

228
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,307
           dream menu           
         into a reality         

229
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,375
 with dishes like this trifecta.

230
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,310
     Order up, Craft Tacos.     

231
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,846
     FIERI: A banh mi taco,     
       barbecue pork taco       

232
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,781
   and a buffalo chicken taco,  

233
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,518
          all piled on,         
     you got it, one plate.     

234
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,386
Honestly, I can't say           
which one to start with.        

235
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,655
           Lovin' it,           
    absolutely off the chart.   

236
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,923
 FIERI: What are we gonna make? 

237
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,658
Some braised pulled pork.       
                      All right.

238
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,193
                   Get after it.
    Rub this pork butt          

239
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,661
         with some salt         
           and pepper,          

240
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,263
       a little bit of oil      
           in the pan.          

241
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:20,731
           So we'll sear this up
                on all sides.   

242
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,466
      Then we're gonna take     
          the pork out          

243
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,203
      and continue building     
    our, uh, braising liquid.   

244
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,071
      Bacon, some mirepoix,     

245
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,941
             Boatload of garlic.
Chopped bell peppers...         

246
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,010
    You sure get a wind up there
       with the throw, don't ya?

247
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,479
  Fresh thyme, fresh rosemary,  

248
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,747
           bay leaves,          
         dried chilies,         

249
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,082
    chili powder, allspice...   

250
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,884
                  Allspice.     

251
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,220
                  Alcohol cider.
         Chicken stock.         

252
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:44,823
      So we'll reduce this down.
    We're gonna transfer        

253
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:47,492
      that to a hotel pan,      
      top it with our pork.     

254
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:50,362
       In the oven 6 hours at...
     Three hundred degrees.     

255
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:51,896
                Bring it out,   
           let it cool, pull it?

256
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,632
          That's right.         
                      All right.

257
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:54,899
                        Next up?
      We're gonna marinate      

258
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,034
  some chicken for our grilled  
     chicken buffalo tacos.     

259
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,103
      So we have boneless,      
    skinless chicken breast,    

260
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,504
        fresh tarragon...       

261
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,973
                  Tarragon?     
            Tell me the premise.

262
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,908
I just love tarragon on chicken.

263
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,243
           That was the premise.

264
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:08,446
     Parsley, minced garlic,    
           olive oil,           

265
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,781
          mix that up.          
           All right.           

266
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:13,251
       So this is gonna go      
     in the cooler 24 hours,    

267
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,520
    marked on the char grill,   
      finished in the oven.     

268
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:18,255
          Diced up, ready to go.
                  Next up?      

269
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,258
    This is our umami sauce.    
                         'Kay.  

270
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,327
      It's gonna go on our,     
        uh, banh mi taco.       

271
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,995
                      All right.
      So we're gonna start      

272
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:28,133
   with some vegetable stock,   
     soy sauce, fish sauce.     

273
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,135
      Really like those detailed
                measurements.   

274
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:32,003
          Raw bacon...          

275
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,405
                Come on down    
          to the carnival, kids.

276
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,206
     It's bobbin' for bacon here
              at Commonwealth.  

277
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,542
             Full peppercorns...
        Full peppercorns.       

278
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,076
           Star anise,          

279
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,346
    cinnamon sticks, cloves,    

280
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:45,150
     chopped ginger, onions,    
         green onions...        

281
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:46,951
      How 'bout you just tell me
 the things that don't go in it?

282
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,821
   Jalapenos, carrots, garlic,  

283
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,691
      toasted sesame seeds      
        and brown sugar.        

284
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,092
                 Okay then.     

285
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,760
     Uh, this is gonna cook     
      for about 90 minutes.     

286
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,162
   Then we're gonna strain it.  

287
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,430
   And we're gonna hit it with  
      a corn starch slurry.     

288
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,697
              That's on top of  
             the banh mi taco...

289
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,232
Right. That will get tossed     
with the pulled pork.           

290
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,300
                         Got it.
              Okay.             

291
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,501
        We're gonna make        
      our craft taco plate.     

292
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:04,569
        We're gonna start       

293
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:07,839
    by heating our tortillas,   
        dipped in water.        

294
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,974
      Throw down our meat,      
    this is our pulled pork,    

295
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,108
      our grilled chicken.      

296
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,578
           All right.           
         Our meat's hot.        

297
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,980
           Let's start          
      with our umami sauce,     

298
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,315
         barbecue sauce,        
       our buffalo sauce.       

299
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,853
 We're gonna start in the middle
     with our banh mi taco.     

300
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:27,325
      Cilantro, jalapenos,      
 pickled carrot and red radish. 

301
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,592
                   Uh-huh.      
                 That works.    

302
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:29,994
 This over here is our buffalo. 

303
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,197
 So that's gonna get house-made 
     cole slaw, blue cheese,    

304
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,765
      some diced tomatoes.      

305
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,334
        Then we'll start        
    our barbecue pulled pork    

306
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,536
   and our umami pulled pork.   

307
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,605
    Grilled buffalo chicken.    

308
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,339
  Back to our pulled pork taco, 

309
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:43,674
         our ranch slaw.        

310
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,010
   That's Sriracha mayonnaise.  

311
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,878
         I'm gonna hold you back
 anymore ingredients after this.

312
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,546
              We've just about  
              gone ridiculous.  

313
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,515
                      All right?
     Parsley and that's it.     

314
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,488
                Slaw's great,   
            complements it well.

315
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,956
   Barbecue sauce got some kick.

316
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,026
             Banh mi, that's got
          your favorite flavors.

317
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,495
      And that umami sauce, wow.

318
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,500
        Next up, grilled chicken
                buffalo taco.   

319
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,901
          There's so much flavor

320
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,570
                in each one,    
           big acid in this one,

321
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:15,373
           big salt in this one,
        big vinegar in this one.

322
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,574
                 Well done.     
         Thank you, sir.        

323
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,376
                 Well done.     

324
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,311
    Fresh, clean, delicious.    

325
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:23,648
    This is my buddy, Ahmed,    
  from Rock and Sole in London. 

326
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,784
        I wanna find out,       
       what does he think       

327
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:29,053
       of some funky tacos      
in a little town called Modesto?

328
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:32,190
   Lots of flavor,              
all layered very nicely.        

329
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,591
Absolutely hittin' the spot.    

330
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,993
          Uh, it's got          
   the perfect buffalo sauce.   

331
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,396
The pork seems like it's been   
 marinated for days.            

332
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:42,567
      Great food, great company,
              even better beer. 

333
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,269
              Get beer from all 
              over the country? 

334
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:46,805
       All over the world.      
   The craft beers are things   

335
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:49,007
     that you will not find     
     in the grocery stores.     

336
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:51,342
        You can always get stuff
    that is your favorite, stuff

337
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:52,810
   you've never heard of before.

338
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,546
  If you ever want a good meal  
        and a good brew,        

339
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:55,947
  come on down to Commonwealth. 

340
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,082
  All right. So here's the deal,
             when we come back, 

341
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,218
      chef says that he has just
                what I need:    

342
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,821
         a waffle that has what?

343
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:05,023
               Don't tell me.   
              Get through this. 

344
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,524
       I'll see you in a minute.

345
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:14,832
                     ♪♪         

346
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,367
                     Hi.        
    Welcome back to Commonwealth

347
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,970
         in Modesto, California.

348
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:22,907
          I just had three tacos
      the size of four burritos.

349
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,575
And now I'm gonna have a waffle.

350
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,910
    How long on that waffle?    

351
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,379
     It is a combination of     
  breakfast, lunch and dinner.  

352
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,780
               Waffle Madame.   

353
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,583
       It's just amazing.       

354
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,184
              All right, chef.  

355
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,853
                Tell me about   
             this wonder waffle.

356
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,988
    First we're gonna mix up    
      our dry ingredients,      

357
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,256
       all purpose flour,       
        granulated sugar,       

358
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,391
         bakin' powder,         

359
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,926
          kosher salt.          
                           'Kay.

360
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,597
  Now for our wet ingredients,  
       eggs, buttermilk...      

361
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,465
         So far, this just looks
    like a regular waffle, chef.

362
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,668
     Well, it's the sandwich    
     that's most impressive.    

363
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,803
           Vanilla...           

364
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,071
         We're making a sandwich
             out of the waffle? 

365
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:55,406
          We are making         
    a Waffle Madame sandwich.   

366
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:58,810
              Cut. I didn't say 
          I was into any sand...

367
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,278
          Ah, you're killin' me.

368
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,214
                I'm gonna --    
   never gonna get the car home.

369
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,549
               I'm gonna have   
             to Fred Flintstone 

370
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:07,552
            that thing, take out
     the floorboard again and...

371
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:08,619
         Melted butter.         

372
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,555
   Addin' our dry to our wet.   

373
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:12,557
           You're making waffles
                  all day?      

374
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,624
 Yeah, the customer's favorite. 

375
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,359
   You make the waffle to order?

376
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,761
        To order and then       
     we build the sandwich.     

377
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:19,764
 It's gonna cook for 2 minutes. 

378
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,766
  All right. Our waffle's done. 

379
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:22,900
   We're gonna cut it in half.  

380
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,570
          Swiss cheese.         

381
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:28,373
We're gonna cook our home fries,
      maple mustard butter.     

382
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,375
      So that's just the butter,

383
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:32,644
               the maple syrup  
    and the whole grain mustard?

384
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:33,911
      Whole grain mustard.      

385
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,112
          And our ham.          

386
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,247
               If waffle's not  
             good enough for ya,

387
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:40,451
               let's just cook  
        your ham in some butter.

388
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,720
                 Those eggs     
   better not be goin' on there.

389
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,989
          And our eggs.         
           All right.           

390
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,059
       Our ham's hot, move      
    that over to our waffle.    

391
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,794
       And our other half.      

392
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:54,465
 And your favorite right on top.

393
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:57,067
     So chef, I know that you're
          a big fan of the eggs.

394
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,403
               I'm gonna just   
       pull this right over here

395
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,405
and just allow them to be yours.
You are welcome to do that.     

396
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,206
      Is it supposed to be eaten
              like a sandwich.  

397
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,474
I don't think I've ever         
 seen anybody do it.            

398
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,342
                 All right.     
 Well, it's only about 17 pounds

399
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,746
                  of food.      

400
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,014
                    Yeah.       

401
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,282
                   Mm-hmm.      

402
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,817
                  Oh, boy.      

403
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:15,486
             Yeah, see, I'm not 
  a huge breakfast person 'cause

404
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:16,687
    I'm not a big sweets person.

405
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,623
             But I do like that 
      when you get a little kiss

406
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,960
                of that maple   
       with the little saltiness

407
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:24,095
         of the bacon or the ham
        or whatever it might be.

408
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:28,099
         And this is that combo,
           which is the contrast

409
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:29,900
              that people love. 
         You know what makes it?

410
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,036
  Maple mustard butter?         
                    Outstanding.

411
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,638
                   That's yours?
          That's mine.          

412
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,439
                   Killer.      
       It's everything you want.

413
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,308
     It's the mustard goin' with
  the ham goin' with the cheese.

414
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,376
          A little bit of the --
                 the waffle     

415
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,777
 playing into the bread element.

416
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,614
 That's pretty much gonna change
       the waistline of Modesto.

417
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,084
   It's fantastic.              

418
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:51,322
      It's sweet and crispy     
and fluffy all at the same time.

419
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:54,725
        Very unique to the area,
   just a whole lot of goodness.

420
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,593
 I'll be back in here tomorrow. 

421
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,728
   The waffle should be illegal.

422
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,263
It actually is.                 
     You should have to weigh in

423
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,733
  before you can eat that thing.
               Nice job, guys.  

424
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:02,800
               Thanks very much.
          Thanks, man.          

425
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:05,269
         Appreciate it.         
Thank you, sir.                 

426
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,404
         Comin' up, it's        
      Stockton, California.     

427

                    Easy greasy.
          Easy greasy.          

428
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:11,542
       An ex-football pro       
      slinging the wings...     

429
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,744
         Now that's what        
       I'm talkin' about.       

430
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,413
 And scorin' big with the sauce.

431
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,814
               Mm.              
   That's my kinda wing sauce.  

432
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:26,457

433
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,992
    So I'm here in Stockton,    

434
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,994
      California in one of      
     the older neighborhoods    

435
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,196
        known as Yosemite       
      to check out a joint.     

436
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:35,800
 Get this, it's an ex-NFL player
   and his college sweetheart.  

437
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,002
   They decided to jump right   
  into the restaurant business. 

438
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:40,204
      And from what I hear,     
   they're doin' pretty good.   

439
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,440
This is Smitty's Wings & Things.

440
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,545
              This is the spot. 

441
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,614
      I need two rib plates     
  and a six-pack of hot wings.

   And they're doin' the wings  
     right without a doubt.     

445
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,955
          Hot and honey barbecue
            comin' up right now.

446
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,223

    I crave 'em all the time.   

447
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:00,425
           And this is the place
                 to get 'em?    

448
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,625
              Yeah.             

449
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,960
   And you always               
support your mom and pops.      

450
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,896
   FIERI: Here, mom and pop is  
           Jaime Smith          

451
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:05,963
     and her husband, Steve,    

452
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,099
    whose career started out    
        on the gridiron.        

453
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,368
   How long were you in the NFL?
Four years all together.        

454
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,304
           Played for the, uh...
Jacksonville and Tennessee.     

455
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,505
     Jacksonville and Tennessee.
Yeah.                           

456
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,240
I had a couple surgeries,       
   back surgeries,              

457
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:17,975
  and that's kinda              
why I had to stop playing.      

458
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,510
   So it was like,              
"I gotta go out and get a job." 

459
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:23,647
      So he traded pigskin      
    for a pizza joint in 2013   

460
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,316
 and added wings to the roster. 

461
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,051
        What makes a great wing,
              in your opinion?  

462
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,920
Crunchy, moist and big.         

463
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:33,057
 Smitty's home of crunchy, moist
                  and big.      

464
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,192
   I need a 12-pack Thai sweet  
       and sour hot wings.      

465
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,862
Whatever your appetite is,      
whether you like hot,           

466
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,397
   you like sweet,              
  you like sour...              

467
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,999
     They have bleu cheese,     
          lemon garlic,         

468
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,468
        the garlic chili.       

469
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,336
 You're the wing-fryin' machine?
Fryin' machine.                 

470
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,670
                 And you're     
       the sauce-makin' machine?

471
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,339
            Yes.                
This is gonna go for which wing?

472
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,408
       The Damn Hot wing.       
       I love spicy food,       

473
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,410
      but I like spicy food     
   that has some flavor in it.  

474
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:53,878
      You wanna have some depth?
        Yes.                    

475
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,946
   So first we're gonna start   

476
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:57,882
         some hot sauce,        
        garlic, cilantro.       

477
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,817
      We've got some coarse     
          black pepper.         

478
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,819
                   Course we do.
    Got some ground cayenne,    

479
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:02,954
          fresh lime...         

480
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,155
         Oh, look at her go now.

481
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,422
      Sorry if I juice ya.      

482
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,625
    Chipotle and adobo sauce,   
       smoked jalapenos...      

483
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,295
                           Okay.
     And some green chilies.    

484
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:14,132
             It's gonna be hot. 

485
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,232
      You'll be all right.      

486
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,969
        I don't know about that.

487
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,103
                     Mm.        

488
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,838
     That's my kinda wing sauce.

489
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,774
         There's a lot goin' on.

490
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:23,841
  You pick up a little afterburn

491
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,042
             at the end of that.
              Yes.              

492
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,643
                    Okay.       
   Next one, what are we making?

493
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,378
      Thai sweet and sour.      
I eat this one.                 

494
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,647
    You don't eat the other one?

495
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,848
I don't do spicy, man.          

496
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,583
             You don't do spicy?
Nah, man.                       

497
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,519
             Big shot NFL guys, 

498
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,788
           I thought you all did
          spicy, drink gasoline.

499
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,923
Oh, nah.                        
                           Fire.

500
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,257
                             No?
Oh, no.                         

501
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,659
              Sweet chili sauce.
              Yes.              

502
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:44,061
        And then we have        
       some rice vinegar.       

503
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,663
      Then we get 30 shakes     
         of fish sauce.         

504
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,932
               Thirty shakes?   

505
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,267
              That's not really 
              a culinary term.  

506
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,271
   We have some fresh ginger,   
      coarse black pepper,      

507
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:56,073
     some granulated garlic     
     and some fresh garlic.     

508
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,142
      And we're gonna whisk     
       this all together.       

509
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:03,614
              That's good stuff.
Yeah, yeah.                     

510
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:04,749
  That's your sauce right there?

511
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,683
  Where'd that recipe come from?

512
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,352
               Me.              
             Play mad scientist?

513
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:09,820
      Mm-hmm.                   
       And then try it on Steve?

514
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,689
              I wanna be around 
             when that happens. 

515
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,424
      All right. Let's make some
                wings, Steve.   

516
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,894
   All right. We'll take some   
   regular all-purpose flour.   

517
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,896
       I mean, I'm just gonna be
    straight with you right now,

518
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:20,364
I am not a big breaded wing guy.

519
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:21,565
     Are you a breaded wing guy?
 Yeah.                          

520
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,633
        So break it down for me.

521
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:23,901
I wanna see what's gonna happen.

522
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,971
  Paprika, we got onion powder. 

523
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,173
      We got garlic powder.     
     Just take it and stir.     

524
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,508
                   Easy, greasy.
          Easy, greasy.         

525
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,977
            Should we dredge 'em
                 when we go?    

526
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:34,979
              Yeah.             
 We just take 'em to the fryer. 

527
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,380
            And what temperature
             are we cookin' at? 

528
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:37,915
             Three--            
            350, 360,           

529
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:38,983
    when the light comes on,    
          I don't know.         

530
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,652
             Should we to the...
        When the light comes on.

531
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:44,856
                 Oh, Steve.     

532
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:47,124
                 Now, that's    
         what I'm talkin' about.

533
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,060
         See, not overly coated.

534
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:51,128
             I wanna taste wing.
                Look at that.   

535
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,263
              Nice and crispy.  

536
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,532
                  Oh, yeah.     
                 All right.     

537
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:56,067
                 We're good.    
        I just had to taste 'em.

538
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,535
  So we do the Damn Hot first,  

539
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,570
         just squirt it         
       in there like that.      

540
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:00,737
          That's coatin' a wing.

541
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,072
             Mm-hmm.            

542
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,808
              Boom.             

543
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,079
    I mean, this is just a good,
               old-fashioned,   

544
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,747
            funky, crunchy wing.

545
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,950
 Do I have anything right there?
    Unh-uh.                     

546
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,752
  That's how everybody lookin'. 
        The Smitty face.        

547
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:17,287
                The Smitty face.
It is.                          

548
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,957
        The sauce is consistent,
              not overly spicy. 

549
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,360
             Mouth's not on fire
     but I do have a good, nice,

550
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:23,560
                 round heat.    
                Nicely done.    

551
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:24,428
                 All right.     
                  Next one.     

552
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,630
 We got the Thai sweet and sour.

553
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,097
                    Okay.       

554
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,432
         This is when that wing,

555
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,368
             havin' a little bit
            of that flour on it,

556
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,639
    really works the best 'cause
             it's soaking it up.

557
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,507
               It really does.  
      That's fried chicken city.

558
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,642
                    Nicely done.
            For sure.           

559
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:38,643
Thank you, thank you.           
                    Nicely done.

560
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,444
  Table 50, Damn Hot six-pack.  

561
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:41,512
              It's a good kick, 

562
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,581
          gives you a little bit
                 of sweat...    

563
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,316
They got this nice crunch bite. 

564
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,251
        All right, we got       
    the Thai sweet and sour.    

565
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,786
     It's a nice mix of flavors.

566
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:51,121
Get 'em all over your hands,    
I mean, they're on your clothes 

567
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,256
   and your shoes.              

568
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,325
I mean, there's wing sauce      
     everywhere.                

569
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:55,926
             FIERI:             
 And the ribs will get ya, too. 

570
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,862
  Walkin' in with the ribs up.  

571
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,330
  FIERI: You gonna make me sit  
    there and dig into that?    

572
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:00,264
        Yeah.                   
That's how we do it.            

573
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,532
         It'll mess my bling up.

574
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,133
You gotta get messy.            

575
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:07,004
 We like to see the Smitty face.

576
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:09,673
         Good sauce, good blaze,
          right amount of sugar,

577
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:10,807
           right amount of salt,

578
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,809
               not overcooked,  
                  good rib.     

579
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,278
           All right.           
    I got a rib plate for ya.   

580
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,747
        The ribs are, uh,       
        meaty and tasty.        

581
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:19,150
I can't finish it, I mean...    

582
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:22,152
    It's good people, good food,
             just a great place 

583
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,154
            to bring your family
                and hang out.   

584
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,357
             You know hard work 
             from football life.

585
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,424
     Mm-hmm.                    
       This is a tough business.

586
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:28,960
             But your enthusiasm

587
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:30,827
             and your optimism, 
        you're gettin' after it.

588
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,630
     And I would put those wings
           up against anybody's.

589
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,698
     Damn. That's what's up.    
                           'Kay?

590
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,166
       I'm gonna tell Emil      
       you used his word.       

591
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,703
       Uh-oh.                   

592
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,638
   So that's it for this trip,  
        but don't worry!        

593
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,774
  There's plenty more Triple D  
  joints all over the country!  

594
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,375
     I'll be looking for you    
          next week on          

595

596
