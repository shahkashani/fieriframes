                 OR ARM-WRESTLE.

96
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,843
UH, ARM-WRESTLE.                
            LET'S MAKE PANCAKES.

97
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:08,112
        THIS IS                 
THE GROUND-UP POTATOES.         
                 OKAY, NOW WHAT?

98
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,314
WE ADD THE ONIONS...            
                           OKAY.

99
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,916
AND THEN PEPPER.                
                    THERE WE GO.

100
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:14,853
NEXT, SALT. AND THEN THIS IS    
THE STARCH FROM THE POTATOES.   

101
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,922
                         REALLY?
YEAH. AND THEN WE               
  ADD THE EGGS.                 

102
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:20,191
        WORK AS A LITTLE BINDER.

103
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,859
AND THEN WE MIX THAT IN.        

104
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:25,530
   THE NEXT STEP                
IS TO ADD THE FLOUR.            
                           OKAY.

105
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,865
AND THEN YOU MIX IT IN. I THINK 
  WE'RE LOOKIN' PRETTY GOOD.    

106
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,468
                      IT'S GOOD.
YEP.                            

107
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,870
          AND YOU FRY YOUR HAND,
          OR ARE WE GONNA JUST--
NO, WE USE A SPOON.             

108
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:35,540
    THE NEXT STEP               
IS TO FRY THE PANCAKE.          
               SO IT SITS THERE,

109
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:38,476
              AND IT COOKS UP,  
           AND THEN YOU FLIP IT.

110
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,678
                            OOH.
YEP.                            

111
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,647
                NICELY DONE.    
            JUDGES GIVE HER A 9.

112
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,016
SO WE CAN TURN IT UP NOW.       
        TALKING TO YOURSELF NOW?

113
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,885
MM-HMM.                         
                        AWESOME.

114
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,354
WELL, I'M ACTUALLY TALKING      
     TO THE PANCAKE.            
         TALKING TO THE PANCAKE?

115
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,790
                  (mouths words)
IT NEEDS ENCOURAGEMENT.         

116
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,130
AND IT'S DONE.                  

117
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,300
              SO IT LOOKS LIKE  
           A SAVORY FUNNEL CAKE.
SURE.                           

118
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,236
                            MMM.

119
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:06,504
                 IT'S LIKE      
          FRIED MASHED POTATOES.

120
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,439
            MMM. OKAY, NOW WHAT?

121
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,309
NOW WE PUT ON                   
THE GOULASH.                    

122
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,279
              SERVE UP THE LADLE
                    OF FUN.     
AND THERE YOU ARE.              

123
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,925
              WOW. BOY, IS THERE
               A LOT OF FLAVOR. 

124
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:30,929
      THIS HAS GOT A LITTLE BIT 
     OF BITE TO IT IN THE GRAVY.

125
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:33,398
           ALL THOSE VEGGIES.   
        THE PORK IS MEGA TENDER.

126
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,201
        YOU GET GREAT CRUNCH    
   STILL GOING FROM THE PANCAKE.

127
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,137
                            MMM.

128
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,872
       THAT'S ONE OF THE BEST   
    POLISH DISHES I'VE EVER HAD.

00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,475

131
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,279
                   I CAN'T--    
               I CAN'T FIGHT IT.

132
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,614
                  ROCK STAR JOB.
                   YOU'RE MONEY.
THANK YOU.                      

133

    THE HUNGARIAN PANCAKE       
IS WHAT I GET MOST OF THE TIME  

134
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,086
    WHEN I'M IN HERE.           
THE GOULASH IS EXCELLENT.       

135
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,021

                       THE BEST.

137
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:02,294
   POTATO AND CHEESE PIEROGI.

                A LITTLE TOUCH  
              OF HOMEMADE TO IT.

         <i> MAIN COURSES</i>

CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP READY.      

140
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,903

DILL PICKLE SOUP READY.         

141
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,772
        THE DILL PICKLE SOUP'S  
        MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE.   

142
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:17,175
                  OKAY, NEXT UP?
DILL PICKLE SOUP.

          I-I LIKE DILL PICKLES,

145
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,714
             NOT--I CAN'T SAY   
          I FREAK OUT ABOUT 'EM.

146
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,317
  FIRST, WE ADD THE CARROT      
AND THEN THE CUBED POTATOES,    

147
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,220
SOME MARGARINE,                 
   AND WATER.                   
                WHERE'S THE, UH,

148
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,456
               DILL PICKLE PART?
IT'LL COME LATER.               

149
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,058
                           OKAY.
IF YOU PUT THE PICKLES IN EARLY,
   IT TURNS THE POTATOES HARD   

150
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,593
FROM THE SALT.                  

151
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,662
                         REALLY?
MM-HMM. SO THAT'S WHY           
 THEY HAVE TO WAIT.             

152
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:40,398
               WHAT WILL BE     
           THE NEXT INGREDIENTS?
UM, YOU ADD SOUR CREAM,         

153
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,600
FLOUR, SALT MIXTURE,            
      WATER...                  
                           OKAY.

154
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,602
AND THAT THICKENS THE SOUP.     
               NOW YOU'RE GONNA 
             WHISK THAT IN THERE

155
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,671
           SO IT TIGHTENS IT UP?
YEAH.                           

156
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,674
               OKAY, WHEN WILL  
              THE PICKLES GO IN?
THAT'S--TA-DA, PICKLES.         

157
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,476
                    AND THEN,   
                 TA-DA, PICKLES?
YES.                            

158
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,012

    AND THEN                    
THE PICKLE JUICE.               
            NOW HOW LONG ARE WE 
            GONNA LET THIS COOK?

161
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,820

   THE SOUP IS DONE.            

162
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:03,688
                  DOES IT TASTE 
                 SUPER PICKLE-Y?

163
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,625
WELL, YOU'LL FIND OUT           
    IN A SECOND.                

164
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,760
                            MMM.

165
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,096
         IT'S NOT AS HEAVY      
   AS I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE.
MM-HMM.                         

166
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,565

  MM-HMM.

            A LOT OF BIG FLAVOR,

169
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,703
 AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE TEXTURE
 OF THE POTATO THAT BACKS IT UP.

FOR A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT.       

247
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,049
    DON'T WANT

          ACCENTUATE, NOT COVER.

                 ON THE OUTSIDE,

253
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,997
   AND THEN IT'S NICE AND CREAMY
           ON THE INSIDE.       

254
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,898

256
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,402
       AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,

258
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,673
              THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

259

   ANYTHING FANCY WITH IT.      

270
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,532
WE'RE JUST GONNA CHOP IT UP     
       A LITTLE BIT,            

271
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,701
  HIT IT WITH A LITTLE          
SALT AND PEPPER, WRAP IT,       

272
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,102
ROAST IT FOR ABOUT              
  HALF AN HOUR.

     AGITATE 'EM A LITTLE BIT...

282
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,863

              THE SAND WILL FALL
                TO THE BOTTOM.

             SO WE'RE TAKING    
          AN ASIAN SPIN ON THIS.

287
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,211
IT'S KIND OF EVOLVED            
     TO THAT.                   
   THAT WILTS A LITTLE BIT MORE,
          AND WE'RE GOOD?       

288
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,546
AND THEN WE'RE GOOD.            
                          GREAT.

289
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,281
HOW ABOUT THAT?                 
                             HO!

290

  IT JUST CAME OUT OF THE WATER.

330
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,171
  BILLY DOES A GREAT JOB WORKING

IT WAS STILL KICKIN'.

00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,106
  IT WAS STILL FLIPPIN'         
RIGHT THERE ON THE PLATE.       
                           YEAH.

332
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,176
          I'VE GOT              
A CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH UP.    

333
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:32,910

       AND IT'S SO MOIST.       

334
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,645
   THE VEGETABLES ARE CRISP,    
        BREAD IS FRESH.         

335
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,382
 THEY TAKE THEIR TIME, AND THEY 
   WANT IT TO TASTE FABULOUS.   

336
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:41,452

  OF THE CHICKEN SALAD,         

338
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:44,656

341
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,527
         SO THIS IS GONNA SPEND 
        SOME TIME SIMMERING HERE

342
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,397
      TO BREAK DOWN THOSE ONIONS
          AND THOSE PEPPERS.    
EXACTLY.                        

343
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,132

  TO SMELL THAT.                
                  I CAN SMELL IT
                    RIGHT NOW.

LIKE BOURBON, BUT...

APPLE CIDER VINEGAR DILUTED

                LET THAT SIMMER.
EXACTLY.                        

348
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,011
WE'RE GONNA GET OUR BONELESS    
     SKINLESS CHICKEN.          

349
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,279
 SEASON IT UP--                 
SALT AND PEPPER.                

350
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,882
ROAST IT IN THE OVEN.           

351
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,549
    SO THESE ARE                
OUR ROASTED CHICKEN.            

352
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,685
  IT'S NICE AND COOLED DOWN,    
SO I CAN GO AHEAD AND PULL IT.  

353
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,287
WE DO THE OLD                   
FINGER METHOD.                  

354
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,890
   I'M JUST GONNA ADD           
A LITTLE TEXTURE TO THIS,       

355
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:21,358
SO IT KIND OF BINDS TOGETHER.   
                 THAT'S NICE.   
              I LIKE THAT STYLE.

356
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,828
NEXT UP IS OUR MAYONNAISE       
   AND YOGURT MIXTURE,          

357
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,630
AND WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT        
   OF CURRY IN HERE.            

358
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,966
MIX THE CURRY, YOGURT, AND MAYO 
        AHEAD OF TIME,          

359
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,634
SO THE CURRY OPENS UP           
    A LITTLE BIT.               
           LET IT WORK TOGETHER.

360
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:32,036
NEXT IS THE CHUTNEY WE MADE,    
 REDUCED DOWN A LITTLE BIT.     

361
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,238
                     BIG CHUNKS.
       BIG CHUNKS.              
SOME CHOPPED GREEN ONIONS,      

362
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,307
CHOPPED ALMONDS.                
        TOASTED CHOPPED ALMONDS.

363
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,443
        YES, TOASTED.           
UH, A LITTLE SALT AND PEPPER.   

364
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,445
  GONNA GIVE THIS A GOOD MIX    
WITHOUT TOSSING IT EVERYWHERE.  

365
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:43,047
      I LIKE THIS IDEA OF HAVING
           THE CHICKEN DONE     

366
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,983
           TWO DIFFERENT WAYS-- 
          OF HAVING IT GROUND UP

367
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:47,384
             SO IT KINDA WORKS  
          ITS WAY IN EVERYWHERE,

368
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,520
    AND THEN HAVING IT SHREDDED.
     WE'RE GONNA SERVE THIS ON? 
     WE'VE GOT                  
OUR HOMEMADE BREAD.             

369
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:52,123
        IS THAT THIS BIG MONSTER
               RIGHT HERE?      
THAT'S THE MONSTER.             

370
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,924
                            OOH.
     I'VE BEEN HERE

               LOOK AT THAT.    

374
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,533
               THAT'S THE BOUNTY
                 OF THE COUNTY. 

375
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:05,069
FRESH TOMATO, AS THE THEME GOES,
      RIGHT FROM THE BARN.      

376
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,872
SOME SPRING MIX HERE.           
    PILE THAT ON.               
              IT DOES GO PANINI?

YEAH, IT DOES. YEP.             
                            OHH!

378
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:12,010
             JUST A LITTLE TOAST
                ON THAT BREAD.  
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

379
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,613
                    THERE WE GO.

380
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:18,349
              NOW IT'S EVEN MORE
                  RIDICULOUS.   
THAT'S RIGHT.
