       the fork-and-knife thing.

120
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,717
            Do it the right way.

121
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,386
                 Like that.

123
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,592
You get the salty meat          
and this deep, rich beef flavor,

124
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,862
and then you get that           
super-seasoned rice,            

125
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,064
and, all of a sudden, that      
fried sweet plantain comes in.

    I mean, wow.

         some lobster right now.

146

Your lobster lollipops.

     FIERI: So,                 
this is a spiny lobster.        

150
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,048
      This is the way we kind of
        take apart the lobster. 

151
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,449
         Go.                    

152
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:20,852
You have all this beautiful meat
      inside. Nice sharp blade. 

153
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,186
               You can kind of  
             just slice through.

154
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,656
            Then put your weight
                 down on it.    

155
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,324
              Take your finger, 
               kind of fix it   

156
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,527
               right in there   
 between the meat and the shell.

157
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,661
              You want to get   
              nice big chunks.  

158
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,600
   So, then we take our chunks, 
 put them in our seasoned flour.

159
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:36,868
                 We take off    
              the excess flour, 

160
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,605
 and we drop it into our tempura
              and into the oil. 

161
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,475
               And we go ahead  
   and take the tails, fry them,

162
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,009
               and plate them   
             on the presentation

163
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,411
          and deep-fry the head,
                    also.       

164
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,547
           Gives it a nice, big,
              bright-red color. 

165
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,684
          All right, so this is 
          our lobster lollipops.

166
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,220

           two pieces per stick.

167
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:58,023

    on the bottom of the plate.

                    Yeah.

on Sunday is called gravy.      

235
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,968
All right, let's hit it.        

236

             a little olive oil

          I'll do the real deal.

241
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,644
    There we go.

245
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,921

great chicken parmesan.         

253

       We use panko breadcrumbs 
      instead of just regular...

00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,806
Italian breadcrumbs. Okay.      

255

      It's a little bit lighter,

          a little bit crispier.

And what are we gonna

                    Fresh basil.

467

Dude, you got it all --         

468
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:58,642
a rustic pesto, the creamy      
beans, great amount of steak.   

469
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,178
The crust is dynamite.          

470
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,713
That's a meal of a pizza.       

471
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:03,847
   Right on, man.               
     Great job.

    It's fantastic. The steak's 
perfect, just the way I like it.

 We really enjoy the cheesecake 
              here.             

485
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,816
   It's homemade, it's fresh.   

486
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,518
    They've got a whole board   
         of cheesecakes.

                          Yes.  

491
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,093
  We're gonna use the pound cake
                 as a crust.    

492
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,294
You're making a pound cake      

493
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,029
  to make the crust             
 for the cheesecake?            

494
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,497
                     Absolutely.
I do it every day.              

495
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,099
             We're gonna mix up 
               the cheesecake.  

496
00:18:55,902 --> 00:19:01,239
     Little sugar, little flour,
     vanilla, raspberry liqueur.

497
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,040
                 Slowly add     
              the cream cheese, 

498
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:04,308
       making sure it's gonna be
              nice and smooth.  

499
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,177
          We're gonna slowly add
                 those eggs.    

500

501
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,917
            Now we're gonna add 
         some fresh raspberries.

502
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,187
So, slowly fold those in        
so they don't break apart.      

503
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:18,055
             Cut our pound cake.

504
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,459
We're just breaking a pound cake
up and just jamming it in there.

505
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,794
I like the way you roll.        

506
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,463
      About half of it in there.

507
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,067
       Because we're gonna bake 
 the bottom half 30, 40 minutes.

508
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,269
    Bring it out.               

509
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:32,803
            Now we're gonna add 
         the rest of the batter.

510
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:35,072
      Second time we put it in, 
      we put it in a water bath.

511
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:38,075
  It's gonna keep our cheesecake
  from being soft in the middle.

512
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,343
How long's it bake then?        

513
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,878
              About 45 minutes. 

514
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,080
             Then we let it cool
                 overnight.     

515
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,283
        Chop up some pound cake,
              put it on there,  

516
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:48,285
                    then        
      a white-chocolate ganache.

517
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,954
                 Top it off     
   with a couple of raspberries.

518
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,757
    Now we're gonna pop a little
      raspberry syrup on there.

          Little powdered sugar.

521

This is so rich, so creamy.

raspberries, the ganache.

530
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,895
       and the pound cake on top
              just tops it off.
