                  BROCCOLI RABE.

106
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,690
WE'RE GONNA MAKE TOMATO JAM     
FOR OUR RABE T.J. SANDWICH.     

107
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,492
             RABE T.J. SANDWICH?
RABE TIJUANA.                   

108
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:56,295
                 WHO IN THE HECK
                IS RABE TIJUANA?

109
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:57,829
  T.J. IS SHORT FOR             
TOMATO JAM OR TIJUANA.          
              ALL RIGHT, HIT IT.

110
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:01,967
SO I GOT FRESH TOMATOES--       
     CORED, HALVED.             

111
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,702
     I'VE GOT DISTILLED         
WHITE VINEGAR, FRESH GINGER,    

112
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,905
 JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SALT,     
FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER,    

113
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,575
      RED CHILI FLAKE,          
CUMIN THAT WE TOAST IN-HOUSE    

114
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,644
AND GRIND UP OURSELVES,         

115
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,047
AND THEN A WHOLE                
 LOT OF SUGAR.                  

116
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,319
             (imitating blender)

117
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,155
        I HAD TO GET IT STARTED.

118
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,858
    IT'S GONNA GO               
INTO OUR NONSTICK POT           

119
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,862
TO REDUCE FOR SEVEN TO EIGHT    
 HOURS AND TURNS INTO JAM.      

120
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,532
WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE GARLIC OIL 
THAT GOES IN THE BROCCOLI RABE  

121
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,799
FOR THE RABE TIJUANA.           

122
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,868
EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL,         
   RED CHILI FLAKE,             

123
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,604
I'M GONNA ADD                   
SOME GARLIC.                    

124
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,005
  GIVE IT ABOUT                 
10 OR 15 MINUTES.               

125
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,541
THE GARLIC JUST TURNS,          
 LIKE, A STRAW COLOR,           

126
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,143
LIKE, LIGHT GOLDEN BROWN.       

127
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,878
             SO WE HAVE SOME    
         BLANCHED BROCCOLI RABE.

128
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,614
   AND TAKE THAT OIL            
THAT WE MADE--DUMP THAT.        
                       RIGHT IN.

129
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,817
     AND THEN WE GOT            
SOME SHARP PROVOLONE HERE.      

130
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,619
              OH, THAT IS NICE  
            AND SALTY AND TANGY.

131
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:57,155
 MIX THAT UP, AND THAT'S        
GONNA GO ON OUR SANDWICH.       

132
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,756
          THAT, THE TOMATO JAM, 
         AND WHAT KIND OF BREAD?

133
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,692
    SESAME TORTA ROLL--         
A MEXICAN-STYLE TORTA ROLL.     
                           YEAH.

134
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,561
       ARE YOU--YOU'RE MAKING IT
          SOUND LIKE TORTOISE.  

135
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,565
THE TORTA ROLL                  
IS FROM MEXICO.                 

136
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,167
        (Charles) WE ADD SOME OF

137
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,570
       THE SAUTéED BROCCOLI RABE
      MIXTURE, FRESH MOZZARELLA.
(Guy) LOCAL?

00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,104
              YEAH, THIS IS FROM
                 CONNECTICUT.   

139
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,307
        SALT, THERE'S YOUR SALT.
 SALT ON THAT                   
CHEESE, RIGHT?                  

140
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:16,708
                  THE OLIVE OIL.

141
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,010
              THE T.J. JUST ONLY
                ON THE TOP BUN. 

142
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,447
OH, THAT'S NICE.                

143
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,183
SO WE'LL LET THAT GO?           
                    LET THAT GO,

144
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:28,320
    AND WE'LL COME BACK IN A FEW
     MINUTES AND GIVE IT A TRY. 

145
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:34,325
MMM. I'M NOT A HUGE             
BROCCOLI RABE FAN,              

146
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,061
'CAUSE IT'S A LITTLE BIT        
     BITTER FOR ME,             

147
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,530
BUT IN THIS INSTANCE, BECAUSE   
 YOU TOOK THE BROCCOLI RABE     

148
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,599
AND SMOTHERED IT                
 IN GARLIC OIL,                 

149
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,467
THE CREAMINESS                  
 OF THAT MOZZ                   

150
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:43,868
     WITH THE SWEET             
AND THE ACID OF THE JAM--       

151
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,137
A LOT OF TEXTURE,               
A LOT OF FLAVOR,                

152
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,606
A LOT OF CHEW,                  
A LOT OF BITE.                  

153
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,541
GREAT SANDWICH.

           NEVER HAD            
       ANYTHING LIKE IT.        

156
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,814
     I THINK THIS ONE WINS.     

157
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:59,150

     I GOT A RABE T.J. UP.      

169
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,152
THE SANDWICHES ARE AN EXPERIENCE

       IT'S THIS PERFECT        
      MARRIAGE OF TEXTURE

 WHO DOESN'T LIKE GARLIC PURéE? 

177
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,842
  THIS IS THE PORK BUTT. WE'RE

CROSSHATCH THIS FAT,            

179

    CAN GET IN.                 

180
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,381

         24 HOURS IN THE COOLER?
THIS ACTUALLY GOES              
  FOR 48 HOURS--                

185
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,595
   TENDERIZES IT                
JUST THAT MUCH MORE.            

186
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,129
                   ROAST IT OFF.
500 DEGREES.                    

187
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:21,333
  AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO,    
WE KICK IT DOWN TO 300 DEGREES  

188
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:24,402
  AND LET IT FINISH. WE'RE

THROW IT UP ON THE SLICER,      
       SLICE IT UP.

   RIGHT THERE.                 

413
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,715
YEAH, IT LOOKS IT.              
    WHITE WINE                  

414
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:07,251
AND CHICKEN STOCK.              
                           OKAY.

415
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,188

SQUEEZE THE LEMON IN HERE.

ALL RIGHT, NOW WE'RE            
  GONNA TAKE THE--              
             SO THREE SAUTé PANS
                FOR ONE DISH.   

417
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:19,797
ONE DISH. IT'S WORTH IT,        
  THOUGH, ABSOLUTELY.           
         WHATEVER YOU SAY, BOSS.

418
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,333
SO NOW WE'RE GONNA START        
OUR PAN-ROASTED POTATOES.       

419
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,268
THIS IS EXTRA VIRGIN            
    FROM ITALY.                 

420
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,672

           ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME
              THIS ENTIRE DISH

422
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,542
NO GARLIC IN THIS.              
                           NONE.

423
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,077
NO. OUR POTATOES.               

424
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:36,080
  I'M GONNA SEASON 'EM          
WITH SALT, BLACK PEPPER.        

425
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,682
     THIS FISH IS DONE.         
BEAUTIFUL, HUH? LOOK AT THAT.   

426
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:39,684
ISN'T THAT PERFECT?             
RIGHT IN THIS SAUCE.            
                           OKAY.

427
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,818
BEAUTIFUL.                      
                    THERE WE GO.

428
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,622
I'M JUST GONNA COVER THIS       
  FOR A COUPLE MINUTES.         

429
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,023
  NOW I'M GONNA                 
TAKE SOME PAPRIKA,              

430
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,425
 I'M GONNA PUT THIS ON TOP      
OF THESE BEAUTIFUL POTATOES.    

431
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,826
JUST MIX 'EM AROUND             
   A LITTLE BIT.                

432
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:53,364
TAKE THE FISH.                  
            WOW, IT'S JUST ABOUT
            READY TO FALL APART.

433
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:54,565
YEP.                            
                            OHH!

434
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,567
ALMOST.                         
                 GO, GO, GO, GO.

435
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,702
I'M GONNA CALL LEON             
 IF THIS DOESN'T--              

436
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,637
                            OHH.
OHH. IS THAT A PROBLEM?         

437
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:04,842
               THE RUSSIAN JUDGE
                GIVES HIM AN 8. 

438
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,577
        COVER THAT WITH SAUCE   
    AND POTATOES, IN MY OPINION.

439
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:09,447
               OH, THERE YOU GO.
 SO NOW WE'RE GONNA TAKE        
A LITTLE BIT OF OUR JUICE.      

440
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,782
EXTRA JUICE RIGHT THERE         
    FOR THE DANCE.              

441
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,918
   THAT IS A LITTLE             
SIDE ORDER OF POTATOES.         

442
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,187
           SO IF I EAT ALL THIS,
            YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO

443
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:17,988
            GIVE ME A RIDE BACK.
  ALL RIGHT, SO NOW             
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS          

444
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,924
WE GOT TO FINISH THIS OFF       
 WITH SOME LEMON SLICES,        

445
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,927
 A LITTLE FRESH                 
ITALIAN PARSLEY.                

446
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:25,529
           AND THIS IS HOW      
     YOUR GRANDMA WOULD MAKE IT?
        THAT'S IT.              
THAT HOW NONNI WOULD DO IT.     

447
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,733
                      NO GARLIC.
NO.                             

448
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:32,870

                 HADDOCK--PRIMO.

449
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:34,405
ALL OF OUR SEAFOOD              
IS FRESH AS CAN BE.             

450
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:37,808
 I'M AT THE MARKET              
7:00 EVERY MORNING.             
             ARE YOU, SERIOUSLY?

451
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,010
YEAH.                           
         IT'S TENDER, NOT A REAL
           STRONG FISH FLAVOR,  

452
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,613
       BUT A NICE LITTLE COATING
       THERE WITH THAT EGG WASH.

453
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,014
             JUST ENOUGH THAT   
          IT SOAKS UP THE SAUCE.

454
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,950
               ENOUGH LEMON,    
           DOESN'T TAKE IT OVER.
YEAH.                           

455
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:48,685
   IT'S PUT TOGETHER RIGHT, MAN.
          TASTY POTATOES.       

456
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,554

                  INDULGENCE.

                   PACKAGE DEAL.

THANK YOU.                      

459
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:58,362
          VERY TENDER.          
      IT FLAKES PERFECTLY.      

460
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,631
  THE LEMON ADDS A NICE TOUCH   
  OF FLAVOR. IT'S PHENOMENAL.   

461
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,499
   IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES.    

462
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,835
 ONCE YOU START EATING IT, YOU  
  CAN'T STOP. IT'S DELICIOUS.   

463
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,170
I GOT TO TELL YOU, MAYOR,       
   THE WAY WAS RAISED           

464
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:08,305

465
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,175
  AND THE ENVIRONMENT I WANT    
TO BE IN IS A JOINT LIKE THIS.  
                  I WANT TO FEEL
                  COMFORTABLE-- 

466
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:14,511
            FEEL COMFORTABLE    
        AND ENJOY THE GOOD MEAL.
     YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL      
      THE LOVE THEY HAVE,       

467
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,647
     BECAUSE THEY WANT YOU      
         TO COME BACK.          

468
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,716
     THEY WANT YOU TO COME      
      BACK TO THIS PLACE.       

469
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,651
          NOT GONNA FINISH THAT?
  I'M GETTING

I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO EAT       
  IT ALL WITH YOU HERE.         

471
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,789
I FIGURED YOUR DETAIL           
WAS GONNA TAKE ME OUT.          
             OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
             SIT DOWN AND RELAX.

472
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,924
ALL RIGHT.                      
              DON'T GET NERVOUS.
