1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,668
  You know, people were asking  
   me all the time, hey, Guy,   

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:04,736
 that one joint you checked out 
   that one city when you were  

3
00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:06,338
 doing Triple-D, how they doing?

4
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:07,339
     You know, I don't know.    

5
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:08,240
     We should check it out.    

6
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:11,410
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
         Over the years,        

7
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:13,412
  I've seen and tasted it all.  

8
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:14,613
    This is ridiculous, dude.   

9
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:15,947
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
        But it turns out,       

10
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:18,550
    it was only the beginning   
     because Triple-D joints    

11
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:19,685
      have been blowing up.     

12
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,353
      And we're going back      
     to see what's cooking.     

13
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,890
    Like on this trip, we're    
     crossing the country--     

14
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,293
          Special this          
       week, guy in town.       

15
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:29,894
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
    --and circling the globe.   

16
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,163
  We call it a Polish burrito.  

17
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:31,964
         Polish burrito.        

18
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:33,031
         Polish burrito.        

19
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:34,099
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
           In Alaska,           

20
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,300
     Not bad movement there.    

21
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,068
      He's Chuck Norris and     
    Emeril at the same time.    

22
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,703
   GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): --a   
    good buddy still working    

23
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,772
    the wok all year 'round.    

24
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:42,975
    I know where I'm going to   
   start spending my holidays.  

25
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,709
    GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): A    
    German joint in Portland,   

26
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,979
 Oregon staying uber authentic. 

27
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:50,382
     They're making over 120    
   different types of sausage.  

28
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,316
         Sausage plate.         

29
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:52,450
          There you go.         

30
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:53,652
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
         And a Ukrainian        

31
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,720
      market in Minneapolis     
           whipping up          

32
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,056
  traditional sausage and stew. 

33
00:00:58,092 --> 00:00:59,491
         Just wheel that        
      right up to the '67.      

34
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:04,530
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
   Familiar faces, new places,  

35
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,632
 and more off the hook flavors. 

36
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:07,900
    This is Triple-D Nation.    

37
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:17,810
   I cannot believe it was 11   
 years ago that we came up here 

38
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,613
 to North Pole, Alaska to shoot 
 a Christmas special for Diners,

39
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:22,814
      Drive Ins, and Dives.     

40
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:23,815
     Is it always like this?    

41
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:24,750
  It's Christmas all the time.  

42
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,418
         GUY FIERI: It's        
     Christmas all the time.    

43
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,420
  And there was one restaurant  
     in particular that we--    

44
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:29,221
      [interposing voices]      

45
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,889
        Were here again.        

46
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:31,890
        Come on, come on.       
            Let's go.           

47
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:32,891
       I have to show you.      

48
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,259
       This is Benny Lin.       

49
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:35,060
       And this is Pagoda.      

50
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:37,996
      I've got the chicken.     

51
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,700
        We saw Pagoda on        
     Triple-D. We got here.     

52
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:42,767
         It was amazing.        

53
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:43,769
      We keep coming back.      

54
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:44,769
   We just moved to the area.   

55
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:47,038
       Our friends told us      
      to check out Pagoda.      

56
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,241
       And we just fell in      
      love with the place.      

57
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,245
      I have been coming to     
   Pagoda for about 31 years.   

58
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:55,180
 GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): And that
  means she found this joint 20 

59
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,581
       years before I did.      

60
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,850
 What makes great Chinese food? 

61
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,651
 What makes great Chinese food? 

62
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:00,919
              Uh--              

63
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,988
      Great Chinese cooks.      

64
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:03,856
      Great Chinese cooks.      

65
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:04,923
      Oh, that's-- really?      

66
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,858
        That's what I was       
       going to say also.       

67
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,326
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
      And that Chinese food     

68
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,261
      maestro is Benny Lin.     

69
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,263
          Why did I age         
        and Benny didn't?       

70
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,599
    Can we just get a picture   
  of looking at the two of us?  

71
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:15,801
  That's not fair, by the way.  

72
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,872
       So Benny-- without       
        question, one of        

73
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,007
  our favorite Triple-D joints. 

74
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,342
        We came up here.        

75
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,677
  It was a really cool special  
    we shot for the holidays.   

76
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,546
      I know we're going to     
   start spending my holidays.  

77
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:28,346
    Chinese restaurant, huh?    

78
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,147
             Pagoda?            

79
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,081
      No, in your kitchen.      

80
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,016
           All right.           

81
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:32,083
         Put a tree up.         

82
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,418
        What did we have        
     last time we were here?    

83
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,420
          King crab leg         
       with ginger sauce.       

84
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,022
      Let's start off with      
       the King crab legs.      

85
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:39,024
    Look at the size of that.   

86
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:40,692
 You have something right there.

87
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,163
         [joke yelling]         

88
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,431
           Fire it up.          

89
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,299
    Now, how many BTUs use do   
   you think we have in there?  

90
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,434
      This one is like 55.      

91
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,302
             55,000?            

92
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:51,103
              Yeah.             

93
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,171
          55,000 BTUs.          

94
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:56,141
     The needle out there at    
     the gas meter's going--    

95
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,709
       we're going to tear      
       this out tonight--       

96
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:58,710
               OK.              

97
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,212
       --and I'm going to       
     move this to my house.     

98
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:01,380
               OK.              

99
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,715
    When I built my new house   
    and built my new kitchen,   

100
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:06,184
      I tried to put a wok      
        set up like this.       

101
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,122
 And all Laurie had to do is see
 it one time with all the water 

102
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:13,325
  and everything on-- she goes, 
  no, no, that's not happening. 

103
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,460
   We add some oil and garlic.  

104
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,594
         We add ginger.         
            - Ginger?           

105
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:17,663
              Yep.              

106
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:18,930
      I feel like I should      
     give the play by play.     

107
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,265
         King crab legs.        

108
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:22,000
      I'm going to take an      
       elbow to the teeth.      

109
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:22,734
     It's like UFC cooking.     

110
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,535
              Bam.              

111
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,736
               Ah!              

112
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:25,938
      He's Chuck Norris and     
    Emeril at the same time.    

113
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:26,738
               OK.              

114
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,672
        Black bean sauce.       

115
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,473
       Some oyster sauce.       

116
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:29,407
          - Soy sauce.          
             - Yeah.            

117
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:30,208
          Look at that.         

118
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:31,276
               OK.              

119
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,077
        I'm gonna faint.        

120
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:32,944
          Black pepper.         

121
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:33,811
           Oh, sugar.           

122
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:34,613
              Yeah.             

123
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,281
         You glaze with         
        some white wine?        

124
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,150
        White wine, yeah.       

125
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:39,618
          The scallions         
        and the cilantro?       

126
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,419
              Yeah.             

127
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,287
   They'll be the last thing.   

128
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,088
           All right.           

129
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,789
          Look at that.         

130
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,228
        That's excellent.       
          - Thank you.          

131
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,029
           Fantastic.           

132
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,231
       Gosh, that's good.       

133
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,032
   I feel like I'm mining for   
    gold in Alaska right now.   

134
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:56,635
          King crab leg         
       with ginger sauce--      

135
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,835
    those are only seasonal.    

136
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:00,572
       But we do have lots      
      of costumer comes in      

137
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,008
      and asks for the dish     
        almost every day.       

138
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,511
          I'm sure not          
       gonna eat all this.      

139
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,380
       So we come back for      
        Triple-D Nation.        

140
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:09,715
       What we like to do       
       is find out what's       

141
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,517
    been going on, how you're   
 doing, and also any new dishes.

142
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:13,652
   Anything new and exciting?   

143
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:14,586
           Absolutely.          

144
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,988
        I get the lobster       
        Cantonese style.        

145
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:18,089
    Lobster Cantonese style.    

146
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,726
      Here's our Cantonese      
          lobster tail.         

147
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:24,662
   The lobster tail Cantonese   
    style is just next level.   

148
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:25,596
       Let's do it, Benny.      

149
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:26,531
           All right.           

150
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,199
       First, we're going       
       to hit up the wok.       

151
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:31,136
       You're going to add      
        oil, 375 degrees.       

152
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:32,003
               OK.              

153
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,204
   Lobster tail in the shell.   

154
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,339
             Got it.            
             - Yeah.            

155
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:35,473
      Getting a quick fry.      

156
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,209
      And nothing on that,      
      no corn starch, or--      

157
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,277
   - No corn starch, nothing.   
              - OK.             

158
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:39,077
               OK.              

159
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,012
    Just like 3 more minute.    

160
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,347
       I think I'm getting      
         taller, Benny.         

161
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,548
   And you're getting shorter.  
            - I know.           

162
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,349
               OK.              

163
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,217
       Drain off the oil.       

164
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,151
            Oh, yeah.           

165
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,219
           All right.           

166
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:48,620
        We going to add a       
      little bit of garlic.     

167
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:49,621
             Garlic.            

168
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,156
        Black bean sauce.       

169
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:51,957
               OK.              

170
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:52,824
             Ginger.            

171
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,624
            Carrots.            

172
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:54,826
               OK.              

173
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:55,626
          Green onion.          

174
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:56,427
          Green onion.          

175
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,295
           White wine.          

176
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,030
   Little bit of white pepper.  

177
00:04:59,066 --> 00:04:59,765
          White pepper.         

178
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,166
      Hoisin and soy sauce.     

179
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,166
         Soy sauce now?         
             - Yeah.            

180
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:03,201
         Soy sauce now.         

181
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:04,035
               OK.              

182
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,103
  And we add the lobster back.  

183
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,237
        Lobster back in.        

184
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:08,774
       Sautée it a little       
    bit, a few more minutes.    

185
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,108
 Not bad movement there, buddy. 

186
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,048
           Right here.          

187
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,649
        How many lobsters       
        was that, Benny?        

188
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,583
          That's three.         

189
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,384
         Three lobsters.        

190
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,519
           That's it.           

191
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,653
        Benny always does       
       it on the low side.      

192
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:22,587
           All right.           

193
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:23,521
          Here you go.          

194
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:24,389
     You want to use these?     

195
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,757
     Here's your chopsticks.    

196
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,460
           I use fork.          

197
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,794
             I use--            

198
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,862
          I use a fork.         

199
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,200
          Special this          
       week, Guy in town.       

200
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,737
     Benny, it's fantastic.     

201
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,071
    Are you going to try it?    

202
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:40,972
        I have to try it.       

203
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:44,742
     Good amount of veggies.    

204
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:48,080
    The lobster is delicious,   
  not overcooked, super tender. 

205
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:49,614
 The sauce doesn't overpower it.

206
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,883
        You can actually        
       taste the lobster.       

207
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,118
 You cook it with the shell on. 

208
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,089
       And you use a fork.      

209
00:05:59,059 --> 00:05:59,891
     All my favorite things.    

210
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:04,563
      Here's our Cantonese      
          lobster tail.         

211
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,364
   It's almost spicy but not.   

212
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,432
      It's a little sweet.      

213
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:09,167
 The ginger really makes it pop.

214
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,501
          Kind of got a         
       little tangy to it.      

215
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,436
          It's amazing.         

216
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:13,305
   This lobster is delicious.   

217
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,406
  I hope he doesn't finish his. 

218
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,508
          - I love it.          
          - Thank you.          

219
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:17,309
           Delicious.           

220
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,110
            Thank you           

221
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,581
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
   Coming up, an old favorite   

222
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,981
       and a hot new dish.      

223
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,250
         Dragon chicken.        

224
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,184
         Dragon chicken.

     [making animal noises]     

226
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:29,221
     Dragon chicken, you're     
       going to love this.      

227
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,423
         [music playing]        

228
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,158
          So here I am,         
       North Pole, Alaska.      

229
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,493
         And I find out         
       they've got an off       

230
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,827
  the hook Chinese restaurant.  

231
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,830
        Oh, I got to stop       
      and check out Pagoda.     

232
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:41,833
That was back in 2009, but now--

233
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,302
        We shot Triple-D,       
       we didn't know you.      

234
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:45,237
       You didn't know us.      

235
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:46,838
         And ladies and         
     gentlemen, after that,     

236
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:48,974
     it's all a blur because    
        then Benny became       

237
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,909
   just a part of the family.   

238
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,710
           [inaudible]          

239
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,178
     I do Guys Grocery Game.    

240
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,046
             Benny.             

241
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,982
    It is nectar of the Gods.   

242
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,184
     We had you on Triple-D     
       Take Out recently.       

243
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,385
            Yes, yes.           

244
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:03,588
     I love that the Pagoda     
    sign is right behind you.   

245
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,523
             Right.             

246
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,525
           We did your          
      brother's restaurant      

247
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:07,592
     down in San Francisco.     

248
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,660
 How many of these can you eat? 

249
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:09,795
          I can get 15.         

250
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,262
        I can eat 15 too.       

251
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,765
      We had a blast there,     
      fantastic restaurant.     

252
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:19,204
  After we do the show, getting 
 at least 30% off the business. 

253
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,673
      We have waiting lists     
       almost every night.      

254
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,742
       And then we had to       
      add this bar in here      

255
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,276
   right now for more seating.  

256
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,678
         Beautiful bar.         

257
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,882
   The addition of the new bar  
  just adds that special touch. 

258
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,817
        I like it better        
     since the bar is open.     

259
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,952
     It's always welcoming.     

260
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,554
     I've never had anybody     
   that I've sent up here from  

261
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,823
      Triple-D that hasn't      
        told me how much        

262
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,391
   they love their experience.  

263
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:42,961
      What did we have last     
       time we were here?       

264
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,162
   We had the walnut shrimp--   

265
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,564
        Shrimp's nice and       
   tender, nice crunch to it.   

266
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:51,369
       --the pagoda steak       

267
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:52,904
    That means really killer.   

268
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,509
 By far the best steaks around. 

269
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:58,843
       Everything's right.      

270
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,378
    It's always hot and fast.   

271
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:01,846
       Every time we come       
       here and, you know,      

272
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,515
   we get something different.  

273
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:06,117
     When they get something    
   new, they're like, hey, you  

274
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:06,918
        want to try this?       

275
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:08,186
     And you're like, yeah.     

276
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,921
        Dragon chicken--        
         it's dynamite.         

277
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,322
 You have to try it tonight, OK?

278
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,057
         Dragon chicken.        

279
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:14,693
         Dragon chicken.        

280
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:19,063
          So heating up         
       the oil in the wok.      

281
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,365
            Chicken.            

282
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:21,733
    (SARCASTICALLY) One thing   
 you can always expect at Pagoda

283
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:22,567
       is small portions.       

284
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,202
               OK.              

285
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,336
       So chicken's done.       
        - Chicken's done.       

286
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,338
              Next?             

287
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,006
       So we had a little       
         bit of garlic.         

288
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,941
  And then we had heavy cream.  

289
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,142
      Heavy cream, got it.      

290
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,877
  So then we had lobster base.  

291
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,678
          Lobster base.         

292
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,879
        Cajun seasoning.        

293
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:35,680
          Black pepper.         

294
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,648
          Black pepper.         

295
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:37,748
          Jack Daniel.          

296
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:38,617
          Jack Daniels?         

297
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,085
              Yeah.             

298
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:42,487
       So Cajun seasoning       
        and Jack Daniels        

299
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,689
     at a Chinese restaurant    
         in North pole.         

300
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:45,690
     You hear it every day.     

301
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,758
          Oyster sauce.         

302
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,092
           Soy sauce.           

303
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,028
      So take the veggies,      
   give those a little blanch.  

304
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:50,829
              Yeah.             

305
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,097
     Broccoli and mushroom.     

306
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:52,897
               OK.              

307
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,031
      The chicken back in.      

308
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,033
               OK.              

309
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:55,901
          Sautée it up.         

310
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,168
 Let it reduce, let it coat up. 

311
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:57,969
              Yeah.             

312
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,704
     Add little bit of oil.     

313
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:00,972
        I'm going to come       
        work on the line        

314
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,707
   here one day, me and Benny.  

315
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:03,507
         All right, Guy.        

316
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:04,309
           It's ready.          

317
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:05,110
           All right?           

318
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,316
  Oh, top steak now, all right. 

319
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:12,116
       What do you think?       

320
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,250
    Chicken is super tender.    

321
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:14,719
  Veggies have got good crunch. 

322
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:15,921
 The sauce doesn't overpower it.

323
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,455
      You are putting out a     
   bunch of whiskey in there,   

324
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:18,523
      but that cooked off.      

325
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:19,657
      There's a little bit      
       of Cajun seasoning.      

326
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:20,458
         Delicious dish.        

327
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:21,826
        How are you guys?       

328
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,528
   Here's our dragon chicken.   

329
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,463
       The dragon chicken       
          is fantastic.         

330
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,732
     The sauce melts in your    
 mouth, along with the chicken. 

331
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,668
      A lot of flavor, and      
     it pops in your mouth.     

332
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,002
        It's very creamy.       

333
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,004
    It's got a little bit of    
  heat to it, but not too much. 

334
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:33,972
         It was so good.        

335
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,607
         It's the Benny         
       twist to it, right?      

336
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:36,808
          I'll open up          
      Pagoda in Santa Rosa.     

337
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:37,675
               OK.              

338
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:38,877
  We'll bleach your hair blond. 

339
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,145
         I'll go black.         

340
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:41,079
               OK.              

341
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,347
        I get some lifts        
        in my shoes, OK?        

342
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:43,615
        And you've got to       
       put on some weight.      

343
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,417
       I've told you this       
        a million times,        

344
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:48,019
       I wish there was a       
      Pagoda in every town.     

345
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,153
       Thank you, brother.      

346
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,421
     - You'll love this guy.    
          - Thank you.          

347
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,356
        The food's great.       

348
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:52,290
        And he's amazing.       

349
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,294
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
      Coming up in Oregon,      

350
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,561
          Look at that          

351
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:58,896
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
        Salami and jerky,       

352
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,298
    straight out of Germany.    

353
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,832
       Salami sandwiches.       

354
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,368
             O-M-G.             

355
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:05,436
        Thai chili jerky.       

356
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:06,171
           Thank you.           

357
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,975
         [music playing]        

358
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,543
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
           In 2013, I           

359
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,546
      was on the Southeast      
    side of Portland, Oregon    

360
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:17,749
      to check out a market     
  cranking out German sausage.  

361
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,684
         I find out it's        
      not just one sausage      

362
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,285
 or two sausages they're making.

363
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:24,288
     They're making over 120    
   different types of sausage.  

364
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:27,291
GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): And these
  days, the list keeps growing. 

365
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:31,162
        This is Edelweiss       
    Sausage and Delicatessen.   

366
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,497
      Currywurst coming up.     

367
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,499
         I saw Edelweiss        
       on Triple-D. And I       

368
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,833
 had to come try it for myself. 

369
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,769
        And it definitely       
      lived up to the hype.     

370
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,704
        If you have gone        
       to Germany and you       

371
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,573
        fell in love with       
     those foods over there,    

372
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,108
 this is where you'll find them.

373
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,843
   This is a multigenerational  
        family business,        

374
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,578
    thriving and doing great.   

375
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,447
    GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): It   
  started by George Baier, who  

376
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,250
   brought all his meatpacking  
       skills from Berlin       

377
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,452
  and opened this place in '82. 

378
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:57,589
  Then he passed that knowledge 
  on to his sons, Tom and Tony. 

379
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:02,193
     So it's the two of you?    

380
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,060
        The two of yous?        

381
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,261
   Is your dad still involved?  

382
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,730
          No, he's not.         

383
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,732
      He's down in Arizona.     

384
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,001
       Since the show, my       
       brother's retired.       

385
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,270
      So now it's just me,      
      my kids, and my wife.     

386
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,671
        Thai chili jerky.       

387
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,006
     It's a family business.    

388
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,841
        And they know how       
       to do things right.      

389
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,078
   What are we going to make?   

390
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,012
      We're going to make a     
 dry-cured Italian wine salami. 

391
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:22,747
            I-talian.           

392
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,683
      We're going to start      
       with the pork fat.       

393
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,952
     So this is all frozen.     

394
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:29,154
  This is going to get gnarly.  

395
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,158
           All right.           

396
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:34,959
         Nice fine dice.        

397
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:35,760
          Look at that.         

398
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:38,563
         We're going to         
       add the beef to it.      

399
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,764
          - What cuts?          
        - Bottom rounds.        

400
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:40,565
         Bottom rounds.         

401
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,332
              Yep.              

402
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,167
          There we go.          

403
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,368
 Just got to add the seasoning. 

404
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:45,570
     This is a curing salt--    

405
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:48,372
  sugar, Morton salt, dextrose. 

406
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,775
       We'll add the white      
     pepper, ground fennel,     

407
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,243
  black pepper, whole fennel--  

408
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,311
              Nice.             

409
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,247
        --Juniper berry,        
      crushed garlic, whole     

410
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,982
   bottle of Italian red wine.  

411
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,317
            Italian!            

412
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,119
  And it's ready for stuffin'.  

413
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,320
      How magical is that?      

414
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,855
    I'm getting one of these,   
     Laurie, for the house.     

415
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:05,256
    And I'm shipping it home.   

416
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:06,524
     That thing was ancient.    

417
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:09,527
          The motor was         
     probably 55 years old.     

418
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,262
        Since then, we've       
      managed to upgrade it     

419
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,798
    to a brand new one we had   
  shipped from Germany, thanks  

420
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,200
          to the show.          

421
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:16,267
         We should have         
       boxed the other one      

422
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,802
  and sent it to Guy as a gift. 

423
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,937
     It's going to be right     
  there next to the new butcher 

424
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,339
      block I just bought.      

425
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,140
           All right.           

426
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,141
    Let me give this a shot.    

427
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,542
           All right.           

428
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,544
    I'm going to wear half of   
  this, I can already feel it.  

429
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:27,245
              Pull!             

430
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,148
              Nice.             

431
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,016
      This'll dry up well.      

432
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,552
      We'll let it cure and     
   hang for a couple of days.   

433
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:35,253
           Smell that.          

434
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:38,556
            [sniffs]            

435
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:41,993
          There we go.          

436
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:43,862
              Wow.              

437
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,899
        I would do damage       
      on a deli with this.      

438
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:50,902
 Since the show, we've probably 
    quadrupled the quantity.    

439
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,837
         It's just been         
       growing since then       

440
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,906
        and has continued       
      to make recipes that      

441
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,108
 have that German feel to them. 

442
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,843
           [inaudible]          
     sandwich for Gretchen.     

443
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:01,445
    There's always something    
      new to come and try.      

444
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:04,448
        This is our Thai        
       chili pepper jerky.      

445
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:05,716
    We take a cow top round.    

446
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,118
     We slice it-- a little     
       over a quarter inch      

447
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,855
     so that it has a little    
     bit of softness to it.     

448
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:13,591
   We're going to add the beef  
   into our little mixing bag.  

449
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:17,395
      Start with some salt,     
   brown sugar, black pepper,   

450
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:22,533
curing salt, clover honey, spicy
  Thai chili pepper seasoning.  

451
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:26,337
We blend our Thai chilies, fresh
  garlic cloaks, a little rice  

452
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,806
  wine vinegar and brown sugar. 

453
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:29,874
          Seal this up.         

454
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,542
      We're going to tumble     
       it for four hours,       

455
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:35,746
      allowing the cells to     
       absorb the flavors.      

456
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,817
 We're going to season our jerky
  with some crushed red pepper  

457
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,751
   and then some black pepper.  

458
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:43,021
    Smoke it at 200 degrees.    

459
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,022
    After two hours it, it'll   
     be completely finished.    

460
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,690
  Here's your Thai chili jerky. 

461
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:48,626
      Thank you very much.      

462
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,696
      There's a pretty good     
  balance between the spiciness 

463
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:52,697
       and the sweetness.       

464
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,433
     And on top of that, the    
      bite is really nice.      

465
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:56,835
         It's so tender.        

466
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,369
       If you like a kick       
       in your beef jerky,      

467
00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,604
       this is definitely       
       the jerky for you.       

468
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,975
        They just have a        
      great product, a lot      

469
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,209
  of great products, actually.  

470
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,178
        Chili cheese dog        
        with sauerkraut.        

471
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,981
             O-M-G.             

472
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,650
     Last time Guy was here,    
    he had the [inaudible]..    

473
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,586
     Housemaid balogna, not     
     just wrapped in bacon,     

474
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:17,155
  but cooked in its own bacon.  

475
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,791
      That's out of bounds.     

476
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:24,395
   Guy also had roasted garlic  
   and fresh rosemary balogna.  

477
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:26,997
             Killer.            

478
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,599
        This is the place       
       to come and relive       

479
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,734
 some of that German experience.

480
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,671
    There's so many different   
       things to try here.      

481
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,940
         We're going to         
        make pizza loaf.        

482
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,609
     First thing we need to     
    do is make the emulsion.    

483
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,011
      We're going to start      
       with the back fat.       

484
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,345
     We're going to dice it.    

485
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,280
      Here in the monster?      

486
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:42,981
              Yep.              

487
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,222
      This is ground meets.     

488
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,657
  Chuck and the pork shoulder.  

489
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,493
            Now ice?            

490
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,228
      We got to keep a cold     
       when it's blending.      

491
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,064
       Because if it gets       
      hot, it'll separate.      

492
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,636
      Going to add the salt     
     and sugar and the cure,    

493
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:08,039
     some dried mustard and     
      smoked paprika, mace      

494
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,709
     and cumin, cardamom and    
    coriander, white pepper,    

495
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,244
       and garlic powder.       

496
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,612
  Now we'll turn it up on high. 

497
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:20,318
       Sun dried tomatoes,      
       crushed red pepper,      

498
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:26,256
  toasted onions, fire-roasted  
  bell peppers, pork shoulder.  

499
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,359
     Now we'll add our Swiss    
     cheese and our cheddar.    

500
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,530
      The final step, we'll     
      add our black olives.     

501
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,132
    Mix it for a minute until   
 everything's well incorporated.

502
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,068
   We're going to go ahead and  
    put this in the loaf pan.   

503
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:39,270
250 degrees for 2 and 1/2 hours.

504
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,474
 Now we're going to slice a nice
  steak out of the pizza loaf,  

505
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,644
 grill it, chop it up into some 
   sticks, add some marinara.   

506
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:48,947
      And it's ready to go.     

507
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:51,682
       Pizza loaf with the      
    homemade marinara sauce.    

508
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:53,351
  The pizza loaf is phenomenal. 

509
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,086
        It's got a little       
     crunch on the outside.     

510
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,888
  It reminds me a little bit of 
 mozzarella sticks but meatier. 

511
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:59,290
          It has such a         
       nice flavor to it.       

512
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,658
     It's really delicious.     

513
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,428
         This is great.         

514
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,030
Your dad should be really proud.

515
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,531
       This is one of the       
         best I've seen.        

516
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:08,298
            Nice job.           

517
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:09,033
      Excellent, thank you.     

518
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:12,904
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
   Coming up in Minneapolis--   

519
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:14,038
         Right in there.        

520
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,506
   GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): --an  
     Eastern European eatery    

521
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,910
   still killing it with their  
   cabbage rolls at Krakowska.  

522
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:21,179
   If you're mowing the lawn,   
  just let it run 'til it's out 

523
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,380
    of gas and get down here.   

524
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,951
         [music playing]        

525
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,220
      I'm here in Northeast     
    Minneapolis, or Nordeast,   

526
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:32,023
  as the locals call it, right  
   across the Hennepin Avenue   

527
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,826
     Bridge, in an area that    
    used to be home to a lot    

528
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,294
  of Eastern European families. 

529
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:37,895
       So of course you'd       
      expect to find, what?     

530
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:39,497
  Eastern European restaurants. 

531
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,365
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
        And back in 2010,       

532
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:42,633
  that's exactly what I found.  

533
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,704
      These days, the third     
   generation is still serving  

534
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:49,106
 scratch-made sausage and stew. 

535
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,875
      This is Kramarczuk's.     

536
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,246
        Kramarczuk's is a       
     family run restaurants     

537
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:58,116
  with made-from-scratch food.  

538
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,051
     It's great when we come    
    in and we see the poster    

539
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,853
      Guy and we know we're     
        at another great,       

540
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,722
   local, Triple-D restaurant.  

541
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,724
   It's nice to have something  
    that you can go to to get   

542
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:08,926
   a taste of the old country.  

543
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:13,531
       More specifically,       
  Ukraine, where the Kramarczuk 

544
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,999
        family came from.       

545
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,333
         My father made         
    everything from scratch.    

546
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,601
        Before it was the       
        cool thing to do.       

547
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,003
       Yeah, that's right.      

548
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,671
 GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): And then
  Orest passed that philosophy  

549
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:21,739
     down to his son, Nick.     

550
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,277
    How many different types    
     of sausage do you make?    

551
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,412
  Anywhere from about 35 to 60. 

552
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:29,347
   What are we going to make?   

553
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:30,948
         We're going to         
      make Krakowska today.     

554
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:33,551
       It's traditionally       
      a Polish lunch meat.      

555
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,885
    Look at the size of that.   

556
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,888
        (ECHOING) Hello.        

557
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,289
  Luke, I'll make your sausage. 

558
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:40,691
         - Are you done?        
             - Yeah.            

559
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:41,492
           All right.           

560
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:42,693
           Am I done?           

561
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:46,830
    [laughs] That's the best    
     line I've had all time.    

562
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:47,798
  What was that we just put in? 

563
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,233
       The pork fat bass.       

564
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,169
       (ECHOING) Build us,      
       and they will come.      

565
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:53,704
     A little bit of sugar,     
      a little bit of salt.     

566
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:54,972
         Right in there.        

567
00:17:55,008 --> 00:18:00,778
   Curing agent, white pepper,  
    mace, granulated garlic.    

568
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,579
           You got it.          

569
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:02,647
      The ground pork loin.     

570
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:03,447
               Go.              

571
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,248
            Sirloin.            

572
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,316
           Mix it up.           

573
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:06,918
     Now we put the rest of     
     our salt, curing agent.    

574
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,718
               OK.              

575
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,852
       Then we mix again.       

576
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:09,987
   A lot of work for sausage.   

577
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:10,788
             Ready?             

578
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:11,556
        Fire in the hole.       

579
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:15,792
[inaudible] right up there, son.

580
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:16,727
   Now we load up the hopper.   

581
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:17,728
              Yep.              

582
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:19,664
      [whistles] Now we're      
       going to stuff it.       

583
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,432
      I knew I had brought      
      glasses for a reason.     

584
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:24,936
  Now we thread the casing on.  

585
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,804
  Grab it as tight as you can.  

586
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:27,804
         That's awesome.        

587
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,407
        We get to the end       
      there, slide it off.      

588
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:30,608
   Tie 'em off on the bottom.   

589
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,143
          Look at that.         
          - Nice seal.          

590
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:33,277
 And then into the smoker for-- 

591
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,412
          12, 15 hours.         

592
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:35,346
          - No kidding.         
             - Yep.             

593
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:36,480
         Pull these out.        

594
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:38,682
   [whistles] That's awesome.   

595
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:39,683
          Ready to go.          

596
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,619
         Just wheel that        
      right up to the '67.      

597
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:42,686
          Let it cool.          

598
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,688
       And we'll be ready       
      to make our sandwich.     

599
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:45,756
       Look at this thing.      

600
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:46,891
      Cut the end off here.     

601
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:47,758
         Slice that up.         

602
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:48,559
           Fire away.           

603
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,360
          Not too thin.         

604
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,494
     That's our Polish rye.     

605
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,163
       Stone-ground Polish      
        mustard on there,       

606
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:54,365
        horseradish mayo,       
         Havarti cheese,        

607
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,499
  our Krakowska that we made--  

608
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:56,567
               OK.              

609
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,369
        --some tomatoes,        
     cucumber, some lettuce.    

610
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,304
       There you have it,       
       Krakowska sandwich.      

611
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,305
     That's a big sandwich.     

612
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,382
  The Krakowska sandwich is one 
 of our best-selling sandwiches.

613
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:14,051
  Their Krakowska is wonderful. 

614
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,053
        Cabbage roll with       
       tomato cream sauce.      

615
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,256
     Every time we get food     
   here it's always been good.  

616
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:19,657
      Two brats with kraut.     

617
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:21,592
        Very tasty place        
       if you want to come      

618
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,394
    from your Ukrainian food.   

619
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,795
         I'm pretty much        
       a traditionalist--       

620
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,064
  the cabbage rolls, pierogies. 

621
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,065
      Boiled cabbage rolls.     

622
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,400
  We call it a Polish burrito.  

623
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:30,201
         Polish burrito.        

624
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:30,968
         Polish burrito.        

625
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:35,472
   If you're mowing the lawn,   
  just let it run 'til it's out 

626
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,774
   of gas, and get down here.   

627
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:40,144
           [inaudible]          

628
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:40,945
        Dumpling madness.       

629
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,481
        Those are great.        

630
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:45,383
   It's like a Polish ravioli.  

631
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,153
   One of our more traditional  
     recipes is bigos stew.     

632
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,756
      We're going to start      
     with a bunch of bacon,     

633
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:58,495
some cubed pork, kielbasa, diced
   onions, margarine, paprika,  

634
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,898
          whole caraway         
      seeds, dried porcini      

635
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,169
 mushrooms, tomato paste, prune 
 lekvar-- just fruit preserves. 

636
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:07,104
   We're going to deglaze the   
    skillet with some chicken   

637
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,774
 broth, add sauerkraut, shredded
   carrots, shredded potatoes,  

638
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,376
  salt, and some black pepper.  

639
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,245
       And we'll let that       
     stew for about an hour.    

640
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:17,114
  Once it's ready, we can take  
  it up the line and serve it.  

641
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,782
           Bigos stew.          

642
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,717
    The sauerkraut is sweet.    

643
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:21,652
      The sausage is great.     

644
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,721
    The mixture is fantastic.   

645
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,990
   It's comfort food that you   
    just want to keep eating.   

646
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,325
       It's made like your      
   grandmother would make it.   

647
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,728
    What's so cool about this   
  place, you guys make it all.  

648
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:31,928
           Impressed.           

649
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,264
   I think you're grandfather   
         would be pretty        

650
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,198
   happy to see this going on.  

651
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:34,966
         I think so too.        

652
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:37,735
      - Here you go, ma'am.     
          - Thank you.          

653
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,536
   GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): But   
  these aren't the only places  

654
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,604
  paying homage to their roots. 

655
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,006
      Two sausages for Jim.     

656
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:42,940
             Enjoy.             

657
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:43,808
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
           --so we'll           

658
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:44,875
   keep spinning in the globe.  

659
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,944
  Next time on Triple-D Nation. 

660
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,946
           To our good          
       friend, Benny Lin--      

661
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:49,880
            [cheers]            

662
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:52,717
     Now stop bringing food.    

663
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,486
   Salt and pepper pork chops.  

664
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,687
         Oh my goodness.        

665
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:57,488
           [inaudible]          

666
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,257
     GUY FIERI: Right here.
