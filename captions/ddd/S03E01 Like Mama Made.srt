   THE RIGHT RATIO?             

407
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:00,524
        I'D GIVE MYSELF A LITTLE
           MORE IF I WERE YOU,  

408
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,394

NO, I'M ALWAYS HUNGRY.          

409

410

        THE BISCUIT IS SO FLAKY 

411
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,401
                 THAT WHEN IT   
               GETS IN MY MOUTH,

412
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,136
                   IT ALMOST    
               JUST FALLS APART.

413
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,604

                 IT'S GOOD GRAVY

414
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,473
             WHEN THE FIRST BITE
                THAT YOU GET    

415
