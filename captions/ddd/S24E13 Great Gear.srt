1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,134
           Hey there.           

2
00:00:02,136 --> 00:00:03,735
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
     and we're rolling out,     

3
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:05,870
      looking for America's     
        greatest diners,        

4
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:06,939
      drive-ins and dives.      

5
00:00:06,941 --> 00:00:08,673
          -This trip...         
              -Wow.             

6
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,542
        We're throwing it       
        into overdrive...       

7
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,210
        This dude does not stop.

8
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,880
       Cooking it up with       
 some killer kitchen equipment. 

9
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:16,415
              That is awesome.  

10
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:17,682
       In San Francisco...      

11
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,485
        Holy breakdown shoulder.

12
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:21,019
  An all-out barbecue joint...  

13
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,888
          We're gonna have to go
             anaconda on my jaw.

14
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,424
       Going to town with       
     some rare city smokers.    

15
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:26,491
These are grandfathered in?     

16
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:27,759
         Yes, they are.         

17
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:28,694
        FIERI: In Maui...       

18
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:29,761
            What a great set-up.

19
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,296
 A tricked out pizza trailer... 

20
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:32,631
               Buddy, you just  
              don't make sense. 

21
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,233
         Putting out pie        
   from their oven on wheels.   

22
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,569
   You can't get pizza that good
            in most restaurants.

23
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:38,904
 And in Stockton, California... 

24
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,438
                Night-night.    

25
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,641
        A blow-your-mind        
       ravioli machine...       

26
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,643
         Ravioli train is coming
            along to Flavortown.

27
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:47,245
       Chugging along for       
         over a century.        

28
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:50,649
  I've seen really cool kitchen 
      equipment in my day.      

29
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,651
   This might be the coolest.   

30
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,386
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

31
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,222
           on "Diners,          
       Drive-Ins & Dives."      

32
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:11,670
    So I'm here at Stockton,    
           California,          

33
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:14,406
     a city that was founded    
          back in 1849,         

34
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,940
      so a ton of history.      

35
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,077
 And you find a place this old, 
 you know what you're gonna get?

36
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,412
     Probably an old-school     
     Italian deli somewhere.    

37
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,147
       And that's exactly       
       what we have here.       

38
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:23,882
           These folks          
      for three generations     

39
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:25,984
    have been scratch-making    
       the Italian sausage      

40
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:28,820
         and making over        
     4,000 raviolis a week.     

41
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,622
      This is Gian's Deli.      

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,493
          Pesto pasta.          

43
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,761
 -Everybody knows about Gian's. 
          -It is truly          

44
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:40,031
     that Italian experience    
 transplanted here in Stockton. 

45
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,633
       FIERI: Conjured up       
       by Gian Bolognini's      

46
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:46,238
    cousins generations ago,    
  and in 1968, 18-year-old Gian 

47
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,173
  arrived and joined the team.  

48
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:49,440
       MAN: Gian came from      
        a little village        

49
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,311
       up in the foothills      
   above Lucca called Corfino.  

50
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:54,245
       FIERI: He took over      
         the biz in '72.        

51
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:57,916
     Then in 2008, son Jeff     
  and his family took the helm  

52
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,918
         and have stuck         
    to what's tried and true.   

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,587
       Where did that come from?

54
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,789
    Hundred-year-old machine.   
  Came from another restaurant  

55
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,591
      that was in business      
       for about 80 years.      

56
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,060
              That is awesome.  

57
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:11,196
    FIERI: Still cranking out   
   raviolis by the table load.  

58
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:12,864
  How many raviolis             
you guys make a week?           

59
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,133
              About 300 pounds. 
A lot of raviolis.              

60
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,202
  Everybody loves the raviolis. 
   Can't order enough of 'em.   

61
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:18,537
    What type of                
 raviolis you make?             

62
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:21,806
          Beef, cheese, spinach,
        Swiss chard combination.

63
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,275
    All that together?          
                  Yes, sir.     

64
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,944
     They are excellent.        
 All right, brother.            
    Where we at?                

65
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,012
              Ravioli filling.  

66
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,081
   Swiss chard, spinach, onions,

67
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:32,284
          celery, parsley pureed
             with spices, eggs. 

68
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:34,419
Gotta have a little binder.     
                        Beef.   

69
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:37,289
 Freshly ground Parmesan cheese,
  bread crumbs, salt and pepper.

70
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,224
How long's it take for this     
  to mix together?              

71
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,225
           Two to three minutes.

72
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,626
And what happens to it          
     after this?                

73
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,694
        We let it sit overnight,

74
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,896
               get it to draw   
      some of that moisture out.

75
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,933
  FIERI: And while that rests,  
  it's go time for dough time,  

76
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:49,500
         and lots of it.        

77
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,171
  Basketball-sized dough balls  
      are floured and sent      

78
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:55,240
   through a sheeter ten times  
   to get the right thickness.  

79
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,175
       Then it's laid out       
        on a pasta table        

80
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:01,246
       big enough to make       
         2,700 raviolis.        

81
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,515
             Now that we've made
          the ravioli filling...

82
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:07,319
So you just keep scooping it,   
keep filling it, smearing it.   

83
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,388
                    Yup.        

84
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,922
I get my Zen moment going.      

85
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,125
 I just come in here            
  for some therapy.             

86
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:15,594
Now we take down the guard rails
               just like that.  

87
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:16,928
             Take the top piece.

88
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,196
   Okay.                        
                   Gently.      

89
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,465
This is a two person job.       
                  Absolutely.   

90
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,068
              It's like making  
             a big ravioli bed. 

91
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,205
                Night night.    
         See you in the morning.

92
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,407
 Etched it down just            
  to seal the ends.             

93
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,475
                           Okay.
And we're gonna pull that off.  

94
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,145
          Is this gonna come off
        the rails and drive down

95
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:34,746
                like a little   
               ravioli train?   

96
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:38,216
     Yes, it is.                
               Oh, I love it.   

97
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,353
         Ravioli train is coming
               to Flavortown.   

98
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:44,823
           Whoo whoo!           

99
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,358
              Wow.              

100
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,960
          That's nuts.          

101
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:52,731
     I have seen really cool    
  kitchen equipment in my day.  

102
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,700
   This might be the coolest.   

103
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:57,502
            It's like a mattress
               in Flavortown.   

104
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:00,638
Now we cut 'em nine across.     

105
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,440
Now what are we into?           
            Pasta sauce.        

106
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,708
        Okay.                   

107
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,176
             Olive oil, onions. 

108
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,980
So this is a generic,           
almost a bolognese sauce.       

109
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:09,381
                    Yeah.       
             You take some beef.

110
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:10,982
        We're gonna get all that
               nice and brown.  

111
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,118
       Celery, parsley, carrots.

112
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,186
And these are all recipes       
 that your dad had.             

113
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,856
     Or that my grandmother used
            and his family used.

114
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,324
      And after about 30 minutes
                 of cooking,    

115
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,193
               we're gonna add  
             some tomato paste, 

116
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:22,460
                tomato puree,   

117
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,462
             our browned onions,

118
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,931
    beef, and celery concoction,

119
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,999
                salt, pepper,   
              red chili flakes, 

120
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,534
              some white wine,  

121
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:30,935
                 chopped up     
             porcini mushrooms. 

122
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,738
Dried porcinis rehydrated.      

123
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,505
             Water that we used 
              in the porcinis.  

124
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,074
The steeping liquid,            
       got it.                  

125
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,876
     We're gonna let that simmer
              for eight hours.  

126
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,877
 And so that's gonna            
be used on the ravioli,         

127
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,079
 this is the go-to.             

128
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,614
                 Spaghetti.     
          That's it right there.
     Got it.                    

129
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,350
       Now we got those raviolis
                that we made,   

130
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,285
             two, three minutes.

131
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,620
              Float to the top, 
                they're done.   

132
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,555
     Now we're gonna add some of
        our homemade meat sauce,

133
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:51,757
            give it a good stir.

134
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,825
    They soak up                
a little bit of sauce.          

135
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,226
        Freshly grated Parmesan.

136
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,828
        And another little stir.

137
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,098
     That's what                
 I'm talking about.             

138
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,368
           Garnish with a little
               extra Parmesan.  

139
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,203
Welcome to food coma.           

140
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,445
   Oh, I'm sorry.               

141
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:14,779
I was somewhere else.           

142
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:19,184
 So it takes me back            
  to my childhood.              

143
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,853
Tender, nice little texture     
to the pasta itself.            

144
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:25,857
  A good balance of             
the Swiss chard to the meat.    

145
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,659
And I love the meat sauce.      
  It's very simple.             

146
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,028
 Just little pillows            
   of perfection.               

147
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:39,070
I literally could eat           
about three plates of these.    

148
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,605
          -Ravioli up.          
         -Can't beat it.        

149
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,941
    MAN: The spinach filling    
      is the perfect bite.      

150
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:43,942
          Great flavor.         

151
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,610
       WOMAN: You can get       
       the frozen raviolis      

152
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,279
    and the frozen meat sauce   
          to take home.         

153
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:48,880
You have a ravioli train.       

154
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,281
 That is so unfair.             

155
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,682
I want a ravioli train.         

156
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,017
    Or how about                
 their meat cannon?             

157
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,821
It's like the artillery center  
   in Flavortown.               

158
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,290
  Oh, yes to that.              

159
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:00,192
  And we're firing              
 this baby up next.             

160
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,165
       FIERI: Gian's deli       
    at Stockton, California,    

161
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,367
      is about as real deal     
           as it gets.          

162
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,569
       Old school Italian.      

163
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,571
Still got all the big blocks    
      of cheese                 

164
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:15,307
and all the big salumi hair     
and they're slicing it to order.

165
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:16,441
            I've often come here

166
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:17,909
           when I need something
                 last minute    

167
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,444
          for an Italian dinner.

168
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:20,712
            You know,           
  whatever you want for lunch,  

169
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,913
    they'll make it for you.    

170
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,314
    Sausage pepper sandwich.    

171
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,383
 WOMAN: The sausage is homemade 

172
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,320
            and it's            
      absolutely delicious.     

173
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:29,788
FIERI: Okay, now we're          
into making sausage.            

174
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,192
             Pork butt, pepper, 
                salt, sugar,    

175
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,860
          curing salt, allspice.

176
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,061
    A lot of it.                

177
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,798
          Nutmeg, garlic powder,
        and a little white wine.

178
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,868
    Mix this all up until we get
 a nice little bowling ball size

179
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,069
           to put in the hopper.

180
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,171
 Hopper non-stopper.            

181
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,138
 Look at the size --            

182
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,610
   Luke, I am your              
  Italian sausage.              

183
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:53,077
              Think we're ready 
                 to go here.    

184
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:57,082
 Oh, it doesn't have            
it's own cool little hinge.     

185
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:01,219
It's like the artillery center  
   in Flavortown.               

186
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,487
        Hook up the hog casings.

187
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,689
If I had this in the back       
 of a covered wagon,            

188
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,091
I'd be called Josey Wales.      

189
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,427
    [ Imitating machine gun ]   

190
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,498
                 All right.     
         We're ready to spin it.

191
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,634
We're a good team here.         
     All right.                 

192
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,971
So now we're gonna take it,     
tie it off with string.         

193
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,105
                  Poke 'em.     

194
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,707
  Let a little bit              
   of the air out.              

195
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,776
   Let these hang for about two,
      three days in the walk-in.

196
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,844
Build all that flavor.          

197
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,913
    Now we're gonna slice it up.

198
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,582
             A browned homemade 
               Italian sausage  

199
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:34,452
with the homemade focaccia bread
        with some teleme cheese.

200
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,455
             We'll finish it off
                in the oven.    

201
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,656
                 All right.     

202
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,392
       And fire roasted red bell
          pepper, spicy mustard.

203
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,094
      Mustard.                  

204
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,398
    Nicely done.                

205
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,000
Baked the focaccia yourself?    

206
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,536
                 Every day.     

207
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,071
It's really dynamite.           

208
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,405
I love the texture of it.       

209
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,608
The way that you guys get       
your grind done for your pork   

210
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,876
    is right on.                

211
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,077
It does a lot of allspice.      

212
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,146
It almost has like a little     

213
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,548
 Swiss-Italian type             
 of a flavor to it.             

214
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,083
And to think that that sausage  
recipe still continues on.      

215
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:07,018
   It's good, man.              

216
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,955
               Appreciate it.   
Well done.                      

217
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,957
     It is a solid sandwich     
           every time.          

218
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,025
         It's got spice         
        but it's not hot.       

219
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,360
      From the fresh bread      

220
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,029
  to the mustard, the sausage,  
         the red pepper.        

221
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,564
  I mean, how can you go wrong? 

222
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,165
    Nothing compares to this.   

223
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,368
       My dad was a big believer
       in treating people right,

224
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,036
                serving them    
     good quality food homemade.

225
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,838
It's a really neat thing        
to see how much pride           

226
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,573
 and how much energy            
and how much enthusiasm         

227
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:29,641
that you're carrying on.        

228
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:30,642
You ought to be proud.          

229
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:33,111
                 Thank you.     

230
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,980
   Coming up, a southern joint  
       in San Francisco...      

231
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,649
          This is kinda barbecue
                 plus plus.     

232
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,517
       Where the biscuits       
         are behemoth...        

233
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,053
  If you can eat the whole thing
        in a day, you win a car?

234
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,121
   And the lamb, well, it's...  

235
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,055
                 Lights out.    
Awesome.                        

236
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,023
               Excellent job.   

237
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,365
   I'm here at San Francisco.   

238
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,634
        I love this city.       

239
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,369
   I mean, you're talking tons  
           of history,          

240
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,769
      awesome sports teams,     

241
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,372
    and you wanna talk about    
  big restaurants, right here.  

242
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,308
     But I gotta be honest,     
  not too many barbecue joints. 

243
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,243
          Well, I mean,         
    you got Gorilla Barbecue,   

244
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:06,511
   or you could find yourself   
            over here           

245
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,512
 on Folsom in the SoMa district 

246
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,514
        just a few blocks       
       up at union square       

247
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,784
  right here at CatHead's BBQ.  

248
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:18,122
         South Carolina chicken.

249
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,991
     A block away your mouth    
      just starts watering.     

250
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,193
                We have the,    
             uh, brisket chili. 

251
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,195
     It reminds me of going     
       to barbecue joints       

252
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,397
       back in the South.       

253
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,731
  It's like fine dining cooking 

254
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,134
       but with a regular,      
      down-home experience.     

255
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,469
FIERI: 'Cause owners Pam Schafer
        and Richard Park        

256
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,805
        are just a couple       
   of down-home transplants...  

257
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,206
             I'm from Tennessee.
            She's from Michigan.

258
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,542
         Cooking up some        
         family fixings.        

259
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,143
        We just bring it        
  from all around the country,  

260
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,678
    recipes we grew up with.    

261
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,880
      Pulled pork on a cat head.

262
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,815
Why is it called cat head?      

263
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,082
      Cat head is a biscuit     

264
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,484
      in the South the size     
        of a cat's head.        

265
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,886
     If you wanna order it,     
         you definitely         

266
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:49,887
           wanna bring          
      an appetite with you.     

267
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,022
            Give me the rundown.
   All right.                   

268
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,090
 So we're gonna take            
   some AP flour.               

269
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,291
                           Okay.
We're gonna put it in a bowl.   

270
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,426
               Do you put most  
              of it in the bowl 

271
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,027
              or do we just get 
              some of it on us? 

272
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,029
We get most of it on us         
and then some of it in the bowl.

273
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,230
             Okay. There you go.

274
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:00,832
So we're gonna put some         
baking powder and some salt.    

275
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,501
We're gonna add the butter      
   and the Crisco.              
                         Okay.  

276
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:06,170
  So you just kinda             
get it into pea-size shapes.    

277
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,639
                There we go.    
             Making the gravel. 

278
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:08,839
 And then we'll add             
   the buttermilk.              

279
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:12,444
So we're just gonna mix         
     it around.                 

280
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,845
               Whoa, yahtzee.   

281
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,847
     Didn't see that one coming.

282
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,450
So you're just gonna            
push it out until you...        

283
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,118
                  Push it out.  
Push it out.                    

284
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,921
  So that's the --              
that's the ring mold.           

285
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,723
  What, if you can eat the whole
  thing in a day, you win a car?

286
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,124
       Look at the size of that!

287
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,459
    Pretty much.                

288
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:32,063
 So we're going 355             
for about 30 minutes.           

289
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,531
             All right. Next up.
  Dry rub.                      

290
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,666
    Brown sugar,                
  Peruvian paprika.             

291
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:36,868
      It's the one I always use.

292
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,136
   Garlic powder.               
                           Okay.

293
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,205
Black pepper, cayenne,          
    chili powder.               

294
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,340
               A ton of cumin.  

295
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:46,678
Some, uh, onion powder,         
   salt, allspice,              

296
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,613
poultry seasoning, cinnamon,    

297
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,014
  and, uh, nutmeg.              

298
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:53,017
    It's like the United Nations
         of seasonings going on.

299
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,618
So what we're going to do now   

300
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,354
 is we're just gonna            
take our, uh, pork butt.        

301
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,423
                          Okay. 
   Give it a nice               
  little rub over.              

302
00:10:58,425 --> 00:10:59,957
Put a little whiskey on it.     

303
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,093
               Whiskey bottle.  
      Take me home.             

304
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:05,162
So this sits in our, uh, fridge 
for a couple of days.           

305
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,231
               How long are we  
              gonna smoke that? 

306
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,499
   About 14 hours.              

307
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,568
            Now we're making our
 North Carolina finishing sauce.

308
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,837
  You know how North Carolinians
       are about their barbecue?

309
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,239
  I am all down on              
the vinegar side of it.         

310
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,108
              Well, this one's  
               a little mixed.  

311
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,045
So we're gonna add some ketchup,
some cider vinegar, brown sugar.

312
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:21,980
        Okay.                   

313
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:24,516
               Some, uh, salt,  
                black pepper.   

314
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,718
You can hear that thing gurgling
 in there right now.            

315
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,720
                Chili flake,    
            some Worcestershire.

316
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:30,722
     Hot sauce.                 

317
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,389
                Whisk it up,    
             bring it to a boil.

318
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,525
            And, uh, it's done. 
Oh, and that's gonna            

319
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,728
go with that pulled pork        
  on that cat head?             

320
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,929
                        Yup.    
    [ Whistles ]                

321
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:41,198
 This has been going            
 for about 14 hours.            

322
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,267
                Nicely done.    

323
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,601
Give it a little salt.          

324
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,603
And this is the finishing sauce 
that we made earlier.           

325
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,738
  We're gonna take              
the cat head biscuit.           

326
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,873
This is mustard slaw.           

327
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,275
                    Okay.       

328
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,877
    Put a little                
of these pickles on there.      

329
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,213
  And there you go.             

330
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,615
          We're gonna have to go
             anaconda on my jaw.

331
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,687
                     Mm.        

332
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:07,224
     The pork's got great flavor
     to it, nice, tangy vinegar.

333
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,359
                Slaw's great.   

334
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:09,828
         Carolina sauce is dyno.

335
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,764
  And that's a nice big biscuit.
                  Oh, boy.      

336
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:15,100
     You know, we just don't get
   enough of this in California.

337
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,101
                 Well done.     
                Really good.    

338
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,435
        Cat head biscuit.       

339
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,371
It's a knife and fork           
    kind of meal.               

340
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,973
       It's just perfect.       
         It's delicious.        

341
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,708
     It's spicy.                
It's a little smoky.            

342
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,842
      FIERI: Folks come in.     

343
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,711
     It smells like barbecue    
       right off the bat.       

344
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:27,979
 You have these beautiful pits. 

345
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,847
These are grandfathered in?     
                Yes, they are.  

346
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,316
  We're one of two restaurants  
   in the city that has them.   

347
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,718
    FIERI: So they're making    
         the most of it,        

348
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,920
         smoking up all         
      the usual suspects...     

349
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:39,257
St. Louis cut ribs.             
        And even mixed in       
       a little wild card.      

350
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,725
                Smoked lamb.    

351
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,927
 You don't really think of lamb 
   as, like, a barbecue item.   

352
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,262
    But this stuff's perfect.   

353
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,598
       FIERI: Let's get into it.
I'm gonna make a spice rub.     

354
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,268
    Dry mustard,                
  cumin, allspice,              

355
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,804
    chili flake,                
cinna-manum-manum-mum-mum.      

356
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,138
        FIERI: Hey, wait.       
         That's my line!        

357
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,540
Nutmeg, brown sugar,            

358
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:58,409
a lot of salt, paprika,         

359
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,278
black pepper and oregano.       

360
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,213
  And this is just for the lamb.
This is just for the lamb.      

361
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,281
  We don't do this              
 for anything else.             

362
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,617
  Now it's bone-in              
   lamb shoulder.               

363
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,818
  Uh, let this also go 48 hours?
Yeah.                           

364
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,621
We marinate everything          
 at least 48 hours.             

365
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,155
     Then how long is this gonna
              go in the smoker? 

366
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,757
    This goes for               
about eight to ten hours,       

367
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,358
    low and slow.               
     All right.                 

368
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,360
So what we're gonna do now,     
we're making an apple slaw.     

369
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,364
Take some red cabbage, some,    
uh, Granny Smith apples.        

370
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:20,798
We're gonna just grate those.   

371
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,700
       We're gonna degrade them?
            You're a dumb apple.

372
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:24,569
We're gonna grate them.         
            You're so not liked.

373
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,237
Then we're gonna take           
just a bulb of fennel.          

374
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,372
                    Okay.       
          Ah, it's good looking.

375
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,708
         I can smell that fennel
                 right now.     

376
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,643
All right. Let's take           
some of this dressing.          

377
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,511
                 And that's...  
Mayonnaise, cider vinegar,      

378
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,713
lemons, sugar, salt,            

379
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,248
    black pepper,               
    and allspice.               

380
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,583
                     Got it.    
  All right, so...              

381
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,785
        Holy breakdown shoulder.

382
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:43,788
So we're gonna shred this up,   
put this on the plate           

383
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,323
  with a little bit             
 of the apple slaw.             

384
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,991
So we like to just, uh,         

385
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,526
   finish her with              
just a little bit of salt       

386
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,862
and, uh, fennel ketchup         
    that we made.               

387
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:53,664
  And there you go.             

388
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,068
 Mm. The lamb meat is very lean,
             but tons of flavor.

389
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,535
             And then the fennel
                 apple slaw,    

390
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:02,006
              super refreshing, 
              palate cleansing. 

391
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,341
        The contrast of the cold

392
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,075
                with the hot,   
        the acid of the ketchup,

393
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,678
 the sweetness with the richness
  and the saltiness of the lamb.

394
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,547
          This is kinda barbecue
                 plus plus.     

395
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,884
         Ah. I think for anybody
    that walks in here and says,

396
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:15,419
        "Ah, I don't like lamb,"
 well, then, you gotta try this.

397
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,687
                Light's out.    
 Awesome.                       

398
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,089
               Excellent job.   

399
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,358
     WOMAN: It's not really     

400
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,161
      what you would expect     
     when you think of lamb.    

401
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,829
 It's tender, juicy.            

402
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:27,031
      The apple fennel slaw     
         is perfection.         

403
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,700
    This is the place to come   
      if you love barbecue.     

404
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:29,967
   FIERI: I love the smokers.   

405
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,102
        I love the smell.       

406
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,338
        Just an awesome,        
         awesome place.         

407
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,441
      Up next, we're headed     
      to the beach in Maui.     

408
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,676
             Too legit to quit. 

409
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,912
      To chow down on some      
       wood-fired pizza...      

410
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:42,847
             That is a gorgeous 
             looking pie, dude. 

411
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:44,649
  While soaking up the scenery. 

412
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:45,884
         This is my kind of gig.

413
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,828
      The food truck scene      
     in the Hawaiian islands    

414
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,096
       is alive and well.       

415
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,965
   When we were over in Oahu,   
we did the Big Wave Shrimp Truck

416
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,100
    and Camille's on Wheels.    

417
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,634
   Now I'm over here in Maui.   

418
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,969
          Hit it, kid.          

419
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:07,772
     To check out a trailer     
    that the guy made himself   

420
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:10,641
      and he's also scratch     
    making the dough by hand!   

421
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,777
    This is Outrigger Pizza.    

422
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,449
 By far the best pizza on Maui. 

423
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:19,584
     Pizza in a parking lot.    

424
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,918
        Who knew it would       
        taste this good.        

425
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,653
  MAN: I'd rather come to this  
      place than a regular      

426
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,388
  brick and mortar pizza parlor 
      any day of the week.      

427
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,323
   WOMAN: It's kind of a show.  

428
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:26,724
        You can watch him       
        throw the pizza.        

429
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,993
    FIERI: A classic pie move   
    Philly native Kevin Locke   

430
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,128
      picked up in college      

431
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,330
         then perfected         
      when he hit the road      

432
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:35,266
     with this cart in 2009.    

433
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,467
            I love the rig, man.

434
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,468
       Who built the pizza oven?

435
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,802
                   I did.       
Did you really?                 

436
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,270
                           Yeah.
What temperature you running?   
       Seven?                   

437
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,006
                          700.  
 Yeah. What kind of             
 wood are you using?            

438
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:43,674
            Kiawe wood, which is
           this tree right here.

439
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,076
So the local native hardwood.   
                            Yup.

440
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,011
  It brings out that smokiness  
          in the dough.         

441
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,412
      More of a flatbread style.

442
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,480
 And a lilikoi pork.            

443
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,215
        The Lilikoi pizza       
        tastes like Maui.       

444
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:52,883
     MAN: It's got that nice    
          pulled pork.          

445
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,352
          It has a nice         
      little lilikoi glaze.     

446
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,554
                  Lilikoi?      
              What is lilikoi?  

447
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,489
Lilikoi is a passion fruit.     
                          Okay. 

448
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,091
          First we're gonna make
                pizza dough.    

449
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,826
 Yup.                           
              Hang on a second. 

450
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,629
             Where's the mixer? 

451
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,698
     No mixers.                 
    All by hand.                

452
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,032
                 Seriously?     
  Yeah.                         

453
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:09,634
I add my yeast to the water.    

454
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:10,902
                       Okay.    
    And my sugar.               

455
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:12,836
               Fantastic.       
   Five pounds...               

456
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,304
              I don't want you  
           to take any offenses,

457
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,374
but I'm gonna stand on this side
        when you pour the flour.

458
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,975
   That's the side              
where the wind's gonna go.      

459
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,110
                    Okay.       
                 Fantastic.     

460
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,512
        I'll be right over here.
Unbleached flour,               

461
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,048
bleached flour, semolina.       

462
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,318
And now we're gonna take out    
     four pounds                

463
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,653
   to add that to               
our second phase of the dough.  

464
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,123
                There you go.   
  water.                        

465
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,324
         So what'd you do today?

466
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,926
      I watched a guy make dough
             for his pizza cart 

467
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:39,464
        at the park by the water
    with some weird contraption.

468
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,265
Danish whisk.                   
                    You Danish? 

469
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:42,466
         No.                    

470
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,002
So we're gonna add our activated
  yeast and water.              

471
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,137
                     Okay.      
Now we'll wait two hours        
  for this to poof.             

472
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,408
               Oh. [ Laughs ]   

473
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,143
                 To do what?    

474
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,144
        Rise.                   
                      Good.     

475
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,146
 Now that we've let             
   the dough rise,              

476
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:58,950
we're gonna reintroduce         
our four pounds of flour.       

477
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:00,752
 Hawaiian sea salt.             

478
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,153
                 All right.     
             So that's together.

479
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:04,755
  Two hours later,              
we're gonna knead the dough.    

480
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,625
And into our plastic bag        
and then refrigeration.         

481
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,227
Let it rest for two days.       

482
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,762
               How many ounces  
     did you weight this out to?

483
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:12,963
    Four ounces.                
              Dough is resting. 

484
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,366
      Now we're going to dry rub
               the pork butt.   

485
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:19,770
Coarse black pepper, cumin,     
chili powder, garlic,           

486
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,772
onion powder, parsley,          

487
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,440
and quite a bit of salt.        

488
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,110
We're gonna mix this up.        
             Generously rub this
                on the pork?    

489
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:28,045
  Yup.                          
              This is awesome.  

490
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,313
                         Okay.  
   A cup of water.              

491
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,382
               So a little bit  
             of braising liquid.

492
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,317
 Pop it in the oven.            
     And how long's it gonna go?

493
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,519
Three and a half hours          
       at 350.                  

494
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,454
       Pull it out, let it cool,
         give it a little shred?

495
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,657
   Yup.                         
                Pork's done.    

496
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:40,924
                Dough's done.   

497
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,127
So put a little bit of flour    
 on our dough ball.             

498
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:46,197
Then we're gonna press it out   
without touching the edges.     

499
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,331
              So you can build  
               a little crust.  

500
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,833
   Boy, that's some loose dough.

501
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:51,135
                Look at that.   
       Little centrifugal force.

502
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,671
               Little semolina  
         for some ball bearings.

503
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:57,341
And then we're gonna do         
our garlic aioli base,          

504
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,410
little bit of garlic,           
      the pork,                 

505
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:03,147
 Maui sweet onions,             
 sweet bell peppers,            

506
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:06,083
 mozzarella cheese,             
little bit of Romano.           

507
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,418
    Boy, that oven's hot, buddy.

508
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,353
   They only take               
about 90 seconds to cook.       

509
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,955
             What a great setup.

510
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,691
             That is a gorgeous 
             looking pie, dude. 

511
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,027
    Do some, uh,                
   fresh Parmesan.              

512
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,299
And here's our specialty,       
    the lilikoi.                

513
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:26,170
              Beautiful pizza.  

514
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,505
               It's dynamite.   

515
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:32,543
                The crust is    
             too legit to quit. 

516
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,181
            Not too much cheese.
             Nothing's overdone.

517
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,450
 When you do get the little bite
           of pork, you love it.

518
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,984
       When you get a little bit
               of the pepper,   

519
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,520
            you're down with it.

520
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,454
          Really dynamite pizza.

521
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,590
        -A lilikoi pork.        
         -Sweet, savory.        

522
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,858
    Dough is crisp, a little    

523
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,393
    charred on the underside    
       the way I like it.       

524
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,661
        MAN: Real tender        
         piece of pork.         

525
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:51,796
      It's got a little bit     
       of fattiness to it,      

526
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:52,930
      which is really good.     

527
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,598
     And it goes really well    
        with the lilikoi.       

528
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,800
        This is my favorite kind
            of pizza restaurant,

529
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,603
            is sitting out here,
         checking out the water.

530
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:00,070
  Italian sausage.              

531
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,872
       My favorite pizza?       
       The sausage pizza.       

532
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,141
 MAN: His homemade pizza sauce, 

533
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,942
        I haven't tasted        
 anything like it anywhere else 

534
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,577
         on the island.         

535
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,546
          All right, what are we
              gonna make next?  
  Italian sausage.              

536
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,214
      You guys are making almost
        everything from scratch.

537
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:11,482
Yes. We're gonna make           
   some red sauce.              

538
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,817
                  Go ahead.     
          I'm standing over here

539
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,018
      because I'm in light blue.

540
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,352
You might get red.              
      And I can already tell you

541
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,221
          that that tomato sauce
           is gonna make a mess.

542
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:19,890
  Ground tomatoes,              
 granulated garlic,             

543
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,225
one teaspoon of basil,          

544
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,494
one teaspoon of thyme,          
      oregano,                  

545
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,497
 black pepper, salt,            
teaspoon of cinnamon, nutmeg.   

546
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,698
And then we're gonna            
    mix it here.                

547
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,166
           We made dough by hand

548
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,969
        and now you're gonna use
             an electric mixer? 

549
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:33,771
               Buddy, you just  
              don't make sense. 

550
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,106
One cup of olive oil.           

551
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:37,775
Give it a little bit            
     of flavor.                 

552
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:40,244
   And the sauce,               
   ground sausage,              

553
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:43,914
 Maui sweet onions,             
     mushrooms,                 

554
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,583
and some green peppers.         

555
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:48,853
     Mozzarella,                
  top with Romano.              

556
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,722
Back into the oven.             
                 90 seconds.    

557
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,657
         This is my kind of gig.

558
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,260
        To be outside like this?
 The life.                      

559
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:57,728
               What do you do   
            during the holidays?

560
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,797
I sell Christmas trees.         

561
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,598
        This dude does not stop.

562
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,467
    There you go.               
Fresh Parmesan again.           

563
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,803
Little bit of truffle salt.     

564
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:08,672
  Hear the crunch?              

565
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,074
                     Mm.        

566
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:11,409
          Look how thin that is.

567
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,010
      Nice crust, a little char.

568
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:15,279
             What I like is that
         you're not heavy-handed

569
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:18,215
          with your ingredients.

570
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,484
         It's not supposed to be
              the gooey cheese  

571
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,420
               stretching off   
              into the sunset.  

572
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:24,622
   It's supposed to be a balance
        between all the flavors.

573
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:26,223
       You can taste everything.
               I'm impressed.   

574
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,225
                 I wanna buy    
           a Christmas tree now.

575
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,227
  Italian sausage.              

576

         Italian sausage        
         is really good.        

577
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,630
   The peppers on it gives it   
     that extra little kick.    

578
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:34,565
   It really pops with flavor.  

579
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,766
 It's an incredible experience. 

580
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,167
          It really is.         
        We're very lucky.

   You can't get pizza that good
            at most restaurants.

right here on a trailer.        

583
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,706
                 Well done.     
Thank you.

  Was that a road trip or what? 

585
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,310
        But don't worry.

   There's plenty more joints

     I'll be looking for you    
     next time on Triple D.     

588
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:52,783
              Think we're ready 
                 to go here?    

589
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,452
     I got him.
