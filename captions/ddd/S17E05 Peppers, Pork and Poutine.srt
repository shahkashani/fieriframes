          in this town.

  That's right -- Mexican food.

gangster about everything.

     I see the way that you are.

80
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,508

           A little heavy cream.

 Just a little bit.

00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,451
A little bit of sugar,          

86
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,487
 just to sweeten up             
   the candy here.              

87
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:12,257
And then we're gonna go         
   to the almonds,              

88
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,391

89
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,793
             Mind if I taste it?

90
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:15,694
   Go right ahead.              

91
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,467
              We should've made 
   about another gallon of that.

92
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,136
         What are we making now?

93
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:25,604
    The stuffing                
for the chiles en nogada.       

94
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:28,540
So, we're just gonna throw a    
little bit of chicken in here.  

95
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,608
    Kosher salt,                
  a little pepper.              

96
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,676
   I like pepper.               

97
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,345
  We're just gonna              
  cook this down.               

98
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,480
     Red onions,                
a little bit of shallots.       

99
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,682
           I don't see shallots 
          a lot in Mexican food.

100
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,150
      That's my                 
classically trained...          
                           Okay.

101
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,019
 I love what it does            
    to the food.                

102
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,153
       Garlic.                  

103
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,223
 Add apples, pears.             

104
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,958
Here's my Anglo influence --    

105
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,029
craisins, apricots, golden      
raisins, tomato paste --        

106
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:52,764
and that's my touch.            

107
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:56,301
Deglaze with red wine.          

108
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,103
    I'm gonna add               
a little bit of sugar.          

109
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,638
I like that car of yours,       
     by the way.                

110
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,973
                   Not bad, huh?
But you know what?              

111
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,576
It might be on blocks           
     right now.                 
                  It's okay.    

112
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,978
              I need to change  
        those tires out anyways.

113
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,446
 Let's finish it up             
with chopped pecans.            

114
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,516
And we have some walnuts.       
    Add cilantro.               

115
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,185
        This is gonna rock. Mmm!

116
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:14,385
Almost ready to stuff.          

117
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,520
                   Stuff.       

118
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,322
We roast chiles poblanos.       

119
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:19,658
               So, you roasted  
               the pepper off.  

120
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,461
   Now I'm peeling              
  all the skin off.             

121
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,196
        Which takes a little bit
        of that bitterness out. 

122
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:25,330
                 Think about    
            like caramelization.

123
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:28,233
I have that stuffing.           

124
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,204
    There we go.                

125
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:35,607
Then I'm gonna take this        
beautiful almond nogada sauce.  

126
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,676
We're gonna represent           
something beautiful here --     

127
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,478
     the colors                 
of the Mexican flag.            

128
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,012
White of the queso fresco,      

129
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:44,950
the pomegranate for the red,    
 cilantro for green.            

130
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,751
              We're good to go. 

131
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:47,753
               Got to get some  
        of that pepper in there.

132
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,358
             This is real deal. 
             This is old-school.

133
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,626
                 This is --     
             This is delicious. 

134
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,897
         Just all the textures, 
         the flavors, the depth,

135
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,700
                and you have    
              all the nuances.  

136
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:04,703
              The complexities, 
             the roasted pepper,

137
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,305
      tenderness of the chicken.

138
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:08,040
     You get some of the little 
     dried fruit coming through,

139
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:10,241
     and you get a little burst 
    coming from the pomegranate.

140
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,176
         I mean, just all of it.

141
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,178
            You rocked that one.

142
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,212
       Orale.                   
                    Very nice.  

143
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,184
        I love something        
       with a little bite,      

144
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:20,852
 and it had the perfect amount. 

145
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,320
   I could've eaten two more.   

146
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,456
       It's an experience       
        that's more than        

147
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,325
just going to get a bite to eat.

148
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,728
   WOMAN #2: They're very much  
         about community        

149
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,795
  and supporting local artists. 

150
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:35,200
   If you look at, in the art   
  of Mexico, it's very bright.  

151
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:38,136
Then you look at the ingredients
          of the food.          

152
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,804
    It's vivid. It's robust.    

153
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,673
             FIERI:             
   And that all comes together  

154
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,142
    in this Baja-style dish.    

155
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,744
      You have the tilapia      
    wrapped in banana leaves.   

156
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:46,611
     That's a fabulous dish.    

157
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,212
              Mmm.              

158
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:52,084
  Looking good -- banana leaves,
           fish, achiote paste. 

159
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:55,887
   We're gonna do               
     zarandeado.                

160
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,155
  It's a Baja dish.             

161
00:05:57,157 --> 00:06:00,125
We're just gonna do a little    
lemon, a little naranja.        

162
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,897
           Now, this right here 
           is the achiote paste.

163
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,165
      Correct.                  

164
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,867
      And you'll find this a lot
      of times in Latin markets.

165
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,903
                  It gives      
             that nice, red hue.

166
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,238
Now watch what happens here     
with the banana leaves.         

167
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,973
           You're gonna toast up
              the banana leaf?  

168
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,776
I'm just gonna make it          
      pliable.                  
                    Nice.       

169
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,313
  Oh, you're good.              

170
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,183
     So, this is                
  nice and pliable.             

171
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,385
Now we're gonna take            
      the fish.                 

172
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,386
Add a little slurry.            

173
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,388
   Put it in there              
 and spread it out.             

174
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,391
         So, you get the citrus,
         you get all that color.

175
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:33,525
     Absolutely.                

176
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:36,395
 I use kosher salt,             
a little black pepper,          

177
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:38,296
just a little citrus            
  from the orange.              

178
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:44,736
A little lemon, some garlic,    
and then I have some onion.     

179
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:51,009
   And we're ready              
    to grill it.                

180
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:54,011
Presentation side down.         
   Seven minutes.               

181
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,147
            So, it'll steam all 
    the ingredients inside of it

182
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,016
         because of the moisture
            of the banana leaf. 

183
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,150
         What are we gonna serve
                 this with?     

184
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,753
Just got a little bit           
of calabaza real quick.         

185
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:02,754
                Some squash.    

186
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:06,958
    There we go.                

187
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,694
What you do is just peel it away
 like a little gift.            

188
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,505
        Tilapia is not typically
                  very fat,     

189
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,407
                  but it is     
        a very widely used fish.

190
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:25,443
 Roasting it in this banana leaf
          with all that flavor, 

191
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,246
             a lot of moisture, 
          this is the way to go.

192
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,515
        Mmm! If you get a chance
              to come try this, 

193
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,984
     you will get a whole nother
        experience and exposure 

194
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,719
            to what Mexican food
                really is --    

195
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,255
             real Mexican food, 
          cultural Mexican food.

196
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,925
            It's packaged, baby.
                    Mmm!        

197
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,328
        SALCIDO ESPARZA:        
  Let's go, let's go, let's go! 

198
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,095
   Let's get this out of here!  

199
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,666
 The flavors are just wonderful.

200
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:49,534
            So, here's the deal.

201
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:50,802
                This has been   
           an outstanding visit.

202
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,071
              You got one more  
          up your sleeve for me?

203
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,606
   We're gonna go               
 to the other coast.            

204
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,274
               We're gonna go   
             to the other coast.

205
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,943
               I'm hanging out  
            in Phoenix, Arizona,

206
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,744
                 at a killer    
             Mexican restaurant.

207
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,680
               This is Barrio.  
  We'll see you in a little bit.

208
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,187
             "Diners, Drive-Ins,
                 and Dives"     

209
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,990
         going real-deal Mexican
                 in Phoenix.    

210
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,126
       You got to come to Barrio

211
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,928
               because this is  
       real-deal Mexican, right?

212
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:17,995
     Absolutely.                

213
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,998
              MAN:              
 Just the flavor in everything. 

214
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,399
     Just got so much style.    

215
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:22,534
       I always feel like       
       I'm at home here.        

216
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:24,135
             MAN #2:            
 You're getting a lot of flavors

217
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,003
 from a lot of different regions
         across Mexico.         

218
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,539
             FIERI:             
   Including a classic version  

219
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:31,342
    of Yucatán's pulled pork.   

220
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,744
   This is called               
  cochinita pibil.              

221
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,145
  "Cochinita" means             
    "little pig."               

222
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,214
"Pibil" means "under earth"     
 or "pit" in Mayan.             

223
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,349
                    Okay.       

224
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:41,352
So, I'm just gonna take         
a little bit of this fat off.   

225
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,754
 Why are you moving             
     back there?                

226
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,356
        Well, because I don't --
                   Listen.      

227
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:47,959
My dad's told me you don't stand
     where the knife is coming. 

228
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:51,095
All right, it's ready.          

229
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,431
A hefty amount of salt.         

230
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:54,699
So, we're gonna get it          
      in there.                 

231
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,900
     Same thing                 
with the black pepper.          

232
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,236
Nice, coarse ground.            

233
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:00,372
Then we got some garlic.        

234
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,840
  Mexican oregano.              

235
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,576
         And we're roasting this
              with the bone in. 

236
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:05,844
      Bone in.                  

237
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,379
I got some bay leaves.          

238
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,647
   We're gonna put              
that achiote slurry.            

239
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,116
      So, we've got lemon juice,
                orange juice,   

240
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,517
          and the achiote paste.

241
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,853
I just kind of pat it around,   
  get it in there.              

242
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,057
             So it doesn't knock
               the crust off.   
     Right.                     

243
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,591
                 You're like    
           a "swine-estitician."

244
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,326
Beautiful, beautiful.           

245
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,397
So, we're just gonna put        
this banana leaf in there       

246
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,598
to seal all the juices.         

247
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,266
         That's the plastic wrap
               that they had?   

248
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,401
     Absolutely.                
                   A little O.J.

249
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,003
A little sour orange.           
                    Sour orange.

250
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,137
   Naranja agria.               

251
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,607
   Let's do this.               

252
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,742
        Okay, so, into the oven.
                  How long?     

253
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,313
6, 8, depends on your pork,     
 250, low and slow.             

254
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,418
  Oh, look at that.             
Isn't that beautiful?           

255
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,153
                  Say hello     
              to my little pig. 

256
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,789
    Look at that.               
           A little crust there.

257
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,493
 So, you can have it            
with tacos or a torta.          

258
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:56,695
             Or in the "hand-a."

259
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,763
All right, we're gonna plate    
      this up.                  

260
00:09:58,765 --> 00:09:59,964
You ready to eat it?            

261
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,099
                Look at that.   

262
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,467
 We're gonna get it             
 all nice and juicy.            

263
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,171
                See, the jus,   
  that's the kicker right there.

264
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,707
Topped with pickled onions.     

265
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,308
Finish with pico de gallo.      

266
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,644
             That's ridiculous. 

267
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,123
             You see the little 
             dance kick there?  

268
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,092
                I don't know    
           where that came from.

269
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,863
           Everything fires off.

270
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:34,065
       You get all of the flavor
                  profiles,     

271
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:37,268
     from the sour to the sweet 
     to the salty, to the spicy.

272
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:41,206
   Oh, my gosh, and then you get
                hot and cold.   

273
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:45,143
         My mouth is having just
         some complete meltdown.

274
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,611
                    Mmm.        

275
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,880
 So, in other words,            
     it's good?                 

276
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:49,880
              It's ridiculous.  

277
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,882
That's Mayan flavors            
    right there.                

278
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:52,817
         They're my flavors now.

279
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,052
    [ Laughs ]                  
                    Yes!        

280
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:58,690
       I have had the last meal 
    on "Triple D" so many times,

281
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:01,760
          but I got to tell you,
              without a doubt,  

282
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,495
         that's one of the best.

283
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,697
        Slow-roasted pork       
    just melts in your mouth.   

284
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,031
                    Mmm.        

285
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,366
          You got to come down. 
         Phoenix is calling you.

286
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,836
     Some of the best "Triple D"
           joints in the world, 

287
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,505
             and now put Barrio 
                on the list.    

288
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,709
        FIERI: Up next...       
                 Rub-a-dub duck.

289
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,444
         ...we're headed        
      to Toronto, Canada...     

290
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,046
                That's crazy.   

291
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,181
      ...where these folks      
          are mixing up         

292
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,118
       some funky flavors       
 on the fast road to Flavortown.

293
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,820
          Baked nice and sticky.

294
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,064
    I'm here on Yonge Street,   

295
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,734
   which is what's considered   
the longest street in the world,

296
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:46,337
 and it divides Toronto, Canada,
    by the east and the west.   

297
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,140
  I'm here to check out a joint 
  that's been here since 1939.  

298
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,875
   This is the Rosedale Diner.  

299
00:11:58,085 --> 00:11:59,550
        All the food here       
        is really great.        

300
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,418
            Best fries, by far, 
        in the city, hands down.

301
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,954
             WOMAN:             
    This is the bison burger.   

302
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,689
    It's absolutely delicious   
           and juicy.           

303
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,025
You got to try the h-hummus.    
          Did you just roll that
             with a "h-hummus?" 

304
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,225
It's all about the h-hummus.    

305
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,695
 To have a Middle Eastern touch 
            like this           

306
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:11,963
  is very unusual for a diner.  

307
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,633
             FIERI:             
 Then again, Dubi and Esti Filar

308
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:18,403
       aren't your typical      
       restaurant owners.       

309
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,105
  Did you just tell him to get  
    his elbows off the table?   

310
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,406
        Yeah.                   

311
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,441
           [ Laughs ]           

312
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,443
     A husband-and-wife team    

313
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:29,781
   who cleaned up this former   
   greasy spoon back in 1981.   

314
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:33,184
    Dubi works with the cooks   
 to come up with killer dishes. 

315
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,254
 And, Esti, what do you do here 
      besides be the boss?      

316
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,322
            Tell him what to say
               and what to do.  

317
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,992
      Tell him what to say      
  and what to do -- very nice.  

318
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:44,462
 In '09, they brought in Toronto
      native Chris Grainger     

319
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,998
       to run the kitchen,      
  and he's cranking out dishes  

320
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,867
      with Dubi and Esti's      
          Israeli flair         

321
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:52,403
    right next to straight-up   
       Canadian classics.       

322
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,671

 Poutine au canard.             

323
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,540
              So, we're making  
             duck cheese fries. 

324
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:56,540
  Yeah, with gravy.             

325
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,675
                 With gravy.    
        Yeah.                   

326
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:00,612
            So, some fresh duck,
              not been frozen.  

327
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:01,745
             We'll get the legs 
               and the thighs.  

328
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,447
        Yeah,                   
we've trimmed them up,          

329
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,949
    taken a bunch               
   of the fat off,              

330
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,084
 rendered that down.            
                        Okay.   

331
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,018
  We're gonna start             
   with some salt,              

332
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,686
  some peppercorns.             

333
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,623
Give it a Canadian kick         
with some maple syrup.          

334
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,759
 Some pureed garlic,            
fresh-picked rosemary,          

335
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,560
some fresh-picked thyme.        

336
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,164
Lastly, some bay leaves         
before we mix this all up.      

337
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,034
   So, now you're just gonna get
      in the tub with the duck? 

338
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,168
  Yeah, rub it up.              

339
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,236
               Rub-a-dub duck.  

340
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,337
     You got it.                
                      Hit it.   

341
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,574
     All right,                 
we're gonna get in here         

342
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,510
and make sure we show           
every one of these guys         

343
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,711
a little bit of love.           

344
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,379
      And how long is this gonna
           sit here and set up? 

345
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,582
We're gonna wrap this guy up    

346
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:40,051
and throw it into the cooler    
for about a full day.           

347
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,987
                   Got it.      
            So, stovetop confit.

348
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,255

  Some brown sugar.             

461
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,023
                    Word.       

462
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,958
Put a bit of granulated garlic, 
    some pepper.                

463
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,827
We're gonna whisk in            
   our sesame oil.              

464
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:17,828
     All right.                 

465
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,429
            And then we're gonna
               cook this down?  

466
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,698
We're gonna cook this down.     

467
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,300
     How much will it reduce by,
                    half?       

468
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:24,702
A little less than half,        
until it's nice and sticky.     

469
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:29,774
              Put that on a --  
                I don't know.   

470
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,642
                 Anything.      
                 I like it.     

471
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,980
            So, the hoisin sauce
              is cooking down.  

472
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:38,049
   It's starting to really smell
             like hoisin sauce, 

473
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:39,716
          and the rib's in there
              with the cinnamon 

474
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,519
            and the peppercorns 
        and the juniper berries.

475
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,320
              It's ready to go? 
It's ready to go.               

476
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,389
                    Okay.       

477
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:46,390
    There we go.                

478
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,159
  We're gonna hack              
   these guys up.               

479
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:52,796
  And with that beautiful smoker
                 out there,     

480
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,598
           you don't smoke them?
                 You just --    

481
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,134
      This, you think, gets them
          the right tenderness? 

482
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,869
   Trust me, Guy.               
          Hey, I trust you, man.

483
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,871
        You're the one that made
              duck gravy fries. 

484
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,273
 Tossing these guys             
      in a pan.                 

485
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,007
                    Okay.       

486
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,344
              So, you hit them  
              into a sauté pan, 

487
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,678
                  hit them      
          with the hoisin sauce.

488
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,013
A little chicken stock          
   in there, yeah,              

489
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,681
and get it reducing nice and hot
  on the stovetop.              

490
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:13,351
Toss them in the oven,          
get them really baked,          

491
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,353
  nice and sticky,              
   pull them out.               

492
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,421
          Baked nice and sticky.

493
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:18,489
    That's right.               

494
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,824
 That's like it should be a song
                in the '80s.    

495

496
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,226
           You know what I mean.

497
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,227
     Yeah.                      
                 Thank you.     

498
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:25,496
                 All right.     

499
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,431
               Bring the ribs.  

500
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,766
                Oh, gorgeous.   

501
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,101
      Our ribs                  
are out of the oven.            

502
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:31,302
They're nice and sticky.        

503
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:33,103
We're gonna hit this with       
some toasted sesame seeds.      

504
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,639
Give them a nice toss.          

505
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,275
We're ready to plate.           

506
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,513
A rib castle for you.           

507
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,714
                 Rib castle.    

508
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,916
     Yeah. Okay.                

509
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,786
  Make them pretty,             
   add some fries,              

510
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,187
and our sticky Asian ribs.      

511
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,789
              Now they're gonna 
                 fall over.     

512
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,392
                  Oh, God,      
               the bone's hot!  

513
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,963
                    Mmm,        
       the hoisin sauce is nice.

514
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,665
        The meat's super-tender.

515
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,601
          Anything that you lost
            in boiling the rib, 

516
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:05,535
            you compensated for 
           in that hoisin sauce.

517
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,272
            That stuff is sticky
               and righteous.   

518
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:09,473
             Gosh, that's good. 

519
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,777
            Excellent job, Chef,
              really nice job.  

520
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,015
       The meat is melting      
         in your mouth.         

521
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:21,085
    The sauce has that really   
      awesome twang to it.      

522
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,153
          It's amazing.
