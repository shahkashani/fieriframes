FANTASTIC.                      
     <i> WITH CHEF JOE SARTOR</i>      
   <i> DOING THE HEAVY LIFTING,</i>

        <i> ESPECIALLY WITH</i>        
         <i> THIS BIG BOY.</i>         

212
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,759
         THE PORCHETTA          
        IS JUST AMAZING.        

213
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:49,761
         IT'S A PERFECT         
      BALANCE OF THE FAT,       

214
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,763
       AND THE CRACKLING        
     IS SALTY AND CRUNCHY.      

215
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:55,166
AS A SANDWICH GOES, THIS IS BIG 
AND IT'S BOLD, AND I LIKE THAT. 

216
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:58,502
      AND THE SALSA VERDE       
    THAT THEY DO IS AWESOME.    

217
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,840
WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE SALSA VERDE
       FOR THE PORCHETTA.       

218
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,241
WE'RE GONNA START               
WITH THE PARSLEY.               

219
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,511
TOASTED FENNEL, GROUND.         

220
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:09,247
TOASTED CORIANDER,              
   ALSO GROUND.                 
                          GREAT.

221
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:12,117
       CHILI FLAKES,            
A LITTLE BIT OF KOSHER SALT.    
                           OKAY.

222
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,851
FRESH GARLIC,                   

223
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,187
THE ZEST OF TWO LEMONS.         

224
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,389
A BIT OF CANOLA OIL             
     IN THERE,                  

225
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,391
      AND START                 
THE BLENDING PROCESS.           

226
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,595
FINISH IT OFF WITH A BIT        
 OF FRESH LEMON JUICE.          

227
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,597
              HOW'S THAT SERVED 
             WITH THE PORCHETTA?

228
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,666
THAT'S GONNA GO ON TOP          
     OF THE PORK                

229
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,335
 AFTER IT'S SLICED              
ONTO THE BREAD ROLL.            

230
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,070
          WHAT ARE WE ONTO NEXT?

231
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,372
ALL RIGHT, SO HERE WE'RE        
GONNA MAKE THE SALT RUB         

232
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,407
THAT GOES ON THE PORK           
 BEFORE WE ROAST IT.            

233
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,209
            WHICH IS GONNA GIVE 
           YOU THE CHANCE TO GET

234
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,211
   THAT REALLY NICE CRUST ON IT,
        AND REALLY GET THAT     

235
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,948
                  NICE, TENDER, 
                PULL-APART MEAT.
   YEAH, SO WE'RE               
GONNA TAKE THE SALT,            

236
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,950
AND WE HAVE PRETTY MUCH         
 THE SAME INGREDIENTS           

237
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,952
  THAT WERE IN                  
THE SALSA VERDE.                
                           OKAY.

238
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:49,353
 SOME CHILI FLAKE,              
TOASTED FENNEL SEED,            

239
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,823
SOME WHOLE DRIED ROSEMARY,      
         TOASTED.               
                 ROSEMARY, MAN--

240
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,892
        YOU GET THAT--ESPECIALLY
        WHEN IT'S CONCENTRATED--
  IT BECOMES                    
QUITE PUNGENT.                  

241
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,762
            I MEAN, IT'S REALLY,
               REALLY STRONG.   
  A LITTLE BIT                  
OF BLACK PEPPER.                

242
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,497
     AND THEN MORE LEMON ZEST...
MORE LEMON ZEST.                

243
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,366
         THAN ONE SHOULD HUMANLY
              MAKE IN A DAY.    
YES.                            

244
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,234
         AND WHY THE LEMON ZEST?

245
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,303
PERMEATE THAT LEMON SCENT       
  THROUGHOUT THE PORK.          

246
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,171
IT'S ALL LOCAL PORK,            
   HORMONE-FREE,                

247
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,908
BEST PORK WE CAN BUY.           
          THIS IS NOT TYPICALLY 
         THE WAY IT'S BUTCHERED.

248
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,845
      THEY HAVE IT SPECIALLY CUT
               FOR THEM.        

249
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,781
         THERE'S BONES THAT ARE 
       TYPICALLY RUNNING INSIDE,

250
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:20,051
    BUT TO HAVE IT ALL CONNECTED
         IS JUST FANTASTIC.     

251
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:23,054
               THIS IS GANGSTER,
              CULINARY GANGSTER.

252
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,390
SO WE'VE GOT OUR SALT RUB.      
   JUST GOING TO SEASON         

253
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:28,459
THE WHOLE LOIN OF THE PORK,     
   AS WELL AS THE BELLY.        

254
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,396
    WE GENERALLY DO THIS        
12 HOURS BEFORE WE ROAST IT.    
                           OKAY.

255
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,798
 AND THEN, UH, WE JUST HAVE,    
UH, SOME CHOPPED HERBS HERE--   

256
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,867
   SOME PARSLEY, ROSEMARY,      
FENNEL TOPS. WE SAVE THE TOPS.  

257
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,337
GOT ALL OUR FLAVOR IN THERE,    
   JUST GONNA ROLL IT UP.       

258
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,606
        YOU NEED TO REALLY LEAVE
           THAT EXTERIOR SKIN   

259
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:44,542
     FOR THE OUTSIDE TO CRISP UP
      LIKE, UH, PORK CRACKLINGS.

260
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:47,746
YOU WANT TO MAXIMIZE            
ALL THAT CRACKLING.             
        CRACKLING MAXIMIZATION--

261
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,814
             SOMETHING YOU DON'T
               HEAR EVERY DAY.  

262
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,618
GIVE IT A QUICK TIE             
SO IT COOKS EVENLY.             

263
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,286
                DO ANYTHING ELSE
                     TO IT?     

264
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,021
WELL, WE'RE GONNA RUB IT        
  WITH OIL, OF COURSE.          

265
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:00,558
YOU GOTTA RUB IT DOWN.          
               WE ARE HERE      
        AT THE MEAT & BREAD SPA.

266
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,961
    AND THEN AGAIN WITH         
THE SALT RUB ON THE OUTSIDE,    

267
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:05,363
 JUST TO HELP, UH,              
CRISP UP THAT SKIN,             

268
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,032
DRAW OUT ALL THE MOISTURE.      

269
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,899
GONNA START THIS OFF            
   NICE AND SLOW,               

270
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,369
ROASTING IT AT ABOUT 275 DEGREES
    FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF,     

271
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,903
GET IT ALL UP TO TEMPERATURE,   

272
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,572
    AND THEN FOR                
THE LAST 35 MINUTES,            

273
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,508
 WE'RE GONNA BLAST IT.          
SKIN WILL PUFF UP NICE.         

274
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,644
           LOOK AT THE CRACKLING
                  ON TOP.       

275
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:22,447
    ALL YOU REALLY NEED TO DO IS

276
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,449
               JUST GO INTO     
         THE BACON FAT BUSINESS.

277
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,451
          OKAY, LOOK AT ALL THAT
             JUICE COMING OUT.  

278
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:29,987
            WOW, YOU DO GO THIN.
YEAH, WE TRY TO GET IT          
    NICE AND THIN.              

279
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,391
       THEN YOU'RE JUST GONNA   
    GIVE IT A LITTLE EXTRA CHOP,

280
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,393
                   JUST IN CASE.
SO YOU GET A LITTLE             
 BIT OF THE BELLY,              

281
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,128
A LITTLE BIT OF THE LOIN        
     IN EVERY BITE.             
             ALL MIXED TOGETHER.

282
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,330
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA            
 TAKE A LITTLE BIT              

283
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:42,467
OF THE EXCESS CRACKLING. MAYBE  
  A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR YOU.    

284
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,602
FRESHLY BAKED                   
CIABATTA ROLL,                  

285
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,871
AND THEN WE'RE JUST             
  GONNA PUT A BIT               

286
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,474
 OF THAT SALSA VERDE            
THAT WE MADE EARLIER.           

287
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:56,481
           I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
                  MY NAME.      

288
00:11:56,483 --> 00:12:00,351
                  IT IS SO JUICY
                   AND SO TENDER

289
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:03,621
                   AND FLAVORFUL
                   AND BALANCED.

290
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:06,157
                NOT TOO MUCH ON 
              THE HERBACEOUSNESS

291
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,159
        WITH ALL OF THAT ITALIAN
          PARSLEY THAT WENT IN. 

292
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,161
     NOT TOO HEAVY ON THE GARLIC
         OF THE SALSA VERDE.    

293
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,764
      THEN WHEN YOU DID THE RUB,
          NOT TOO MUCH SALT,    

294
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,833
 NOT TOO MUCH ROSEMARY--ROSEMARY
      CAN BE SO PREDOMINANT.    

295
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:18,903
        AND ENOUGH CIABATTA ROLL
          TO HOLD IT TOGETHER.  

296
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,772
BOOM.                           
                      KILLED IT.

297
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,373
           ONE PORK.            
    IT'S AN IMPRESSIVE SANDWICH.

298
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,442
   THEY HAD IT WITH THE MUSTARD.
    GIVES IT A NICE LITTLE KICK.

299
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:27,244
                    HOW IS THAT?
           DELICIOUS.           

300
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,714
     DO YOU SEE THIS RIGHT HERE?
      THAT'S A SKIN MOISTURIZER 

301
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,716
              IN FLAVOR TOWN,   
          RUNNING DOWN YOUR ARM.

302
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:34,652

                 AND YOUR CHEEK.

304
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,323
    YOU JUST CAN'T GO WRONG.    

305
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,324
   YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA GET    
     SOMETHING GOOD THERE.      

306
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,393
          ROCKIN' IT.           
        I WILL BE BACK.         
THANK YOU.                      

307
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:45,396
IF YOU BUILD IT, THEY WILL COME.
       YOU HAVE BUILT IT.       

308
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,998
          <i> UP NEXT...</i>           

309
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,866
                LOOK AT THE SIZE
                 OF THAT THING.

 JUST IN CASE ANYBODY           
WAS COUNTING. I WASN'T.         

493
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,767

        BUT DON'T WORRY,        

496

     DRIVE-INS AND DIVES."      

499
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,785
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THOUGHT        
  I WOULD JUST SHOW UP          

500
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,521
 TO THIS LUNCH COUNTER,         
AND I WAS GONNA BE SAFE.        

501
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:00,124
I REALLY MISSED IT              
   ON THAT ONE.
