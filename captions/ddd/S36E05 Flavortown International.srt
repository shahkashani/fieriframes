00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,134
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,136 --> 00:00:03,602
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:06,671
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,940
          This trip...          

5
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:09,274
                   Ah-ha!       

6
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:12,477
    It's a first class ticket   
  to Flavortown International.  

7
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:15,080
                I'm drowning    
                in my drool.    

8
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:17,615
 We've got a credible Indonesian
          in Florida...         

9
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,351
                  Makes me      
              wanna go to Bali. 

10
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,820
 ...a Middle Eastern taste fest 
         in Oklahoma...         

11
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,288
               No matter where  
               you are in OKC,  

12
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,290
         you've got to come find
                  this guy.     

13
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:26,959
  ...and in Portland, Oregon... 

14
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:28,560
              That, lights out. 

15
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:32,631
   ...a funky joint all about   
      over the top tortas.      

16
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,633
               That's dynamite  
           any way you slice it.

17
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,635
      That's all right here     
           right now,           

18
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:39,104
      on "Diners, Drive-ins     
            & Dives."           

19
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:45,077
                     ♪♪         

20
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:50,982
                     ♪♪         

21
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,784
       Now, when you watch      
     "Guy's Grocery Games,"     

22
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,452
    a lot of times you'll see   
      that I bring on chefs     

23
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,655
      from "Triple D" on to     
           "Triple G."          

24
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:57,990
         Well, this time        
      things have changed.      

25
00:00:57,992 --> 00:00:59,657
  You see, I'm bringing a chef  
         from "Triple G"        

26
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,594
 and putting him on "Triple D." 
   Confusing, right? Exactly.   

27
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,329
    So I'm here in beautiful    
       Hollywood, Florida,      

28
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,763
   to check out a joint that's  
           serving up           

29
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,466
  some bomb Indonesian cuisine. 

30
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:10,468
        This is Krakatoa.       

31
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,870
      Okay, serve, please.      

32
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,705
        There are posers,       
and then there's the real thing,

33
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:16,341
   and this is the real thing.  
      -I need lime, please.     

34
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:20,145
 The aroma will just pull people
   in right off the sidewalk.   

35
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:21,279
        It's very unique.       

36
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,482
  The spice is a punch in your  
             mouth.             

37
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:26,618
   Typically, that doesn't mean,
       "Come down here and eat."

38
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,555
 GUY: And the one-two punch here
     are owners and husbands    

39
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:31,556
   John Anthony and Abe Moiz,   

40
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:35,360
   who's cooking up knock-out   
 Indonesian from his childhood. 

41
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,428
    -Were you a cook in Bali?   
              -No.              

42
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,431
          You just cook the food
      that you know how to cook.
 Yes.                           

43
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,034
     There's so many flavors    
   coming in all these dishes,  

44
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:44,903
  and it's definitely not like  
    any other kind of Asian.    

45
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,772
     Serve, please, Singang.    

46
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,907
      I enjoy the Singang.      
      If you like seafood,      

47
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,043
  this is really a great dish.  

48
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:54,379
     It's more like a curry,    
 but with a little bit more zip.

49
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,714
               What's the dish  
              we're gonna make? 

50
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,382
     -Singang with seafood.     
             -Okay.             

51
00:01:57,384 --> 00:02:00,118
We're gonna make a seasoning    
called Bumbu Samawah.           

52
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,854
-Called hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.
      -Bumbu is seasoning.      

53
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,456
             -Bumbu.            
         -Garlic first.         

54
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,858
  Ginger, galangal.             

55
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,327
         -Galangal? Yes.        
     -Lemon grass, shallot.     

56
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,797
And when I was in "Triple G,"   
 I didn't find this.            

57
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,198
       -We have candlenut.      
         -No, you don't.        

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,265
                 Yes, we do.    

59
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,336
 You have macadamia,            
     that's why.                

60
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:18,670
            Sri Lanka lime leaf.

61
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,205
White pepper, coriander.        

62
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,406
            -Tumeric?           
              -Yes.             

63
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,008
             -Vodka.            
          -It's a sake.         

64
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,143
          -That's sake?         
             -Yeah.             

65
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:27,145
             -Okay.             
           -No, water.          

66
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:32,016
         -Sounds great.         
           -Salt, oil.          

67
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:36,288
Indonesian bay leaf. Simmer     
that for 30 to 45 minutes.      

68
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,290
  -Okay, now what are we doing? 
          -Yellow rice.         

69
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:40,225
          Jasmine rice.         
          -Lemon grass.         

70
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,693
      Bay leaf.                 
  This is my soul.              

71
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,028
         -The live leaf?        
              -Yes.             

72
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,365
     -Tumeric, coconut milk.    
   -This is the kuning sauce.   

73
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,966
          Yellow sauce.         
   -Very similar to the sauce   

74
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,167
             we made            
         -Very similar.         

75
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,837
    Water, salt.                
Cook for about 30 minutes.      

76
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,906
             -Okay.             
 -We're gonna make the Singang. 

77
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,108
    Coconut oil,                
 the Bumbu Samawah.             

78
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,377
             The sauce we made? 

79
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,646
Sugar, chicken base.            

80
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:02,047
     -This is the fresh cod?    
              -Yes.             

81
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:05,250
 Red pepper, onion,             
 chopped lime leaf.             

82
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:09,121
   Turmeric, tamarind, water.   
 -Kind of poaching the fish now.

83
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,588
   Yes. Scallion.               

84
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,391
        -Cherry tomatoes.       
             -Yeah.             

85
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,459
           Thai basil.          
  -That smells like Thai basil. 

86
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,728
                The shrimp go   
             in the last minute?
 Yes.                           

87
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,263
    We are going                
 to do the rice now.            

88
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:20,932
    Make it like a krakatoa.    
     -Oh, this is a volcano.    

89
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:25,270
  Yes. Put this for             
some green, tomatillas.         

90
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,538
        This is the lava.       
        -I love the lava.       

91
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,609
It's Indonesian chili sauce.    
I think we are ready.           

92
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:34,212
   -I'm drowning in my drool.   
     -That's how we eat it.     

93
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,614
                 I love it.     

94
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,217
                Outstanding.    

95
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:40,552
           The flavors are light
               but pronounced.  

96
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,353
             You get the sweet, 
              you get the sour, 

97
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,222
            you get a little bit
                of the spice.   

98
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,424
      You get the fresh seafood.

99
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,161
         It's really surprising.

100
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:52,897
               It's delicious.  
      Makes me wanna go to Bali.

101
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,900
       I have two Singang       
            for you.            

102
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,703
     Every bite is fragrant,    
        and it's intense        

103
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:59,504
   without being overwhelming.  

104
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:02,774
   You say, "Wow, this is not   
  your typical fish or shrimp." 

105
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:05,510
  It's just a different flavor  
     that is just delicious.    

106
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:08,714
 -So how did you find the place?
 -I work in downtown Hollywood, 

107
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:11,516
      so I know                 
it's a diamond in the rough.    

108
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:12,851
             WOMAN:             
  It's very close to the beach, 

109
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,453
      and you're able just      
       to walk right over       

110
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:17,255
and get an Indonesian experience
      -Some more is coming.     

111
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,591
 Today, I had the Semur Daging, 
      and it was fantastic.     

112
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,260
 It's a beef dish with a lot of

   ahogada sauce.               

222
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:49,094
       You use chicken drippings
              in ahogada sauce? 

223
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,963
No one said this is traditional,
but you're gonna love it.       

224
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,098
We've got our tray lined in     
    banana leaf.                

225
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,500
    So we've got                
some achiote paste here.        

226
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,568
             -Salt.             
             -Salt.             

227
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,969
            -Garlic.            
         -Black pepper.         

228
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,103
   Whole habanero.              

229
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,772
           Fresh lemon and fresh
             orange, fresh lime.

230
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,240
        -You stand back.        
    -So go ahead and tell me    

231
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,309
        how that comes out, Meg.

232
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,843
                Over the top    
               of the chicken.  

233
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,713
      Lay that over in the oven.
               350. How long?   

234
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,914
 For about an hour.             

235
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,584
Once that's finished,           
tread it for pollo pibil torta  

236
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,986
and save our drippings          
for the ahogada torta.          

237
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,389
So we're going to do            
our spicy tomato sauce.         

238
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,524
        -What's in that?        
        -Tomato and Arbol       

239
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,192
 and the drippings.             
   Let it simmer.               

240
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,328
And then that'll be ready       
to go on our torta ahogada.     

241
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,528
                 Okay, Chef.    

242
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,331
So now we'll make the slaw      
  that goes on top.             

243
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,400
   Slice an onion,              
sliced habanero, raw.           

244
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:31,803
 -That's not gonna hurt at all. 
  -Some salt, Mexican oregano.  

245
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,404
 We like to crush it            
  with their hands.             

246
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,541
 Just a little fresh lime juice.
          -Flavor jets.         

247
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,343
Now we're gonna build           
 our ahogada torta.             

248
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:39,811
   First we toast               
    our bolillo.                

249
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,746
             It's nice and light
                 and fluffy.    

250
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,416
Put some of our carnitas        
that we made inside.            

251
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,118
Top it with our slaw            
and cilantro on top.            

252
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,353
   It's essential

Tuck our Rosemary in.           

331
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,471
This is maybe the least         
traditional thing we do here.   

332
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,673
  Some avocado leaf             
that we're putting in,          

333
00:12:55,675 --> 00:13:00,411
habanero, garlic, diluted       
   tamarind paste.              

334
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,947
         -This is weird.        
          -Bit of oil,          

335
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,283
     salt, and some pepper.     
      -Roast this off at --     

336
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,219
  375 about an hour             
   and 20 minutes.              

337
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:11,155
    -What are we on to next?    
-We're gonna make jalapeño mayo.

338
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,893
Chard chilies, garlic           
salt, lime juice, some mayo.    

339
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:17,228
                Let's see it.   
                 Okay, Chef.    

340
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,364
   We're gonna put              
our jalapeño mayo on first.     

341
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,232
                  You could     
         hide behind this thing.

342
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:22,901
Tortas as big as your head.     
That's what we're going for.    

343
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:25,370
          That's good. Well, you
            almost covered that.

344
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,771
 Once our Huaraches             
are baked off, hand fry         

345
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:31,910
 for about a minute.            
Both sides go in and on top.    

346
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,311
                    Wow.        
            The tamarind tomato.

   I think I'm feeling lucky I'm
  gonna get three. There you go.

348
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,317
Queso Botanero -- that's like   
    queso fresco                

349
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,785

 chili and cilantro.            

350

00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,526

               I've ever had.   

356
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:05,877
      Great crunch. It's creamy,
         it's spicy, it's tangy.

357
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,347

358
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,148
               The acidity of   
    the pickled onion is a must.

359
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,951
     The avocado flies right in.

360
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:15,219
 And you get a little bit of fat
     coming in from that cheese.

423
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:45,102
     You take that tamarind pod,

424
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,904
              and then you have 
             the tamarind seeds.

425
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,172
           That old thing if you

429
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:53,377
     -Tamarind pods, right.     
   -I could be here all week.   

430
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,913
Boil the tamarind beans for     
hour, hour and a half.

00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,982
             -Okay.             
      -Strain the tamarind      

432
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,250
  and get the juice             
     out of it.                 

433
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,185
     And then that's what we use
      for the base of the sauce.

434
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:05,390
 Exactly. Cilantro,             
     some salt.                 

435
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:07,725
    -Now we make the samosas.   
       -Couple of these...

437
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:13,531
     Then you add the meat.     
  -I'll just have it like that.

         -All the way...        
         -To the corner.

           -That's it.          
 -And then we put in the fryer.

             Let's see it, Chef.

442

Put them right here.            
 Take one of these.
