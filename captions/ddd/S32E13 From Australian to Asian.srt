00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:07,205
      drive-ins, and dives.

00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:13,078
              -Ahh.             
           -Delicious.          

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,080
     ...'cause we're headed     
        all over the map.       

8
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:16,882
I can't wait to see this.       

9
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,151
    From Australian favorites   
        in Kansas City...       

10
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:20,218
   Out of bounds.               

11
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,287
        ...to an eclectic       
        El Paso eatery...       

12
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,623
That's a Mexican pasta dish.    

13
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,558
        ...and a Hawaiian       
          grab 'n go...         

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,559
      Brother.

  ...with funky Japanese flair.

00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,163
What is this back here?         
          Sushi robot.          

17
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:32,430
 What?                          
              Yeah.             

18
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:36,435
 I don't know about             
this sushi robot stuff.         

19
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:38,303
     That's all right here,     
           right now,

23
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:54,520
      So I've been to a lot     
         of restaurants,        

24
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:56,254
 I've been to a lot of bakeries,
     but I don't think that     

25
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,057
         I've ever been         
  to an Australian restaurant,  

26
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:00,992
and I know for a fact I've never
  been to an Australian bakery. 

27
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,861
 So I'm here in Downtown Kansas 
         City, Missouri,        

28
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:05,263
     to check out just that,    
      an Australian bakery.     

29
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,799
        This is Banksia.

  Prune and brandy pasta tart.  

31
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:12,737
     They have an incredible    
         array of food.         

32
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,806
     SERVER: Pork sandwich.     

33
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:16,274
            I think it's amazing
                and creative.   

34
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,810
       Jerk chicken salad.      

35
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:20,412
  I've never been to Australia, 
    but when I come in here,    

36
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,614
       I feel like I have       
      a little taste of it.     

37
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:25,884
 FIERI: That's 'cause owners Rob
 and Kate Joseph and Erika Vikor

38
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:27,953
       are really bringing      
    the flavors of Down Under   

39
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,888
  to the heart of the Midwest.  

40
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,558
              How did you three 
           Aussies end up in KC?

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,560
       I just took a dart,      
    threw it on the map. No.    

42
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:37,029
     I started a veterinary     
     pharmaceutical company     

43
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:38,964
         Bin Australia,         
    we moved it to the U.S.,    

44
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:41,033
      and after three weeks     
         of retirement,         

45
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:43,368
my wife said I needed to get out
  of the house and get a hobby. 

46
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,703
      So you opened up a bakery?

47
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:47,239
   Yeah. We missed the things   
    that we had in Australia,   

48
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,040
         and we thought         
     Kansas City needed it.     

49
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,442
              Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

50
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,110
    MAN: Any mood you're in,    
       anything you need,       

51

    a pastry or a full meal.    

52
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,515
        Beef potato pie.        

53
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,984
  The beef pie is great because 
  the beef's really well done.  

54
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,586
        It's very savory.       

55
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:04,189
It's a wonderful mix between the
  meat and the mashed potatoes. 

56
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,524
                 What are we    
             starting off with? 

57
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:08,594
So we're gonna make a shortcrust
pastry for the beef pie.        

58
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:10,195
We're gonna have our flour.     

59
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,930
  Just a little bit             
for your homies over here?      

60
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,332
   Yeah. We'll just add a little
           bit over there, so...

61
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:14,533
            Well, I like to make
                a lot of mess   

62
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,267
              so everyone else  
              can clean it up.  

63
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,269
Just drop a little bit.         
                           Salt.

64
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:19,004
                  Vinegar.      
            Some chilled butter.

65
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,006
     So, we crumb that, and then
      we're gonna add the water.

66
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,208
And we bring it all together    
  into a big lump.              

67
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,811
          That's a culinary term
     in Australia, a "big lump."

68
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,679
            My lovely lady lump.

69
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,147
                Check it out.   

70
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,216
Okay. So we have our ball       
of dough that we're now --      

71
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:33,218
            No. Do not change it
              to ball of dough. 

72
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,286
           You called it a lump.

73
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:36,288
The lump of Aussie dough.       

74
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,157
    And now we're               
  gonna sheet that.             

75
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,159
Now we're gonna cut out         
     our rounds.                

76
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:42,027
               Do you normally  
          put flour on the ring?

77
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,494
 Yeah.                          
          So it doesn't do that?

78
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,362
You ruined that one.            

79
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,897
                There you go.   
                I ruined it?    

80
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,767
 I don't remember me holding the
   ring without the flour on it.

81
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,303
Don't come to Banksia the day   
after Guy's been here.          

82
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:52,237
The pies will be awful.         
                           Yeah.

83
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,905
        Make sure that the girls
                are working.    

84
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,506
   Yeah.

               into a pie tin?  

86
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,777
       We are.                  
We're gonna trim that up.       

87
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,179
                 All right.     
        Now we make the filling.

88
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,181
        Okay.                   
   Let's do that.               

89
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:03,915
We have an Angus-beef           
     chuck roll.                

90
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,318
           We're gonna coat that
              in our spice rub. 

91
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,386
                Onion powder.   

92
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:08,653
             Granulated garlic. 

93
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:09,787
               Mustard powder.  

94
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,189
Kosher salt.                    
                  Ginger powder.

95
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,191
   Ginger powder.               
    There you go.               

96
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:13,592
                Celery seed.    

97
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:14,660
                Black pepper.   

98
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,261
           Give that a good mix.

99
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:17,596
          Coat our beef in that.

100
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:19,798
            And then we're gonna
     brown it off with some oil.

101
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,200
            And then we're gonna
             take that liquid...

102
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,335
 Right over the top?            

103
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,070
           Add a little bit more
               of the dry mix.  

104
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,272
             Some fresh garlic. 
                 Red onion.     

105
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:28,607
              Lots of red wine. 

106
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:29,741
  Rosemary?                     
                 Bay leaves.    

107
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:30,875
       And a little a bit       
        of cheese kofta,        

108
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,344
               so, we can pull  
           those out at the end.

109
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:33,679
    This will go                
   how many hours?              

110
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,813
             Five hours at 250. 

111
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:36,882
     All right.                 
What are we into now?           
                           Okay.

112
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,817
             So we're gonna make
             a cheesy-potato top

113
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,218
             for this beef pie. 

114
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,620
        Okay.                   
                  Potatoes.     

115

118
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,293

             then strain those.

drippings that were left over...

          Going onto the beef...

 Oh, right in there.

00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,737
                Put all those   
              into the freezer. 

228
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,071
And the puff pastry...          

229
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,807
         We use a thousand-layer
              pastry technique. 

230
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,276
I can't wait to see this.       

231
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,545
              We're gonna start 
             with some AP flour.

232
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:28,079
                Salt. Butter.   

233
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,947
            Apple-cider vinegar.
                   Water.       

234
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,415
            And we're gonna make
                a big dough.    

235
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,817
                    Okay.       

236
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,287
And now we're gonna sheet that, 
fold that puff pastry,          

237
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,356
and we're gonna create          
1,000 layers with butter        

238
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,825
in between so when we put it    
in the oven the steam           

239
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,628
from the butter cooking is      
gonna make that pastry puff up. 

240
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,831
  Got it.                       
         So now, frozen sausage.

241
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,433
               We're gonna run  
              a little egg wash 

242
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:49,834
               'cause this is   
              kind of our glue. 

243
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,636
Okay.                           
          Now a little egg wash.

244
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,773
    And then we're gonna seam it
    so that it doesn't pop open.

245
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:55,841
       Got it.                  

246
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:57,909
                So, egg wash.

           A little surimi crab.

342
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,032
   Okay.                        
               Fresh ahi tuna.  

343
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,502
                  Cucumber.     
The spicy aioli we made earlier.

344
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,369
                   Unagi sauce. 
When's it become a burrito?     

345
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,706
                      Right now.
It's a seaweed tortilla.        

346
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:15,773
             It's ready to roll.

347
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,308
 So what you've made            
  is a gigantic...              

348
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,176
                      Maki roll.
...as big as a burrito.         

349
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,179
  Now I understand.             
  Took me a while.              

350
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,916
      I dig it.                 
You get the warm shrimp.        

351
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,251
You get the cold spicy tuna.    

352
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:27,385
  You get the rice,             
 which, I'll say --             

353
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,919
 one of my big fears            
     of any time                

354
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,254
   I see something              
  being automated,              

355
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,056
especially something            
as delicate as sushi,           

356
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,457
  is that that rice             
   gets hammered.               

357
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,260
   It gets pressed              
 together too much.             

358
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,797
I think one of the reasons      
you wouldn't find people        

359
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,732
 getting sushi to go            
is 'cause it takes forever.     

360
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,601
So, what you have here,         
someone can order a burger,     

361
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:44,668
someone gets a fish sandwich,   

362
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,070
 and someone can get            
  a sushi burrito,              

363
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,739
then you can be back            
on the road in five minutes.    

364
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,941
              Right to he beach.
 That's a big deal.             
     Well done.                 

365
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,475
       Your sushi burrito.      

366
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,144
      I love the freshness      
          of the fish.          

367
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,013
    And the sauce is not too    
          overwhelming.         

368
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,614
      Just the right amount     
          of spiciness.         

369
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,149
       -It's really good.       
        -This is amazing.       

370
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,218
This is way good.               
     They're brother and sister,
                 by the way.    

371
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,352
   They're good friends of ours.

372
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,154
              I know their dad. 
         Do you eat sushi a lot?

373
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,289
      It's my favorite food.    
     You're getting it like this
                 how fresh?     

374
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,624
         It's so fresh.         

375
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,226
     They use a lot of great    
        local products --       

376
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,027
grass-fed beef, local produce...

377
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,098
  The fresh fish comes from the 
  Pacific Ocean, right outside. 

378
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,032
 FIERI: Except when it doesn't. 

379
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,769
We switch it all up, and we grab
      our cod from Alaska.      

380
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,771
      Because you can't do      
          misoyaki cod          

381
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,640
     without having real cod    
          from Alaska.          

382
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:24,309
    The misoyaki fish burger.   

383
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,778
      Misoyaki fish burger      
       is my new favorite.      

384
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,646
       It literally melts       
         in your mouth.         

385
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,849
       A white flake fish.      
          Great sauce.          

386
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,049
       FIERI:                   
What are we into next?          

387
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,718
               We're gonna do   
       our misoyaki fish burger.

388
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,852
    "Misoyaki"...               
what does that mean?            

389
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,521
       It's like a miso-marinade
                    fish.       

390
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:37,789
And you butcher it up?          

391
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:38,990
             We're gonna invite 
       Chef Charles in for that.

392
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,391
                He's the man.   

393
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,527
  FIERI: And Head Chef Charles  
     Garcia Llamas has been     

394
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,196
      Eric's right-hand man     
     since back in the day.     

395
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,598
      -We worked together.      
           -In Vegas?           

396
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,665
           -In Vegas.           
              -Yes.             

397
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:48,933
     All right.                 
Let's get after it, Chef.       

398
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,201
                 All right.     
         I'm just gonna flay it.

399
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,136
   He's after it.               

400
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,804
   So he's got it               
   all trimmed up.              

401
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,205
   And we're gonna              
  use the skin on?              

402
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,673
              Yes.              
   We gotta keep the skin on.   

403
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,274
Oh, I can't wait to see this.   
  Thank you, Chef.              

404
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,410
  Nice job.                     
                      Thank you.

405
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:00,744
        Ahh.                    

406
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,947
This is the most tranquil       
back kitchen/prep kitchen       

407
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,149
I've ever been in in my life.   
 What are we making?            

408
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,751
    So we're gonna make our miso
           marinade for our cod.

409
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,286
               So we start off  
               with our saki.   

410
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,054
       Ta-da!                   
                    Hear it...  

411
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,622
                Light it up.    
      Wow.                      

412
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,291
                 Shiro miso.    
               Our white miso.  

413
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,559
       Sugar.                   
     Stir it up.                

414
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,227
             Bring it to a boil.
And that's our sauce.           

415
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,296
   So, next up, we're gonna make
       our amazu salad dressing.

416
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,563
    Start with the rice vinegar.

417
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,632
         A bunch of white sugar.
           A little bit of salt.

418
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,168
             Bring it to a boil.
         Let the sugar dissolve.
Got it.                         

419
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,037
      We're gonna add our kombu,
             our dried seaweed. 

420
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,839
And this is a dressing          
that goes on the sandwich?      

421
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,640
  Yeah. So we take the cod right
            out of the marinade,

422
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,708
    put it into the broiler.    

423
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,843
A lot of times, you see         
   a fish sandwich              

424
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,043
and it's a fried-fish           
      sandwich.                 
                     Yeah.      

425
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,112
But you're taking a premium     
   piece of fish,               

426
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,915
flown in from Alaska fresh,     
and you're a fast burger joint? 

427
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,050
                          Yes.  
   Makes no sense.              

428
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,052
   This is our taro brioche bun.
                 Made fresh.    

429
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,320
This taro is actually from local
          farmers here in Kauai.

430
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,989
Okay.                           
       This is our misoyaki cod.

431
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,057
               Our miso sauce.  

432
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,258
             Then we're gonna go
               into our salad,  

433
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,593
         with our amazu dressing
             with made earlier. 

434
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,061
          And there you have it.

435
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:52,730
It's a little above and beyond  
what I was anticipating.        

436
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,268
  Wow. Tender fish.             
    Great sauce.                

437
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,071
You do get that nice            
 sweet of the miso,             

438
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,873
  and then you get              
the sour of the vinegar         

439
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,875
and you get that little play    
going back and forth.           

440
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:05,677
    Brioche bun.                
Is this a local bakery?         

441
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,079
                     Yes, it is.
The bun that they are           
making you is rockin'.          

442
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,747
When you're gonna come          
   to the islands               

443
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:13,685
and you're going to enjoy       
  a fish sandwich,              

444
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,353
the last thing you want         
is to have it fried.            

445
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,821
                      Exactly.  
    Nicely done.                

446
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,422
           -Thank you.          
 -You're misoyaki fish sandwich.

447
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,957
Misoyaki fish burger is amazing.

00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,900
   The food is very eclectic.   

564
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,769
      The oxtail tostadas.      

565
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,038
 The oxtail tostada is amazing. 

566
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,108
   It has a creamy bean layer   
      and the smoky oxtail.     

567
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,578
    The meat just kinda melts   
         in your mouth.         

568
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,912
    What is next                
  on the game plan?             

569
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:37,248
Now we're gonna make some oxtail
              for our tostadas. 

570
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,316
Okay. Same seasoning we used    
 on the skirt steak?            

571
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,652
                    Yeah.       
  So we're gonna sear those off.

572
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,187
 Okay, Chef.                    
                 Take these out.

573
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,655

                   Carrot.      

574
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,457

00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:49,993
       Bits and chunks in there.

  Bits and Chunks.

   Bits 'n chunks,              
   bits 'n chunks               

579
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,134
   So two poblanos              
and the jalapeño. Got it.       

580
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,736
                  Jalapeño.     
               Coriander seed.

00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,105
   And a bay leaf.              

583
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,607
            This is gonna braise
              for eight hours.  

584
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,742

Next for this tostada is?       

586
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,479
               We're gonna do   
               the bean purée.  

587
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,681
              Beef fat. Onion.  
                   Garlic.      

588
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:11,815
   And what beans               
    are we using?               

589
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,617
      That's frijoles de charro.

590
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,819

     they were.                 

591
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,756
      Right across the border...
that's where we get those beans.

592
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,224
           Put the water in now.

593
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,693
So we'll let these go for a     
simmer for about two hours?     

594
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,027
            For about two hours.
                   Mm-hmm.      

595
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,296
 We'll add the salt             
   and the cumin,               

596
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:26,564
