  Man, it sure is nice to have

  It's never here.              

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,872
             Exactly. And since 
          we're on quarantine...

4
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:08,406
        Yeah,                   
the car's on quarantine.        

5
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:09,674
     ...the car's on quarantine,
                    also.       

6
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,076
            And we've been doing
         some great cooking here

7
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:12,878
      at the Fieri house, but...

I just want to go out.          
I just want to go out to eat.

    Niko and Sikey from Seattle.

22
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,513
          They sent French dips.

 That's what I'm talking about!

       You know -- Luigi's pizza
               from San Diego.  
RYDER: Yeah.

          He's sending arancini.

    Mike's City Diner in Boston,

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,398

00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:19,077
          from "Diners,

   the most tenure out of you?  

43
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:30,622
  I think it's Voula's -- Niko, 
    Sikey, and Voula herself.   

44
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,424
  We got Benny Lin all the way  
   out of North Pole, Alaska.   

45
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,495
       By the way, Benny,       
   I love that the Pagoda sign  

46
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,764
      is right behind you.      
                          Right.

47
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,500

      from Pizzeria Luigi.

      I got Ryder over here     
       working the camera.

   my right-hand man, Hunter,   

51
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:50,775
     but I think he's taking    
       care of the goats.       

52
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,311
           We're here           
     in the outdoor kitchen.    

53
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:55,113
     I'm wearing this shirt,    
            rerf.us,

 their job due to the pandemic.

      that's lost your job,     

58
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,391
 it's a place to go and sign up 

59

        for a $500 grant.       

60
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,395
    So, here's the game plan.   

61
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:13,599
  I asked you to send me a dish 
   that you're super-proud of,

00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:16,468
and then I'll do the final steps
       of the preparation       

63
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,605

 The restaurants are
