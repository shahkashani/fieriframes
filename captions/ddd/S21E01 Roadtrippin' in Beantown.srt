00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,736
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:06,538
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,607
          This trip...          
  Unh!

         to Bean Town...

          extravaganza.         

8
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:15,881
                I'd eat that    
               out of a shoe.   

9
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:18,217
 In the Allston neighborhood... 

10
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,551
                  Check it,     
               don't wreck it.

       "Triple D" mashup.       

12
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,888
                 You are not    
             gonna believe this.

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,557
          One kitchen,          
        two restaurants.        

14
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,959
              This is probably  
       one of the most confusing

15
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,561

         to the left...         

17
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:32,231
I don't like it at all.         

18

    ...and a wicked gastropub   
          to the right.         

19
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,167
         If it's funky,         
         I'll find it.          

20
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,302
         This is funky.         

21
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,438
     And, in South Boston...    
                      I like it.

   in Allston, Massachusetts,

      I get clam chowder,       
      I get lobster rolls,

          That's right.

I don't know where else         

42

I would find anything like this

 with Mexican food.

used to call me "The Maxican."

     All right.                 

59

So, we're gonna make            
our marinade for the brisket.

  It has a nice, smoky flavor.  

114
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,833
You make a mess of yourself,    
 but it's worth it.             

115
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,370
Lone Star Taco Bar is a lot more
      than just a taco bar.     

116
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,305
            It offers           
  a lot of different cocktails, 

117
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,040
 a lot of different food items. 

118
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,041
Generally always get            
      the corn.                 

119
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,242
                    MAN:        
            Grilled street corn.

120
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,044
             WOMAN:             
   Slathered in a garlic aioli  

121
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,045
   with a little bit of spice   
             in it.             

122
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:11,783
The grilled street corn,        

123
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:12,851
  one of the things             
 I think works great            

124
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,319
  is by parcooking.             

125
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,920
            Little salted water?
  Absolutely, yeah.             

126
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,323
I find by blanching it          
and then grilling it,           

127
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:19,858
this kind of blooms the sugars, 
makes it nice and sweet.        

128
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,925
              What does it do?  

129
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,860
       Bloom.                   

130
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,261
           It blooms the sugars.

131
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,529
So, we're gonna make            
  the aioli for it.             

132
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,164
      We start                  
with heavy mayonnaise,          

133
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,133
fresh-chopped garlic,           
 ancho chili powder.            

134
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,302
Gonna use some pepper,          
    kosher salt.                

135
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:32,204
   This is grated               
   Cotija cheese.               

136
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:33,138
   Fresh cilantro.              

137
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,339
And now we're gonna add         

138
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,808
some of my favorite hot sauce --
Valentina Extra-Hot.            

139
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,610
Fresh lime juice is key,        
     tons of it.                

140
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,346
 Gonna whisk this up            
        nice.                   

141
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,415
   So, this comes               
  out of the water.             

142
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,217
Gonna snap it in half.          
        Yep.                    

143
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,620
 We're gonna hit it             
with a little bit of oil,       

144
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,555
       pepper,                  
and then a bunch of salt.       

145
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:53,558
Give it a quick toss            
and then on the grill.          

146
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,492
             Just a little char?

147
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,694
        Yeah,                   
we want a nice char.            

148
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:58,363
We're gonna put our aioli       
on the plate down first.        

149
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,032
   Corn's finished              
    on the grill.               

150
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,704
Give it a little roll.          

151
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:08,706
                 Street corn    
           if I've ever seen it.

152
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,776
Then we need a big pinch        
     of Cotija.                 

153
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:13,378
                    Yep.        
             I like that flavor.

154
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,515
Little shake of our ancho chili,
                make it nice.   

155
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:19,151
   And then plenty of fresh lime
            to squeeze over it. 

156
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,287
  Very nicely done.             

157
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,856
This, with a little bit         
     of the mayo                

158
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:25,991
  and a little bit              
    of the cheese               

159
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,658
and a little bit of lime        
coming through there,           

160
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,860
   a little ancho               
  at the end of it,             

161
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,162
    this is real                
Mexican street food.            

162
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,532
  Well done.                    
                 Thank you, man.

163
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:36,868
         Just fantastic.        

164
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,002
                 It's fresh.    

165
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,004
             WOMAN:             
       The aioli's great.       

166
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,272
      It's really garlicky,     
           but sweet.           

167
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:41,473
   I don't like it              
       at all.                  

168
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,674
 I'm gonna continue             
  to not like this              

169
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,009
over the entire commercial      

170
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,078
  that's coming up              
  in just a minute.             

171
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,212
  We're hanging out             
at Lone Star Taco Bar           

172
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,748
     in Boston,                 
   of all places.               

173
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,082
Can we make another dish?       
                  Let's do it.  

174
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,084
 All right. I'll be             
passed out in the corner.       

175
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:54,219
See you in a little bit.        

176
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,425
             FIERI:             
          Welcome back.         

177
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,894
            Hanging out         
    in the outskirts of Boston  

178
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,697
     at a funky little joint    
   called Lone Star Taco Bar.   

179
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,501
         Chef Max and I,        
  we've had fantastic barbacoa. 

180
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:12,237
We had some Mexican street corn.
             It was outrageous. 

181
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,172
             And he promised me 
                 something,     

182
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,640
            again, in this true,
              authentic style.  

183
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,042
         What do you got for me?

184
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,309
Our chicken-ranchero            
      tostada.                  

185
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,245
             WOMAN:             
        Chicken tostada.        

186
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,580
              Which is my go-to 
  pretty much every time I come.

187
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,049
Gonna make ranchero sauce.      

188
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,116
 Nice, hot stockpot.            

189
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,451
    I'm gonna use               
a little vegetable oil.         

190
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,319
    Some onions.                

191
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,521
Like to put some salt           
      in there                  

192
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,123
to help them sweat down         
    a little bit.               

193
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,657
Now we're gonna add             
our dry ingredients.            
                         Hit it.

194
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,259
Pasilla chili.            

195
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,795
      Guajillo.                 
                    My favorite.

196
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,062
 This is straight-up            
    chili powder.               

197
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,797
                        Comino? 
Comino, oregano.                

198
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,265
    Dried thyme.                

199
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,934
   Chopped garlic,              
    black pepper.               

200
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,336
   Give it a stir.              

201
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:45,670
Now that this has sweat down    
    a little bit,               

202
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,006
we're gonna add our chopped,    
roasted green pepper,           

203
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,809
  poblano chilies,              
and red chili pepper.           

204
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,410
Yeah, we leave the skins on,    
we get rid of the seeds.        

205
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,945
     'Cause we're gonna run this
       in an immersion blender? 

206
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,213
No, leave it chunky.            
                    This chunky?

207
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,482
This chunky.                    
    It's funky when it's chunky.

208
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,283
                  And then      
           a little green chili.

209
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,819
       And last but not least...

210
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,821
  Chopped tomatoes.             

211
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,956
   A little sugar.              

212
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,359
 This is gonna cook             
for at least 45 minutes.        

213
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:08,293
                   Got it.      

214
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,563
     I'd eat that out of a shoe.

215
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,831
We're gonna take our boneless,  
skinless chicken breasts        

216
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,101
 and we're gonna put            
some of our ranchero sauce      

217
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,235
that we made right on there.    

218
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:20,372
      We've got                 
some ancho chili again.         

219
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,908
Cumin, black pepper,            

220
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,977
 granulated garlic,             
some fresh lime juice.          

221
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,045
And then we're gonna put        

222
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,046
some chicken stock in           
to get this braising.           

223

00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,094
    You don't want to leave.    

451
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,763
       Kielbasa with hunter stew
               for you, ma'am.  

452
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:35,899
  The menu is very, very close  
  to what my mother used to do. 

453
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,969
        FIERI: But here,        
    Dad's running the show --   

454
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,904
         Chef and owner         
       Teddy Barcikowski.       

455
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,305
                   FIERI:       
                Why Polonia?    

456
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,307
      We called                 
 all people Polonia.            

457
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,977
  They still living             
outside the mother country.     

458
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,646
     So people that live outside
             the mother country 

459
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:49,981
             are called Polonia?

460
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,182
        Yeah.                   
                     I like it. 

461
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,717
        And before Teddy        
         was a Polonia,         

462
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,653
   he fought against communism  
    in the Polish air force.    

463
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:58,522
    Then he escaped the U.S.    
    with his family recipes,    

464
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,325
   opening this joint in '02.   

465
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,192
    Pierogi are ready to go.    

466
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,861
       I love the pierogi.      

467
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,062
And that's one of the few places

468
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,264
 that actually does it the real,
         authentic way.         

469
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,533
                 What are we    
              gonna make first? 

470
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:10,001
We're gonna make first          
 the meat pierogies.            

471
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,668
                  Let's go.     

472
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,604
We have two kind of meat --     
   pork shoulder,               

473
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,606
     and we have                
  the chuck tender.             

474
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:18,009
  There's the pork,             

475
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:22,880
then you're gonna add a little  
bit of celery, parsley, leeks.  

476
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:25,283
  We have carrots,              
we have bay leaves here.        

477
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,018
      Allspice.                 

478
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,487
 Granulated garlic,             
 granulated onions.             

479
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,755
   Vegeta spices.               

480
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,756
                   Vegeta.      
   You know what is this?       

481
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,892
       Vegeta is vegetable base.

482
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,561
              Used tremendously 
                 in Europe.     

483
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,096
        Yeah.                   
We have to bring to boil.       

484
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,297
               Let it simmer?   
    Yeah.                       

485
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,631
                And how long    
             is this gonna cook?

486
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,367
One and a half hours.           
                        Gotcha. 

487
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:45,236
Now, we pull the meat           
out of the vegetables.          

488
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,637
              Meat is finished. 
             Caramelized onions.

489
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,839
           Now we're gonna grind
                 the mixture    

490
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,774
               that's gonna go  
               in the pierogi.  
   Yes.                         

491
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,643
                  Holy moly     
         that's coming out fine.

492
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,045
                   Onions.      

493
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,247
                Oh, Yahtzee!    

494
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,983
Now we mix the meat.            

495
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:02,020
Now we gonna roll out dough     
 for the pierogies.             

496
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,890
     You cut it                 
 in three pieces...             

497
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,527
 ...and we're gonna             
    roll it out.                

498
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,330
Now we cover it with water.     

499
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,465
    Time to make                
   the pierogies.               

500
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,666
            Right in the middle?

501
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:17,134
        Yeah.                   

502
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,737
           Take all the air out.
                   Got it.      

503
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,071
And then the cutter.            

504
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,807
               Let's put these  
                in the water.   

505
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,141
                Now, how long   
             have these cooked? 

506
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,409
Three to five minutes.          

507
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,678
                 Very nice.     

508
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,347
Sour cream in the middle,       

509
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:32,483
  caramelized onion             
with the bacon bits.            

510
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,118
      Parsley.                  

511
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,221
                Gonna be hot.   

512
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,622
                   Mm-hmm.      

513
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:39,756
                    Mmm.        

514
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,126
        Very light, very tender.

515
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,029
              When people say,  
               "Oh, pierogi."   

516
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:49,967
            They've had frozen, 
        not hand-made pierogies.

517
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,302
            And if you try this,

518
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,104
          it will change the way
             you think of them. 

519
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,171
                 Delicious.     

520
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,374
     Here's your pierogies,     
             ma'am.             

521
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:59,243
        The meat inside,        
    it's a little bit sweet.    

522
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,379
   The right amount of onions   
they way they should be sautéed.

523
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,781
 One of the reasons             
 I'm here in Boston             

524
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,782
is for a program called         
    Best Buddies.               

525
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,119
My buddy Anthony Shriver, he's  
the founder of Best Buddies.    

526
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,854
 My buddy Dan Koppen            

527
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:12,256
and my buddy right over here,   
   this is Chris.               

528
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,258
 Here's this awesome            
       program                  

529
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,927
that works with adults with     
intellectual disabilities.      

530
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,531
It's about pairing buddies      
and athletes and chefs.         

531
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:21,999
It's a great way to teach people

532
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,935
      about the acceptance      
  of difference and diversity.  

533
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,203
 Let me ask first --            
what'd you think of the pierogi?

534
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,073
      I thought the pierogi     
         was fantastic.         

535
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,541
        I just love food.       

536
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,276
          [ Laughter ]          

537
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,744
   It's a good thing to love.   
                     Yes, it is.

538
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,079
It's a good thing to love.      

539
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:37,548
Do you think Dan's had          
very many pierogies?            

540
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,816
              Yes.              

541
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,818
  I think he's had              
      a couple.                 

542
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,619
 The knight cutlet ready to go. 

543
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,422
              MAN:              
  Teddy does an excellent job.  

544
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,223
   Brings out a lot of flavors  
          in the pork.          

545
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,758
             WOMAN:             
   I love the knight's cutlet.  

546
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,095
     It's crispy and stuffed    
 with all these goodies inside. 

547
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:54,631
         Now we're going to make
                  the what?     

548
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,633
  Knight's cutlet.              

549
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:56,767
              Knight's cutlet.  

550
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,769
  We cut the pork,              
then we're gonna pound it.      

551
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:01,772
               Like earthquake  
               in California.   

552
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,574
    Yeah, it is.                

553
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,777
  For the filling,              
we use the smoked ham,          

554
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,647
 slice of mushroom,             
    Swiss cheese,               

555
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,583
with a couple slices            
 of the red pepper,             

556
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,051
  bacon on the top.             

557
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,587
Pepper, garlic, salt.           

558
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,322
So, we gonna make the roll.     

559
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,257
                   Got it.      

560
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:23,727
It's going in the egg wash      
  and bread crumbs.             

561
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,129
                    Okay.       

562
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,130
               Okay, now we go  
                to the fryer?   

563
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,465
 Now we're gonna go             
    to the fryer.               

564
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,667
                  How long?     

565
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,869
10 minutes, 270 degrees.        

566
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,137
                Low and slow.   
  Yeah.                         

567
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,671
So it cooks all the way through,
               nice and even,   

568
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,007
     and doesn't brown too fast.

569
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,342
        Yes.                    

570
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,477
                    Okay.

572
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,281

Yes.

                 Very nice.

Do you love the potatoes?       

577

We finish with gravy            
   on the cutlet.

                Tastes great.   

581
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,969
          For the amount of time
            that you cooked it, 

582
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:07,104
             a lot of the flavor

583
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:10,841
  of the mushroom and the cheese
  and smoked ham comes through. 

584

                 Way to go.

 that it just bursts in flavors.

588
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,117
    I don't want to share it    
          with anyone.
