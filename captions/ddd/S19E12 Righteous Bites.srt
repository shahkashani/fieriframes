1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,133
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,601
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:07,072
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,173
          This trip...          

5
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,942
       O-m-g.                   

6
00:00:09,944 --> 00:00:11,276
      ...release the jaw...     

7
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:13,545
I'm so full from eating it,     
  and I want more.              

8
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:16,081
   ...'cause we're dishing out  
     some righteous bites...    

9
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,617
        It sounds like an extra 
   45 minutes on the elliptical.

10
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:19,617
       It is.                   

11
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,686
 ...in Los Angeles, California. 

12
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,555
              This is not even  
              humanly possible. 

13
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,691
The monster of all sandwiches...

14
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,092
             This is ridiculous,
                 by the way.    

15
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:29,828
          ...jam-packed         
      with the good stuff.      

16
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,897
               Cheese sticks,   
             Philly cheesesteak,

17
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,566
                French fries,   
              chicken fingers.  

18
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,635
Then up the coast in Monterey...

19
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:38,637
                 I don't use    
         this fancy-dancy stuff.

20
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,105
  ...we're hitting the wharf... 

21
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:41,840
           This is like calamari
                 gone wild.     

22
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:44,175
           ...for some          
      off-the-hook seafood.     

23
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,111
             Wow. This is fresh.
                    Mmm!        

24
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:47,446
     And in Aiea, Hawaii...     

25
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:50,181
I mean, I think I got           
a pretty wild hairstyle.        

26
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,517
But I think you might take      
  the cake, buddy.              

27
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:53,452
             ...some            
   out-of-this-world flavor...  

28
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:55,320
 This is crazy good.            

29
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:58,390
       ...at a place known      
     for serving up strikes.    

30
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,726
       In a bowling alley?      
       Are you kidding me?      

31
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,994
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

32
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,764
     on "Diners, Drive-Ins,     
           and Dives."          

35
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,814
   So, I'm here in Los Angeles  
      in Westwood Village,      

36
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:23,549
 just a couple blocks from UCLA.

37
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:25,217
     But how did I get here,    
          is the story.         

38
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:27,686
 See, I got this buddy named Jay
  that lives on the East Coast. 

39
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,888
       He says, "Hey, Guy.      
Next time you go to Los Angeles,

40
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,157
 "you got to check out this East
   Coast buddy of mine's joint  

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,825
       that he opened up.       
     You're gonna love it."     

42
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,027
        I said, "Really?"       

43
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:36,761
 And he says, "Would I send you 
         anywhere else?"        

44
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,564
           All right.           
       This is Fat Sal's.       

45
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,171
         Fat Bahn Mi-ki!        

46
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,772
        You'll never try        
        another sandwich        

47
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,107
    like this anywhere else.    

48
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,175
  Waiting on the Reuben rolls.  
       Chili cheeseburger.      

49
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:51,443
           It's crazy.          

50
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,645
  MAN: They take the appetizers 
      and the French fries      

51
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,581
        and they put them       
 on the actual sandwich itself. 

52
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,782
       FIERI: Serving up        
       monster sandwiches       

53
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,118
        is the brainchild       
      of owners Josh Stone,     

54
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,589
 Sal Capnick, and Jerry Ferrara,
     three New York buddies     

55
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:05,924
           who invaded          
      health-conscious Cali     

56
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,926
with their greasy-spoon concept.

57
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:10,395
We couldn't find the kind       
of food that we wanted to eat.  

58
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:11,663
So we were just like,           
     "Whatever.                 

59
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,131
 Let's just make it             
   all ourselves."              

60
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,402
 And since they opened in 2010, 
 their cravings have caught on. 

61
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,404
You bring somebody from the East
Coast that's out here visiting, 

62
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,271
    will you bring them here?   

63
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,206
                I always do.    

64
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,741
                  Take them     
          to the Hollywood sign,

65
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:23,808
                  take them     
            to the walk of fame,

66
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,743
         take them to Fat Sal's.

67
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:25,744
     MAN: I'm not gonna lie.    

68
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,412
         The only reason        
       I come to Westwood       

69
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:28,680
  is for Fat Sal's sandwiches.  

70
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,349
         I have no idea         
       what else is here.       

71
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:31,283
     Fat Jerry.                 

72
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:32,551
             WOMAN:             
    I'm having the Fat Jerry.   

73
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,352
       And it's just like,      
  the best thing I've ever had. 

74
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,620
      So, this is the Fat Jerry.

75
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,688
This is the Fat Jerry.          

76
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,357
                  Named after...
Jerry Ferrara.                  

77
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,025
           FIERI: Yep.          
        That'd be Jerry,        

78
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:43,295
         a.k.a. Turtle,         
     from HBO's "Entourage."    

79
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:44,429
              Everybody that's  
              in movies or TV   

80
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,430
                 wants to be    
     in the restaurant business.

81
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:46,632
             Everybody in sports

82
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:47,499
                 wants to be    
     in the restaurant business.

83
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,767
    Everybody in                
the restaurant business...      

84
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,169
              Wants to be in... 
Movies and sports.              

85
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,904
         All right, so let's go.

86
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,506
     Starts with                
our extra-wide hero bread,      

87
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,974
which we call fat bread.        
                           Okay.

88
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,777
   Give this thing              
a little bit of that butter.    

89
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,513
   Get it started               
    on the grill.               
                           Okay.

90
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,181
  We're gonna drop              
  chicken fingers,              

91
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,849
 mozzarella sticks,             
 and French fries.              

92
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,984
                Oh, what else   
              is going in this? 

93
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,420
       Bacon.                   

94
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:09,721
        Eggs.                   

95
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:11,056
    Cheesesteak.                

96
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,123
       Onions.                  

97
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,925
           All for one sandwich?
All for one sandwich.           

98
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,061
 Little bit of salt,            
little bit of pepper.           

99
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,795
 I'm gonna give this            
   a little turn.               

100
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,264
  I'm gonna chop up             
     our Philly.                

101
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,266
We got a little American cheese 
   going on here.               

102
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:24,203
       Bacon.                   
We're gonna take this.          

103
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,471
             Philly cheesesteak,
                   an egg.      

104
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,140
        Okay.                   
That thing's looking good.      

105
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,209
              Chicken fingers,  
             mozzarella sticks. 

106
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,411
     And fries.                 

107
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,146
              This is not even  
              humanly possible. 

108
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,015
   We're gonna do               
a little bit of ketchup,        

109
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,550
a little bit of mayo.           

110
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,285
             This is ridiculous,
                 by the way.    

111
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,153
  This goes here.               
  This goes there.              

112
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,956
            Look at the gour-met
                   in you.      
    Yep.                        

113
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,626
 I'm gonna give this            
a nice roll, nice cut.          

114
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,161
             Look at this thing.

115
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,567
               Cheese sticks,   
             Philly cheesesteak,

116
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,969
                French fries,   
              chicken fingers.  

117
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,371
       Bacon.                   

118
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:00,972
                 Oh, and --     
There's bacon.                  

119
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,041
                 No lettuce,    
               none of that --  

120
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,643
We're not screwing it up        

121
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:07,312
and over-vegetablizing it,      
      you know?                 

122
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,446
               It's legit, Josh.
Little nostalgia.               

123
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,648
            Nice job, my friend.
Thanks, brother.                

124
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,383
    Fat Jerry!                  
      MAN: I'm indecisive,      

125
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,652
      so I like to take all     
    the things I might want,    

126
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,253
           have it all          
      on the same sandwich.     

127
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,655
    And you would think that    
    it would be just weird,     

128
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,189
    but it's really amazing.    

129
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,724
 It kind of makes me feel young,
   eating something like this.  

130
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,927
     Who came up with things    
       like the Fat Jerry,      

131
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,328
        which is far away       
         from the truth?        

132
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,529
              JERRY: I pig out. 

133
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,031
             When we were going 
          through the Fat Jerry,

134
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,332
         I just couldn't believe
                that you guys   

135
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,000
           would let me put all 
       this stuff on a sandwich.

136
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,201
          [ Laughter ]          

137
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,071
     But the menu's rocking     
   more than just sandwiches.   

138
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,205
            All right. So, what 
         are we gonna make, man?

139
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:37,142
We are going to make            
meat lovers' pizza rolls        

140
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,677
with a marinara-sauce dip.      

141
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,279
              For some reason,  
               it sounds like   

142
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,147
             an extra 45 minutes
             on the elliptical. 

143
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,482
       It is.                   
    It could be.                

144
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,616
      At times.                 
Depends how many you eat.       

145
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,018
            Give me the rundown,
                    boss.       
   Okay.                        

146
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,419
So, we're gonna mix all         
of our stuff together here.     

147
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:53,158
We've got our ground beef,      
sausage, chopped-up pepperoni,  

148
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,960
      parmesan,                 

149
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,896
shredded mozzarella,            
and chopped provolone.          

150
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,031
    Fresh basil.                

151
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,834
Then we're gonna add a little   
bit of the marinara sauce.      

152
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,370
We are going to have to         
    put on these.               

153
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,237
                 All right.     

154
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,506
                     Oh.        

155
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:10,642
This is how they go on.         

156
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,311
        Fast.                   
                      I'm ready.

157
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,646
Oh, I really thought            
you had that thing on.          

158
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,714
      I'm like,                 
"Guy's a professional."         

159
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,749
So, we're gonna give this       
       a mix.                   

160
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,186
                 All right.     
She's a-mixed.                  

161
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,787
Spring-roll wrapper.            
                    There we go.

162
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,990
      A little                  
  measuring device.             

163
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,261
              Little egg wash.  
Little egg.                     

164
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,730
   I'm gonna tuck               
   and roll here.               

165
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,598
Put it in a little flour.       

166
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,467
             And hold them cold.
Yeah.                           

167
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,736
 We are going to...             
       Drop them like they're...

168
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:38,870
        Hot.                    

169
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:39,938
       Drop them like they're...
            MAN: Hot.           

170
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:44,743
                    Okay.       
Nice, nice.                     

171
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,611
                    Sexy.       

172
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,479
    Nice crunch.                

173
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,715
            Take a look at that.

174
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,086
                    Mmm!        
                Great flavor.   

175
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,422
           I get that pepperoni,
           not too much cheese, 

176
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,458
                which is what   
            I was worried about.

177
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,895
               Awesome crunch   
               from the roll.   

178
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,499
                You got a lot   
              of texture to it. 

179
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,235
      It doesn't sog out on you.

180
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,503
              I should just try 
                  one more.     

181
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,704
 Just a little bit.             

182
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,106
                    Mmm.        

183
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,375
     Meat lover pizza rolls!    

184
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,244
 Literally pizza in an egg roll.
         It's fantastic.        

185
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:22,380
  The meat lovers' pizza rolls  
     remind me of New York.     

186
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,716
When I told you about that buddy
     of mine on the East Coast, 

187
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,451
               that's my buddy  
                right there.    

188
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,920
               His name's Jay,  
    and he's a buddy of Jerry's.

189
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,922
              So, fitting that  
             I get you two here.

190
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,256
     Jerry and I                
are East Coast guys,            

191
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,192
so, it's, like, nice to         
have something East Coast.      

192
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,461
Nice recommendation, my brother.

193
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,596
                Hey, what can   
              I get you today?  
 Hi.                            

194
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,730
       If you come to L.A.      
     and you're visiting me,    

195
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,065
    we're going to Fat Sal's.   

196
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,734
        You want to finish that?

197
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,003
           [ Laughs ]           
      I'm gonna crush that.     

198
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,138
             I'm gonna crush it 
                 right now.     

199
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,542
      Up next, I'm cruising     
         to Monterey...         

200
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:51,409
                Salt, pepper.   

201
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,810
   Lime zest.                   
                 Lime zest.     

202
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:53,745
        Done.                   
                          Check!

203
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,079
   ...for a fresh-catch joint   

204
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,748
        that's reeling in       
         one favorite...        

205
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,783
          I'm an abalone junkie.

206
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,484
        ...after another.       

207
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,186
         Dungeness crab, to me, 
         is the king of the sea.

208
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:12,297
            I'm here            
    in Monterey, California,    

209
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:13,831
      on Municipal Wharf 2.     

210
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,033
 Now, this is the working wharf.

211
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,767
     There's a tourist wharf    
          on that side.         

212
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,570
   But this is where the boats  
         really come in.        

213
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,839
 I mean, you got an abalone farm
           down there,          

214
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,574
     you got a fish market,     
          you name it.          

215
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,909
      And you need a place      
  for the wharf workers to eat. 

216
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,645
      And that's right here     
         at this joint,         

217
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,180
 Loulou's Griddle in the Middle.

218
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:33,718
    This is really good food.   

219
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,520
Fish tacos.                     
                 Oh, great.     

220
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:36,521
 It's my favorite place to come.

221
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,991
    It's almost like dancing    
         in the aisles.         

222
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,393
       It's time to party.      

223
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:43,929
             FIERI:             
  A party that started in 2001  

224
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,130
       when Loulou Garrett      
        bought the joint.       

225
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,133
And 10 years later, her business
      partner, Gigi Davis,      

226
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,870
 jumped ship from corporate life
        to join the fun.        

227
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:53,205
This is now my office,          

228
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:55,540
    which I feel                
incredibly grateful for.        

229
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,208
              Really stressful. 

230
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,476
                I don't know.   

231
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,345
       You must have a real good
             therapy plan here. 

232
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:05,349
This super-chill spot used to be
    a bait shop back in '48.    

233
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:08,553
    And it's still keeping up   
   that fresh-catch tradition.  

234
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,755
    Halibut over                
 mixed baby greens.             

235
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:13,357
        ...hauling in one       
    of my favorites, abalone.   

236
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,559
 Fresh is the best.             

237
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,694
And it's actually farmed and    
grown right here in the bay.    

238
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,629
                   Crazy.       

239
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,231
   These bad boys are amazing.  

240
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:22,367
   They're not like calamari.   
     They're not like clams.    

241
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:25,169
     They're like something     
    you've never had before.    

242
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,571
A little more buttery           
   than calamari.               

243
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,239
            Yeah, more buttery. 
          Fattier than calamari.

244
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,975
GARRETT: Abalone sliders.       

245
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:32,377
      They are so delicate      
          and flavorful         

246
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,346
and probably the perfect slider.

247
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,181
          I'm an abalone junkie.

248
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:41,319
           Abalone is the jewel 
     of the Pacific North coast.
It is.                          

249
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,587
             Okay, get after it.
     Okay.                      

250
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,255
We're gonna make the dredge     
for the abalone sliders.        

251
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,992
Flour, white pepper.            
                          Okay. 

252
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:48,326
    Garlic salt.                
                         Got it.

253
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:49,995
 All Seasoned salt.             

254
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,130
  Cayenne. Paprika.             

255
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,064
 That's it. Simple.             

256
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,265
               Don't be afraid  

257
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,467
  that she put that much Cayenne
                  in there.     

258
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:56,935
                  It's not      
            super-spicy Cayenne.
  No.                           

259
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,803
It's not gonna hurt you.        
    Let's do it.                

260
00:08:58,805 --> 00:08:59,771
Aren't they beautiful?          

261
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,340
              Wrecking his day. 

262
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,142
  Yep, right there.             
        Done.                   

263
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,810
           Okay. Now we're gonna
             take the body off. 

264
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:08,546
             Wow, this is fresh.
     Yes.                       

265
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,281
              Okay, here we go. 

266
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,684
 So, we finish the little finish
            of the tenderizing. 

267
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,154
              Not so much that  
         you broke all the flesh

268
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,822
             'cause you want it 
            to have its texture.

269
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,557
Take those out. We're gonna     
just dredge them up.            

270
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,959
                   Great.       

271
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,694
Got our pan heating here.       

272
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,028
I'm gonna put the buns down     

273
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,297
'cause it's gonna cook super    
quick, less than a minute.      

274
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,632
     High heat.                 

275
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:28,967
Little clarified butter         
       there.                   

276
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,236
     Just enough to warm them up
       and put a crust on them. 

277
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,303
    Pretty much.                

278
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,372
           This is like calamari
                 gone wild.     

279
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,540
               You do not want  
              to overcook them. 

280
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,978
We're gonna make the aioli.     

281
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,646
              I'll do the mayo. 
   Okay.                        

282
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,714
         Go 'cause I don't want 
       that abalone to overcook.

283
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:44,782
     Lime juice.                

284
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,851
        Mayo, lime juice, check.

285
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,786
We have an olive oil that's been
infused with lemongrass.        

286
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:49,787
                 Very nice.     

287
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,457
   Fresh cilantro.              

288
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,192
Salt, pepper.                   
                   Salt, pepper.

289
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,993
     Lime zest.                 
                     Lime zest. 

290
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,862
                          Check!
Check on those abalones.        

291
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:58,929
    Get it good.                
                    That enough?

292
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,732
   That's enough.               
   Abalone slider.              

293
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,200
  Put a little slaw             
      on there.                 

294
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:05,937
That's a little radish,         
      cilantro.                 

295
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,305
      Got that.                 

296
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,141
     Fruit slaw.                

297
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,084
               It's so tender.  
           Great abalone flavor.

298
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:23,021
            Not too much spice. 
           The bun fits it well.

299
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,290
        I mean, I love any great
        sourdough bun like this.

300
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,827
            Slaw complements it.

301
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,697
   All the bright, fresh flavors
             with the crunch -- 

302
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,632
               it's fantastic.  

303
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,834
Great.                          
                  Nice job.     

304
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:36,768
     Thank you.                 
                      Mmm!      

305
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:40,905
That's good abalone.            

306
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,441
     The spices are blended     
       perfectly together.      

307
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:46,444
             How do you explain 
                 the seafood    

308
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,246
              that you get here 
                at Loulou's?    

309
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,247
         It's so fresh.         

310
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,315
   MAN: And the boat pulls up   

311
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,783
       right to the back        
       of the restaurant.       

312
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,652
   You watch it get unloaded.   
      You can't beat that.      

313
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,721
  FIERI: And they're pulling in 
     this hands-on favorite.    

314
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:59,190
            GARRETT: Crab feast.

315
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:02,126
 When crab season comes around, 
     everybody gets excited     

316
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,230
because we know we're gonna have
     a good meal that night.    

317
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:09,534
              From November 2nd 
         to right around June...

318
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:10,668
    GARRETT: Yep.               

319
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,069
            ...you can get fresh
               dungeness crab.  

320
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:15,740
      And dungeness crab, to me,
        is the king of the sea. 

321
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,609
         So how do you do yours?
Simple.                         

322
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:19,344
      Sea salt.                 

323
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,613
     Bay leaves.                
   Couple lemons.               

324
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:23,280
We're just gonna drop           
the whole lemon in there.       

325
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,482
 Garlic. That's it.             

326
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:26,284
           So a simple seasoning
                   to it,       

327
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,153
           not too much stealing
              from the flavor.  
   Yep.                         

328
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:30,889
                Look at that.   

329
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,223
    Upside-down.                
                      Buh-bye.  

330
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:34,559
   Wait till you see how vibrant
        orange it's gonna turn. 

331
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,294
        Okay. How long you gonna
                have it down?   

332
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,029
About 15, 20 minutes.           

333
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,297
     Ready?                     
                       Bring it.

334
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,431
            You take the shell, 
          clean out the mustard,

335
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,699
              and do all that.  
    Yes.                        

336
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,034
Unless they ask for it.         
   Unless they want the yum-yum.

337
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,469
     They might.                

338
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,441

               about the dish.  

452
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,909
     Seriously?                 
                      Yeah.     

453
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,546
Daikon radish.                  
                  Daikon radish.

454
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,715
      We're making radish juice.

455
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,818
             So we're gonna add 
             the pulp in here.  

456
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,686
                      Soy sauce.
I love soy sauce.               

457
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,221
                Lemon juice,    
               fresh-squeezed.  

458
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,559
              Sesame seed oil,  
              a key ingredient. 

459
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:02,827
             Red chili peppers. 

460
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,963
   And to top it off is a little
           toasted sesame seed. 

461
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,765
          Then we mix it all up.

462
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,435
And this is the sauce that      
we dip this whole thing in.     

463
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,171
        Ooh.                    
 Got a little bite.             

464
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,374
  That's delicious.             
     We're gonna finish the soup

465
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,109
                with a little   
              Tennessee whisky. 

466
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,710
                 Here we go.    

467
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,379
 No wonder everybody            
in this island loves you.       

468
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,447
 You could feed your            
whole family with this.         

469
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,583
                 Here we go.    

470
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,585
           We're gonna be adding
             some baby bok choy 

471
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,453
           and the green onions.

472
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,256
             Ginger and cilantro
             or Chinese parsley,

473
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,524
             and you add that --
As you like.                    

474
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,264
       O-m-g.                   

475
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:41,332
This is not gonna be good.      

476
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,067
 I'm gonna be asleep            
 in the parking lot.            

477
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,201
                A little bit    
               of mom's sauce.  

478
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,103
              It will cut that. 

479
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,338
         Oh!                    

480
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,874
Dude, you win best oxtail soup  
 in the world award.            

481
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,344
 This is crazy good.            

482
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,548
  That was the bite             
    right there.                

483
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,484
What I can't get over           
is the flavor in the broth.     

484
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,819
  And then you get              
  that mom sauce.               

485
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,222
    I'm shaking.                
I can't get it in the spoon.    

486
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,559
      It's hot.                 
I want to shove it in my face.  

487
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:09,660
I want to get in the bowl.      

488
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:15,099
        Mmm!                    
     [ Growls ]                 

489
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,301
      MAN: And here we have     
        our oxtail soup.        

490
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:20,171
       Very beefy flavor.       
  It has a lot of oxtail in it. 

491
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,973
    A little spice, a little    
   sweetness, little tartness.  

492
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,175
         Just wonderful.        

493
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,511
    The ponzu sauce is a nice   
      addition on the side.     

494
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:27,845
     It's crazy.                
                          It is.

495
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,048
I'm so full from eating it,     
  and I want more.              

496
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:36,053
At The Alley Restaurant,        
it's not just oxtail stew.      

497
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,055
                     No.        
You have more.                  

498
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,055
                We have more.   
Like what?                      

499
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,189
                 Barbecue --    
     Don't!                     

500
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,192
Actually, don't tell me.        
Okay, here's the deal.          

501
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,527
We're hanging out at the        
Aiea Bowling Alley in Aiea      

502
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,996
at The Alley Restaurant.        

503
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:46,930
 When we come back,             
   I'll be asleep               

504
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:48,199
 and Chef will make             
   something else.              

505
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,300
I'm gonna finish this.          
        Bomb.                   

506
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,641
             FIERI:             
 So, here I am in Aiea, Hawaii, 

507
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,443
 and the locals have steered me 
        to this joint --        

508
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,646
        a bowling alley?        

509
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:03,114
     It's called                
The Alley Restaurant            

510
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:05,516
and it's here in the town of    
Aiea right outside of Waikiki.  

511
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:09,386
This guy made an oxtail stew    
that is out of this world.      

512
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,456
But he promises me he has more  
tricks up his sleeve.           

513
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,590
Chef, what do we got?           

514
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,259
              We're gonna make  
              some cola turkey. 

515
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,260
Cola, like regular cola         
that everybody likes?           

516
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,528
                    Cola.       
        Okay.                   

517
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,397
          We're gonna start off 
     with a fresh turkey breast.

518
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,198
         And we're gonna make it
                into portions   

519
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,867
              that we're gonna  
               be marinating.   

520
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,935
       Put it into our pot here.

521
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,470
Let's make the marinade.        

522
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,805
                Cola is what    
         we're gonna start with.

523
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,007
Just straight off the tap.      

524
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,810
         And then we're gonna do
            a little salad oil. 

525
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,679
                 Soy sauce.     
                Fresh garlic.   

526
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,482
            Fresh ground pepper.
               Watch the cola.  

527
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,217
         Once I turn it in here,
             it's gonna change, 

528
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:42,086
               it's gonna get   
           all bubbly like that.
Okay.                           

529
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,622
    And that cola will tenderize
                this turkey.    

530
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,023
      It's gonna taste like beef
        if you close your eyes. 

531
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,424
         No.                    
                            Yes.

532
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,293
Really?                         
          You're gonna say, "Oh,
            what is that beef?" 

533
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,161
              But it's turkey.  

534
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:53,297
And how long are we gonna let   
this marinate on the turkey?    

535
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,498
                 Overnight.     

536
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,166
     All right.                 
     Overnight.                 

537
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,035
               So, this is our  
     overnight-marinated turkey.

538
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:00,404
         And we will grill some.

539
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,974
   How many pieces              
     do you get?                
                      Three.    

540
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,444
  We have to turn it and turn it
            so it doesn't burn. 

541
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,783
     And here we have our turkey
           right off the grill. 

542
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,252
 All that's gonna go            
    on that bun?                

543
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:15,520
             All that's gonna go
                in this bun.    

544
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:17,988
            Put some mayonnaise 
            in here, both sides.

545
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,423
          I'll drop this lettuce
               right in here.   

546
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,027
          This is your sandwich.

547
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,799
I don't know exactly how        
 to get after this,             

548
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,268
so I'm gonna have to            
   get half of it.              

549
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:35,606
        Mmm!                    

550
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:38,342
  Look at the juice             
 coming off of that.            

551
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,245
It doesn't taste like soda pop  
and it's not super-sweet.       

552
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,951
But that is rich flavor         
 all the way through            

553
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:48,152
and it is super tender.         

554
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:51,289
I mean, super tender.           
        Mmm.                    

555
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,291
It's like Thanksgiving.         
I'd eat till I pass out.        

556
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,560
 That, seriously --             
     it's simple                

557
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,495
and it's to the point,          
but it is super flavorful.      

558
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,630
   Dynamite, Chef.              

559
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,465
      Your cola turkey sandwich.

560
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:04,868
          It's not dry.         
  It's so moist and so tender.  

561
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,036
        It's very hearty.       

562
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,572
       You don't feel like      
    you're eating a sandwich.   

563
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:08,973
          You feel like         
      you're eating a meal.     

564
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,307
      Tasty chicken plate.      

565
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,643
   WOMAN: People come from all  
   over the island to eat here  

566
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:15,379
  for the food and for bowling, 
        but for the food.       

567
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,381
            Order up.           

568
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,449
And the food's righteous.       

569
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:19,850
  I mean, this food             
is ridiculously good.           

570
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,518
                     Ridiculous.
Ridiculous, yes.                

571
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
                That's the word.
 I concur.                      

572
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,792
It's not bowling-alley food.    
I'll tell you that much.        

573
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:29,994
The reputation is huge.         
 The food is legit.             

574
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,395
 You take the time,             

575
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,397
you put it in a really funky,   
   fun atmosphere.              

576
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,665
      Nice job.                 
                      Thank you.

577
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,801
    Really nice.                

578
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,202

It's funky.                     

585
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,548
                It is money.    

586
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,949
         I think I need         
       one more from you.
