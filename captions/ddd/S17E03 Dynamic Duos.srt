1
00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:03,869
         Hey, everybody,        
         I'm Guy Fieri,         

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,137
 and we're looking for America's

3
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:06,538
   greatest diners, drive-ins,  
           and dives.           

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,207
          This trip...          

5
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:11,143
 You have got to make some sense
    of what's going on here.    

6
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:12,945
         ...it's a pair         
        of dynamic duos.        

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,613
              Ooh.              

8
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:17,015
     In Denver, Colorado...     

9
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:18,283
Maybe it<i> is</i> gonna be            
    a mile high.                

10
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:20,085
  ...the triple-threat joint... 

11
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:21,220
   That's a first.              

12
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,755
     ...for drinks, pizza...    

13
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,291
 That's where the manhole cover 
   from Flavortown comes from.  

14
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:28,827
    ...and bodacious biscuit.   

15
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:31,230
 Holy biscuit mania.            

16
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,365
 Then in Scottsdale, Arizona... 

17
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,500
           [ Imitates whirring ]

18
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:35,700
    ...a mom-and-pop spot...    

19
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,569
       This is getting more odd 
               as we go.        

20
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,904
        ...scratch-making       
         their rendition        

21
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,440
    of morning-time classics.   

22
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:42,974
     And say "goodnight" to Guy,

23
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,177
     'cause he's gonna pass out 
             in the car.        

24
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,914
That's all right here, right now
         on "Triple D."         

27
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:05,864
    I'm here in the Bluebird    
  district of Denver, Colorado. 

28
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:08,066
     Now, they call it that     
   because right down there --  

29
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:10,202
   that's the Bluebird Theater  
      that opened in 1913.      

30
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,671
    Anyhow, here to check out   
     a place -- let's see --    

31
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:13,671
      it started as a bar.      

32
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:15,406
       Then they added in       
         a pizza joint.         

33
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:17,142
       Then they added in       
        a biscuit place.        

34
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:20,745
  So, now we've got ourselves   
  Fat Sully's, Denver Biscuit,  

35
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:23,449
       all under the roof       
      of the Atomic Cowboy.     

36
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:27,619
           Order up -- Franklin!

37
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:31,957
   The Denver Biscuit Company   
     is<i> the</i> place to come to    

38
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,025
    in Denver for good food.    

39
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,359
             Order up -- Dahlia.

40
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,228
 This is as good as any biscuit 
     I ever had in Georgia.     

41
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:39,297
    Eggs and bacon -- this is   
      my favorite biscuit.      

42
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,400
  MAN: Everything just tastes   
  better in between a biscuit.  

43
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:46,571
  FIERI: Like shrimp and grits  
      and chicken pot pie.      

44
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,706
    Biscuit-based everything.   

45
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,842
    This is the good stuff --   
      plain-out good food.      

46
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:52,177
              Yum.              
   FIERI: And it's a long way   

47
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:55,781
  from the dive bar owner       
  Drew Shader took over in '04. 

48
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,583
When we started, we were        
 a whiskey and PBR bar.         

49
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:00,319
                   That was it. 
That was it.                    

50
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,990
  But this South Florida native 
     wanted a taste of home     

51
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,458
     in the Mile High City,     

52
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:10,596
   so he brought in his buddy,  
      chef Jonathan Larsen.     

53
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:11,863
   So you're like               
  biscuit badasses?             

54
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:13,165
                  Yeah.         

55
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:18,403
      Like this hot mess of     
   a barbecued pork sandwich.   

56
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,871
               And the Elmer.   

57
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:21,540
   Let's fire up                
   some biscuits.               

58
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,075
       All-purpose flour first. 

59
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:26,077
           Some cake flour.     
       We got buttermilk powder.

60
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:28,480
Buttermilk powder -- really?    
                           Yeah.

61
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,682
     Little salt, little sugar, 

62
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:35,153
 little baking powder, and then 
 the secret -- cream of tartar. 

63
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,755
Really?                         
           Yeah. It just works. 

64
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,022
                 And we got     
             to grab the grater.

65
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:38,957
         We have three of these.

66
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,024
This is Darth Grater?           

67
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,160
                  Yeah.         

68
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:43,228
   Frozen butter.               

69
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:44,229
               Frozen butter.   

70
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:46,231
I want to push.                 
               Okay, I'll hold. 

71
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,232
    Look at that.               

72
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:49,568
 It's like a butter             
cotton candy machine.           

73
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:50,669
                  Yeah.         

74
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:56,108
So that's it?                   
                 For right now. 

75
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,576
            Now we're gonna add 
            our buttermilk,     

76
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:00,445
           yogurt,              
           and some whole eggs. 

77
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:02,714
       It has to be incorporated
          for about a minute.   

78
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,918
           So we're gonna mix up
               the biscuits.    

79
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:08,987
Now we're gonna just add        
a little bit...                 
                 ...more flour. 

80
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,056
    It's about 2 of these cups. 
    It kind of varies.          

81
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:13,192
                  That's it.    

82
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,129
Mixture's out of the way.       
    Now time to roll.           

83
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:19,130
                  Time to roll. 
Look at that.                   

84
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,466
It's like                       
a Sleep System pillow.          

85
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,801
             We cut it in half. 

86
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,470
              I'm going to just 
                  knead it.     

87
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,339
 So what have we got going here?
   Are we gonna roll it again?  

88
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:29,807
   Yeah, we're just gonna get it
     kind of into a rectangle.  

89
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,677
             So we're just gonna
              keep rolling out. 

90
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,012
         You can see that butter
          still is right there. 

91
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,480
             We got to check it 
               and make sure.   

92
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:40,552
                Ooh, yeah.      
           Not very -- not yet. 

93
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,087
     It's the right consistency.

94
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:47,892
     Then we punch and cut.     
 I'll go straight down on them. 

95
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:50,829
        Hoh!                    
 That is a monster!             

96
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,431
Maybe it<i> is</i> gonna be            
    a mile high.                

97
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:54,966
             [ Chuckles ]       
       Take a little pan spray. 

98
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:57,169
           Now they're gonna go 
               in a oven --     

99
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:00,172
   350 degrees for 18 minutes --
         convection oven.       

100
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:01,406
     All right.                 
  Off to the oven.              

101
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,779
Now pork butt for this          
  pulled pork Elmer.            

102
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,315
             We got salt first, 
                black pepper.   

103
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:13,451
 This is all the dry rub that's 
    going for this pork butt.   

104
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:17,122
         Paprika, chili powder, 
             a little cumin.    

105
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:18,990
  Brown sugar?                  
                      Oh, yeah. 

106
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:20,192
              And some cayenne. 

107
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:21,726
So, generously rub this?        

108
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,128
           We're gonna chill it 
               for 24 hours.    

109
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,263
                We'll wrap it   
              in plastic wrap.  

110
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,531
Get it in the smoker            
    in how long?                

111
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:27,598
                  10 hours      
             we'll smoke it for.

112
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:28,533
 What kind of wood?             

113
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:29,868
                  Hickory.      
Very nice.                      

114
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,470
And you also make               
your own barbecue sauce?        

115
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,272
                  Oh, yeah.     
Word.                           

116
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:36,808
Okay. Wow!                      

117
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:39,077
It's a cornucopia               
for barbecue sauce.             

118

00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,462
                Some of that    
             just breaks apart. 

347
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,464
     So now what are we gonna do
              with it?          

348
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,132
 We're gonna take it            
     from here,                 

349
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:57,334
and we're gonna grill it        
     on the flat top            

350
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,871
so it gets a nice little        
caramelized crisp on it.        

351
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,473
           And then we'll put it
             in the enchilada.  

352
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,075
 Yes.                           
                 Very nice.     

353
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:06,410
      And we're                 
  gonna slice it up             

354
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,146
    so it makes it              
a little easier to eat.         

355
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,481
And then we're gonna take       
   these tortillas --           

356
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,952
a little bit of homemade        
  chipotle, ricotta...          

357
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,286
 zesty black beans,             

358
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,589
 and then the slow-roasted pork 
       goes right on top.       

359
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,759
Then we're gonna top them       

360
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,062
with that spicy New Mexico      
      chili sauce...            

361
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,298
 and two incredible,            
    edible eggs,                

362
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,334
  and top it with a little bit  
       of fresh cilantro.       

363
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,172
                    Mmm.        
             That's really good.

364
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:38,977
           That New Mexican     
       chili enchilada sauce... 

365
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:40,044
             is right on point. 

366
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,113
             Little bit of heat,

367
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,914
     nice little sweetness to it
          from that honey.      

368
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,652
 Call it a breakfast enchilada. 
  Call it a breakfast burrito.  

369
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:51,389
   Call it anything you want,   
 just don't call me late for it.

370
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:54,458
       Those eggs are a complete
            waste of time.      

371
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,995
              That is just fine 
               just by itself.  

372
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,763
                Nicely done.    
Awesome.                        

373
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,733
    They are just delicious.    

374
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,068
 I can't stop stuffing my face. 

375
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:06,804
     When this place opened     
        and we tried it,        

376
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,472
     it was no turning back.    

377
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,074
             FIERI:             
    Kind of like when Pauline   

378
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,278
     first fell for Carmen,     
           literally.           

379
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,946
   He was working as a manager  
   at another restaurant here,  

380
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,683
 and there's a little step down 
 going down into the bar area.  

381
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,151
    And I had high heels on,    
   and I almost took a spill,   

382
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,286
     and he caught my hand.     

383
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:23,687
And he didn't let go            
       of it?                   
                             No.

384
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,155
                  Honest truth. 

385
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:29,093
           Pauline is a genius. 

386
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:31,362
    Carmen is right beside her. 

387
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:34,631
   They make a blend of flavors 
   that you'd never think of.   

388
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:36,234
     FIERI:                     
     Like this crazy concoction 

389
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,035
         Pauline threw together 
         one night.             

390
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,037
      PAULINE:                  
Chicken on the Coup.            

391
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,105
            Chicken on the who? 
Coup.                           

392
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,639
       Scratch-made gravy       

393
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:46,177
       poured over crispy       
   sausage-and-sage stuffing.   

394
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,979
             What are we making?

395
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,548
     We are making the          
sausage-and-sage stuffing.      

396
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:55,586
Butter, onions, celery.         

397
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:57,388
We're gonna let those sweat down
        for a little bit.       

398
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,856
                  Okay.         

399
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:02,994
 Add sausage -- give that a stir
 to loosen it up a little bit --

400
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:06,965
 salt, black pepper,            
  and ground sage.              

401
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:09,867
                   Money.       

402
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,269
We have day-old bread.          

403
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,604
      It's an Italian loaf,     
  so it really holds together.  

404
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,673
             So, chicken stock? 
Chicken stock.                  

405
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:19,677
Okay, so from here, we're gonna 
add our cooled sausage mixture. 

406
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,677
All righty.                     

407
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,880
We're gonna combine this --     

408
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,081
"Ring Around the Rosie."        

409
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,215
Okeydokey.                      

410
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,684
And we're gonna put it          
in the pan to bake.             

411
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,819
                      How long? 
About an hour...                

412
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:32,289
at about 400 degrees.           

413
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,424
         What are we making now?

414
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:34,959
    We are making the           
sausage-and-pepper gravy        

415
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,360
   for the Chicken              
    on the Coup.                

416
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:38,763
     We're gonna start          
with reserve bacon grease.      

417
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:41,231
            Okay. Very nice.    
         I'm glad you save that.

418
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:42,833
             Pork sausage again.

419
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:45,903
And then we have onions.        
 This gets cooked down.         

420
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,606
Then we're gonna add fresh      
 garlic and chicken base.       

421
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,376
             Got a little flour 
               for some roux.   

422
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:53,778
         Yeah,                  
a little bit of flour.          

423
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:55,580
 Then we're gonna do            
   the whole milk.              

424
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:58,649
         Nice Vanna White pour. 

425
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:01,385
 So we're gonna do black pepper,
       granulated garlic,       

426
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,988
    cayenne pepper              
for a little more heat,         

427
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,522
and fresh-grated nutmeg.        

428
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,925
    Then we're gonna let this   
  thicken up just a little bit. 

429
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,126
     Then we add                
  the heavy cream.              

430
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,796
     Wow, that's a heaping help 
              of gravy.         

431
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,064
  No calories here.             

432
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,532
     That's it.                 

433
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,735
So, stuffing just came out      
       of the oven,             

434
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:18,936
so it's nice and hot.           

435
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:21,739
A little soft on the bottom     
    and crispy on top,          

436
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,541
 so we're gonna take            
    a little bit                

437
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,076
and put it on the flat top      

438
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:28,613
    and let that                
 get nice and crisp.            

439
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:31,549
 So we're gonna take            
this crispy stuffing,           

440
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,552
   and I'll ladle some of this  
  gravy all the way around it.  

441
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,154
     And say "goodnight" to Guy,

442
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:38,489
     'cause he's gonna pass out 
             in the car.        

443
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,024
                   Huevos!      

444
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:41,559
       Huevos.                  

445
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:42,693
     That's it.                 

446
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:46,363
                  Mmm.          

447
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,833
     I like this little crispy  
   stuffing thing you just did. 

448
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:49,967
   When it's Thanksgiving time, 

449
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:51,368
     I always want the stuffing 

450
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:53,104
     around the edge of the pan.

451
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,038
Crispy.                         
                 Delicious.     

452
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,506
               Great texture    
               on the stuffing. 

453
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,576
     A real gravy -- nice little
         black pepper to it.    

454
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:01,979
   A big portion -- Thanksgiving
       any time of the year.    

455
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:03,314
    That's right.               

456
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,449
               Nicely done.     
           Chicken on the Coup? 

457
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,317
     That's it.                 

458
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,320
       There's no bawler on me. 
Sorry.                          

459
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:12,790
       This is good stuff.      

460
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,458
              MAN:              
      There's layers to it.     

461
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:17,528
   Each time you take a bite,   
 you taste something different. 

462
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,796
              All right,        
       what are we cooking next?

463
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,197
Wine Country French Toast.      

464
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,332
           This girl's trouble. 

465
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,501
       Wine Country French Toast
            coming up next.     

466
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:33,477
           So, of course,       
     a guy from the wine country

467
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:36,747
   has to come all the way down 
      to Scottsdale, Arizona,   

468
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,216
       to Perk Eatery to get... 

469
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:39,617
Wine Country French Toast.      

470
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:42,353
    Wine Country French Toast.  
    This should be interesting. 

471
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,288
  We're gonna start             
   with red wine.               

472
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:45,489
                 From Italy?    

473
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:46,624
      Yes.                      

474
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,226
                Wine Country.   

475
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,828
It's a wine country, too.       

476
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,430
And then we're gonna do         
some balsamic vinegar,          

477
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:53,698
a sprig of rosemary,            

478
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,832
 and we're gonna let that reduce
 until it gets nice and syrupy. 

479
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,635
       This is getting more odd 
               as we go.        

480
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,171
      Once this is reduced,     
we're gonna add our maple syrup.

481
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,372
We're gonna let that cook       
   a little bit longer          

482
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:04,041
   till it reduces              
   about halfway.               

483
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:08,379
   This is the Jewish challah   
 that we use that we hand slice.

484
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,914
                Same bakery?    
Same bakery.                    

485
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,316
We're gonna put down a little   
bit of clarified butter.        

486
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,619
So we're gonna put this         
in the egg wash.                

487
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,124
    That reduces, that cooks,   
 and we'll put it all together. 

488
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,726
      Yes.                      

489
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:25,930
So we're gonna top this         
      with brie.                

490
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:26,931
              So the brie's on. 

491
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,233
  Wait till it gets             
a little bit melted.            

492
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,472
       Brie's starting to melt. 

493
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:38,542
We're just gonna drizzle it     
  over a little bit here.       

494
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,744
                 Just crazy.    
Yeah.                           

495
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:44,414
And then we have                
slow-roasted red grapes.        

496
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,085
 These are tossed with a little 
  bit of kosher salt, rosemary, 

497
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,488
  and a little bit              
of clarified butter.            

498
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,091
 You got a little too much time 
      on your hands, girl.      

499
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:55,793
     You think?                 

500
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:01,132
 Silence is golden.             

501
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:02,833
           You should practice. 

502
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:03,868
     [ Laughs ]                 

503
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:08,573
     This a grown-up breakfast. 

504
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,241
           You get the richness 
               of the brie,     

505
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,843
 cut some of the sweetness with 
  the tannins of the red wine,  

506
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,645
                uniqueness of   
             the roasted grapes.

507
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,448
 And the fact that you're brave 
 enough to put it on the menu,  

508
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,951
     I think that's what makes  
     Perk an interesting joint. 

509
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:23,621
            Matthew,            
   Wine Country French Toast.   

510
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:25,856
      MAN: I'm telling you,     

511
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,925
      the French can't make     
     French Toast like this.    

512
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,127
       It's very special.       
   It's a great place to come.  

513
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:33,931
 They're getting pretty crowded,
      and you can tell why.     

514
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,667
                  Nice job.     
  Awesome.                      

515
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:41,138
So that's it for this road trip,
but don't worry.                

516
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:44,141
 We got plenty more joints      
 to find all over this country. 

517
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,943
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

518
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,478
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

519
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:49,747
           Okay, I have a rule. 

520
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:53,083
   I don't do shots with people 
     with better hair than me.  

521
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:54,485
          [ Laughter ]          

522
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,354
     Okay, look at the mustache 
            and the hair.       

523
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,723
 I'm already beat at this table.
       This is ridiculous.
