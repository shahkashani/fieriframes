MMM. THIS IS AWESOME.           

187
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:23,742
   I'M DOWN HERE IN SAN DIEGO.  

188
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,744
  NOW MEXICAN FOOD IN THIS AREA 
          IS ON POINT.          

189
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,746
       BUT I'M NOT FEELIN'      
       LIKE MEXICAN FOOD.       

190
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:30,415
       I'M THINKIN' PIZZA.      
   I HEAR THIS IS THE JOINT--   

191
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:31,750
         PIZZERIA LUIGI.        

192
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,752
      18-INCH, THIN-CRUST,      

193
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:36,454
          HAND-TOSSED,          
       NEW YORK-STYLE PIE       

194
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:37,756
     IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA?    

195
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:39,624
     I GOTTA CHECK THIS OUT.    

196
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,626
   THESE PIZZAS                 
ARE JUST DELICIOUS.             

197
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,563
THAT'S ALL YOU CAN SAY.         
        THE SAUCE IS VERY SWEET.

198
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:45,696
              I LOVE THE CRUST. 

199
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,633
   LOOK AT HOW THIN AND TIGHT   
          THAT CR--OH!          

200
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:50,502
BEST PIZZA IN SAN DIEGO.        

201
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:54,573
  <i> AT A JOINT THAT'S DOING 'EM</i>  
   <i> UP TO 20 DIFFERENT WAYS...</i>  

202
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,307
        SPINACH RICOTTA.        
PLAIN CHEESE PIZZA.             

203
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:57,909
  I REALLY LIKE                 
THE VEGAN A LOT.                

204
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,777
       THAT RIGHT THERE--       
 THAT'S LIKE A PICTURE POSTCARD.

205
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,647
    <i> MADE ENTIRELY BY HAND.</i>     
            I MADE THE FIRST ONE
                   AT 15.       

206
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:06,451
      <i> LIKE BACK IN ITALY,</i>      
 <i> WHERE LUIGI AGOSTINI WAS BORN.</i>

207
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,853
                 I WAS RAISED   
              IN NORTHERN MILAN.
  <i> HE CAME TO THE STATES IN '94,</i>

208

     <i> AND THEN TOOK A CHANCE</i>    
      <i> AND OPENED HIS OWN.</i>      

210
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:18,396
WHAT MAKES YOUR PIZZA           
      SO GOOD?                  
         WE REALLY PAY ATTENTION
             TO THE DETAILS.    

211
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:21,666
WE'RE GONNA MAKE PIZZA DOUGH    
    WITH BOTTLED WATER?         
           THE WATER IS THE KEY.
               IT IS BETTER.    

212
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,601
       BOTTLED WATER IS CLEARER,
              CONSISTENT.       

213
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,670
           IN NAPLES, THE PIZZA 
           TASTES A CERTAIN WAY.

214
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,605
     IN NORTHERN MILAN, IT JUST 
     TASTES A LITTLE DIFFERENT. 

215
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,940
               ALL THE CHLORINE 
               INSIDE THE WATER,

216
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,676
                 IT JUST KIND OF
                  AFFECTED IT.  
    A LITTLE                    
DRY ACTIVE YEAST.               

217
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:32,944
THE WATER'S JUST KIND OF        
    ROOM TEMPERATURE,           

218
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,547
   SO IT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE  
 MORE TIME FOR THAT TO ACTIVATE 

219
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,948
AS OPPOSED TO HAVING            
  SOME WARM WATER.              

220
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,884
   THAT'S WHY I ADD A LITTLE BIT
       OF SUGAR ON THE SIDE.    
THROW THE SUGAR ON IT.          

221
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:43,154
I LIKE THAT STIRRING IT         
 WITH THE ARM METHOD.           
                IT'S OLD-SCHOOL.

222
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,822
WHY DON'T WE PUT THE HOOK ON IT 
AND JUST DO THE HOOK THAT WAY?  

223
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,025
         IT JUST WON'T MIX IT UP
                 AS WELL.       
AS WELL.                        

224
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,493
WE ARE GONNA USE THE MIXER      
  AT SOME POINT, CORRECT?       

225
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:51,830
           SOME TIME TODAY.     
       AND THEN I ADD THE SALT. 

226
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,899
MR. "I'M STIRRING THE WATER     
WITH MY ARM IN THE MIXER."      

227
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,167
   LOOK HOW FAST                
HE'S GOT IT GOIN'.              

228
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:59,504
 HIGH-GLUTEN FLOUR--THE GLUTENS 
ARE WHAT CREATE THIS ELASTICITY,

229
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:03,174
    THE CHEW TO IT,             
AND GIVES IT SOME BODY.         

230
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,377
IT'S KINDA LIKE A LITTLE        
HOME GYM FOR YOU IN HERE,       

231
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,512
BETWEEN LIFTING                 
AND POURING...                  
                    I'M WORKING.

232
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,981
JUST DOING--UH-HUH.             
  10-15 MINUTES?                
               ABOUT 15 MINUTES,
                IT'LL BE READY. 

233
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,583
                WHERE YOU GOING?
 THAT WAY. WE'RE GOING          
TO SET IT ON THE TABLE.         

234
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,585
               LET'S JUST SET IT
                RIGHT UP HERE.  

235
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:17,589
OH, YOU'RE GONNA GO AROUND,     
      A LITTLE DANCE.           

236
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,591
       WHAT, WE JUST PULL IT OUT
        LIKE THIS, HUH, TRY IT? 

237
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,793
            MMM, THAT WAS GREAT.
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.             

238
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,530
 DUDE, SERIOUSLY, TAKING A BITE 
   OF THAT--THAT'S DELICIOUS.   

239
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,865
WE'RE GONNA GO 18 OUNCES.       

240
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,601
AND THEN BALL 'EM UP?           
SO YOU ROLL 'EM OVER,           

241
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,136
MAKE IT NICE AND CLEAN          
ON TOP, SPACE 'EM OUT.          

242
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,472
AND SO WE JUST SIT HERE AND JUST
    KNOCK THESE OUT ALL DAY.    

243
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,741
              YOU LET 'EM PROOF 
             A LITTLE BIT MORE, 

244
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,943
     THEN YOU START TO MAKE PIES
              OUT OF IT.        
CORRECT. SO AFTER PROOF,        
    PUT ON THE FLOUR.           

245
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:42,146
          SO THAT'S HOW I DO IT.
         I COME AROUND THE EDGE.
GO AROUND ONE TIME,             
BACK TO THE MIDDLE.             

246
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:45,283
AND THEN I JUST                 
 KINDA, LIKE--                  
               NOW THIS IS      
         WHERE THE PARTY STARTS.

247
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,418
AND THEN I--                    
             IS THAT YOUR STYLE?

248
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:48,687
YEAH.                           
                         REALLY?

249
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,822
YOU AN THROW 'EM                
 IN THE AIR...                  
                        WHOA-HO!

250
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,557
A LITTLE BIT MORE.              
   SEE THE BACK OF THE HAND? I'M
  NOT EVEN GONNA PLAY THIS GAME.

251
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,227
     I CAN THROW IT, BUT NOT 18,
          AND NOT THAT WAY,     

252
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,696
    NOT WITH THE--MY BLING WILL 
   SNAG IT. THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL. 

253
00:09:58,798 --> 00:09:59,964
AND WE'RE ALL SET               
 WITH THIS ONE.                 

254
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,567
                  SO WHAT ARE WE
                    GONNA MAKE? 
A CAPONE...                     

255
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,636
       THE CAPONE IS GREAT      
    IF YOU'RE REALLY HUNGRY.    

256
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,637
A MEAT-LOVER PIZZA.             
       AND IT IS SO GOOD.       

257
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,706
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.               
                  LET ME SEE    
              HOW I CAN MAKE IT.

258
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,441
            I RUN MY SAUCE HEAVY
               TO THE OUTSIDE,  

259
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,844
          BECAUSE OF THE THEORY 
        THAT THE PIZZA COMES UP,

260
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,245
DROP BACK ON IT.                
              WHAT DO YOU THINK?

261
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:17,515
JUST FILL OUT AN APPLICATION.   
   WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES.       
            SO THERE'S A FUTURE.

262
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,784
           NOW ARE YOU GRATING  
        THE MOZZARELLA YOURSELF?
YEAH.                           

263
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,520
SAUSAGE, PEPPERONI.             
      OKAY, SO A LITTLE MEATBALL
              GOES DOWN?        

264
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,522
USUALLY A COMBO MEATBALL,       
AND WE JUST GRIND IT DOWN.      

265
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:27,125
     LOOK AT THE SAUCE PLACEMENT
           ON THAT PIZZA.       

266
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,794
    LET'S SEE                   
HOW IT COMES OUT.               
                WHAT DO YOU HAVE
               YOUR OVEN SET AT?

267
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,597
525-550.                        
                  THERE YOU GO--
                   SMOKIN' HOT. 

268
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,333
          LOOK AT THAT BAD BOY. 

269
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,868
              MMM.              

270
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,605
THIS IS REALLY GREAT PIZZA.     
    THAT'S RIDICULOUS.          

271
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,675
WORK ON THAT CRUST A LITTLE BIT 
 TO GET A PIECE OFF OF THERE.   

272
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,677
OH! YOU'RE COOKIN' IT           
   IN A HOT OVEN--              

273
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,812
      THAT'S THE WAY            
TO ROCK 'N' ROLL WITH THIS.     

274
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,015
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GREAT           
  ABOUT THIS PIZZA?             

275
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,550
IT HAS THE RIGHT AMOUNT         
   OF SAUCE UP HERE.            
                     AH, NO WAY!

276
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,019
I'M A MEAT LOVER. WHEN YOU TASTE
  THE MEAT, IT'S JUST PERFECT.  

277
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:58,356
IT'S ONE OF THE BEST PIZZAS     
      THEY HAVE HERE.           
      (woman) SLICE IS UP.      

278
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,892
 THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT TYPES
   OF PIZZA THAT YOU CAN HAVE.  

279
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,496
 TOMATO-BASIL                   
IS REALLY GOOD.                 
                   ONE SAUSAGE  
                AND BELL PEPPER.

280
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,364
         THE MONA LISA--        
        IT'S REALLY GOOD.       

281
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,633
WE'RE GONNA MAKE A MONA LISA.   
  IT'S SAUSAGE, PEPPERONI,      

282
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:11,569
MUSHROOMS, ONIONS, PEPPER       
    AND BLACK OLIVES.           

283
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:15,073
                  LOOK AT THAT! 
                A LITTLE CURL...

284
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,910
    MMM, THIS IS                
SOME OF THE BEST PIE.           
                   THAT'S RIGHT.

I'M MOVING IN YOUR HOUSE.

288
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,788
       EVERYONE LOVES THE PIZZA.
I THINK THE SAUCE               
 IS EVERYTHING.                 

289
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,457
      YOU CAN TELL THEY PUT     
     A LOT OF WORK INTO IT.

               RED PEPPER FLAKE.

291
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,727
THIS IS GREEK OREGANO.          
               THE GREEK OREGANO
                IS A LOT MILDER 

292
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,796
       THAN THE MEXICAN OREGANO.
MEXICAN.                        

293
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,464
             SALT, BLACK PEPPER.
BLACK PEPPER.                   

294
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:43,401
   GRANULATED GARLIC.           
THIS IS PARMESAN CHEESE.        

295
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,603
I LOVE THIS IDEA.               
          MIX IT UP NICELY.     
    THEN THROW THE BASIL INSIDE.

296
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,671
                  TRY THIS ONE.

 NICE--NICE BRIGHT FLAVOR,      
GOOD TOMATO, GET THE HERBS.     

298
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,744

   EVEN STARTED                 

299
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,213
TO REALLY PULL OUT OF THAT      
BASIL AND THAT OREGANO YET.     

300
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,682
I JUST LOVE

   <i> AND EVEN A BARBECUE SAUCE.</i>

303

      <i> OR NO SAUCE AT ALL.</i>      

304
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,757
  SO THIS ONE                   
IS A WHITE PIE.                 
         IT'S DELICIOUS         
          AND SIMPLE.           

305
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,759
           MOZZARELLA, PARMESAN.
YEAH.                           

306
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,695
   THROW A LITTLE               
FRESH SPINACH ON IT.            

307
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,697
THROW FRESH GARLIC ON IT.       
                 OH, TALK TO ME.

308
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,699
NOW WE GET THE RICOTTA CHEESE-- 
       NICE AND CREAMY,         

309
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,701
AND HERE'S HOW WE DO IT.        
                   LOOK AT THAT.

310
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,769
          WHEN IT COMES OUT,    
       WE'RE GONNA HIT OLIVE OIL

311
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,506
              OR ANYTHING ON IT?
NOPE, JUST THIS.                

312
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,707
         THIS IS HOW YOU PARTY. 
           THAT IS BEAUTIFUL.   

313
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:24,909
      MMM. BITING               
THAT SALTY MOZZARELLA,          

314
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,512
  AND THEN YOU GET A LITTLE BIT 
         OF THE SPINACH.        

315
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,314
BUT THEN YOU BITE               
INTO THE RICOTTA,               

316
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,915

      OH, AWESOME.              

317
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,851
      IT'S THE COMBINATION      
    OF THE CHEESES, I THINK,    

318
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:33,985
  THAT MAKES IT TASTE SO GOOD.  

319
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,855
IF I LIVED IN SAN DIEGO, I WOULD
 HAVE A SIGNATURE ACCOUNT HERE. 

320
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,525
 YOU CAN'T GET PIZZA            
ANYWHERE IN SAN DIEGO           

321
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,526
THAT'S BETTER

                   THAT IS GOOD.

322
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,261

MY FAVORITE PLACE TO COME.      

323
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:45,930

   A LITTLE BIT.                
                    LET ME PLAY.

373
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,048
OKAY, NOT TOO WIDE.             
             'CAUSE IT WON'T FIT
               IN THE MACHINE.  

374
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:47,785
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.              
     TAKE IT.                   
                   LET IT DRAW  
                 THROUGH ITSELF.

375
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:51,189
 AND IT'S A NICE                
THICK PASTA SHEET.              
                     NOW FOLD IT
                    INTO ITSELF.

376
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,057
BACK TO THE PRESS.              

377
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:57,061
CHANGE THE NOTCH.               
  PRESS AGAIN.                  
      SEVEN TIMES JUST TO GET US
            TO THIS STAGE.      

378
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,731
      THESE'LL JUST GET A CHANCE
      TO KINDA HANG OUT A BIT...
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

379
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,865
           UNTIL WE'RE ALL DONE,
             AND THEN WE'LL...  
YEP.                            

380
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:05,336
             USE A LITTLE SALTED
                BOILED WATER.   
AND A LITTLE BIT                
 OF OLIVE OIL--                 

381
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,871
GIVE IT ABOUT TWO MINUTES.      

382
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,340
I'M JUST GONNA GREASE           
THE PAN A LITTLE BIT            

383
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,075
WITH SOME BUTTER.               

384
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,676
A LITTLE BIT OF MARINARA.       
         MARINARA THAT YOU MADE.

385
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,746
               LOOK AT THE COLOR
                 ON THAT. MMM.  
GO OVER TO OUR                  
PASTA SHEETS.                   

386
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,748
                   LOOK AT THAT.
LAY IT DOWN IN HERE.            

387
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:19,684
  RIGHT, AND YOU'RE OVERLAPPING,
       BECAUSE THAT HELPS IT    

388
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,885
 STAY TOGETHER WHEN YOU COME OUT
        WITH THE SPATULA.       
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

389
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:24,822
A LITTLE BIT OF SAUCE,          
   PARMESAN FIRST.              
          JUST ADDS A LITTLE BIT
            OF SALTINESS TO IT. 

390
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,825
     THEN I GO                  
FOR THE GROUND BEEF.            
                THE FRESH GROUND
                  THAT YOU DO.  

391
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,694
YES.                            
            A LITTLE GARLIC,    
       A LITTLE SALT AND PEPPER.

392
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,630
PARSLEY, A LITTLE BIT           
 OF THE MOZZARELLA--            

393
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,099
LAY SOME OF THAT DOWN.          
            AND THAT'LL MELT    
        AND SPREAD A LITTLE BIT.

394
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,834
  IT WILL SPREAD OUT.           
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GO         

395
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:39,037
FOR THE RICOTTA CHEESE.         
                 NICE AND LIGHT.

396
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,971
MM-HMM.                         
                 HOW MANY LAYERS
                 IS THIS--THREE?

397
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:43,708
THREE SHOULD WORK.              
           SO WE GO BACK DOWN   
        WITH THE NOODLES, SAUCE,

398
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,710
         PARMESAN, GROUND BEEF, 
          MOZZARELLA, RICOTTA,  

399
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,246
                 AND THEN AGAIN.
AND AGAIN.                      

400
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,715
                 WE BAKE        
          OPEN ON THE TOP LAYER.
       YES, 350                 
FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES.           

401
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:54,251
   FANTASTIC. AHA, LOOK AT THAT.
    SEE THOSE LAYERS IN THERE?  

402
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,920

403
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,989
   THAT'S DELICIOUS--EXACTLY HOW
     IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DONE.  

404
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:00,525
         NOTHING'S POURING OUT. 
         YOU CAN TASTE THE MEAT.

405
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:01,926
         THE RICOTTA STANDS OUT.
MM-HMM.                         

406

 OF THE BEST LASAGNAS THERE ARE.

407

             AUTHENTIC LASAGNA.

427
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:51,843

00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:15,826
  THE ARANCINI--IT'S DELICIOUS. 

463
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,895
      IT'S ALL MELTED TOGETHER  
     AND AMAZING IN THE CENTER. 

464
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:21,432
ARE WE GONNA FRY THESE          
     OR BAKE 'EM?               
          WE ARE GONNA FRY THEM.

465
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,301
AH, MY FAVORITE WORD.           
                          "FRY."

466
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:25,636
NO--"AH."                       

467
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,439
SO LET'S BEGIN THIS.            
                THIS IS ACTUALLY
                  BEEF STOCK.   

468
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,975
1/2 GALLON--AND WE              
 MAKE THAT HERE?                
                     YES, WE DO.

469
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,710
    GONNA WAIT FOR THAT TO BOIL.
WE'RE USING ARBORIO RICE...     

470
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,780
                         MM-HMM.
 WHICH IS A NICE BIG,           
THICK SHORT-GRAIN RICE.         

471
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,782
     MM-HMM, GREAT TO WORK WITH 
         WHEN YOU'RE MAKING     

472
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,784
        SOME KIND OF RICE BALLS,
              EASY TO MOLD.     

473
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,720
                   YOU GIVE THIS
                   A QUICK STIR.
JUST LET THIS SIMMER.           

474
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,788
                   THAT'S RIGHT.
   WHEN ARE WE GONNA            
ADD IN OUR INGREDIENTS?         

475
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,858
   I'M GONNA ADD IN A LITTLE BIT
            OF SEA SALT.        
OKAY, A LITTLE                  
WHITE PEPPER.                   

476
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,927
             SOME WHITE PEPPER, 
           A TEASPOON OF BUTTER.
ALL RIGHT.                      

477
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,729
     WHEN IT'S HALFWAY COOKED...
WE THROW IN THE SAFFRON.        
     LOOK AT THAT.              

478
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,998
                 IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THE SAFFRON CAN'T               
LAST THAT LONG...               

479
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:57,601
                   THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU GOTTA PUT IT IN THERE,      
 LET IT BLOOM AND--BOOM.        

480
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,270
     LET IT BLOOM AND--BOOM.    
 WE'LL LET THAT FINISH COOKING, 

481
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,607
AND THEN WHAT'S                 
 GONNA HAPPEN?                  
              LET IT COOL DOWN  
           FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES.

482
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,676
ALL RIGHT, NOW ARE WE DOING THIS
       TRADITIONAL-STYLE?       

483
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:07,945
YES.                            
                 I'M LEARNIN' IT
                  THE RIGHT WAY?

484
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,481
YES. GRAB SOME RICE THERE--     
    MAKE A LITTLE BALL.         
                         LITTLE?

485
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,349
   NOW WE'RE GOING              
TO PRESS DOWN ON IT,            

486
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:13,884
MAKE, LIKE, A LITTLE WELL       
        IN THERE.               

487
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,087
    MY WELL OF FRIENDSHIP, THIS.
SURE. WE'RE GONNA GRAB          

488
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,888
       A LITTLE BIT             
OF THIS GROUND MEAT MIXTURE     

489
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,624
THAT WE MADE EARLIER.           
         <i> BEEF AND PORK</i>         
  <i> WITH MARINARA AND VEGGIES.</i>   

490
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:22,626
          A LITTLE MOZZARELLA...
MM-HMM.                         

491
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,695
   NOW WE'VE GOTTA BRING THE TOP
      OVER, SO WE KINDA GET--   

492
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,497
RIGHT.                          
             SO THAT GETS BURIED
                IN THE CENTER.  

493
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,499
   THEN YOU'RE GONNA DIP IT     
IN YOUR LITTLE FLOUR AND WATER. 

494
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,434
    THEN INTO THE BREADCRUMBS...
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

495
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,236
    JUST PUTTING A CRUST ON 'EM.
YES.                            

496
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,704
350-DEGREE OIL?                 
                            YES.

497
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,073
 OKAY, AND THEN WE'LL SERVE 'EM 
    WITH A LITTLE BIT OF THIS   

498
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:38,442
 WARM MARINARA                  
OR TOMATO SAUCE.                
         MARINARA SAUCE, MM-HMM.

499
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,977
   JUST TILL THEY'RE            
NICE AND GOLDEN BROWN.          

500
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,780
WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE?          
                   I THINK      
             THAT ONE'S PERFECT.

501
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,716
  OKAY. OH!                     
LOOK AT THAT.                   
                         PRETTY.

502
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,785
THE MELTED MOZZARELLA--         
    IT'S BEAUTIFUL.             

503
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,654
   POUR A LITTLE SAUCE OVER IT. 

504
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:52,723
   MMM! IF I WAS TAUGHT         
HOW TO MAKE THOSE AT HOME,      

505
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,791
I NEVER WOULD'VE LEFT HOME.     

506
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:57,394
  THE RICE HAS GOT A NICE       
LITTLE FIRM CENTER TO IT...     

507
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:01,065
                         MM-HMM.
  BUT A NICE CREAMINESS         
ON THE OUTSIDE. MMM! MMM!       

508
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:04,001
   THAT IS JUST FANTASTIC.      
I LOVE THE PEAS IN THERE, TOO.  
                         MM-HMM.

509
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:07,271
 THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE--WINNER, 
    WINNER, RICE BALL DINNER.   

510
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:08,739
    FIRST THING THAT HITS ME    

511
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,540
        IS THE CRISPINESS       
       OF THE OUTER CRUST.      

512
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,076
THE MEAT AND THE RICE           
 AND THE MOZZARELLA             

513
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,745
ALL BLEND TOGETHER.             
 IT'S REALLY GOOD.              
       ONE MEAT LASAGNA.        

514
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:17,548
      THE BEST HOME-COOKED      
 ITALIAN MEAL YOU'LL EVER HAVE. 

515
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,617
     ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10,     
        I'D GIVE IT A 12.       

516
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,752
              IN THE WORLD      
         OF BALTIMORE ITALIANS, 

517
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,221
                    IS THIS     
                ONE OF THE BEST?
       THIS IS THE BEST.        

518
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,556
(man) I WOULD RECOMMEND IT      
      TO EVERYBODY.             
             IT HAS AN AUTHENTIC
                ITALIAN FEEL.   

519
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,891
LOOK AT THE PORTIONS.           

520
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,560
THEY GIVE YOU THE PORTIONS      
   ON HOW BIG YOU ARE.          
        LOOK HOW--YEAH.         

521
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,562
           IS THAT WHAT YOU DO--
               YOU SCALE IN,    

522
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,632
                   AND THEN THEY
                     SERVE YOU? 
          RIGHT, YEAH!          

523
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,566
         I DON'T COME BACK HERE 
         JUST FOR THE MOZZARELLA

524
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,568
   AND THE PASTA AND THE SAUSAGE
       AND THE WHOLE THING,     

525
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,570
               JUST TO HANG OUT 
               WITH THESE CATS. 

526
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,373
   SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP.  

527
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,707
           BUT WE GOT           
   PLENTY MORE JOINTS TO FIND.  

528
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,577
     I'LL BE LOOKING FOR YOU    
    NEXT TIME ON TRIPLE "D."    

529
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:48,579
TRY IT.                         
            MMM, THAT WAS GREAT.

530
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:50,581
IT'S PRETTY GOOD.               
        I LIKE THE SALT IN THAT.

531
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,117
             WHAT DO YOU THINK? 

532
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,021
                            HEY!
WHOA!
