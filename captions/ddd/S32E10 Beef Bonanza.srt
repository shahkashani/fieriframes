00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,201
           Hey, there.          

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,669
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:06,939
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

4
00:00:06,941 --> 00:00:08,007
          This trip...          

5
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:11,543
      I christen ye knights     
         of Flavortown.         

6
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,745
     ...it's a full-fledged     
         beef bonanza...        

7
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,881
               Hi, food coma.   
               My name's Guy.   

8
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:18,550
      ...like in San Diego      
   where we're taking a dip...  

9
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:20,953
                That's it, baby.
    ...and loafing around...    

10
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:24,423
 That's some of the most tender,
      moist meatloaf I've tried.

11
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:27,492
    ...plus, an El Paso joint   
   cranking out the kebabs...   

12
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:30,161
                 Delicious.     
   I mean, like really dynamite.

13
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,564
 ...and a real-deal Italian spot
         in Delaware...         

14
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,165
            It's like a warm hug
              for your stomach. 

15
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,634
 A little warm hug.             

16
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:38,570
  ...rolling it and stuffing it 
       the old-school way.      

17
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:41,306
It's a secret recipe that       
we've had for a very long time. 

18
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:43,641
              Okay, I will not  
                tell anybody.   
      Okay.                     

19
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,711
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

20
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,247
 on "Diners, Drive-ins & Dives."

00:00:54,254 --> 00:01:00,392

23
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,060
          So, I'm here          
    in Wilmington, Delaware.    

24
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,862
   You got to love coming back  
       to the East Coast.       

25
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,264
I mean, there's so much history,

26
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,065
        and particularly        
       restaurant history.      

27
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,533
     We're here to check out    
         a joint that --        

28
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,002
   Well, it's five generations  

29
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:13,539
  been making handmade raviolis 
        since the 1940s.        

30
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,807
     This is Mrs. Robino's.     

31
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:16,942
     Pork out in the window.    

32
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:18,810
    WOMAN: If you want to get   
      a good Italian meal,      

33
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,145
          you're coming         
        to Mrs. Robino's.       

34
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:21,413
          Spizzato up.          

35
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,615
     We've been coming here     
       for about 50 years.      

36
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,150
             Here you are, T.C. 

37
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:28,486
It's all about eating and family
  and friends getting together. 

38
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,556
             FIERI:             
 That's 'cause at Mrs. Robino's,

39
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:33,225
   it's family that's keeping   
      everything together,      

40
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:36,695
    just ask Andrea Wakefield   
        and Robin Mabrey.       

41
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,229
       Let me get this straight.
                  Sisters?      

42
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,431
Cousins.    Cousins.            

43
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,900
                Mrs. Robino was 
         your great-grandmother.
              Yes.              

44
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,902
               Mrs. Robino was  
              your grandmother. 
Yes, she was.                   

45
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:47,105
            So, your grandmother
                   took over.   
              Yes.              

46
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,574
          Who is her grandmother
                   to you?      

47
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:51,843
        Aunt.                   
                     Got it.    

48
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,312
               I'm still lost.  
        Just play along at home.

49
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,714
     The food is phenomenal.    

50
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,649
       The beef braciole,       
         in particular,         

51
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,052
 is better than I've ever had it
         anywhere else.         

52
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:01,452
               Beef braciole.   

53
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,188
    It's a tender cut of beef   
       that's pounded down      

54
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,522
           to make it           
        even more tender,       

55
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,959
   and it's baked until it is   
     so succulent and juicy.    

56
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:10,395
The sauce itself is probably the
best tomato sauce I've ever had.

57
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:11,396
                  Alright,      
             what are we making?

58
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:12,797
          Our homemade          
        spaghetti sauce.        

59
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,133
    We're gonna be putting it   
      on our beef braciole.     

60
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,736
 It's a secret recipe that we've
    had for a very long time.   

61
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,539
                Okay, I will not
                  tell anybody. 
              Okay.             

62
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,808
    So, we're gonna start out   
 by putting some oil, onions... 

63
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,410
                    Whew!       

64
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,612
           ...garlic.           

65
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,213
              You're gonna put  
         the skins of the garlic

66
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:29,348
            in the tomato sauce?
              Yes.              

67
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,415
                Are we gonna    
              puree this later? 

68
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,617
     We're gonna strain it.     

69
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:32,884
     You don't need to sit there
        and have one of the kids

70
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,285
                 peeling this   
               all the way down.
            Exactly.            

71
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,020
                 I've cooked    
              my entire life... 

72
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,222
         Never saw that?        
             ...never seen this.

73
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,356
       Well, there you go.      

74
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,625
          So, these are         
         the neck bones.        

75
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:42,026
           Neck bone's connected
             to the...rib bone. 

76
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,562
            Is that how it went?

77
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,096
          Pork fatback.         
                   Pork fatback.

78
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,498
       This is gonna cook       
    and let it sit overnight.   

79
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,235
This is your great-grandmother's
           recipe from the '40s.
              Yep.              

80
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:52,371
      That's about as old-school
             as it gets, right? 

81
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:55,106
     So, what we have to do     
    is transfer this to here.   

82
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,775
    That's what I was hoping    
  you were gonna help me with.  

83
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,643
     You see how she stood there
  and just kind of waited for me

84
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,313
                to figure out   
     that I was picking this up?

85
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:02,714
         You want to do         
         the messy part?        

86
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:05,050
             If it's the pouring
  the sauce part, I'm back here.

87
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,718
              Oh, you made that 
                 easy-peasy.    

88
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,054
       Now we're gonna go       
         with our paste.        

89
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,056
             When are we putting
                the basil in?   
           Right now.           

90
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:14,526
    And we're gonna cook this   
six to eight hours, stirring it.

91
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,060
                  What are      
               we making next?  

92
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,729
        We're gonna make        
       the beef braciole.       

93
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:18,864
     This is a top sirloin.     

94
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,133
We're going to start            
 by pounding it out.            

95
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:22,801
                 Beautiful.     
   Thank you.                   

96
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:26,204
Parsley, garlic, salt,          
Parmigiano-Reggiano.            

97
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,739
                    Okay.       
Cracked pepper.                 

98
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,942
We're gonna roll this baby up.  
This is how my grandmother      

99
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:31,343
    always had it               
with the toothpicks.            

100
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:34,146
A little more black pepper,     
    a little oil.               

101
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:35,814
   Just roast just              
 till it gets brown,            

102
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,682
and then we're gonna top it     
 with our red sauce             

103
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,285
and braise it in the oven       
for about three hours.          

104
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,420
               I'm salivating.  

105
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:42,954
    Then we have                
   the spaghetti.               

106
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,689
         This is homemade pasta?
Yes, it is.                     

107
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,092
  Red sauce on top,             
 and there you are.             

108
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,760
            This is how you know
      it's done the right way --

109
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,829
               with the fork.   
              No knife needed.

                   Crazy.

115
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:05,043
      I've had five or six bites
                here already.

           got to be ridiculous.

118
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:10,248
Oh, it's crazy. Every person    
leaves with a to-go box.        

119
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,584

121
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,453

          The bread's fantastic.

322
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,289
           The jus is luxurious.

323
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,358
       You get all that nice fat
                that's coming   

324
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,361
              from the braising 
              of the short rib. 

325
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:06,430
Little touch of the red wine and
   then melted Gruyère on top --

326
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,165
         It's all the components
              of what you want  

327
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,633
             a great French dip 
                   to be.       

328
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,302
              That's it, baby.  

329
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,037
             SERVER:            
      Short rib French dip.     

330
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,705
  The French dip is incredible. 

331
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,776
        The short rib is        
    packed with flavor. Mmm.    

332
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:19,577
           Was that a food moan?
                    Okay.       

333
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:22,247
         This is my buddy Lonie,
             who's a three-time 

334
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:24,048
              Super Bowl champ  
             with the Patriots. 

335
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,183
              What do you think 
                 of the dip?    

336
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,851
 Amazing. Huge fan.             
  I'm all about --              

337
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:27,919
              Well, thank you,  
             but I'm right here.

338
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:28,987
 I'm all about dips.            

339
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,521
        If you watch "Triple D,"
               you understand   

340
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,390
               that we've got   
              multiple cameras. 

341
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,259
              Lonie hooks us up 
              with the GoPros.  

342
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,461
    We don't have the mouth cam,
              by the way, yet.  

343
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:37,795
    Well, I just                
 gave you one, so...            

344
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,530
           Yeah, so, now I'll be
          wearing the mouth cam.

345
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,799
                I don't know    
            how to chew with it.

346
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,133
       Shrimp and polenta.      

347
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:45,003
      This is our favorite      
       family restaurant.       

348
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,272
   There's a lot of diversity,  
   a lot of different flavor.   

349
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:48,806
      MAN: If you come here     
    for breakfast or brunch,    

350
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,542
         the chilaquiles        
     are definitely a must.     

351
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:51,675
        How's                   
  the French onion?             

352
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,077
           Delicious.           
        It's my favorite.       

353
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,012
I'm a French onion junkie.      
Favorite thing on the menu?     

354
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,013
                    Meatloaf.   
       Really?                  

355
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,615
                       Yeah.    
         Meatloaf ready         
            to plate.           

356
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,150
              MAN:              
It's not a traditional meatloaf.

357
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,585
        The glaze on here       
       is just excellent.       

358
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,422
   That little pop of flavor,   
        wrapped in bacon.       

359
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,157
      Just crazy wonderful.     

360
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,492
   Jo's meatloaf.               

361
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,761
California grass-fed            
    ground beef.                
                     Got it.    

362
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:12,097
 Some diced pasilla             
   chili peppers.               

363
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,431
      Pasillas                  
 aren't very spicy.             

364
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:14,766
      They add                  
a really nice flavor.           

365
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,100
  Italian parsley.              

366
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,368
      And then                  
  Pecorino cheese.              

367
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,771
      This is a very interesting
         meatloaf at this stage.

368
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,173
Panko breadcrumbs...            
       eggs...                  

369
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,241
                  Whole milk.   
A little salt and pepper.       

370
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,377
                  How much      
           Worcestershire, Chef?
About a tablespoon.             

371
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,379
               I like the way   
           this is going so far.

372
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,515
 Mold the meatloaf,             
     pop it out.                

373
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:33,184
We've already got our           
applewood-smoked bacon laid out.

374
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,587
Pull up the ends.               
                This is when    
             the magic happens. 

375
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,855
  Flip it over into             
 the perforated pan.            

376
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,123
           It's like you've done
                that before.    

377
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,858
   For the glaze,               
    you've got...               
                     Ketchup.   

378
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,394
...ketchup, brown sugar,        
    dry mustard.                

379
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,063
                 Hot sauce.     
We're gonna glaze it.           

380
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:47,131
               So, we cook it.  
It's gonna be portioned.        

381
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,534
Pop it back in the oven         
for about 12 to 15 minutes.     

382
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:51,402
               Now we're into.  
Demi-glace.                     

383
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:54,272
We've got beef stock, red wine, 
  and tomato paste.             

384
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,208
 Thyme, peppercorn,             
bay leaves, red onions.         

385
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,277
Bring it to a boil, strain it,  
let it reduce about half.       

386
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,147
        And then a little slurry
              to tighten it up. 

387
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,948
     Good to go.                
           The meatloaf is down.

388
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,151
Do a quick sear on both sides,  
   and then we got              

389
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:09,420
our garlic Yukon mashed         
potatoes, French green beans,   

390
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,755
   country gravy,               
and then our beef demi.         

391
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:15,492
       For most diners, it's not
 like 80 steps to make meatloaf.

392
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:19,697
                     ♪♪         

393
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,299
         It's fantastic.        

394
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,502
That's some of the moist tender,
      moist meatloaf I've tried.

395
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:28,906
 This is my first time that I've
ever had pasillas in a meatloaf.

396
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,775
            Between the Pecorino
              and the pasilla,  

397
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,110
               this has a ton   
               of personality.  

398
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,646
         It's like its own style
                of meatloaf.    

399
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,648
 The demi is a nice little kiss,
         but the real star of it

400
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,118
                is that sauce   
 that you glazed on the outside.

401
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,721
  I mean, then you go into extra
   innings adding in this gravy.

402
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,924
  The mashed potatoes are great.
       Green beans are on point.

403
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:49,727
               You masked your  
            French bistro energy

404
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:52,664
       into this American staple
                really well.    
Thank you.                      

405
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,865
             You can take a man 
             out of the bistro, 

406
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,066
     but you can't take a bistro
               out of the man.  

407
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,736
       I got the meatloafs      
    for you guys right here.    

408
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,405
    It's extremely flavorful.   

409
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:03,140
   The sauce that they put on   
 top of it is just so delicious.

410
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:06,544
     It's got a smoky taste     
         from the bacon.        

411
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,346
                  I grew up     
         with my mom's meatloaf,

412
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,348
            but then I came here
       and fell in love with it.

413
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,883
    So, Mom takes               
 second fiddle now?             

414
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,418
                     Yeah.      
        Okay.                   

415
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,953
      Steak frites, pickup.     

416
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,688
       I love coming here.      
          It's amazing.         

417
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,222
  I'll be back many more times. 

418
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,556
             You nailed it, man.

419
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:20,858
              You've made this  
           a contemporary diner.

420
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,160
                 So, you get    
           the comforts of home,

421
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,427
               get the things   
                that you love   

422
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,429
           at the culinary level
      that you're accustomed to.

423
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,498
   Appreciate it.               
               Jo...Ric...      

424
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,434
             Brother Bleu Diner.

425
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:31,769
              Pbht. Who knows.  
               Come meet him.   

426
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,439
              You'll like him,  
           whatever his name is.

   a Persian place in El Paso   

428
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:39,444
      full of surprises...      
             This, I got to see.

429
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:40,778
             ...from            
       their mechanics...       

430
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,112
          I don't know what part
                not to touch.   

431
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,514
           I might get something
              caught in there.  

432
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:44,716
       ...to the recipes.       

433
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,050
         I've never heard of it,
             I've never seen it,

434
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,185
          and I would definitely
                eat it again.

436
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,227
     You know how they say,     
 "It's always bigger in Texas"? 

437
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,896
 I think they should say, "It's 
 like, always ethnic in Texas." 

438
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,699
      I mean, I have found      
 some of my favorite "Triple D" 

439

      in this great state.      

440
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,571
So, I'm not surprised to be down
        here at El Paso,        

441
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,240
       just a couple miles      
   from New Mexico and Mexico,  

442
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,642
    and I'm here to check out   
      a Persian restaurant      

443
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,112
   where they're making these   
 kebabs with this crazy machine.

444
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,914
      This is Tasty Kabob.      

445
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,182
I'm plating Ghaimeh.            

446
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:20,518
     This is very authentic     
          Persian food.         

447
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,720
       -Chicken koobideh.       
       -It's very healthy.      

448
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:23,988
            It's very flavorful.

449
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,456
It's good. It's good.           
     It's good.                 

450
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,791
   WOMAN: We don't have a lot   
   of Persian food in El Paso,  

451
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,660
   so we like the originality.  

452
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,196
     FIERI: And that new mix    
       in a sea of Tex-Mex      

453
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:34,198

       Hendry's homeland.       

454
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,933
             Where are you from 
                 originally?    
      Iran.                     

455
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,335
       So, is this Iranian food?
    Persian.                    

456
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,404
         To someone that's never
              had Persian food, 

457
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,139
             how do you describe
            what it tastes like?

458
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,875
   It's not spicy               
and very simple, you know,      

459
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,077
salt, pepper, lemony.           

460
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,679
               A lot of rice?   
  A lot of rice.                

461
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,683
    I really like the spices,   
        the herbal notes.       

462
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:53,417
      What's your favorite thing
                on the menu?    

463
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,685
 The beef koobideh.             

464
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:55,819
   Beef koobideh.               

465
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,422
   It's just ground beef mixed  
           with spices          

466
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:59,556
     and mixed with onions,     
       cooked on a skewer.      

467
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,160
It's tender, and it's delicious.

468
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,761
              What are we gonna 
                 make first?    
Beef koobideh.                  

469
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:04,895
             Okay, let's start. 

470
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,632
  This is the meat.             
              80% meat, 20% fat.

471
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,301
Beef, I run them twice,         
 and the third time,            

472
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,169
      the onion                 
   is gonna go in.              

473
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:15,173
And now we just season it       
with salt, cayenne pepper,      

474
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,108
 but it's not spicy.            
We don't make it spicy.         

475
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,643
               So, we form it   
               onto the kebab.  

476
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,112
 We can do by hands,            
but we do have a machine.       

477
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:24,048
               I've never seen  
    a ground-beef kebab machine.

478
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,316
       This is                  
 the kebab machine.             

479
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,851
          I don't know what part
                not to touch.   

480
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,386
           I might get something
              caught in there.  

481
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,454
                Put the meat    
                 in the top.    

482
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,389
You want to just feed           
   the skewer in.               

483
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,457
             Ta-da!             
                   There you go.

484
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,327
           So, it just          
     compresses it on there.    

485
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,462
                    Yes.        

486
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,397
     Well, it's a lot sexier    
        that way than you       

487
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,331
        and I cramping it       
    on there with our hands.    

488
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,869
      I christen ye knights     
         of Flavortown.         

489
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,671
     Let us take the castle.    

490
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,474
              We will finish it 
            on the charred grill

491
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,275
                  for five      
              to seven minutes. 

492
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,543
         Now what are we making?

493
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,411
  We are gonna make             
 some basmati rice.             

494
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,547
            It's already cooked.
Yeah, it's half cooked.         

495
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:57,748
You're gonna steam it.          

496
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,616
Water, vegetable oil.           

497
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,618
          So, it's gonna make it
     a little crispy down there?

498
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,421
        Yes.                    
 We call it tahdig.             

499
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,423
                   Tahdig.      
              A little saffron. 

500
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:07,091
 Plain white yogurt.            

501
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:10,494
The first five minutes, we want 
to have it on high heat...      

502
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,763
                    Right.      
...so they're crispy            
   at the bottom,               

503
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,699
and then we lower down          
  for half an hour.             

504
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,500
               Alright, next?   
   Mast-o-musir.                

505
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,837
Mast is plain yogurt,           
and musir is the shallot.       

506
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,439
                   This is      
              one dry shallot.  

507
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:22,907

     Yes, it is.                

508
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,042
These are from Iran,            
      actually.                 

509
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,310
                  It's like     
               shallot chips.   

510
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,112
             Like playing bones.

511
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:30,781
We soak them couple hours       
and process in a blender,       

512
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,116
and that's what we get.         

513
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,252
    Salt.                       
              That's the sauce  
               for the kebab.   

514
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:35,920
        Yes.                    
 Our rice is ready.             

515
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,321

    some butter.                

516
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:39,724
         A little of the saffron
            that's been bloomed.

517
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,259
  Put it on the top             
    of the rice.

                 the skewer?    

520
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,599
 We put the tomato.

  And there you go.

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,900
The rice is good 'cause it's got
     a little crunch to it,     

536
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,235
             but yet            
       it's tender inside.      

537
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,769
Ready for the next one?         

538
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,372
  MAN #2: I've known Eshi for a 
 while, and she used to feed us,

539
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:31,909
   and I remember just wishing  
 she would open up a restaurant.

540
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,244
               What did you do  
           before you were here?

541
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:36,114
I managed a restaurant,         
actually, for 29 years.         

542
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,849
                  For 29 years? 
        Yes.                    

543
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:40,050
I always want to open           
    my own place.               

544
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,519
     FIERI: And even though     
    she named it Tasty Kabob,   

545
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,922
    it's more than just meat    
        on a skewer here.       

546
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,191
    Here's your ghormeh sabzi   
           with rice.           

547
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:51,329
     Ghormeh sabzi consists     
    of a lot of herbs, beans,   

548
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:52,997
       and a Persian lime.      

549
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,866
 This reminds me of my pot roast
           growing up.          

550
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,535
         It's got meat,         
   but it's in a Persian way.   

551
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,736
            Alright, what are we
              gonna make next?  

552
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:00,738
   Ghormeh sabzi.               

553
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,473
               This is a stew?  
       Yes.                     

554
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:07,879
I put the oil, cilantro, leaf   
fenugreek, spinach, and parsley.

555
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:09,747
      Add some                  
   chopped garlic.              
                      Okay.     

556
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,882
      So, while                 
this one is cooking,            

557
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,152
we're gonna use oil,            
chopped onion, the meat.        

558
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,487
                      Chuck?    
       Yes.                     

559
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,823
  We will season it             
with turmeric and combine.      

560
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,025
               Alright, next?   

561
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:25,229
Salt, pepper, red kidney beans, 
  and this is a --

564
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,567
    No, those are               
    Persian lime.               

565

  Of course.

four to five hours to be ready.
