00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:02,668
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,336
      looking for America's     
        greatest diners,        

3
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:06,605
      drive-ins, and dives.     

4
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:07,740
          This trip...          
                    Get it.     

5
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:09,274
         ...we're eating        
      the extraordinary...      

6
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:11,209
  There is nothing              
I don't love about this.        

7
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:13,345
          ...at places          
   that aren't so ordinary...   

8
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,215
      Every time you're supposed
 to take a right, you went left.

9
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:18,283
     ...like a seafood shack    
          in Cancun...          

10
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,818
   That's exactly               
   what I wanted.               

11
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,420
 ...that's simple in the front, 
     but party in the back.     

12
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:25,357
   It is a funky,               
little, cool hideout.           

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,159
          And check out         
      this Houston spot...      

14
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,426
   That's got all               
my favorite flavors.            

15
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,229
  ...serving a surprising spin  
        on surf and turf.       

16
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,631
 If you put barbecue            
 and sushi together,            

17
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,033
      it better                 
  taste like that.              

18
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:36,635
 ...and a Charlotte beer store, 
      plus wild waffles...      

19
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:37,770
                  Yes, I'll     
               bring one home.  

20
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:40,172
    ...equals a funkalicious    
       find in Flavortown.      

21
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:42,440
                Man, you have   
              rocked the house. 

22
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,376
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

23
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,645
 on "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

24
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:49,581
                     ♪♪         

25
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:59,324
                     ♪♪         

26
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:00,993
  You can't come to Charlotte,  
         North Carolina,        

27
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:03,462
     without coming to NoDa,    
       North of Davidson.       

28
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:05,663
    You know we've been here    
    before -- Cabo Fish Taco.   

29
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:06,932
     Anyhow, I got a really     
        interesting one.        

30
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,333
         See, this guy's        
        got a beer shop.        

31
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,400
        And then he talks       
       to his other buddy,      

32
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,669
 who wants to open a restaurant.

33
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:12,471
  They say, "Great, let's blow  
    a hole through the wall."   

34
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:16,341
 Well, and the rest is history. 
      This is FuD At Salud.     

35
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,043
            McELWEE:            
      Order up. Frambella.      

36
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:19,478
    Absolutely a hidden gem.    

37
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,079
           All right,           
    I have waffles rancheros.   

38
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,347
What's the level of the food    
  in your opinion?              

39
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,349
                 Holy smoke.    
        This stuff's incredible.

40
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,284
              And it's unique.  

41
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:27,018
       Michelle O'Banh Mi,      
          table three.          

42
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,021
      Jeff is creating big,     
  brilliant things back there.  

43
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,423
   That's owner Jeff McElwee,   

44
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,825
       who's making up for      
    a lack of formal training   

45
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,762
   with loads of imagination.   

46
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,897
            Were you always like
    this as a kid -- inquisitive

47
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,566
  and just doing things your way
       and making things happen?

48
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:42,467
        Yeah.                   

49
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,569
   So, when buddy Jason Glunt   

50
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,771
    was looking to serve food   
       at his bottle shop,      

51
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,439
       Jeff could picture       
        the opportunity.        

52
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,441
     He saw somewhere doing     
peanut butter-and-jelly waffles.

53
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,044
  Like, "That's kind of boring. 
    Let's get weird with it."   

54
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:54,113
        Four waffles up.        
    Four waffles going down.    

55
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,181
 FIERI: So, now he's serving up 
          a whole line          

56
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,049
   of wild waffle sandwiches.   

57
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,118
       You're Killin' Me,       
            S'Mores.            

58
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,520
              Okay, what are we 
                making, dude?   

59
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:02,921
All right. So, making           
our homemade waffle batter.     

60
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:05,257
It's for the You're Killin'     
Me S'Mores waffle-wich.         

61
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:06,524
                Waffle batter   
              with egg whites?  

62
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:07,726
     Damn right.                
      Meringue.                 

63
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,127
                   Get it.      
  Oh, yeah.                     

64
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,063
    We start off                
with egg yolks, sugar.          

65
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,664
And we're gonna beat            
 enough air into it             

66
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,534
 that it's gonna go             
from yellow to bright white.    

67
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,335
We're gonna add our butter      
    nice and slow               

68
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,470
    so it doesn't               
  shoot everywhere.             

69
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,138
 Cut the speed down             
    to about two.               

70
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,806
  Grab our vanilla,             
 toss that in there.            

71
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,275
              How many waffles  
               will this make?  

72
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,677
I wouldn't say tons,            
but definitely a lot.           

73
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:26,678
            Right in the middle.
   Yeah.                        

74
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,079
           Leaning towards tons?

75
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,214
 Honestly, I haven't            
looked into it that much.       

76
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,949
                You're gonna    
               have to study.   
All right.                      

77
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,084
So, then we're gonna            
   grab our milk.               

78
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:33,351
     Whole milk.                
 You want that fat.             

79
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,753
    We're tossing               
 our salt in there.             

80
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,421
 Throwing the baking            
  powder in there.              
                      Okay.     

81
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:37,890
     Cornstarch.                
                       What?    

82
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,291
  Well, they called             
   for cake flour.              

83
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:40,892
    Cake flour is               
cornstarch and flour.           

84
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,761
     So, we grab                
  our sifted flour.             

85
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,496
Now we're gonna beat it         
  till it's smooth.             

86
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,833
 So, now we're gonna            
add our batter mixture          

87
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:48,834
 into our meringue,             

88
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,769
and then just fold it in        
  till it's smooth.             

89
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:51,769
                Nice folding.   

90
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:52,771
    Thanks, man.                
Thanks for noticing.            

91
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,173
         The waffle maker's hot.

92
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:55,707
       Cook it                  
 for three minutes.             

93
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:56,975
                 Next step?     
Making the marshmallows.        

94
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,843
               If you're gonna  
           sell s'mores indoors,

95
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,712
               you got to make  
              the marshmallows. 
For sures.                      

96
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,714
               For sures when   
           the s'more's indoors.
  Yeah.                         

97
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:04,583
      Start off                 
with water, gelatin.            

98
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:05,917
                   Got it.      

99
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,185
While that's mixing,            
  we're gonna start             

100
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,254
adding our ingredients          
  to our saucepan.              

101
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:12,391
 Water. Corn syrup.             
        Salt.                   

102
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:13,725
    Finally --                  
       Copious amounts of sugar.

103
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,394
Yeah, that's copious.           

104
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,528
Once this guy gets boiling,     
we're gonna transfer it.        

105
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,130
Add it nice and slow.           

106
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,401
  It's 240 degrees,             
and it will hurt pretty good.   

107
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:23,468
               Mix, mix, mix?   
    Yeah.                       

108
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,602
About 10 minutes into it,       

109
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:25,937
we're gonna add our vanilla     
 to give it flavor.             

110
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,405
                      Right.    
  Then, from there,             

111
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,674
  we're just gonna              
   keep beating it              

112
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,008
till it's bright white.         

113
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,944
I've made a lot of things,      
but this is a first.            

114
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,480
All right, we'll transfer it    
to a big plastic pan.           

115
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,616
And you got to line it          
with a ton of powdered sugar    

116
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:38,950
or it's gonna stick like crazy. 

117
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,218
       As high                  
as you can pour them.           

118
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,154
  That is just pure             
liquid gold marshmallow.        

119
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,556
              Crazy. So, we'll  
              let this set up.  

120
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,359
        Yeah.                   
I'm gonna dust the top.         

121
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:48,426
                   Just so      
        it doesn't stick to you.

122
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,560
     Four inches                
  by four inches --             

123
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,562
 That's kind of what            
  we're going for.              

124
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:51,697
               Gotcha. Gotcha.  

125
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,699
  Mallows are cut.              

126
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:55,100
  We're good to go.             

127
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,835
Now we're gonna start           
building our sandwich.          

128
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,438
Graham-cracker crumbs.          
              Oh, filling it up.

129
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,772
  Chocolate sauce.              

130
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,507
Gonna fill all them nooks.      

131
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,777
Now we're gonna grab one of our 
lovely homemade marshmallows.   

132
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,046
 Now's the fun part.            

133
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,048
 You can say brûlée,            
 but I'm not a chef,            

134
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,050
so I'm gonna burn it.           
                  That is crazy.

135
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,519
     Top it with                
 our second waffle.             

136
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,120
              You are whacked.  

137
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,790
Got to have fun with food.      
 Get weird with it.             

138
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,926
              I am so impressed 
       with the creativity, man.

139
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,727
          Ryder is going banan--

140
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,262
                  Yes, I'll     
               bring one home.  

141
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,596
                Look at that.   

142
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,534
              Dude, it is like  
             a gigantic s'more. 

143
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,103
                Really crazy.   

144
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,806
             The toasting of it,

145
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,876
           the caramelization of
 the marshmallow with the torch,

146
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,144
                  that was      
              the game changer. 

147
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,879
              Graham crackers,  
        got to have it in there.

148
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,281
           You need that flavor.
    Don't mess with your batter,

149
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,349
               'cause you have  
              that locked down. 

150
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,618
                 Well done.     

151
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,486
         You are out of control.
                Outstanding.    

152
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,755
             WOMAN:             
   You're Killin' Me S'Mores.   

153
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,423
            It does taste really
           like a s'more, right?

154
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,025
             Wowee. Phenomenal. 

155
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,827
        It brings me back       
         to being a kid.        

156
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,363
 So, these two don't            
need an introduction,           

157
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,564
      but I'll                  
  just remind you.              

158
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:02,234
  Panini Pete, Greg             
from Pinky's and Penguin.       

159
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:03,635
  Both of you make              
really creative food.           

160
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,837
 Tell me about this.            
          Homemade marshmallows,

161
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,372
               and the dust on  
             the graham crackers

162
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,307
        instead of the chunks --
                perfect, man.   

163
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,642
   I wouldn't change a thing,   
   except my hands are sticky.  

164
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,977
                 [ Laughs ]     

165
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,515
 The food is a perfect marriage 
      with the bottle shop.     

166
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,850
We have over 550 beers.         
We brew our own beer, too.      

167
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,719
         You brew your own beer?
    Yeah.                       

168
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,054
           Can I buy a beer here
             and eat over there?

169
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,256
     Yeah, yeah.                
 It's all the same.             

170
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:25,257
             Can I eat over here
           and buy a beer there?

171
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,591
            McELWEE:            
  Yeah, whatever you want, man. 

172
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,393
  FIERI: Well, whatever you do, 
      you got to save room.     

173
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,795
    'Cause when we come back,   

174
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:32,130
       Jeff's getting down      
     with the Funky Chicken.    

175
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,998
 MAN: I guarantee if you get the
  chicken-and-waffles sandwich, 

176
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,800
 you will not get anything else.

177
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,002
   FIERI: See you in a minute.  

178
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,810
      FIERI: "Triple D" is      
  chilling out at FuD At Salud  

179
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,278
  in Charlotte, North Carolina, 

180
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,613
    which, I got to tell you,   
    isn't your typical setup.   

181
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,548
            McELWEE:            
    Firing out four waffles.    

182
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,952
 FIERI: It's Chef Jeff slinging 
      his waffle-world menu     

183
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,621
   in the middle of his buddy   
       Jason's beer store.      

184
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:57,889
We are limited, you know.       
We don't have a hood.           

185
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,091
We don't have a grill.          

186
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:00,158
     McELWEE: Yeah, it's all    
       electric equipment.      

187
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,559
 So, we've got to be            
  really creative.              

188
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,227
      FIERI: And that means     
      putting a crazy twist     

189
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,763
    on this Southern staple.    

190
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:06,097
             WOMAN:             
  I got a Chicken and Waffles.  

191
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,567
It's not your normal            
chicken and waffles.            

192
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:09,835
               We're not doing  
               fried chicken,   

193
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,235
    'cause you don't have a hood
                and the fryer   

194
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,904
          and the whole giddyup.
No, it's chicken salad.         

195
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,439
                Chicken salad   
                and waffles.    

196
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,773
    Chicken salad               
    and waffles.                

197
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,108
    Sounds weird?               

198
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,376
 We sold three times            
  as many of those              

199
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,578
  as anything else              
    on the menu.                

200
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,579
                 Seriously?     
     Yeah.                      

201
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,113
   We're gonna pop              
this can of chicken open.       

202
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,515
              Chicken in a can, 
                    dude?       

203
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:24,716
              I don't even know 
            what's gonna happen.

204
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,218
Well, doves fly out,            
first, when we open it.         

205
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,586
   So, we're gonna              
  drain the juice,              

206
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,655
'cause we want this chicken     
salad to be flavorful,          

207
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:33,525
but we don't want it            
to be watery and gross.         

208
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:36,661
  Plop it in a pan.             
We're gonna add our mayo.       

209
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,063
 A couple of shakes             
  of black pepper.              

210
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:42,200
And then you're gonna           
    get in there.               

211
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:43,668
     Next step,                 
candying some walnuts.          

212
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,936
The butter's melted.            
                        Okay.   

213
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,604
   And we're gonna              
  add our walnuts.              

214
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,607
  Stir them up till             
they're nice and coated.        

215
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,544
And then add our sugar.         
Combine them together.          

216
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,145
 You don't want them            
to caramelize or get burnt      

217
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,480
or anything like that.          

218
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,081
               Okay, let's go.  
          Let's make the waffle.
All right.                      

219
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,217
We're gonna start off

00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,534
                   Sambal,      
           fresh chopped garlic,

332
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,403
               and then we do   
          a Korean chili powder.

333
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:39,871
        And then a little sugar.

334
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:40,939
                We'll put it    
               in the cooler,   

335
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:42,473
            and we'll let it sit
              for another day.  

336
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,808
  Okay, I like it.              

337
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,612
        Now we're gonna cook off
       my bulgogi and my kimchi.

338
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,213
Is this the normal portion      
   or is this just              

339
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,149
a lumberjack portion            
'cause Hunter and I are here?   

340
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,951
             I've seen you eat, 
     and I got to make sure I --

341
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,552
    Don't start.                
    Don't start.                

342
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:55,887
              Put a little bit  
               of cheese here.  

343
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,755
         Next comes the bulgogi.

344
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,090
             We're gonna hit it 
              with some kimchi. 

345
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,692
               Distribute it.   

346
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:03,561
         Hit it with spicy mayo,
              little sriracha,  

347
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,897
        then we finish it off --
 nice little pop of green onion.

348
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,700
          Make it nice and sexy.

349
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:11,202
       I wanted that one.       
          Come on, now.         

350
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:14,972
      That is really good.      
That's very good.               

351
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,042
The bulgogi's great,            
 right off the bat.             

352
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,044
The sauce almost candies        
on the outside of it.           

353
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:21,646
The kimchi -- nice, vinegary.   

354
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,314
So, you get the sweet           
    of the beef,                

355
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:24,648
    the sourness                
   of the kimchi,               

356
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,252
    the crunch of               
 the French fries...            

357
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,586
       That sriracha, too.      

358
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:29,987
...and then the extra kick      
from the sriracha, exactly.     

359
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,790
Brother, that's thinking        
outside the box, there.         

360
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:32,923
                Thanks, Guy.    

361
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,258
     AKER: Kimchi fries up!     

362
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,060
      I'm gonna cheese 'em      
 and please 'em and get 'em out.

363
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,463
   The bulgogi here is legit.   
        It's done right.        

364
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,465
              AKER:             
 Ribs and brisket rolls, please.

365
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,734
                 How did you    
              find this place?  

366
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:44,602
  Actually, I was just driving  
    through the lot one day,    

367
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,072
  discovered it, and I've been  
     coming here ever since.    

368
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:48,672
     FIERI: And it's tucked     
        inside a building       

369
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,408
     built for a pizza chain    
          in the '70s.          

370
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,811
              This is vintage.  
Vintage.                        

371
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:55,279
The show is "Diners,            
Drive-Ins & Dives." You...      

372
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,748
               Yeah, we dived.  

373
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,283
                Hey, ballin'    
             on a budget, baby. 

374
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,084
    Hey. Ballin'                
    on a budget.                

375
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,287
  Have chain-link,              
     will party.                

376
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,155
      WOMAN: I've known Ray     
       for quite a while,       

377
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,423
    and everything that comes   
      out of his chef mind      

378
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,092
         turns out to be        
      a really great meal.      

379
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,560
              MAN:              
       Surf-and-turf roll.      

380
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,363
    The surf and turf is what   
      Q-Shi is all about --     

381
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,899
   a portion of barbecue mixed  
   with a little bit of sushi.  

382
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,367
               It's delicious.  

383
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,902
            AKER: We're gonna do
   our surf-and-turf roll, Chef.

384
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,304
Nice big ol' brisket.           

385
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,306
I think this is the state bird  
  in Texas, Hunter.             

386
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:22,507
           I think so.          
      I think you're right.     

387
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,108
                I season mine   
               really simply,   

388
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,110
        with salt, black pepper,
               garlic powder.   

389
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,578
 And how long are we            
gonna leave that on?            

390
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,847
       We're gonna stick this in
  the cooler for about 24 hours,

391
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,715
            and we'll smoke this
             for about 16 hours.

392
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:33,651
                210 degrees.    

393
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,052
All right, here we go.          

394
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,987
     For the surf-and-turf roll,
      we like a nice wide slice.

395
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,590
               Oh, that one --  
                  Oh, yeah.     

396
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,391
                 All right.     

397
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,126
Nice little smoke ring          
       to it.                   

398
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,794
  Good bark. Good.              

399
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,062
          All right, we're gonna
      make our Japanese dressing

400
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,330
          for the surf and turf.

401
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,799
       We have sugar and wasabi.

402
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:50,001
                  Jalapeño.     
               Some cilantro.   

403
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,803
              Put a little bit  
              of salt in there. 

404
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,271
              Some horseradish. 

405
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,739
                 Soy sauce.     

406
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:55,940
             Sweet chili sauce. 

407
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,742
Sriracha?                       
                  Sriracha.     

408
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:00,611
                 Lime juice.    
             Some water. Mirin. 

409
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,879
             And the last thing 
              we're gonna do is 

410
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,148
           just put a little bit
          of sesame oil in here.

411
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,149
        Ohh.                    

412
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,483
              See, that's that  
               Georgia thing.   

413
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,585
                   "Ohh."       
    Ohh.                        

414
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:12,824
   That's got all               
my favorite flavors.            

415
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,358
              Mmm!              
         Wasabi all day.        

416
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,493
   Now we're gonna              
   make this roll?              

417
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,295
                Sushi chef's    
               doing the roll.  

418
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,696
  All right, Chef,              
    take it away.               

419
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:20,631
                    Rice.       
              Press it evenly.  

420
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,033
               Then I'm gonna   
                go snow crab.   

421
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,768
               Shrimp tempura.  

422
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,971
You put pieces of avocado.      
       Got it.                  

423
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,639
               And roll it up.  

424
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,976
             The brisket slice. 
This should be interesting.     

425
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,111
              And I'm gonna put 
               some jalapeños.  

426
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,846
          And Japanese dressing.

427
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,115
               That's the one   
                we just made.   

428
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,916
            And sriracha on top.
           They are ready to go.

429
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,118
     And that's                 
   all she wrote.               

430
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,154
                     ♪♪         

431
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:47,258
In sushi, everything's          
got to be in balance.           

432
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,727
So, as soon as you take         
something like smoky beef,      

433
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,729
you got to make sure it doesn't 
take the lead in the show.      

434
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,131
The sauce that we put           
    over the top                

435
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:56,200
really kind of balances         
      that out.                 

436
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,401
       That's really good.      

437
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,069
If you're gonna put barbecue    
 and sushi together,            

438
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,671
   it better taste              
     like that.                 

439
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,474
       The tempura shrimp,
