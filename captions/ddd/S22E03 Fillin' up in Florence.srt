            I tell you, you got 
    to watch out for the bandit.

     FIERI: Up next, a chef     
    who's mixing things up...   

231
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,961
      The term                  
 was "bubbly nice"?             
                    Bubbly nice.

232
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:52,364
       ...and taking local      
      to a whole new level.     

233
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,432
 When you're cooking            
     in here...                 
                       Yeah?    

234
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:55,467
...this is your view.           

235
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:05,810
      So, it is really easy     
    to get lost in Florence.    

236
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,812
      I got to tell you --      
   between the narrow streets   

237
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,947
           and, well,           
    maybe making a wrong turn   

238
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,016
on a one-way street a few times.

239
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,485
        But don't worry.        
       We're finally here.      

240
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:16,021
We're a few blocks away from the
central market to check a joint 

241
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:18,823
   where a son has carried on   
     his parents' tradition     

242
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,492
            and added           
   his own little twist to it.  

243
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,127

[ Speaking Italian ]            

245
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,167
    It's local. It's Tuscan.    
           Delicious.           

246
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,501
       It's just sublime.       

247
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:34,039
               Florentine food  
             is micro-regional.

And for Chef Alessandro Gargani,

250
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,579
        it's a quick walk       
        to the market...        

251
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,847
             This is my garden. 

252
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,983
         ...or stepping         
       out the back door.       

253

You need a fresh herb, you      
just go out there and grab it?  
                      That's it.

254
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:50,254
    This fresh fixation comes   
   from growing up in the biz.

     The food here is great.    

259
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:05,070
     At times, I'm reluctant    
 to try new things -- not here.

     It's my favorite thing.    

262
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,742
                 Okay, Chef.    
             What are we making?

263
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:13,477
We're making the farfalle       
with pistachio pesto.

00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,046
We're gonna do fresh pasta.

                 Fantastic.     
                 Let's go.      

266
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:18,216
We have here semolina flour.

268
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:21,152
  We're gonna make              
a hole in the middle.           

269
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,688

    Salt and oil.               

271

Scramble the eggs inside.

    Can't tell that he's made it
     900,000 times or anything. 

273
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,832
  We're gonna use               
  this magic tool.              

274
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,232
           This is a magic tool?

275
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,969
Yeah, because it helps you      
not get your hands so messy.    

276
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,272
  But now it's time             
    to get messy.               

277
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,741

 This little guy --             

278
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,910
We're gonna put to rest         
   for 30 minutes.              

279
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:49,246
        Wrap it in some plastic?
Wrapped in plastic, yes.        

280
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:52,317
              So, now we've let 
               the dough rest.  

281
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,920
It's time for the pasta dough   
to go through the machine       

282
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,656
  so we can achieve             
a nice, thin sheet dough.       

283
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,991

  that makes fancy.             

287
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,398
Otherwise, you can do           
   something else.              

288
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,734
                "Special tool   
             that makes fancy." 

289
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:13,270
This is a special tool          
that makes it look fancier.     

290
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,472
     And...                     
                        Yay!    

291
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,274
...that's the farfalle.         
              They're beautiful.

292
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:19,210
              It's kind of like 
       tying a bow on a present.

293
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,278
     But we're not pinching them
                 too tight,     

294
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,814
        because then they become
            mushy in the middle 

295
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:25,617
                  and they      
             won't cook through.
 Exactly.                       

296
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:26,684
But now let's make the sauce.   
                           Okay.

297
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,686
 Lime zest, garlic.             

298
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,222
     Fresh mint,                
extra virgin olive oil.         

299
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:35,226
 And now's the rest             
 of the ingredients.            

300
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:38,830
So, you got pistachio,

304
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,308
       Extra virgin olive oil --
        just like a tablespoon. 

305
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,242
                  Nothing.

               Pinch of salt.   

307
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:55,312
     Then we're gonna kick it up
                 with mint.     

308
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,047
 Did you just Emeril            
     this dish?                 

309

                        No.     
    Oh, you did.

You just Emeril'ed it up.       
         I watch it. I watch it.

311

313
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,057
              And then the fire 
    goes on for about 30 seconds

318
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,471
                We just toss    
              the pasta inside. 

319

       Add some cherry tomatoes.

 It's really bright             
and refreshing and unique.

 Love the pistachio.

is exactly how I like it.

I've never had Italian food like
  this in America or in Italy.

 How do you describe            
     this food?                 

333
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:57,508
    WOMAN: Simple and flavorful,
                  elegant.      

334
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,877
Elegant goes in there?          
        Okay.                   
                        Yeah.   

335
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,245
 The atmosphere is sensational. 

336
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,380
                So, what time   
                do you open?    

337
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,182
We open at dinner only.         
                    Dinner only?

338
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:07,652
Yes. For me, it's all about

   WOMAN: You can always find   
       a little something       

341
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,058
          in every dish         
       that's innovative.       

342
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,061
      WOMAN #2: I'm eating      
    the pasta del magnifico.    

343
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,430
   The flavor's just amazing.   
   It's completely unexpected.  

344
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,533
Tagliatelle del "Magnifico"     

345
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,669
is one of the recipes that      
my father was very famous for.  

346
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,539
       Okay. So, now we're gonna
            roll out the pasta. 

347
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,540
                There we go.    
                Look at that.   

348
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,876
       And now                  
we're gonna prepare the sauce   

349
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,544
 that is gonna blow             
  your mind apart.              

350
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,079
             Blow my mind apart.
    Yep.                        

351
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,981
                    Okay.       

352
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:40,284
                  We start      
              with heavy cream. 

353
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,019
                Orange zest.    
                Lemon zest.     

354
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,287
And this is hearty zest.        

355
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,823
 I mean, this isn't             
little, petite zest.            
                           Yes. 

356
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,358
 We're gonna give it            
   to them. Okay.               
                      So, yes.  

357
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,492
                Mint leaves.    

358
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:52,029
      Add a shot of Stravecchio,
               Italian Cognac.  

359
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,033
            Now we're gonna let 
       the sauce reduce to half.
I like this.                    

360
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,035
                 See how now    
              it's bubbly nice? 

361
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,370
      The term                  
 was "bubbly nice"?             
                    Bubbly nice.

362
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:02,039
               We're gonna add  
            the Parmesan cheese.

363
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,908
        Ooh.                    
   Nice and tight.              

364
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,512
                    Pasta       
         is getting translucent.

365
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,314
                      Mmm.      
    Trans-lunchy.               

366
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,048
                    Nice.       
             I love this pasta. 

367
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,985
     Tagliatelle del "Magnifico"
                 are ready.     

368
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,053
                Buon apetito.   

369
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,455
Thank you very much.            

370
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:22,593
      The mint                  
with the orange and lemon --    

371
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,063
 It's reminiscent               
  of a cocktail.

mix your palate up a little     

374
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,269
 and you want to get            
   something rich               

375
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,404
with a lot of flavor            
and a lot of creativity,        

376
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,472
 this is your dish.             

377
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:37,875
I've never had a pasta          
     like that.                 
                     Thank you. 

378
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,679
        It's a new plate.       
  It's different but excellent. 

379
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:45,149
     WOMAN: And a little bit    
 of oranges -- That's the twist.

380
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,617
       And who would have       
        thought of that?        

381
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,419
        This is the place       
      where I bring people      

382
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,821
     when they come to visit    
          from America.         

383
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,489
      The thing                 
I really like the most --       

384
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,491
You're a character, man.        
                     Thank you.

00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,426
You are an experience,          
     my friend.                 
                      Thank you.

386
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,195
You are an experience.          
    Nicely done.                
                         Oh.    

387
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,965
       FIERI: Coming up at      
  our last stop in Florence...  

388
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:01,900
           FIERI: You try first.

00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,100
  We try together.              

390
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,369
           ...a taste           
 of a different Italian city... 

391
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,372
         So, you get this salami
                from Naples?    

392
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:08,906
        Yeah.                   
Everything is from Naples.      

393
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,376
  ...fired up old-school-style. 

394

         for you and everything,

               I got to work.   

396
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:26,124
So, my final leg of this awesome
  "Triple D" tour of Florence,  

397
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,725
            I'm over            
    the Ponte Vecchio Bridge    

398
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,127
 on the older side of Florence. 

399
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,527
     Now, what would you get    
           over here?           

400
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,063
  Well, you got antique shops,  

401
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,931
       you got businesses       
         for the locals,        

402
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,266
         and, of course,        
       I find a pizzeria.       

403
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,734
   And not just any pizzeria.   

404
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:40,605
   I'm talking an old-school,   
 real-deal Neapolitan pizzeria. 

405
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,840
          That's right.         
     This is Il Gusta Pizza.    

406
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,880

          Blew my mind.         

407

 From the minute you walk in the
  door here, it's just amazing. 

408
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,818
It's kind of what you're looking
   for when you come to Italy.

opened their first joint in '04.

414
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,430
    Started with                
  the Gusta Panino.             

415
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:06,497
  We make sandwich.             

416
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,499
     And after,                 
 we do Gusta Pizza.             

417
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,768
We do fresh every time.

That's a lot of salt.

00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,328
              Just two minutes. 

432
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,797
        Okay.

00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,798
 Now we open it up.

     And Caputo.

            It's the best flour.

436
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,837
  It's the best.                
                        Okay.   

437
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,607
Let this go for 25 minutes,     
 and we pull it out.

   Okay.                        
                And leave it    
              for five minutes. 

441
00:16:57,283 --> 00:17:00,884
                 And after,     
   we do the ball for the pizza.

442
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,686
Then we make the pizza.
