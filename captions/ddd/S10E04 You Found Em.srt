121
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:21,859
            IT'S NOT CHILI.     
       IT'S HOT DOG CHILI SAUCE.
YES.

CHILI POWDER, PAPRIKA.          

123
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,731
WE'RE GONNA ADD CUMIN,          
    GARLIC POWDER,              

124
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,466

       ANY SALT GOING INTO THIS?

125
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,401
NO. NO SALT.                    
           NO SALT IN THE CHILI?

126
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,870
   THE WAY WE PREPARE IT WITH   
MUSTARD, ONION, AND THE HOT DOG,

127
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,405
IT EXPLODES IN THE FLAVOR.      

128
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:35,407
        AS A CHILI,             
IT'S NOT THE BEST-TASTING.      

129
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:38,276
    OKAY, SO MIX IT UP, AND THEN
     LOW AND SLOW COOK IT DOWN? 
THAT'S IT.                      

130
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:40,278
FIRST, WE'RE GONNA              
    PUT IN OIL.                 

131
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,080
THEN WE JUST ADD OUR MEAT.      
                          80/20?

132
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,082
YES. PUT SOME ONIONS ON IT.     
    AND WATER. IT'S INTERESTING.

133
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,485
SIMPLE BEAUTY.                  
             MEAT'S COOKED DOWN.
                NOW WHAT'S UP?  

134
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:48,954
WE'LL ADD OUR DRY SPICES

               A LOT OF PAPRIKA,

00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,756

137
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,093
         OKAY, SO LET'S GIVE HER
             A LITTLE TASTE.    

138
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,628
           THAT NEEDS SOME HELP.
        TO MAKE IT              
A LITTLE MORE PALATABLE...      

139
00:04:57,665 --> 00:05:00,365

140
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,834
  AT LEAST WE'RE GONNA GET SOME 
  SUGAR AND SOME SALT IN THERE. 

141
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,903
       JUST ENOUGH TO TAKE      
 A LITTLE BITE OF THE BITE OUT. 

142
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,038
       SO NOW SHE'S READY TO GO?
THAT'S IT.                      

143
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,774
        A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER. 

144
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,776
 STILL COULD USE A LITTLE SALT, 
        BUT YOU SAY THAT        

145
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:12,778
       THAT DOG AND EVERYTHING'S
            GONNA CARRY IT.     
ABSOLUTELY.                     

146
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,579
TIME TO MAKE THE CHILI DOG.     
              LET'S GO, BROTHER.

147
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:16,581
                      ALL RIGHT.
DO WE SKIM THE OIL              
    OFF THAT?                   

148
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,116
                             NO.
ABSOLUTELY NOT!                 

149
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,118
         JOE ALWAYS SAID THAT   
       THAT KEEPS THE FLAVOR IN.

150
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,654
OKAY, HOW DO YOU BUILD ONE?     
       STEAMED BUN?             
                    STEAMED BUN.

151
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,123
              STEAMED DOG.      
        A LITTLE BIT OF MUSTARD.
A LITTLE BIT?                   

152
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,392
        FOR ME, THAT'S A LITTLE.
COMIN' IN HOT--                 
  CHILI SAUCE.                  

153
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,995
CAN SEE THAT OIL                
ON TOP OF THAT.                 
             YES. CHOPPED ONION.

154
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:33,264
   NOW WE CAN DO SHREDDED CHEESE
      ON THERE IF YOU'D LIKE.   
HIT THE CHEESE.                 

155
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,900
                 THAT'S THE DOG.
WOW. ALL RIGHT,                 
  HERE WE GO.                   

156
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,402
IS IT GETTING ON ME?            

157
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:40,004
  I'VE HAD A FEW DOGS IN MY DAY 
    FROM CHICAGO TO NEW YORK.   

158
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:42,006
DID IT ALL RIGHT--BUN'S STEAMED,
         DOG'S GOT SNAP,        

159
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:43,809
 ONIONS ARE DICED               
TO THE RIGHT SIZE.              

160
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,811
   I MEAN, YOU DID              
ALL THE PIECES, MAN.            

161
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,813
WHEN YOU'RE INCORPORATING       
THE SALTINESS OF THE DOG,       

162
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:50,148
 THE BITE OF THE ONION, THE HALF
  GALLON OF MUSTARD YOU PUT ON, 

163
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,150
IF YOU HAD ANY MORE SALT        
  IN THAT CHILI SAUCE,          

164
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:54,552
   IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH.        
THAT'S AUTHENTIC. NICE JOB.     
              CHILI DOG, PLEASE.

165
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:57,088
 I LOVE CHILI. I LOVE HOT DOGS. 
 I LOVE CHEESE. IT'S JUST GOOD. 

166
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,224
         CHILI DOG WITH CHEESE. 

167
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,359
 YOU DON'T WANT TO STOP EATING. 
   IT'S JUST REALLY GOOD FOOD.  

168
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,762
   "POOR BOY," PLEASE, TINA.    
                         COMING.

  JUST GOOD SOUTHERN COOKIN'.   
       SWING IN, GET A BURGER,  
     GET A LITTLE FRIED CHICKEN.

170
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,300
       I NEED EXTRA GRAVY.      

171
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:10,902
  MY FAVORITE THING ON THE MENU 
     IS THEIR FRIED CHICKEN.    

172
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:13,571
     IT'S FRIED PERFECTLY.      
    <i> THE REAL KENTUCKY WAY.</i>     

173
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,573
                PORK LARD--     
          THIS IS THE REAL DEAL.

174
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,709
YES, THE ONLY WAY               
    TO DO IT.                   
                           LARD.

175
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,778
I'M GONNA CUT IT UP FIRST.      
  PUT TWO CUBES IN THERE.       

176
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,315
GET IT PACKED UNDER THE COILS   
     AND WE'LL MELT IT.         
                       (humming)

177
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,317
        (Austrian accent) FIRST 
       HE PUSHES DOWN THE LARD. 

178
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,652
               HE'S WORKING OUT.
AND THEN WE'LL PUT              
THE THIRD ONE IN.               

179
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,721
    (normal voice) 'CAUSE THAT  
   HOT OIL'S GONNA START MELTING

180
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,723
     EVERYTHING ON TOP. KIND OF 
    LIKE THE ICEBERG IS SINKING.
YES.                            

181
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,658
   ALL RIGHT SO THIS GOES DOWN, 

182
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,660
           AND THEN WE CAN START
            DOING SOME CHICKEN. 

183
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,463
                SO THIS         
        IS THE BREADING PROCESS?
     YES. WE'LL PUT             
THE EGGS IN FIRST, SALT.        

184
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,265
                   PEPPER,      
            SEASONING MIXTURE...
YES.                            

185
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,134
NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD MILK.       
                     BUTTERMILK?

186
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,668
JUST REGULAR MILK.              
                   REGULAR MILK?

187
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,270
YES.                            
         YOU'LL BATTER AND DROP.

188
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:48,206
  YOU DON'T LET IT SIT UP FOR 20
  MINUTES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
NO.                             

189
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:51,076
                   LET'S SEE IT.
 DROP IN THE BATTER, MAKE SURE  
THAT YOU HAVE ALL THE GOODNESS. 

190
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,078
DROP IT IN THE FLOUR,           
 STRAIGHT TO FRYER.             

191
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,280
        300-DEGREE OIL--        
 HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO COOK? 

192
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:57,282
WE'LL DROP IT FOR 20.           
 IT'LL BE BEAUTIFUL.            
                        IN LARD.

193
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,284
THAT'S IT.                      
      HOW DOES IT GET SERVED UP?

194
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,619
     PUT IT IN A BOX            
WITH GRAVY, SLAW, A ROLL,       

195
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,621
CHOICE OF FRIES,                
TOTS, OR RINGS.                 

196
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:07,092
 OKAY. IT'S ABOUT               
8 MILLION DEGREES.              

197
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,493
GREAT FLAVOR, NOT TOO HEAVY,    

198
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:11,563
ALMOST REMINDS ME A LITTLE BIT  
OF KIND OF A ROASTED CHICKEN,   

199
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,565
WHERE IT'S GOT A THIN,

           BAKE IT OFF AT 350...
   YEAH.                        

297
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,675
                            FOR?
40 MINUTES.                     

298
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,743
      BRING IT OUT, LET IT COOL.
             LOOK AT THAT.      
MM-HMM.                         

299
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,745
          IT'S LIKE A SPEED BUMP
              IN FLAVOR TOWN.   

300
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,147
      HOW DO YOU JUST KEEP FROM 
     PICKING INTO IT RIGHT NOW? 

301
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,683
IT'S HARD.                      

302
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:54,151
             OH, YOU GOT PEOPLE 
             AT THE FRONT DOOR. 

303
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,953
      (laughs)                  
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.            

304
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:57,955
                     IT'S GREAT.
 I SHOULD HAVE                  
SAW THAT COMING.                

305
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,957
              SO TWO BIG SLICES 
            OVER TO THE FLATTOP.
YEP.                            

306
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:02,493
PUT A LITTLE MARGARINE DOWN,    
    PUT THE MEATLOAF ON--       

307
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,495
ABOUT TWO, THREE MINUTES        
       EACH SIDE.               

308
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,898
               THIS IS THE ART  
            OF "CRUSTIFICATION."
UH-HUH.                         

309
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,833
               AND THEN         
       WHAT DO WE SERVE IT WITH?

310
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,169
MASHED POTATOES, ZUCCHINI,      
        AND SQUASH              

311
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:13,438
AND A LITTLE FRENCH BAGUETTE.   
     IT'S JUST WHAT YOU'D EXPECT
             IN A DINER.        

312
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,173
           THAT'S A BIG PORTION.
YEAH.                           

313
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,641
                         MMM.   

314
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,443
                 I THINK        
         DINERS ACROSS THE WORLD

315
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,445
           HAVE TO TAKE A LESSON
               ON THIS ONE--    

316
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,114
            TENDER, JUICY,      
       GOOD EXTERIOR CRUST--MMM.

317
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,183
  BUT IF THE "CRUNCHIFICATION," 

318
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,584
   THE ADDING THAT EXTRA LAYER, 

319
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,786
         ALL THAT LITTLE CRUNCH 
             ON THE SIDE...     

320
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,321
                         MMM.   

321
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,523
             AND WHY DO YOU EVEN
              MESS UP THE PLATE 

322
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,058
     WITH VEGETABLES AND BREAD? 

323
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:37,061
   I JUST WOULD LIKE A--I'D LIKE
    YOU TO FLOAT THAT IN GRAVY. 

324
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:38,463
       THE MEATLOAF PLATE.      

325
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:41,800
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD--THE SPICES
      AND THE GRAVY ON TOP.     

326
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,536
IT'S VERY SAVORY AND VERY MOIST.
     IT MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH.    

327
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,870
     FILL-YOUR-STOMACH MEAL.

              THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

      FOR 60 YEARS.             

496
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,683
DID IT CHANGE AT ALL?           
              NO.               

497
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,085
NO?                             
     NO, IT REALLY HASN'T.      

498
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,153
     <i> YEP, STILL PACKED...</i>      
COME ON DOWN.

    <i> STILL WORTH THE WAIT...</i>

00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,625
  USUALLY AT LEAST 30 MINUTES.  
       <i> AND STILL RUN BY</i>        
   <i> THE KING OF THE JOINT...</i>    

501

    YOU'RE GONNA GET BUSIER!    

503
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,298
DOUG'S GOT ISSUES, YEAH.        
THAT'S WHY WE LIKE HIM.         

504
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:23,768
          SHORT STACK!          
    I GOT A PICKUP DOWN HERE!   

505
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:27,572
         YOUR 60th ANNIVERSARY--
            NOTHING'S CHANGED.  
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?             

506
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:31,375
           WELL, YOU'VE UPGRADED
                TO iTouch.      
WELL, WE'RE REALLY WITH IT      
  WITH TECHNOLOGY HERE.         

507
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:34,378
                  YEAH, YOU ARE.
  AND WE ENLARGED--WE TOOK      
THE WALL BOARD OFF THAT SIDE.   

508
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,781
IT'S 3/4 OF AN INCH.            
      I DIDN'T NOTICE THE BRICK.

509
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,584
                  COME ON DOWN--
                  EXTRA SEATING.
       <i> THE PAYMENT BOOKS</i>       
        <i> ARE STILL HERE.</i>        

510
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,385
           PEOPLE JUST LAY DOWN 
               THEIR MONEY.     

511
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,187
    YOU START WITH YOUR BALANCE.
YEP.                            

512
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,256
    AND YOU JUST START DOING    
THE DEDUCTION AND THEN ADD MORE.
  YEP.                          

513
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,925
CAREFULLY ALPHABETIZED.         
              NO, I LIKE THE WAY
                 YOU DO IT.     

514
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:51,929
            ANYBODY WILL A BOOK?
LEGACY BOOKS--GOOD IDEA, GUY!   

515
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,665
 I GOT A DELINQUENT FRENCH TOAST
              HERE.             

516
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,601
                        LET ME--
        I ALSO NEED EGGS        
         IN ONE ORDER.          

517
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,536
        DOES HE HAVE A TIARA ON?
YES.                            

518
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:01,805
              IT HASN'T CHANGED.
 <i> AND NEITHER HAVE THE REGULARS</i> 
       <i> LIKE NICK BENSON.</i>       

519
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,542
YOU EAT THE SAME THING          
EVERY TIME, DON'T YOU?          
                     JUST ABOUT.

520
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,544
CAN I PUT MY BREAKFAST          
       ON HERE?                 
                       OH, YEAH.

521
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,480
 YOU'VE BEEN COMING HERE        
PROBABLY LONGER THAN MOST.      
                     SINCE 1959.

522
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,416
   THE PLACE IS A LOT WIDER NOW.
'CAUSE THEY TOOK OFF            
   THE FIBERBOARD               

523
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,552
THAT WAS FALLING DOWN.          
            RIGHT, PAINTED IT   
          WITH A BRIGHTER COLOR.

524
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,554
SO YOU CAN BRING                
A DATE HERE NOW.                
                     WELL, YEAH.

525
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:19,357
    THEY EVEN POURED IN A CEMENT
       FLOOR IN THE BACK ROOM.  
INDOOR PLUMBING?!               

526
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,625
        PLATING THE FOOD        
         FOR THE PEOPLE.        

527
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:24,028
  WHAT MADE YOU COME HERE?      
           JAMES BEARD AWARD    
              OVER THERE.       

528
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:26,030
NICE. THE FAMOUS                
JAMES BEARD AWARD               

529
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,566
    JUST HANGING HERE           
UP NEXT TO THE GODZILLA.        

530
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,901
  IT'S NOT THE PRETTIEST PLACE  
    YOU'RE EVER GONNA EAT AT,   

531
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:34,038
       BUT IT'S GOOD FOOD       
          EVERY TIME.           
SOMEBODY TAKE THIS. I THINK     
  HE ORDERED WHITE TOAST.       

532
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:35,706
                 I NEEDED       
           THAT JOSE YESTERDAY! 

533
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:39,376
       I GET ONE THING--        
       THE SMOKY JOSE...        
             A SMOKY JOSE AGAIN.

534
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,379
    HASH BROWNS, POACHED EGG,   
         SAUCE ON THAT,         

535
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:43,247
            AND THEN            
    THE SMOKY CHEDDAR CHEESE.   

536
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,916
    BEST BREAKFAST IN TOWN.     
SPRING SPECIAL.                 

537
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,917
     PEOPLE ACTUALLY LINE UP    
  AND THEY'LL WAIT FOR AN HOUR. 

538
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:48,852
AN HOUR!                        
     THAT'S NOT TOO BAD, THOUGH.

539
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:50,854
  PEOPLE BEHIND YOU KIND OF     
KICKING YOU AND PRODDING YOU    

540
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:52,856
TO GET OUT OF YOUR WAY.         
           LIKE, "STOP TALKING."

541
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:54,858
         SHUT UP AND EAT        
       SO I CAN SIT DOWN.       

542
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:56,527
                 EAT YOUR LOAD  
               AND HIT THE ROAD!

543
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:59,596
WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY, THE LAST    
THING I WANT TO DO IS WAIT.     

544
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,732
  THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE PLACE  
             TO GO.             

545
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:04,135
           I LOVE IT.           
  IT'S A CHARMING, DUMPY PLACE. 

546
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,404
    <i> OH, HO! WAIT A MINUTE.</i>     
           <i> DUMPY?!</i>             
         GOT A PICK-UP.         

547
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,938
YOU TOLD US LAST TIME...        

548
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:11,008
          WE'RE SORT OF A DUMP  
         ASPIRING TO BE A DIVE. 

549
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,877
EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW. THEY'RE
   ON THE EDGE OF THEIR SEAT.   

550
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,078
       WE'VE BEEN WORKING HARD. 

551
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,614
JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME,        

552
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,683
WOULD YOU CALL THIS PLACE       
    A DUMP OR A DIVE?           

553
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:21,552
                    IT'S A DIVE.
   IT'S A DIVE?                 
ONE VOTE FOR DIVE.              

554
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,086
DUMP OR DIVE?                   

555
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,622
              DEFINITELY A DIVE.
             DIVE.              

556
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:26,023
THAT'S TWO.                     

557
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,492
DUMP OR IS IT NOW A DIVE?       

558
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:32,029
             DIVE<i> EXCEPTIONNEL.</i> 
DIVE<i> EXCEPTIONNEL.</i>              
   THAT'S THREE.
