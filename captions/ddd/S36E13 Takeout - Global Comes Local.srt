00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:02,868
     So when I come off the road
           from doing "Triple D"

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,269
    the first thing I want to do

3
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:07,005
       is get home to my kitchen
 and cook my food for my family.

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,275
        And after a few weeks --
Dad, can we just --             
  I mean, please.               

5
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:13,812
Go to a restaurant              
at least one time.              
           They start to revolt.

6
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,147
      So I came up with an idea,

7
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,549
          how about we reach out
   to some of our favorite chefs

8
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:21,220
                and have them   
            send us dinner, huh?

             Got it.            

230
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,996
                 Soy sauce,     
  sesame oil, green chili paste,

231
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,333
       our local Hawaiian honey,
              gochujang sauce,  

232
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:24,002
             which is the Korean
                chili sauce.    

233
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,136
    Simmer for five, 10 minutes.

234
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,806
    Chef, how are we going to   
     prepare the pork belly?    

235
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:30,675
    Slice about half inch slabs.

236
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,210
            Yep, just like that.

237
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:35,413
        Garlic and ginger can go
         into the sauce as well.

238
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:37,549
  And now I can start throwing  
      this pork belly down?     

239
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,884
          Yeah, we're gonna want
    to get that nice and crispy.

240
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,419
    Now, Chef, tell me about    
         the pork belly.        

241
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,620
      What did you do to it     
          before this?          

242
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,022
         We actually marinate it
                in that sauce   

243
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,291
  that you're making right there
                for 48 hours    

244
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,427
          and then we'll tent it
          and put it in the oven

245
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,963
                   at 325       
           for about four hours,

246
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,665
           drain off the liquid,

247
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,834
     and then back in the fridge
                for 24 hours.   

248
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,235
              Yum!              

249
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,171
           All right,           
so we've got a cooked pork belly

250
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,906
  with a lot of flavor already. 

251
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,975
 Now we're putting a sear to it.
            -Perfect.           

252
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,243
   Kimchi, give me the rundown  
         on making this.        

253
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,579
                That's about    
             a two-week process.

254
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,114
             Take Napa cabbage, 

255
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,582
         brine it in salt water,
                drain it off,   

256
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:16,121
      add a variety of different
     spices, garlic, fish sauce,

257
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:19,991
  and that sits out and ferments
    for about two or three days.

258
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,726
          So what you have there
      is you have four different

259
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,395
               Korean pickles,  
              and those pickles 

260
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:26,331
           will be accouterments
            for your final dish.

261
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,732
     Hey, wait, wait, wait,     
        wait, wait, wait.       

262
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,201
 Don't go international with us 
   with the accouterment talk.  

263
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,336
              Oh, sorry, sorry. 

264
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,204
                Those will be   
         four garnishes for you.

265
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,673
      Thank you very much.      

266

That's some Korean pickled onion
               with jalapeño.   

267
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,944
       How are those made?      
          Oh, my gosh.          

268
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:43,214
               It's just sweet  
  white onion, sliced jalapeños,

              and lemon juice.  

270
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:47,552
          Outstanding.

 Tell me about the bean sprouts.
         What's in here?        

272
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:52,156
       Those are quick blanched,
         then tossed sesame oil,

273
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:56,628
          Korean dashi, which is
     soup base and green onions.

        cucumber wakame?        

276
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,767
      We do a quick sugar brine,

277
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,570
               then rehydrated  
         Japanese wakame seaweed

278
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:08,906
      and then rice wine vinegar
             and sugar marinade.

279
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,175
  All right, Chef, we've pulled 

280
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:12,576
          the majority          
     of the pork belly here.    

281

               our soul bowls.  

282

          of nice scoops of rice

 of that shaved scallions there.

 is a high-end restaurant dish,

         like the best?         

459
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:16,941
      Number two is my favorite.

460
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:20,745
     Unique mixture of dry,     
   fresh, and pickled peppers.  

461
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:23,614
  I like what's going on here.  
    The sausage is delicious.   

462
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,282
       The kolache dough,       
           it's light,          

463
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,018
    it's tender, but it still   
     has some texture to it.    

464
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,686
      That was very tasty.      

465
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:31,756
    I'm not a big sweets fan,   
    but I'll be trying this.    
         Wait, wait, wait, wait.

              I feel left out.

                I have FOMO.    

468
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,295
    And what about the other    
          three of us?          

469

            Silvana,            
       here you go, Chef.       

470
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,166
     It's warm. It's creamy.    

471
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,567
    It's a nice kiss of maple   

472
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,636
     and a little nuttiness     
        from that pecan.        

473
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,504
      It's not overly sweet     

474
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,707
 and I'll even go in for another
          piece of it.          

475
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,844
  I'm telling you what, sister, 
         excellent job.         

476
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,512
  All right, so listen, we need 
      to clean all this up.     

477
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,248
      And while we do that,     
  let's take a moment to watch  

478
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,452
  one of my favorite "Triple D" 
  OG joints -- Chaps Pit Beef.  

479
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,721
    Look at that.               
You come to Baltimore.          

480
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,123
This is what you better see.    

481
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,191
              And if you don't  
             it's not Pit Beef. 

482
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,994
 -What year did I go there, Bob?
             -2008.             

483
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:13,130
 The time I went was with Duff, 
   Duff Goldman and Duff and I  

484
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,866
       made this sandwich.      

485
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,801
                 It was big.    

486
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:19,002
         Look at the bite on it!

487
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:22,006
Make sure you don't...          
   lose anything.               

488
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,142
        Then we came back       
       for another visit.       

489
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,676
I haven't found a joint         
like it in the country.         

490
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,945
Really good premium meat,       
a little bit of seasoning,

 the lump charcoal.             

492
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:32,749
            Slice it.           
          -You got it.          

493
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,152
      This is all you sent?     

494
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:36,153
     Yeah, well,                
 we had another box,            

495
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,489
 but it didn't make             
    the airplane.               

496
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:41,358
         Is that a sign         
       or a cutting board?      
          A glass cutting board.

497
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,694
We're gonna get it out          
  to you real soon.

        -The cordon cue.

And that is gonna be our        
thin sliced pit beef            

501
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:53,237
wrapped around pork barbecue    
  and deep fry it.

     -Walk me through this.

Take five slices of that beef   
and you're gonna lay them out   

504
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,044
in, like, a star pattern.

and our barbecue seasoning.

     We cover it                
with a piece of foil

              Thank you, guys.  
       You guys are all awesome.

575
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:35,599
     For everybody at home,     
            remember,           

576
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,469
you can get to these restaurants
   or call them or email them,  

577
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:41,138
    but you can probably have   
  these dishes at your doorstep 

578
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,272
      in the next few days.

00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,075
       That's how we do it      
     on "Triple D Takeout."     

580
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,610
     Adios. Thank you, guys.

        -All right, so --       
             -Whoo!
