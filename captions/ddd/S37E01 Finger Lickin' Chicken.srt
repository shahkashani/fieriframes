That'll make the show.

 MAN: They're serving breakfast,
 and I live in the neighborhood 

118
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,318
     and I love coming here     

119
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,120
    to get the Thai breakfast   
        sausage sandwich.       

120
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:19,457
   This has Thai flavors based  
 on a traditional Thai sausage. 

121
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,926
      We're going to start      
      with the brown pork.      

122
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,061
     This is cooked, cooled     
          jasmine rice,         

123
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,930
      water and fish sauce.     

124
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,664
       We give that a mix.      

125
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,267
   This is green curry paste.   
        Dark brown sugar.       

126
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,070
    We're going to scoop out    
  generous three ounce portions 

127
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,472
   and then flatten them out.   

128
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:36,074
 Go in a convection oven at 475.

129
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,877
          They get nice         
      and crispy and brown.     

130
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,946
   Now we're going to make the  
 dressing for the papaya salad. 

131
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,349
     Start with lime juice.     
        Dark brown sugar.       

132
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,750
           Fish sauce.          

133
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,086
 Ginger, garlic. Blend that up. 

134
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,754
      Pour over the papaya.     

135
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:53,825
  We're also going to add some  
 chopped cilantro and mix it up.

136
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,493
      We're ready to build      
          our sandwich.         

137
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,963
  We're gonna take our pickled  
        Thai chili mayo.        

138
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,965
        It's lime juice,        
      pickled Thai chilies,     

139
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,768

       salt, brown sugar.

00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,369
           Mayonnaise.

         on the bottom.         

142
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,373
     Now we're going to add     
      two of these patties.     

143
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,642
       We're going to put       
     a little bit more mayo.    

144
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,912

   We use two chicken tenders   
   into our crispy batter mix.

 Crispin' them up on both sides.

503
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,471
           Four slices          
    of sharp cheddar cheese.

   Take our sweet corn purée,   
 vegan margarine, diced onions, 

505
