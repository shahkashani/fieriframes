What are we starting off with?  
The chicken and waffles?        

270
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,238
       First we have to marinate
                our chicken.    

271
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,706

              it in from there.

00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,512
And was Sam the head chef       
  here at the time?

00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:18,983

are we gonna let this marinate? 

279
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,585
           -12 hours.           
             -Okay.             

280
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,188
  -Now we're making the dredge? 
 -We use our all-purpose flour, 

281
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,391
      pepper, granulated garlic,
                dry mustard,

00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,992
                  paprika,      
                onion powder.   

283
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,461
   And then we're gonna pick out
a nice piece of chicken for you.

284
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,996
    There we go.                

285
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,532
A little squeeze to get some    
of that extra flour in there?   
                        Correct.

286
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:36,735
         And now we just take it
             and into the fryer.

287
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:38,403
And that's all she wrote.       
Now, how long is that gonna go? 

288
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:39,737
              15 to 20 minutes. 

289
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,072
And in the meantime,            
we'll make the waffle.          

290
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,874
                   First,       
             you beat your eggs.

291
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,610
              We have our milk, 
             our vegetable oil. 

292
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,078
              Now our vanilla,  

293
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,013
             all-purpose flour, 
              granulated sugar. 

294
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,148
            You can add the salt
                   for me.      

295
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,149
      Please pass the malt.     
       -Ooh, I like this.       

296
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,486
       Makes the outside crispy,
             the inside fluffy. 

297
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,354
     -A little bicarbonate?     
            -Exactly.           

298
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,623
             That's the batter. 

299
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,291
What kind of waffle maker       
are we cooking this on?         

300
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,560
Coal-fired? Nuclear?            
      Electric?                 

301
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,028
       -The one over here.      
              -Sun?             

302
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,831
  Oh, the old one.              

303
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,900
    We make sure you have enough
        to spread it all around.

304
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,970
    -How long will this take?   
    -Two and a half minutes.    

305
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:14,239
        Then we got our chicken.

306
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,241
              Then we dress it  
            with cinnamon sugar.

307
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:17,509
                Then we have    
              our maple syrup.  

308
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,043
      And then we put a spoonful
                 of butter.     

309
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,045
        Okay.                   

310
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,983
I like that little              
cinnamon-sugar kiss             
you just put on that.           

311
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,254
 Nice, light batter,            
   tender chicken.              

312
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,589
I think the key to it,          
besides great chicken,          

313
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,591
  is a really nice              
   homemade waffle              

314
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,527
and the fact that you're        
making it from scratch.         

315
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,196
 And that's the way             
Sam wanted everything done?     

316
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,431
   -Sam's way or the highway.   
          -Nicely done.         

317
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:44,536
      The waffles are soft      
        and golden brown.       

318
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,671
        The fried chicken       
       is mouth-watering.       

319
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,006
   Sam's is a great community

321
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,542
       I'll sit at the bar      
       and have a martini.      

322
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,478
    One of the best martinis    
         I've ever had.         

323
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,413
      Rib platter, table 3.     
           Pick it up.          

324
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,682
      I eat in here three,      
       four times a month.      

325
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,818
       And at least once,       
     I got to have the ribs.    

326
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
      -Now we're into ribs.     
       -We use a dry rub.       

327
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,822
              This is a little  
           mesquite-smoked salt,

328
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:06,157
              pinch of nutmeg,  
              some white sugar. 

329
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,559
             granulated garlic, 
                  cinnamon,     

330
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,229
         kosher salt, of course,
           crushed thyme leaves,

331
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,165
               paprika, cumin,  
                onion powder,   

332
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,633
              and black pepper. 

333
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,302
      -Another Sam recipe?      
              -No.              

334
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,703
              -No?              
        -A little add-on.       

335
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:21,239
Who's Little Add-On?            
 Does he work here?             

336
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,774
                    I add       
           mesquite-smoked salt.

337
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,041
   Because if you               
don't have a smoker,            

338
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,443
you're gonna need a little bit  
 of that love, okay.            

339
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,845
           Rub this in for this.

340
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,848
          Now we add brown sugar
                 to the top.    

341
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,783
         We don't want too much.
       We don't want too little.

342
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,718
    I take hard apple cider.    
              -Ooh!             

343
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,119
          Put that in the bottom
                 of the pan.    

344
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,121
                 This makes     
      a steaming process instead

345
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,723
                  of using      
             the typical water. 

346
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,591
           -"Wooder"?           
 -That's south Jersey -- water. 

347
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,727
           -"Wooder."           
     -Now we can cover this.    

348
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:45,597
              Goes to the oven  
             at 350 for an hour.

349
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,864
Then we'll drop down            
and go low and slow?            

350
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,733
                  Correct.      
           250 for another hour.

351
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,735
        Okay,                   
did you just get taller?        

352
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,137
                [ Chuckles ]    

353
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,604
       There's                  
  a big ramp here.              

354
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,406
You've got your kale            
and you've got your collards.   

355
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:58,476
   Okay, so what we do is we use
     our homemade chicken broth.

356
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,278
             -Okay.             
  -Then we add our turkey wing. 

357
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,080
   It's a smoked turkey wing.   
            -Got it.            

358
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:04,682
    Bring that to a boil, and we
   just let it cook for an hour.

359
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,016
              Put your favorite 
              seasoned salt in. 

360
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,084
         It doesn't matter what.

361
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,821
              And onion powder, 
             a pinch of nutmeg. 

362
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,422
       That's                   
 an interesting one.            

363
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,024

          -Rachael Ray?         

364
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:14,893
 A little shout-out             
    to you, Rach.               

365
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,094
Now we're just packing          
   them in there.               

366
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,962
                It'll fit all   
                in this pot.    

367
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,163
 And once they cook             
   for that hour?               

368
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,765
  -We pull the turkey wing out. 
         -Right, right.         

369
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,433
                 Chop it up     
  and put it back in the greens.

370
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:23,568
All right, and then...          

371
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,502
               Ribs are ready.  

372
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,838
How many ribs they get?         

373
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,440
                We serve four   
                to an order.    

374
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:32,510
          And we take our sauce.
                    Okay.       

375
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:35,046
           We have some homemade
   macaroni and cheese, as well.

    -Collard greens are next.

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,382
    Look at that.               

378
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,518
Have a little vinegar           
    here for me,                

379
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,719
 a little hot sauce.            

380
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,354
   I love greens.               

381
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,859
        Mmm.                    

382
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,727
 Tender like butter.            
It's not oversalted.            

383
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:52,997
  Love a little bit             
of that turkey wing.            

384
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,466
        Mmm.                    
I could eat that whole pot.     

385
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:58,602
 I've had a few ribs            
     in my day.                 

386
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,404
        Mmm.                    
Got a nice bark on it.          

387
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,673
 I got a little bit             
   of that cider,               

388
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,942
  and I get a touch             
      of smoke.                 

389
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,209
      Laying on                 
  that brown sugar.             

390
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,278
Your whole dry rub mix          
 that you did on it,            

391
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,282
I definitely get some sweet     
    off the top.                

392
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,017
All right, I'm done.            

393
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,353
  I'll have a nap.              

394
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,622
      Absolutely succulent      
         and delicious.         

395
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,490
  Every piece is super tender.  

396
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,025
     It falls off the bone.     

397
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,094
The way this place feels

 having a good time.            

401
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,100

       to go?                   

402
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:31,636
             Sure, you can have 
               the whole pot.   

403
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:32,837
That's what I meant.

             That's easy for you
                   to say.      

444
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:13,270
             Not really, though.

445
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,872
BLEDSOE: We're gonna start off  
with some cream cheese.         

446
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,607
     We're gonna                
add mascarpone cheese.          

447
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:17,875
              Mascarpone, okay. 

448
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:20,344
  Shredded coconut,             
  coconut extract.              

449
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,213
vanilla extract, honey.         

450
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,549
                  Darling.      
       Where's this going to go?

451
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,217
We're gonna stuff it            
in our challah bread.           

452
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:29,219
                   Holla!       

453
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,922
Then we close it up.            

454
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,893
                 All right,     
               let's cook it.   

455
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,428
     All right,                 
we have some whole eggs.        

456
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,164
We have heavy cream,            
     whole milk.                

457
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,165
                    Okay.       

458
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,099
    Brown sugar.                

459
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,300
               Rolling Stones.  

460
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:47,038
Ground nutmeg, ground cinnamon, 
  coconut extract.              

461
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,906
          If there wasn't enough
              coconut in this.  

462
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,641
  And a little bit              
     of vanilla.                

463
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,376
       And now                  
we're gonna mix this up.        

464
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,245
We're gonna go ahead            
and dip it in our mix.          

465
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:55,446
          It's like a pool raft.

466
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:56,914
And then put a little bit       
     of butter.                 

467
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,516
                    Okay.       

468
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,452
 And that probably takes as long
    as a prime rib does to cook.

469
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,120
           It's gonna           
  take about 10 to 12 minutes.  

470
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,522
     -Finish it in the oven?    
              -Yes.             

471
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,791
             -Okay.             
        -And I cut this.        

472
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,459
       This is                  
 a raspberry purée.             

473
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:11,462
Diced strawberries, and we put  
our coconut on here --          

474
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,197
    a little more               
  shredded coconut.             

475
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,866
  Syrup, cinnamon,              

476
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,068
powdered sugar, mint,           

477
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,803
and brûléed bananas.            

478
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,004
                    Okay.       

479
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:23,074
            So, how do I eat it?
                     Oh.        

480
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,842
     With a fork                
    and a knife.                

481
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,349
               It's delicious.  
          It's not overly sweet.

482
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,018
             I love the texture 
               of the coconut.  

483
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,686
                Great texture   
           on the outside of it,

484
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,621
           because you cooked it
   a long time with the challah.

485
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,158
         The crème brûlée banana
    along with the strawberries.

486
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,226
                But the thing   
 that makes it all come together

487
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,362
               is the acidity   
         in the raspberry purée.

488
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,698
      That's really great.      
            -Awesome.           

489
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,167
 -That's an adult French toast. 
        -Oh, I like that.       

490
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,637
           And the coconut-cream
           stuffed French toast.
      WOMAN #1: Oh, my God.     

491
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,239
  WOMAN #2: Each bite, you get  
   the texture of the coconut,  

492
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,974
 the sweetness with the crunch. 

493
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:59,376
              I have no problem 
            giving it a "wowie."

494
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,979
  Did she just drop             
     a "wowie"?                 

495
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:04,382
             Wowie!             
          It's amazing.         

496
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:05,649
  Apparently, that's something  

497
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,718
      you might have heard      
     when Eddie was around.     

498
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,588
One of his favorite expressions 
    was "Wowie!"                

499
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,722
       So, this guy was the life
                of the party.   

500
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,323
        -This is a wowie.       
             -Yeah.             

501
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:16,060
   WOMAN: Eddie was a big part  
          of Baltimore,         

502
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,462
         and his legacy         
      still lives on here.      

503
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,197
     Your crabcake po' boy.     

504
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:24,802
  The jumbo lump crab meat with 
  this Tabasco-bacon-onion jam. 

505
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,270
  A lot of people in Baltimore  

506
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,339
 take pride in their crabcakes, 
        but they're gonna       

507
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,942
   have to measure themselves   
       by Miss Shirley's.       

508
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,076
                 What are we    
                making next?    

509
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,545
   -A bacon-onion-Tabasco jam.  
             -Okay.             

510
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:38,148
Olive oil, sweet onions,        
   chopped garlic.              

511
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,484
             -Bacon?            
             -Bacon.            

512
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:40,951
                There we go.    
                  Next up?      

513
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,887
            -Coffee.            
  -I like where this is going.  

514
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:45,356
Apple-cider vinegar,            
    maple syrup.                

515
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,225
      -A little hot sauce.      
          -Brown sugar,         

516
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:49,026
   and a little black pepper.   
             -Okay.             

517
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,294
                 All of this    
           is gonna cook down...

518
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,695
For two and a half hours.       

519
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,432
             So now we're gonna 
      finally make the crabcake?
  Yes.                          

520
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:57,701
A little mayo, eggs,            
   Worcestershire,              

521
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,571
Old Bay, yellow mustard,        
    kosher salt.                

522
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:01,906
 Mix this together.             

523
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:02,974
                    Okay,       
            what's going on now?

524
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,441
     All right,                 
we have 2 pounds of crab meat.  

525
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,043
             -Whoa!             
      -Roasted red peppers,     

526
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,112
parsley, crabcake mix.          

527
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,114
             -Okay.             
     -This is cracker meal.     

528
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:14,719
  So, this is just enough effort
               to combine it.   

529
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:17,921
Yes, that's what I call         
   a crabcake.                  
                    I am in awe.

530
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,724
      Now, show me what the size
   of a crabcake is around here?

531
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,660
2 ounce. Three of them will go  
  in the sandwich.              

532
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,961
                    Okay.       

533
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,462
     Now we have                
   our bacon jam.               

534
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,597
Plenty of that on there.        

535
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,399
             -Okay.             
       -Old Bay remoulade.      

536
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,200
          I'll get this for you.

537
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,002
 Old Bay remoulade.             

538
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,070
                  Old Bay.      

539
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,271
 Yeah, bibb lettuce,            

540
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,540
red and yellow tomatoes.        
       -Okay.                   

541
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,910
  And then we have              
 our mini crabcakes.            

542
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:41,745
                    Okay.       

543
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,549
Gonna garnish with parsley      
    and Old Bay.                

544
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,158
             This is outrageous.

545
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,163
             The way you compose
  this sandwich is so next-level

546
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:03,034
         from the super-unctuous
                 bacon jam.     

547
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,969
   In the crabcake, there's only
   a little bit of egg and mayo,

548
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,240
                and that kiss   
   of this little cracker crumb.

549
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:10,908
                Cracker meal.   

550
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,315
               My mom and dad   
    are both huge crabcake fans.

551
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:20,384
                 My old man     
        would flip out for this.

552
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,320
          You give me greatness.

553
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:24,388
     Thank you.                 
 I appreciate that.             

554
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,457
 It's some of the best crabcakes
         I've ever had.         

555
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,726
  I would order it every chance 
             I got.             

556
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,594
I need those strawberry waffles.

557
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,730
   When you leave, you always   
 have a huge smile on your face.

558
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,065
          So give it up         
     for Eddie and a little.    

559
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,801
        TOGETHER: Wowie!        

560
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:39,803
          [ Laughter ]          

561
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,939
  So, that's it for this trip,  
        but don't worry!        

562
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,875
 There's plenty more "Triple D" 
  joints all over the country.  

563
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,477
         I'll be looking        
        for you next week       

564
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,013
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

565
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,282
   Oh, speechless.              

566
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:52,949
          I like that.          
        -No, that's you.        

567
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,951
          [ Laughter ]          

568
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,620
        And the crowd goes wild!

569
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,222
                 Good night!
