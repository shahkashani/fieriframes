 I'M THE OLDEST OF 12.          

35
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:39,431

     A LOT OF STUFF REAL QUICK. 

36
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,567

00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,183
      IT'S A LOCAL THING,       
      IT'S A TYPE OF BREAD.     

44
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:00,719
IT'S LIKE A FRIED BREAD, BUT    
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT, 

45
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,654
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA             
DEEP-FRY 'EM.                   

46
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,723
START WITH THE FLOUR,           
PUT SOME DRY YEAST INTO IT.     

47
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,525
       SO THIS IS GONNA         
       TAKE SOME TIME TO PROOF. 

48
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,526
YEAH, I GIVE 'EM                
ABOUT FIVE, TEN MINUTES.        

49
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,462
THEN WE JUST ADD SOME SALT.     

50
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,397
NOW WITH THE MANTECA,           
WE DON'T ADD THAT MUCH,         

51
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,333
BECAUSE WE'RE ALREADY           
DEEP-FRYING ALL THIS.           

52
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:16,135
      THIS IS JUST GONNA HELP   
      SEPARATE IT A LITTLE BIT, 
      MANTECA IS LARD.          

53
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,136
ADD A LITTLE BIT OF             
BAKING POWDER AND WARM WATER.   

54
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:20,872
       SO YOU POUR A LITTLE IN, 
    KINDA FEEL WHERE YOU'RE AT, 
                MOVE IT AROUND. 
UH-HUH.                         

55
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,074
                    I LIKE YOUR 
          MEASURING TECHNIQUES. 
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT.         

56
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,611
   NOW YOU'RE KINDA KNEADING IT 
   AND THEN ROLL IT IN A BALL   

57
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,546
        AND LET IT PROOF        
        FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. 

58
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,748
        I FEEL LIKE I'M DRIVING 
        A LITTLE MINI BUS.      

59
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,818
  IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING    
  RIGHT INTO BIG TORTILLA LAND. 

60
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,819
NO, THIS IS                     
A LITTLE BIT THICKER.           

61
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:37,622

START FLIPPING SOME LARD        
ON TOP OF IT.                   

62
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,425
            DO WE WANT IT FLAT? 
NO, WE WANT IT TO PUFF UP.      

63
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,561
         OH, IT IS PUFFING,     
         HOUSTON, WE HAVE PUFF! 

64

112
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,552

134
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:44,209
SKIN, TYPICALLY,                
WHEN PEOPLE FRY THAT UP,        
THEY CALL THAT CHICHARONES.     

135
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,479
  UH-HUH,                       
  THEY'RE BOTH CHICHARONES      
  BUT THIS ONE HAS MEAT IN 'EM. 

136
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:49,548
        THIS IS THE WAY WE MAKE 
        OUR CHICHARONES.        

137
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,750
    I ADD A LITTLE BIT OF WATER 
    SO IT DOESN'T STICK         
    TO THE BOTTOM, SALT.        

138
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:55,487
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT           
A CHICHARONE CAN BE DIFFERENT   
FROM REGIONS?                   

139
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,622
            FROM REGIONS, YEAH. 
UH-HUH!

          I CANNOT WAIT.

TO MELT THE CHEESE.             

148

         SELLER HERE?           

149
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,115
THAT AND THE CARNE ADOVADA.     

150
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:27,452
  LOOK AT THAT, ARE THEY ALWAYS 
  THE SIZE OF A SMALL FOOTBALL? 

151
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,387
ALWAYS THAT SIZE.               

152
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:33,525
         WOW! YOU BITE INTO IT, 
         AND YOU GET A LITTLE   
         TENDER PIECE OF PORK   

153
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,460
      AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, 
      YOU GET A CRUNCHY THING.  

154
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,797
         THAT'S SURE IS         
         A DIFFERENT CHICHARONE 
         THAN I'VE EVER HAD.    

155
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:41,466
      THE ONLY THING THAT NEEDS 
      TO GO ALONGSIDE OF THAT,  

156
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:44,402

204
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,551
      WE GOT SOME BUTTER        
      IN THERE, HUH, LOOKS LIKE 
      A HOT TUB OF BUTTER.      

205
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,686
      IT'S LIKE THE PUBLIC POOL 
      IN FLAVOR TOWN.           

206
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,221
OH, YEAH, I'M ABOUT TO ADD      
MY SHRIMP TO THAT NICE BUTTER.  

207
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,157
      SHRIMP INTO THE DEEP END. 

208
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,627
LET THAT SAUTE                  
FOR A FEW MINUTES,              
TURN THE SHRIMP OVER.           

209
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,229
      OKAY, THAT'S AN ABUNDANCE 
      OF BUTTER.                

210
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:54,165
WE ADD ARTICHOKE HEARTS,        
A LITTLE DICED HAM.             

211
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,233
            I LIKE THE LANGUAGE 
               YOU'RE SPEAKING. 
WHITE WINE.                     

212
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,169
THE MEETING HERE IN FLAVOR TOWN 
IS GOING REALLY WELL.           

213
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:01,305
OH YEAH, THE SHRIMP,            
GRANULATED GARLIC.              

214
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,641
    WHOO! JOHNNY MONSTER FLAVOR 
    JUST JUMPED IN.             

215
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,311
A LITTLE BLACK PEPPER,          
A LITTLE KOSHER SALT.           

216
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:09,180
YOU CAN'T SAUTE IT TOO LONG     
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA            
TURN THOSE SHRIMP TOUGH, RIGHT? 

217
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:11,650
OH YEAH, FRESH BASIL,           
GREEN ONIONS,                   

218
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:14,052
AND A LITTLE CHOPPED GARLIC,    
STIR THAT UP.                   

219
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,854
        WE'RE GOOD TO GO THERE, 
        AND WHAT ARE WE GONNA   
        SERVE THAT OVER?        

220
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:19,056
ANGEL HAIR PASTA.               
      I LIKE THAT, SERVE IT UP. 

221
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,058
HEY, WHERE YOU GOIN'            
WITH THE REST OF THAT SAUCE?    
                           OH...

222
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,994
WHO DO YOU THINK                
YOU'RE FOOLIN'?                 

223
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:26,331
      A LITTLE PARMESAN CHEESE, 
      OH YEAH.                  

224
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,333
MMM, OH, THAT'S NICE.           

225
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,201
LET ME TELL YOU                 
THE 90 REASONS I LIKE THIS.     

226
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,671
EVERY INGREDIENT                
THAT WENT IN THERE, I DIG.      

227
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:35,273
THE HAM, THE SHRIMP IN          
NICE LITTLE BATTERING ON THERE. 

228
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:38,743
NICE AND TENDER, BUTTER,        
WHITE WINE, GARLIC.             

229
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,678
MMM, YEAH.                      

230
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,680
      CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THAT. 

231
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:45,016
    IT'S RICH, VERY FILLING,    
    IT'S GOOD, VERY GOOD.       

232
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,018
IT WAS GOOD THAT YOU NAMED      
THE STREET AFTER THIS DISH.     

233
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,020
AND NOT JUST ONE.               

234
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,290
NOW WE HAVE EGGPLANT NAPOLEON.  
    AS IN NAPOLEON AVENUE.      

235
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,426
    STACKS OF EGGPLANT          
    WITH SHRIMP AND CRAWFISH.   

236
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:59,497
IT'S NOT A COMBINATION          
YOU SEE EVERY DAY.              
                             NO.

237
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,966
THIS IS THE TROUT TCHOUPITOULAS.
       CHOPOLOUPAS, APPELOOTIE. 

238
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,035
                   TULAPOTUMUS. 
I CAN'T SAY THE NAME EITHER.    

239
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:05,904
TCHOUPITOULAS.                  
                 TCHOUPITOULAS. 

240
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,972
       AND TROUT WITH THE SHRIMP
       AND THE CRAB MEAT.       

241
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:11,309
THE SHRIMP IS EXCELLENT.        

242
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:15,380
YOU'RE GETTING THE REAL TASTE   
OF LOUISIANA SEAFOOD.           

243
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,249
  AND IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO GO  

244
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:21,119
 WHEN YOU JUST DON'T WANNA COOK 
 AND YOU JUST WANNA EAT.        

245
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,321
   IT'S A PLACE YOU CAN COME,   
   YOU CAN BE COMFORTABLE.      

246
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,256
   YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.   

247
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,258
                  IT FEELS LIKE 
        THE LOCAL CORNER JOINT. 
YEAH.                           

248
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,927
AS A LOCAL, YOU WANNA EAT       
AT LOCAL PLACES.                

249
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,997
IT'S JUST A GOOD PLACE          
TO COME AND GET                 
ALMOST WHATEVER YOU WANT.       

250
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,400
(Guy)                           
EVEN IF WHAT YOU WANT           
ISN'T CLASSIC NEW ORLEANS...    

251
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:37,468
        WHO HAD THE ROAST BEEF? 

252
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,670
    (Guy)                       
    LIKE CHICKEN FRIED STEAK,   
    LAMB SHANK, AND THIS ONE.   

253
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,606
        I'M HAVIN' THE BRISKET. 

254
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,474
     SLOW COOKED                
     AND A NICE FULL FLAVOR.    

255
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:45,410
GONNA DO A BEEF BRISKET         
BUT FIRST, I WANNA MAKE         
A DRY RUB.                      

256
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:47,345
KOSHER SALT, BLACK PEPPER.      

257
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:49,347
                      GENEROUS? 
YEAH.                           

258
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,416
           SO A LITTLE PAPRIKA, 
           GRANULATED GARLIC?   

259
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,686
YES, AND SOME WHOLE THYME,      
SWEET BASIL, I'LL MIX THAT UP   
REAL GOOD.                      

260
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,954
            THIS HERE'S LIKE    
            A BARBECUE DRY RUB, 

261
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,090
         AND WE GOT THE BRISKET 
         WITH THE CAP ON.       

262
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,025
        IT'S GOT A BUNCH OF FAT 
        RUNNIN' THROUGH IT.     

263
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,561
     TONS OF FLAVOR, BUT IT HAS 
     TO BE COOKED LOW AND SLOW  

264
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,697
TO GET THE CHANCE TO BREAK DOWN 
ALL THAT CONNECTIVE TISSUE      

265
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,665
           WHICH MAKES A LOT    
           OF THE GREAT FLAVOR. 

266
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,301
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH THIS? 
PUT A LITTLE OLIVE OIL ON IT.   

267
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,237
              DO YOU RUB IT IN? 
YEAH, RUB IT IN.                

268
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,305
FLIP IT OVER,                   
COAT THE OTHER SIDE.            

269
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,107
PUT IT ON A FLATTOP             
FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES.          

270
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,109
                       SEAR IT? 
YEAH, EACH SIDE.                

271
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,178
          PUT A NICE CRUST      
          ON THE OUTSIDE OF IT? 

272
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,447
YEAH, I'M GONNA HAVE TO         
FLIP THE BEEF BRISKET OVER.     
            HEATIN' UP THE FAT. 

273
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,449
      ANYTHING GONNA GO IN THERE
      WITH THAT?                

274
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:28,386
ONION, BELL PEPPER,             
I'M GONNA LIFT THIS UP.         

275
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,588
        THE FAT RENDERS         
        AND POURS OVER THE SIDE 
        AND MOISTURIZES IT?     

276
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,390
YES.                            
                      I DIG IT. 

277
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,859
AND THEN A LITTLE               
SECRET HAM PASTE.               
                     HAM PASTE? 

278
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,861
         A LITTLE BIT OF WATER  
         JUST TO GET IT STARTED,

279
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,796
           STEAM IT A LITTLE BIT
           AS IT COOKS, AND THEN
           YOU RENDER DOWN.     

280
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:41,399
  GET YOUR OWN FAT AND JUICE... 
YES.                            

281
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:44,536
         PUT SOME FOIL OVER IT? 
LOCK IT DOWN ABOUT 350          
FOR FOUR HOURS.                 

282
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,004
FOUR HOURS,                     
IT SHOULD BE FALLIN' APART.     

283
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:49,807
                  LET'S SEE IT, 
               WOW, THAT'S HOT! 
CUT IT FOR YOU.                 

284
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,742
I DON'T EVEN KNOW               
THAT YOU NEEDED A KNIFE.        

285
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,546
YOU COULD HAVE JUST LOOKED      
AT IT, AND IT WOULD HAVE        
FALLEN APART.                   

286
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:58,349
LOOK AT IT, THAT IS TENDER,     
WHOA! MMM, THAT'S TASTY, MAN.   

287
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:02,019
   YOU DIDN'T PUT ANYTHING ELSE 
IN THERE AFTER I TALKED TO YOU? 
NO, I DIDN'T.                   

288
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,823
LOOK AT THAT,                   
THAT BROKE DOWN REAL NICE.      

289
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,092
THAT'S EXCELLENT FLAVOR,        
NOT TOO SALTY,                  
STILL ENOUGH TEXTURE,           

290
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,094
BECAUSE I HATE WHEN THEY COOK   
TOO MUCH AND THERE'S NO TEXTURE.

291
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:12,096
            THAT'S REALLY GOOD. 
                IT'S DELICIOUS. 

292
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,232
        IT'S VERY GOOD.         
                 THERE YOU ARE. 

293
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,501
          AS WE SAY HERE,       
          IT TASTES LIKE MAMA'S.

294
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:19,437
I THINK THE WORLD OF THIS PLACE.
IT'S ONE OF THE                 
BEST RESTAURANTS IN THE CITY.   

295
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,439
YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING          
ABOUT MAGAZINE STREET           

296
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,841
WITHOUT ANYBODY SAYING          
JOEY K's.                       

297
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,776
THEY MAKE YOU                   
FEEL LIKE YOU'RE FAMILY.        

298
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:28,646
EVERY TIME THE DOOR OPENS,      
YOU'LL SEE SOMEBODY WALK IN     
THAT YOU KNOW.                  

299
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,448
YOU ALWAYS WANNA COME BACK.     

300
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,416
             YOU'RE HAVIN'      
             THE TCHOUPITOULAS. 

301
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:34,451
                    DO YOU KNOW 
             HOW TO SPELL THAT? 
I CAN.                          

302
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:36,587
       YOU KNOW HOW I SPELL IT? 
NO.                             

303
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:39,390

                        QUIT IT.

398
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:56,814
     DO YOU PUT SYRUP ON PIZZA? 
MY KIDS LIKE IT.                

399
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:58,616
  THIS IS HOW YOU GET IT GOIN'. 

400
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:02,286
               SOME BACON, MMM. 

401
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:05,756
OH NO... WAY BETTER.            

402
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,691
                    WAY BETTER. 

403
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,561
  (Guy)                         
  AND SHE'S SERVIN' IT UP       
  FOR LUNCH, A LITTLE CREAMIER  
  BUT NO SYRUP.                 

404
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:13,430
     THIS ONE GETS HOMEMADE     
     BOLOGNESE SAUCE.           

405
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,833
            VEAL, GROUND CHUCK, 
            AND SWEET SAUSAGE.  

406
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,102
YEAH, I THINK WHEN I DRIVE UP   
AND SEE IT SAY KELLY O'S        
OUT FRONT,                      

407
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,638
I'M EXPECTING THERE             
TO BE VEAL IN THE BOLOGNESE,    
LOOK AT THAT.                   

408
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,774
HOLD ON GUY,                    
YOU'RE GETTIN' A BIG PLATEFUL.  

409
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,775
            HEY, THAT'S ENOUGH, 
            THAT'S ENOUGH.      

410
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:28,045
     AH, PECORINO ROMANO CHEESE 
     ON TOP.                    

411
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,981
                 AH, DELICIOUS. 

412
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,982
  THE POLENTA, NICE AND CREAMY. 

413
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,585
  THE BOLOGNESE GOT             
  SOME NICE BIG CHUNKS OF MEAT. 

414
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,654
          IT'S GOT A LITTLE BIT 
          OF SWEETNESS TO IT.   

415
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,589
              IT'S REALLY GOOD. 
THANK YOU.                      

416
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,591
        IT IS A LOT OF POLENTA. 
  THE MEAT SAUCE IS THE BEST.   

417
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,994
                     I LOVE IT. 
WOW!                            

418
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:45,062
IT'S A NICE TWIST               
ON THE PASTA.                   

419
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:49,133
TO COME IN AND FIND             
THAT I CAN GET SOME POLENTA,    
FRESH MADE BOLOGNESE,           

420
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:53,271
OR I CAN HAVE IT FRIED          
AND PUT SYRUP ON IT, IS GREAT.  

421
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:56,541
SO FAR TODAY, I'VE BEEN         
TO POLAND AND ITALY.            

422
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,476
        UP NEXT, TURKEY.        

423
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:01,078
    DO YOU MAKE TURKEY POT PIE? 
YES, IT'S A SOUP.               

424
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,014
                   IT'S A SOUP? 
YEAH.                           

425
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:04,882
YOU DON'T FIND THAT             
IN MANY PLACES.                 

426
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:05,750
WHEN WE COME BACK.              

427
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:11,155
I NEED THE MASHED POTATOES.     

428
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,291
(Guy)                           
AT KELLY O'S DINER              
IN PITTSBURGH,

ALL KINDS OF LOCAL FAVORITES.   

430
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:19,763
PEOPLE LIKE HALUSKI             
IN PITTSBURGH.                  

431
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,366
POLENTA, IT'S INCOMPARABLE      
TO ANYBODY ELSE'S               
THAT I'VE EVER HAD.             

432
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,568
TWO ORDERS OF HOME FRIES.       

433
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,837
(Guy)                           
NOT BAD FOR A COOK WHO GOT      
HER TRAINING TOTALLY ON THE JOB.

434
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,906
YOU TAUGHT YOURSELF?            
                            YES.

435
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,375
STARTIN' WITH FAMILY RECIPES.   
  SOMETHING YOU'D ALMOST GET    
        AT YOUR HOUSE.          

436
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:34,445
        BEST THING ON THE MENU, 
             WHAT DO YOU THINK? 
     TURKEY POT PIE SOUP.       

437
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,381
                I'VE NEVER SEEN 
           TURKEY POT PIE SOUP. 
IT'S MY FAVORITE.               

438
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,383
(Guy)                           
KELLY CAME UP WITH THIS ONE     
HERSELF AND FOLKS HERE LOVE IT. 

439
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,319
IT'S THE BEST SOUP.             

440
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,187
          SO WHAT IF WE         
          SPICE IT UP A LITTLE? 

441
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,123
        OH, WHAT'S IN THIS      
        LITTLE BASKET OF MAGIC? 

442
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,057
     WE'RE GONNA MAKE           
     A LITTLE BIT OF A DRY RUB. 

443
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,060
       A LITTLE SEASONING SALT, 
       A LITTLE BIT OF PARSLEY, 

444
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:50,862
     BASIL, THAT WON'T HURT US, 
     PAPRIKA, GARLIC POWDER,    

445
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:54,998
  A LITTLE POULTRY SEASONING,   
  AND NOW, MIX UP THAT DRY RUB. 

446
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:57,868
            I DON'T DE-BLING    
            JUST FOR EVERYBODY. 

447
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:00,804
    NOW YOU GET UP UNDERNEATH   
    THAT TURKEY SKIN LIKE THIS. 

448
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:03,808
    SEE HOW THAT SEASONING      
    IS ALL SITTING ON THE MEAT, 

449
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:07,978
   SO THAT FAT WILL RENDER DOWN 
   AS IT COOKS AND FLAVOR       
   ALL OF THAT MEAT.            

450
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,948
   I'LL GO AHEAD AND THROW SOME 
   ONIONS DOWN IN THERE,        

451
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,816
         SOME CARROTS IN THERE, 
         WRAP IT IN FOIL.       

452
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:14,885
   WE DON'T WANNA LOSE ALL THAT 
   MOISTURE OUT OF THE TURKEY.  

453
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,820
THEN REST 3 1/2 HOURS.          

454
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,423
GET IT NICE AND GOLDEN BROWN,   
DE-BONE IT.                     

455
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,425
    TAKE OFF THE TURKEY BREAST, 
               YOU CAN USE THAT 
            FOR THE SANDWICHES. 
CORRECT.                        

456
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:23,360
BOIL OFF THE CARCASS.           

457
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,296
        WITH ALL OF THE VEGGIES 
        THAT WE ROASTED,        

458
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,297
           WE'LL SIMMER THIS    
           IN A BUNCH OF WATER. 

459
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,233
GET A LITTLE FLAVOR             
IN THE BROTH, STRAIN IN.        

460
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:31,168
         NOW WE'RE LEFT         
         WITH OUR TURKEY STOCK. 

461
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:33,104
I ADD THE CELERY AND ONIONS.    

462
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,972
HOW LONG'S THIS GONNA SIT THERE 
                    AND SIMMER? 
TEN MINUTES.                    

463
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,907
   NOW, READY FOR THE POTATOES. 
FROZEN VEGETABLES IN.           

464
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:40,044
THAT'S A HEAPIN' HELPIN', HUH,  
GIVE IT TO YOU                  
ON THE FROZEN VEGGIES THING,    

465
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:42,046
BECAUSE THAT'S KINDA            
WHAT PEOPLE EXPECT.             

466
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:45,116
ALL THE TURKEY                  
THAT WE PICKED FROM THE BONES,  
WE'LL MAKE A LITTLE ROUX.       

467
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:47,185
NOW WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN,        
THAT'S THICKENING UP.           

468
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,254
I MEAN, THAT'S JUST             
MY TWO CENTS.                   
         I LIKE YOUR TWO CENTS. 

469
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,390
LOOK AT ALL THE LOVE            
YOU GOT IN THAT.                
                    LOOKS GOOD. 

470
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,658
             HOMEMADE PIE CRUST.

471
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,994
   MMM, THAT IS CREAMY GOODNESS 
   RIGHT THERE,                 

472
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,930
            BUT IT'S NOT STICKY 
            LIKE CANNED SOUP.   

473
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,065
 ALL THAT GREAT TURKEY AND THEN 
 YOU'VE GOT ALL YOUR VEGGIES.   

474
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,066
             PEOPLE CAN SAY     
             WHATEVER THEY WANT 

475
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,936
   ABOUT THE FROZEN VEGGIES,    
   BUT THEY'RE NICE AND TENDER. 

476
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:07,138
    THAT CRUST IS MONEY, I MEAN 
    THAT TASTES LIKE A BAKED... 

477
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,073
POT PIE.                        

478
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,543
   YEAH, THAT'S WINNER, WINNER, 
         TURKEY POT PIE DINNER. 
THANK YOU.                      

479
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,478
               HOW IS IT TODAY? 
VERY GOOD.                      

480
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,747
I'M WORKIN' FOR THE COMPLIMENT. 
YEAH, WE GO FOR GOOD FOOD.      

481
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:19,750
      GOOD FORTUNES, GOOD FOOD. 

482
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,753
  IT'S ONE OF THOSE             
  LITTLE OUT-OF-THE-WAY PLACES. 

483
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,755
SO IT REALLY IS                 
A NEIGHBORHOOD JOINT.           
           THAT'S THE BEST PART 
                      ABOUT IT. 

484
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,691
         THIS IS WHY YOUR PLACE 
         IS SO COOL.            

485
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:29,293
   IT'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE       
   WORKING REALLY HARD WHO HAVE 
   A TON OF ENTHUSIASM.         

486
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:32,563
I'M PROUD OF MYSELF.            
   YOU SHOULD BE, YOU'RE MAKIN' 
           THINGS FROM SCRATCH. 

487
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,565
   IT'S HOMEMADE,               
   THAT'S ALWAYS REALLY GOOD.   

488
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,434
        EVERYONE'S FAMILY HERE.

             WHAT A COOL PLACE! 

490
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:40,371
WELL, IT'S REALLY HARD          
TO GET TO WHERE I'M AT.         

491
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:43,307
 AND LOOK AT IT, I HAVEN'T SEEN 
 A PERSON WALK OUT OF HERE      
 WITHOUT A SMILE.               

492
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,642
 SO THAT'S ALL FOR THIS TRIP,   
 BUT WE'RE HEADED FOR SOME MORE 
 GREAT JOINTS.
