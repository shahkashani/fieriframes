00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:02,534
           Hey, there.          

2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:04,003
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:06,805
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

4
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:07,672
          This trip...          

5
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:08,473
              It's time to eat. 

6
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:09,808
  ...we're all over the map...  

7
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,410
There's a lot going on          
   in this thing.               

8
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:13,545
          ...picking up         
    some first-class flavor.    

9
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,213
     That's no joke right there,
                   folks.       

10
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:17,615
     From incredible Italian    
         in Delaware...         

11
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:20,151
     Oh, that's double fist bump
              right there, pal. 

12
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,888
  ...to a quick Middle Eastern  
       spin in San Diego.       

13
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,357
   It's like, raining chicken in
  Flavortown right there, buddy.

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,492
   And in Vancouver, Canada...  

15
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,361
    You just took it to the next
        level, just so you know.

16
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,430
        ...a pizza joint        
   charting all-new territory.  

17
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:35,567
      That's a destination bite.
   People come here to get that.

18
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,569
     Because you won't find that
               anywhere else.   

19
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,637
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

20
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,441
 on "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

21
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:48,313
                     ♪♪         

22
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:54,053
                     ♪♪         

23
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:55,521
    So I'm here in San Diego,   
           California,          

24
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:57,389
    in the Kearny Mesa area,    
     and I got to tell you,     

25
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,458
 ladies and gentlemen, the food 
  revolution is alive and well. 

26
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,061
      I mean we are finding     
          our favorite          

27
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:03,796
    ethnic foods everywhere.    

28
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:05,063
    I'm here at a strip mall    

29
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,464
           looking for          
    some Middle Eastern food.   

30
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:10,736
   This is Tahini Street Food.  

31
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,337
     I got a steak shawarma     
           rice bowl.           

32
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:15,073
Real authentic Middle Eastern   
food. I've been hooked.         

33
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,007
    I could come here every day.

34
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,143
          Cumato salad.         
       Six-piece falafel.       

35
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,812
And I love Mahmoud and Osama    
and all the crew here.          

36
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,148
    FIERI: That's high-school   
      buddies Osama Shabaik     

37
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,883
      and Mahmoud Barkawi,      

38
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:27,418
   who started out as a lawyer  
        and aspiring cop,       

39
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,687
  but couldn't resist the pull  
       of their families'       

40
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,556
  Egyptian and Syrian cuisine.  

41
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:35,160
  So they started a side hustle 
    that exploded into this.    

42
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:37,095
San Diego, you find taco shops  
all the time, right?            

43
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,496
             -True.             
    -You don't find shawarma.   

44
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:39,998
              FIERI: So this is 
     a Middle Eastern taco shop?

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,233
          -Pretty much.         
    -For the most part, yeah.   

46
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:42,701
      We stole the recipes      
        from our mothers.       

47
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,169
We'll stack the shawarmas       
      in-house.                 

48
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,170
         I got a chicken        
       shawarma sandwich.       

49
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,171
          Fries inside.         

50
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,438
 Chicken shawarma is definitely 

51
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,907
        one of the dishes       
       that I order often.      

52
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,642
       All of the flavors       
      just drizzling down,      

53
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,111
   marinating as they cook it.  

54
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:55,047
They shave off the meat right in
   front of you. It's delicious.

55
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,181
                 All right.     
       What are we making first?

56
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,516
  The marinade for              
the chicken shawarma.           

57
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,318
   The first thing              
 we have is yogurt.             

58
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,186
Fresh blended oranges           
     and lemon.                 

59
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,255
         Seed, pith, everything.
The whole nine.                 

60
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:04,656
    I haven't seen this one yet.

61
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,591
    Tomato paste.               
  Red-pepper paste.             

62
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,526
    Soybean oil.                
   White vinegar.               

63
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,062
                Lemon juice.    
Black pepper.                   

64
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:11,129
                  Turmeric.     
  Good call.                    

65
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,263
  You know your way             
 around the kitchen.            

66
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,298
                I've dabbled.   

67
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,600
                  Paprika.      
   Got it.                      

68
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:15,800
                   Cumin.       
 Curry powder.                  

69
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,336
   Garlic powder.               
        Salt.                   

70
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:19,071
  Onion powder.                 
               A little cayenne.

71
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:20,538
        Yeah.                   
And some ground ginger.         

72
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,674
             Got it. Now, is it 
             all chicken thigh? 

73
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,076
Yes. Now we'll throw            
the marinade in here.           

74
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,345
     It'll help to break it down
              with that yogurt. 

75
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:28,547
            And then we'll start
        to build the rotisserie.

76
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:29,614
   Watch me, now.               

77
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:30,882
          Two pieces of chicken!

78
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,151
                  Ah-ha-ha!     

79
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:35,487
              And three pieces  
               of chicken now!  

80
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,289
We're actually gonna sneak      
  in some lamb fat.             

81
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,423
                Hold please.    

82
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,624
It's definitely a secret        
   from back home.              

83
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,693
It actually melts off           
as the vertical boiler          

84
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,094
is cooking the chicken.         

85
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,363
A couple more pieces on top, and
  then the onion and the tomato.

86
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,365
           And then this will go
     to the vertical rotisserie.

87
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,768
The first layer takes roughly   
  about 45 minutes.             

88
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,835
                  Next up?      

89
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,437
   We make our own              
    tahini sauce.               

90
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,307
First, we'll start we the pure  
sesame-seed paste, sriracha...  

91
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:57,242
      You don't see that so much
     in the Middle Eastern menu.

92
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,109
     Not at all.                

93
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,844
...water, lemon juice...        

94
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,845
                 Yeah, yeah.    

95
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,447
...salt, garlic powder,         

96
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:06,451
cumin of course, cayenne pepper,
citric salt, black pepper.      

97
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,319
Get the arm workout in.         
  It's good to go.              

98
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,388
                    Wow!        
       I'll have a bowl of that.

99
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,656
     [ Laughs ]                 

100
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:12,390
        So now we're gonna build
           the chicken shawarma.

101
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,926
        I can have it in a bowl,
       I can have it as a salad,

102
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,795
     or I can have it as a wrap.
We make our own pita bread.     

103
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,263
         I'll have it as a wrap.
You got it.                     

104
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:22,134
  So this is yeast, sugar, salt,
         flour, and wheat flour.

105
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:23,335
      Yes, sir.                 
And a little bit of olive oil.  

106
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,403
We'll set it in here.           

107
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,005
                    Whoa!       
                Look at that!   

108
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,139
That's where the magic happens. 

109
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,540
       -Little hot though.      
             -Whoa!             

110
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,743
             Okay, there's steam
   coming out of the side of it.

111
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,678
        No can beat-a this pita.
                 It's moist.    

112
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,080
          It's got great texture
               on the outside.  

113
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,347
           Tender on the inside.

114
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,083
            The whole wheat adds
          some really nice body.

115
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,684
                  Dynamite.     

116
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,486
   It's like, raining chicken in
  Flavortown right there, buddy.

232
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,425
      I don't think I could have
          dreamed that pizza up,

233
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:07,826
               but I'm so glad  
           that I got to try it.

00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,974
        Now, typically on       
  "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives,"  

237
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,777
     we do not shoot joints     
  that are only open at night,  

238
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,245
         but we're here         
      in Vancouver, Canada,     

239
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:30,048
and we heard about a pizza joint
 where they're making their pies

240
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,051
   with a bunch of enthusiasm   
         and creativity,        

241
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,120

          of craziness,         

242
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,388
     just like their owner.     

243
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:41,392
  This is Corduroy Pie Company.

  Sausage and peppers, Brussels 
    sprouts, for table three.   

245
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,597
   WOMAN: There's a lot of pizza
                in Vancouver,   

246
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,865
            and I think Corduroy
                is different.   

247
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,466
Bacon and potato for table four.

248
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,871
 Super innovative, creative pies

  the ingredients that he uses.

      FIERI: That would be      
      Chef Graham Marceau,      

252

       who traded working       
         in fine dining         

253
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,613
 for a different slice of life. 

254
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,147
    Had you owned a pizza parlor
                before this?    

255
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,215
 I worked in several            
    pizza shops.                

256
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,149
          You worked in several?

257
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,351
                I've flown on   
             several airplanes, 

258
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:07,885
              I'm not a pilot.  

259
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,787
             That's all I have. 
        I'm gonna go after that.

260
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:10,422
             Good night, folks. 

261
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:11,690
So I just jumped in.            

262
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,624
We didn't want to just do       
pepperoni and mushroom,         

263
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,094
so we started curing stuff,     
started doing weird stuff.      

264
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,229
          Lamb sausage.         

265
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,164
 I got to say, the lamb sausage 
         is my favorite.        

266
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,899
        It's quite rich,        
    but then he cuts all that   

267
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,968
  with a little bit of acidity  
       with these grapes.       

268
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,436
   It's got some spice to it.   

269
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:26,170
   It's fresh. It's delicious.  

270
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,372
   We're gonna do               
a lamb sausage pizza.           

271
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:28,706
                Lamb sausage?   
  Correct.                      

272
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,108
             What is your crust?

273
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,510
We take a note out of the       
sourdough-bread-baking book.    

274
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,444
We basically start with this.   
It's called a poolish.          

275
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,646
                I get foolish   
              with the poolish. 

276
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:37,048
Ice-cold water here,            
 some baker's yeast,            

277
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,716
on top of our poolish here.     

278
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:39,918
                    Okay.       
   Sugar.                       

279
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,386
        Salt.                   
     Canola oil.                

280
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:42,787
Full-strength bread flour.      

281
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,188
 Whole-wheat flour.             
       My man.                  

282
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,124
We're gonna mix this            
for 10 minutes, rest it,        

283
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,992
then we're gonna mix it         
for another 10 minutes.         

284
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,260
    Bring it out.               
We're gonna portion.            

285
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,062
And then it goes in the fridge  
    for 24 hours.               

286
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,397
                    Okay.       

287
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,765
 So now we're making            
our house-made lamb sausage.    

288
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,467
                Let's see it.   
We ground the lamb shoulder.    

289
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:57,201
     Some salt.                 
Fresh-chopped oregano.          

290
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,337
    Chili flakes.               
Ground black pepper.            

291
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,205
  Minced garlic.                
           Let it set overnight.

292
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,008
               Let the flavors  
               come together.   

293
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,542
       What else is on this pie?
Sweet onions.                   

294
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,344
A little bit of Sicilian        
olive oil on the bottom.        

295
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,012
                        Okay.   
Olive oil on the top.           

296
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,748
    Fresh thyme.                

297
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,083
    Black pepper.               

298
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,552
  I really like how you just put
              the thyme there,  

299
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,953
           and the pepper there.

300
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,289
  We got some salt.             

301
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,091
      It's the flair and essence
               that makes it.   

302
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,226
 So we'll mix it up.            

303
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,694
    Roast at 650                
 for about an hour.             

304
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:24,696
                    Okay.       

305
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,564
A little bit of flour           
on top of the dough.            

306
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,433
I like to touch the bottom      
    on the board,               

307
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,301
flip it, and then flip it back, 

308
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,669
  and then we know              
the whole thing is coated.      

309
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:32,971
                      Got it.   
   And just start               
  with the fingers.             

310
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,172
Treat it like a baby.           

311
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:35,774
       -Do you have kids?       
            -I don't.           

312
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:36,975
         Yeah, you don't do that
                to your baby.   

313
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,311
          [ Laughter ]          

314
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:40,779
I just put it on the back       
    of my hands.                

315
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,380
I use my thumbs to guide it.    

316
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,916
               That's exactly   
             how I throw dough. 

317
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,117
          Gorgeous lookin' skin.

318
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,519
So this is a white sauce --     

319
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,387
crème fraîche thinned out       
with a whipping cream,          

320
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,923
  Parmesan cheese,              
 smoked mozzarella.             

321
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,459
Here's our lamb sausage.        

322
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,194
Roasted onions.                 
                  Look at those.

323
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,461
  Seedless grapes.              

324
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,197
    You just took it to the next
        level, just so you know.

325
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,064
 This is a good one.            

326
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,599
 Pepper. Some salt.             

327
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,934
  Fresh green kale.             

328
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:03,935
         All right. In the oven.

329
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,203
              -Yes.             
              -650.             

330
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,270
Give it a little shake.         

331
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,006
        Shimmy shimmy cocoa pop.
Six minutes.                    

332
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,341
Bada-bing, bada-boom.           

333
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,142
               Gorgeous, man.   

334
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,477
    Fresh basil.                

335
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:15,814
 Sicilian olive oil             
      on there.                 

336
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:18,616
                Time to eat.    

337
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,617
               It's delicious.  

338
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,086
      That lamb sausage on pizza

339
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,487
     is one of my new favorites.

340
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,288
                And the lamb    
          and the grape combo...

341
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,357
    And the kale coming through,

342
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,292
               which gives it   
       a really nice textural...

343
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,693
         You get this nice char.

344
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,495
      I don't think I could have
          dreamed that pizza up,

345
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,296
               but I'm so glad  
           that I got to try it.

346
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,365
              It's imaginative, 
             and it's delicious.

347
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,836
       That's a destination pie.
   People come here to get that.

348
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,504
     Because you won't find that
               anywhere else.   

349
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,506
      I got a lamb sausage      
          for the bar.          

350
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,507
  MAN: The lamb sausage itself  
           is amazing.          

351
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,177
It has that flavor that you want
     without that gaminess.     

352
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,778
               It's definitely  
         a little bit different.

353
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,547
   It's got the grapes on there,
             which is something 

354
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,716
 that I would never really think
             to put on a pizza. 

355
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:54,519
     Nice and crispy crust.     
      Lovely to bite into.      

356
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:55,853
          Good pizza, good room.

357
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,656
FIERI: There's some funk goin'  
on in the room, right?          

358
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,791
    This is like,               
some grandpa's old garage.      

359
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:00,992
          It's so cozy.         
         It's all wood.         

360
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,061
It feels like a ski lodge       
 meets a biker bar.             

361
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,796
      -Someone's basement.      
         -Your basement.        

362
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,531
Technically it is my basement.  
'Cause I live upstairs.         

363
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,067
                    Okay,       
             you had me at that.

364
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:12,270
It's laid back. There's craft   
beer, craft food, craft pizza.  

365
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,806
             Lamb & The Grapes. 
        That's my new band name.

366
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,075
              Our newest album  
             "Piece 'o the Pie."

367
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,276
              All right, Chef,  
                one more pie?   

368
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,744
 Done.                          
          Amatriciana.          

369
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:22,413
   The amatriciana is excellent.
        It's a little bit salty,

370
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,349
           a little bit of heat,
      a little bit of sweetness.

371
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,383
       I'll see you in a minute.
              You want a piece? 

372
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,818
           Good, let me make you
   one up here in just a second.

373
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,254
             I'll be right back 
                 with this.     

374
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,863
                  Aw, man.      

375
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:44,001
          [ Laughter ]          

376
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,938
 Welcome back. We're hanging out
         at Corduroy Pie Company

377
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,007
    in Vancouver, Canada, eh?   

378
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:49,940
     [ Laughs ]                 

379
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,408
     We are about creative pies,

380
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,878
               eclectic pies,   
             scratch-made pies. 

381
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,413
         The ingredients        
       that they use here,      

382
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,415
       it's just something      
    that's totally different.   

383
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,017
             FIERI:             
     Like this cheeky feast.    

384
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,484
   An amatriciana in the window.

385
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,654
       The amatriciana is       
     my go-to pie for sure.     

386
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:05,290
   It's based off of a classic  
       Italian pasta dish.      

387
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:07,558
   There's lot of sweet onions  
       on there, pancetta,      

388
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,026
   lots of the roasted garlic.  

389
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,094
          It's so good.         

390
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,229
                    Okay.       
            So what are we into?

391
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,363
     We're doing                
an amatriciana pizza.           

392
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,697
         Which is of my favorite
                pasta dishes.   

393
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,366
            Which -- it does not
                go on pizza.    

394
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:16,768
  No.                           
              So I'm just here  
           to let you know that.

395
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,503
 But here in Canada,            
 we break the rules.            

396
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,171
             Everybody says that
            about the Canadians,

397
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,173
         "rule-breakers," right?

398
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,707
So we got the cheeks            
   off some pigs.               

399
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:24,775
                 Guanciale.     

400
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,243
                These cheeks,   
             not the other ones.

401
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,980
What we do is, we cure them     
with kosher salt, sugar,        

402
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,514
    fennel seeds,               
    chili flakes,               

403
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:34,118
black pepper, bay leaf,         
freshly grated nutmeg.          

404
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,986
They're gonna go over...        

405
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:35,987
      How long is this gonna go?

406
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,188
A week in the fridge,           
  it's gonna cure.              

407
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,656
We're gonna cook it slow        
 for probably about             

408
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,058
   a half an hour,              
     45 minutes.                

409
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,992
         Okay. So now the sauce.

410
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,326
We got our diced pork cheek.    

411
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,329
We'll slowly render this out    
    in the oven.                

412
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:45,330
            Let me just tell you
                 something.     

413
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,198
             The dry brine that 
             you put on that... 

414
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,134
          Bro. I'd just sit with
              a bowl of those.  

415
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:50,935
                    Ohh.        

416
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,004
    Diced onion.                
   Oregano leaves.              

417
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:54,539
   Minced garlic.               
  And chili flakes.             

418
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,807
 A little stir-sky.             

419
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,208
So, we're gonna in...           

420
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,542
   Once our onions              
  are rendered out,             

421
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,110
we can add our tomato sauce.    

422
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,546
                It goes down    
            for how much longer?

423
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:02,880
 For about an hour.             

424
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:03,882
                At 650. Okay.   

425
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,082
We're ready to roll.            

426
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,552
 We got our finished            
amatriciana sauce here,         

427
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:11,222
Parmesan cheese, pickled onions 
that we pickle in-house,        

428
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,556
   cured cheek...               

429
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,758
              A cheeky fellow.  

430
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,493
  ...whole-roasted              
   garlic confit,               

431
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,029
aged mozzarella cheese,         
   fresh oregano,               

432
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,898
   a little salt,               
fresh cracked pepper.           

433
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,165
          Do you want to give me
              the pipe wrench?  

434
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,433
               I'll go get it.  
Pipe wrench?                    

435
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:23,835
             Yeah, so I can take
              the kitchen sink. 

436
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:26,036
           That's the only thing
             that's not on here.

437
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,372
                Buda-dum-bum.   
          I'll be here all week.

438
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,375
Six minutes in the oven.        

439
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,576
   Sizzle sizzle.               

440
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,911
          Like Mount Vesuvius --
      the volcano in Flavortown.

441
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,446
Some basil going on here.       

442
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,714
 Sicilian olive oil.            

443
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:37,781
   She's-a ready.               

444
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,785
                 Here we go.    

445
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:43,388
                 The sauce,     
       with the cured pork jowl,

446
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,923
      I want that on everything.

447
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,590
I don't know if you can offer it
            as a salad dressing,

448
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,458
             but I'll take some.

449
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,126
            The confit garlic...

450
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,262
               A genius touch.  

451
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:54,999
   You're taking one of the most
   beloved Italian pasta dishes,

452
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,134
       and go put it on a pizza.

453
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,138
  I would come in to try it just
   to prove that it didn't work.

454
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,807
           You put it on a pizza
     just to prove that it does.

455
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:03,541
                Outstanding.    

456
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,343
    Thanks, man.                

457
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,878
          Amatriciana.          
          Table eleven.         

458
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,947
  The amatriciana is definitely 
          my favorite.          

459
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:12,083
      The red sauce is not      
your typical pizza tomato sauce.
