1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,267
           Hey, there.          

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,735
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:07,139
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:08,540
          This trip...          
                  Out of bounds.

5
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,542
 ...I think I found the answer. 

6
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,611
   If something makes you young,
               it's jambalaya.  

7
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:15,013
    The trio of soup, salad,    
          and seafood.          

8
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,149
       This will make you happy,
                    man.        

9
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:19,217
    In Franklin, Tennessee...   

10
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,285
You got a little twang,         
      you know.                 

11
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:21,686
       I'm throwing twang in it!
You're doing good.              

12
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,422
     ...the Double Cinco...     

13
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:24,489
                Just a little   
            something-something.

14
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,892
          ...tossing up         
      outrageous oysters...     

15
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,426
                Look at that!   

16
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,429
         ...and a fiery         
     fried-chicken sandwich.    

17
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,364
              I'm not gonna fit 
               in my swimsuit.  

18
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,898
   In Kansas City, Missouri...  

19
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,968
            You should smell it,
                 by the way.    

20
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,702
 ...a down-home comfort joint...

21
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,505
                   That's       
            my campaign message.

22
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:41,640
        ...where the name       
        just says it all.       

23
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:44,043
       You name yourself PotPie,
            you better deliver. 

24
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:46,244
      Then in Nashville...      

25
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,312
     Here we go.                
   Coming at you.               

26
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,648
      ...the funky café...      
                 It's medicinal.

27
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,183
Medieval is more like it.       

28
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:54,386
      ...where eating well      
       means eating well.       

29
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,855
             You eat good, then 
       you can eat naughty, too.

30
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,657
That's a hell of a way          
  to put it, girl.              

31
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,992
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

32
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,661
         on "Triple D."         

35
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:18,743
 So, I'm about 15 minutes south 
     of downtown Nashville.     

36
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,213
 But more importantly, I'm only 
like an hour north of Lynchburg.

37
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,348
       You know, the home       

38
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,950
       of the world-famous      
    Jack Daniel's distillery.   

39
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,019
            Come on.            

40
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:28,687
    Anyhow, I'm in Franklin,    
           Tennessee,           

41
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,756
      to check out a joint      
   that the people in the know  

42
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,223
        say I got to see.       

43
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:33,625
        This is 55 South.       

44
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,297
             Pork Chop Sandwich.

45
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:41,300
 There's no better place to be. 
     Everything is perfect.     

46
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:43,301
   Hot Chicken, bag of shrimp.  

47
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:44,369
        Food is amazing.        

48
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,038
         It's different.        
     It's fresh. It's tasty.    

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,373
           McCONNELL:           
       BLT in the window.       

50
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,308
 Plenty of variety. That's what 
      makes it really good.     

51
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,643
       FIERI: And all part      

52
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,378
      of Jason McConnell's      
        personal roadmap,       

53
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,582
   a poli-sci grad turned off   
        by D.C. politics        

54
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:59,384
          and turned on         
      by southern cooking.      

55
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:05,190
 And in 2010, it all became part
      of the 55 South menu.     

56
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,658
It's a little bit of everything.

57
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,596
   Cajun, it's country, it's a  
little bit of Memphis, Franklin.

58
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,466
    FIERI: Even a local dish    
 I like to get when I'm in town.

59
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,201
        The Hot Chicken.        

60
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:18,337
The Hot Chicken knocks it       
  out of the park.              

61
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:20,472
     It'll set you on fire.     

62
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,739
                 What are we    
              gonna make first? 

63
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,942
We are going to make            
Hot Chicken marinade.           

64
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,610
                       Marinade.
You got a little twang,         
      you know.                 

65
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,345
       I'm throwing twang in it!
You're doing good.              

66
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,014
We got a little paprika.        

67
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:32,283
It's the base, 'cause           
you want to have red chicken.   

68
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:36,555
We got salt, black pepper,      
Louisiana hot sauce, cayenne.   

69
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,957
                [ Whistles ]    

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,959
 Granulated garlic.             

71
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,896
    A little oil.               

72
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:46,498
You want to get this            
   kind of going.               

73
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,032
Got a little bit of water.      

74
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,035
This is paste.                  
                This is spackle.

75
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,773
 That's the napalm.             

76
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,574
             If you can't afford
                pepper spray,   

77
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,778
     just carry a handful of it 
when you walk down a dark alley.

78
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,048
             Look at that look. 

79
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,451
 It's not that bad.             

80
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,319
                  Awesome.      

81
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,320
We're gonna marinate            

82
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:10,989
and finish the chicken sandwich 
     with this.                 

83
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,924
  We're gonna save              
 just a little bit.             

84
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,726
We'll put the chicken           
      in this.                  

85
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,529
     Old Ranger Danger over here
       took the chicken breasts 

86
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,064
     and gave it a little score.

87
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,667
              You know, just -- 
   [ Squelch! ] -- sucked it up.

88
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,936
   Just gonna get               
  the paste on it.              

89
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:26,338
      How long would you really 
      like to let this marinate?

90
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,539
  A couple of days.             

91
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,276
            Now we're gonna make
                 the dredge.    

92
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,410
  We got some flour             

93
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,746
with a little baking powder     
       in it.                   

94
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,548
 Granulated garlic.             

95
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,682
  A little paprika.             

96
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,151
We really want to get           
 some color in that.            

97
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,553
      Cayenne.                  

98
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,221
  Creole seasoning.             

99
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,489
     More salt.                 
                       Okay.    

100
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,491
          Kind of an all-purpose
                Cajun dredge.   

101
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,163
   And then we got              
 our atomic chicken.            

102
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,900
We got the oil.                 
                    Got the oil.

103
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,901
We're just gonna lay            
      that in.                  

104
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,370
              No dropping these 
                into a fryer.   

105
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:01,106
  No, you got to go             
with the skillet. 375.          

106
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,040
          Three to five minutes?
 Yeah.                          

107
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,245
      The key here is that score
               to that breast.  

108
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,947
           That's where you let 
  the funkalicious get in there.

109
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,317
  We're good. Okay.             

110
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,720
 So, we're gonna do             
a little white bread.           

111
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:15,988
                    White bread.
 Little mayo.                   

112
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,390
  A little schmear.             

113
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,925
     Two pieces.                
                     Two?       

114
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,526
              I'm not gonna fit 
               in my swimsuit.  

115
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,730
 A breast, a breast.            

116
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,867
           You're gonna put more
              of that on there? 

117
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,802
               Enough already.  

118
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,337
     That's the way you normally
            make it for people? 

119
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,471
        Yeah,                   
it's the perfect amount.        

120
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,340
This is a key component.        

121
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,676
  You got to have               
  lots of pickles.              

122
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:40,812
And always, you know,           
you got to give it the --       

123
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,080
bring it all together.          

124
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,550
                 A lot more     
           than I bargained for.

125
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:46,718
                Just a little   
            something-something.

126
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,520
                 Here we go.    

127
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,358
                  Not hot.      

128
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,893
              I have any here?  

129
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:58,363
              Not here or here, 
          but, like, right here.

130
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,564
      A little.                 
                     Little bit?

    You're good.

              is super tender.  

133
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,371
     There's great crunch, nice 
   texture on the outside of it.

134
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:07,639
               Not overly done  
                with batter.    

135
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,307
                 The pickles    
             are the only thing

          the texture, flavor --

Well over a million.

           I'm having           
    the char-grilled oysters.   

164
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:12,570
    It's oysters with cheese    
 and goodness and wholesomeness

     and all kinds of other

some char-grilled oysters.      

167
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:22,047

    some oysters.

173
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:38,062
We're gonna do our cheese,      
 parmesan-reggiano,             

174
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,798
 grated mozzarella,             
chopped Italian parsley,

a little lemon zest,

  a little Creole.              

177

Stir this bad boy up.           
And then we're going on top.

      a grilled cheese sandwich.

181
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,282
Exactly.                        
        I like the way you roll.

182
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,417
It's Tennessee oysters.         
           Now where do they go?

183
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,486

We'll get a little melt         
   on the cheese.               

186
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:10,429
Splash of the butter.           
    Tray on top.

            piece of that bread.

194

        to it is out of bounds.

                That's where    
             the magic happens!

00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,404
      after the chicken sandwich
                that we had.    
Keeps you young.                

215
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,607
   If something makes you young,
               it's jambalaya.  

216
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,675

            In your jambalaya --

218

   Mine, I like to do pork butt,
               chicken thighs,  

219
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,014
               smoked sausage,  
                holy trinity.   

220
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,549
                   I mean,      
           I go the whole gamut.

221
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,216
      Is that where we're going?
Chicken and andouille.          

222
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,453
          Chicken and andouille.
We make the andouille here.     

223
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,555
           You make the sausage?
 We do.                         

224
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,491
              Of course you do. 

225
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,028
             The mise is ready. 

226

put some blended oil in.        

228
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:57,636
      Chicken.                  
   This is breast.              

229
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,638
We're gonna get that going      
 just for a second.             

230
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,039
  Got some celery.              

231
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,309
 Bell pepper, onion,            
  a little garlic.              

232
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,177
                      Loving it.
Let that go for a second.       

233
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,712
Really just kind of breaking up 
the chicken in there            

234
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,547
    a little bit.               
                       I gotcha.

235
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,783
 We're gonna cut up             
some of this andouille.         

236
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,885
                Look at that.   

237
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,190
So, we got the sausage          
      going in.                 

238
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,792
               I like the way   
              this looks, man.  

239
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,326
   We're gonna do               
   some dry thyme,              

240
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:26,164
   basil, oregano,              
chopped Italian parsley.        

241
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,933
                      Hot sauce.
Louisiana hot sauce.            

242
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,734
       Creole.                  

243
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,135
                I like where    
           you're going with it.

244
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,737
And then we're gonna do         
    our liquids.                

245
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,473
   Tomato juice.                
   Chicken stock.               

246
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:39,410
     Little bit                 
 of crushed tomato.             

247
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,613
 Got a little simmer            
      going on.                 

248
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:44,616
   We're gonna add              
some long-grain rice.           

249
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,284
And now you can't leave         
   till it's over.              

250
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,619
  We're just gonna              
  let that simmer               

251
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,789
until all the rice absorbs      
the liquid, and that's it.      

252
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,693
    If you got to make any phone
     calls, check your e-mails, 

253
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:55,827
             I can watch the pot
                 for a bit.     

254
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,298
               Looks awesome.   

255
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,902
     Good color, lot of product,
               lot of sausage.  

256
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,973
And a little extra hot sauce    
     on the top.                

257
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,442
Some fresh scallions.           
     That's it.                 

258
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,311
           That's all she wrote.

259
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:19,784
              What we have here 
         is real-deal jambalaya.

260
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,053
               Not too spicy.   

261
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:25,523
           The really nice piece
              is the andouille. 

262
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,325
                 Great smoke    
             coming out of that.

263
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,794
   But that's the little element
   that pushes it over the top. 

264
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,129
                It just makes   
             all the difference.

265
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,797
             The rice is tender.

266
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,265
               Little scallion  
               on the outside.  

267
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,801
        Nice, round heat coming 
       from that Cajun seasoning

268
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,202
      and the spices you put in.

269
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,005
       This will make you happy,
                    man.        

270
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,439
                 My friend.     

271
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,011
 Chicken and sausage jambalaya. 

272
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:48,747
          It's so good.         

273
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:51,749
    LORI: It's not too spicy.   
       It's just perfect.       

274
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,151
        It's good to know       

275
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,752
   that we won't have to just   
 travel down to New Orleans now 

276
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,388
  to enjoy some good jambalaya. 
  You see?                      

277
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,627
       FIERI: Coming up...      
             Look at that thing.

278
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,162
         ...we're headed        
   to Kansas City, Missouri...  

279
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,629
                Put the rest    
         of this magic together.

280
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,767
  ...for the perfect ingredient 
           in pot pie.          

281
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,268
                  The juju.     
          Put the juju in there.

282
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:20,078
     So, if I'm in Chicago,     
       what do you expect?      

283
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,279
       Exactly. Hot dogs.       

284
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,281
     San Diego? Fish tacos.     

285
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,216
    New Orleans -- po' boys.    

286
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,885
 North Carolina -- pulled pork. 
        You get the idea.       

287
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,555
      So here I am midtown      
     Kansas City, Missouri.     

288
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,290
       What do you expect?      
           You got it.          

289
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,358
         This is PotPie.        

290
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,762
            Pot pie.            
MAN: Pot pie is classic.        

291
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,297
       Kansas City comfort food.
Exactly.                        

292
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,765
            WILLIAMS:           
     I got three pies going.    

293
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,367
It's my buddy Steve Post        
   with MRN Radio.              

294
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,503
This dude's legit. What do      
you think of the pot pie?       

295
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,838
     This is absolutely amazing.
See?                            

296
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,974
      Okay, Sarah, I got a pasta
         and a pie ready to go. 

297
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,910
              MAN:              
    Their menu is so simple.    

298
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,712
  They just tend to execute it  
           very well.           

299
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,246
      MAN #2: There's a lot     
     of attention to detail.    

300
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,781
         It's inventive         
   without being pretentious.   

301
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,583
             FIERI:             
   The same way you'd describe  

302
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,852
  French-trained chef and owner 
         John Williams.         

303
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,722
We follow standard, you know,   
  French technique.             

304
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,656
               You Frenchified  
                comfort food.   

305
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:06,858
        Sure.                   

306
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,527
  And when he opened this joint 
            in 2003,            

307
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,796
  the name was an afterthought. 

308
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,798
We didn't even have pot pies    
the first few months we opened. 

309
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,933
                 Seriously?     

310
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:17,001
                 What makes     
             righteous pot pie? 

311
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,136
     Good juju.                 

312
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:19,270
You put the good energy into it 
  when you make it,             

313
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,939
and that's what they get        
  when they eat it.             

314
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,941
  That juju's working its magic 
       in two versions --       

315
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,945
  one with beef and mushrooms,  
  the other -- braised chicken. 

316
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,215
        Chicken pot pie.        
        Very hot tonight.       

317
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,884
      It's the best version     
       of a comfort food.       

318
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,819
               All right, man.  
                Get it going.   

319
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,020
        Okay.                   
   Fresh chicken.               

320
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,822
  I'll season it,               
  salt and pepper.              

321
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:39,023
Our pan is plenty hot.          

322
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,892
     Sear it off                
skin side down like that,       

323
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,695
     try to get                 
 a nice, good color.            

324
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:46,297
Searing this off is the first   
step in building flavor.        

325
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,099
             Rendering the fat. 
                  I dig it.     

326
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,633
We'll pull them out.            
                           Okay.

327
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,569
Onions, celery, carrots.        

328
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,037
             A little mirepoix. 
Yep.                            

329
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,105
   We add garlic.               
   Sweat it good.               

330
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,041
Now we'll return the chicken    
     to the pot.                

331
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,844
                      Got it.   
Hot chicken stock.              

332
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:02,113
   That's been on               
since yesterday afternoon.      

333
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,381
                        Wow.    
Cook that overnight.            

334
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,916
                  How long      
           we gonna let this go?

335
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,784
    This will go                
 for about an hour.             

336
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,919
Cover it with tinfoil.          

337
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,187
            You should smell it,
                 by the way.    

338
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,189
                    Ooh.        
           In the oven how long?

339
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:12,991
 For about an hour.             
    Bring it out.               

340
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,593
                      Strain it?
  Yeah, lay it out,             
    cool it down.               

341
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,195
  Pick it. Pick it.             

342
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,296
              For the filling,  
             what are we doing? 

343
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,199
  We're gonna start             
by getting our broth going      

344
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:25,469
with mirepoix -- onions,        
celery, carrots, garlic.        

345
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,004
                    Wow.        
   And leeks.                   

346
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,406
   Leeks, I think,              
    are the key.                

347
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,341
           I don't think people 
    use enough leeks in general.

348
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,409
      It really adds that depth.

349
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,610
                   That's       
            my campaign message.

350
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,345
         Two leeks in every pot.

351
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,613
      Like it.                  
 I'll get on board.             

352
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,948
     So, we got                 
 the mirepoix going.            

353
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,149
Got good color on it.           

354
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,619
And we're gonna go ahead        
and add some chicken stock.     

355
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,621
 So, this is coming             
     to a boil.                 

356
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:44,889
      Season it                 
with salt and pepper.           

357
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:45,824
       Thyme.                   

358
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,158
                    Ooh.        
         Lots of thyme for this.

359
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,559
Now I'm gonna add my roux.      

360
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:49,693
              This is the flour 
                and the fat.    

361
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,695
We'll whisk that smooth.        

362
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,163
 We've got the roux             
    incorporated.               

363
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,165
We add a little bit of corn     
  right at the end.             

364
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,300
Now all we got to do            
  is assemble them.             

365
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,301
             Okay. Put the rest 
         of this magic together.

366
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,970
This is our picked chicken.     

367
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:01,239
Put a goodly amount,            
  but not too much.             

368
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,773
Ladle the broth over.           

369
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,976
                Just give me    
               a bowl of that.  

370
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:06,577
This is puff pastry.            
                        Got it. 

371
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,645
Salt and pepper on top.         

372
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,380
         That's it? In the oven?
                  How long?     

373
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:10,648
  About 10 minutes.             

374
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,916
                     Oh!        

375
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,784
See the steam coming out.       

376
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,520
That's a definite sign          
  that it's ready.              

377
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,654
             Look at that thing.

378
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,423
         Half a chicken in there
                practically.    

379
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,060
                    Mmm.        
                It's creamy.    

380
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,394
           There's enough pastry
                   to it.       

381
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,863
                Nice veggies.   
       The flavor's really deep.

382
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,199
                 Delicious.     

383
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,199
                  Brother,      
        I'm gonna tell you this.

384
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,534
       You name yourself PotPie,

385
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,804
         which we've never seen 
   in the history of "Triple D,"

386
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:33,804
             you better deliver.

387
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,140
         And you delivered, man.

388
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:37,808
                    Mmm.        

389
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,810
                  The juju.     

390
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:39,911
   The juju.                    
          Put the juju in there.

391
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,482
              The inside of it  
                is fantastic.   

392
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:45,883
              I mean, the meat  
        and all the stuff in it.

393
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,686
   But this crust on the outside
              is so incredible. 

394
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,955
  Something you definitely want 
    to eat on a winter's day.   

395
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:53,024
 Just down-home, wonderful food.

396
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:55,426
          Your scallops         
      with wild asparagus.      

397
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,527
        It's pretty much        
    our favorite restaurant.    

398
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,496
    You'll have to come here    
    for, like, a date night,    

399
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,231
    those special occasions.    

400
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,167
       You guys had your wedding
        catered by these folks? 

401
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,435
   We had it here.              

402
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,371
        You had the wedding here
                  in PotPie?    
Here at PotPie.                 

403
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,773
   We want to feed our people,  
 and this is our favorite food, 

404
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:09,907
    so bring the people here.   

405
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,910
            WILLIAMS:           
   Chicken pasta, table four.   

406
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,377
 Every time I eat here, I think,

407
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,579
   "When's the next time we're  
   gonna get to go back here?"  

408
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,448
               Ceremony again?  
       You gonna renew the vows?

409
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,784
       When you do it, just make
        sure that -- I'll come. 

410
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,787
     Simple, refined, balanced. 
   What you see is what you get.

411
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,088
       Right.                   
                      Well done.

412
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:28,793
        FIERI: Up next...       

413
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,528
     I can hear                 
the one squirrel in there       

414
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,529
pedaling his heart out.         

415
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,430
 ...we're headed to Nashville...

416
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,532
   This is, like,               
the healthiest thing            

417
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:35,799
   I've ever eaten              
   on "Triple D."               

418
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,336
  ...for a joint that's rocking 
      a new trend in town.      

419
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,470
If I lived in Nashville,        

420
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:40,438
   I'd be by two,               
 three times a week.            

421
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:51,715
 So, I'm about 10 minutes from  
 downtown Nashville, Tennessee, 

422
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,117
   right over by the airport.   

423
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,186
Now, a lot of people think about
 Nashville, what do they think? 

424
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,988
     They think great music,    
        killer barbecue.        

425
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,122
       But you know what?       
      There's another side.     

426
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,858
   The eclectic mix of people   
         that live here.        

427
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,260
   That's why there's a joint   

428
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:05,196
   that's serving up a really   
  funky, unique, healthy menu.  

429
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,832
You got to check out Phat Bites.

430
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,336
         Hummus Envy up.        

431
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,272
             We are so thrilled 
       that we found Phat Bites.

432
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,607
     WOMAN: It's different.     

433
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,476
      You don't really get      
 this type of food in Nashville.

434
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,744
    Salad Trio in the window.   

435
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,746
         MAN: I mean, these are 
     the kind of spots you want,

436
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:24,482
       'cause you just can't eat
            barbecue every day. 
 Exactly.                       

437
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,618
 FIERI: A philosophy that owner 
 Julie Buhler's been dishing out

438
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,022
        since she opened        
    this funky joint in '02.    

439
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:33,557
             You eat good, then 
       you can eat naughty, too.

440
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,093
That's a hell of a way          
  to put it, girl.              

441
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:37,428
          And it raises         
       another question...      

442
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,430
Why'd you call it "phat"?       
           Pretty hot and tasty.

443
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:42,700
      And I want it to have fat 
   sandwiches and skinny salads.

444
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:46,036
 So, for the fat, she's got you 
     covered with sandwiches    

445
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:49,506
like The Big Jerk with jerk pork
     and caramelized onions.    

446
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,908
          It's awesome.         

447
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,711
   FIERI: And The Ninja Bomb    
   with Chinese chicken salad   

448
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,646
   and -- get this -- granola.  

449
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:58,049
            It's like breakfast 
           in a turkey sandwich.

450
00:16:58,051 --> 00:16:59,850
  As for the skinny, how about  

451
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,987
       at least two dozen       
   homemade salads every day?   

452
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:04,989
          Long Life up!         

453
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,323
 The Long Life Salad is amazing.

454
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:10,194
   Raw kale salad with beans,   
    quinoa, kale, nutrients,    

455
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,597
       you know, something      
   that's actually gonna give   

456
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,798
     some life to your body.    

457
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,732
The Long Life Salad.            

458
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:15,867
     All right.                 
So, let's get into it.          

459
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,668
              Black-eyed peas.  

460
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,803
           Christmas lima beans.

461
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,538
Christmas lima beans?           

462
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,140
  They're just a little prettier
       than regular lima beans. 

463
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,074
   Yes, they are.               

464
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:25,676
                Black beans.    
               Split lentils.   

465
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,345
     Here we go.                
   Coming at you.               
                      All right.

466
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,219
        So, these are gonna soak
                 overnight.     

467
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,287
    Now, next up?               

468
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,022
            We're gonna put them
                in the pots.    

469
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:40,024
       We have to cook them now.
                Come up here.   

470
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,893
You have to cook them           
  all individually.             

471
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,930
As much as they can handle,     
       right?                   
             Right there's good.

472
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,438
  Okay. So, we got              
all of our beans on.            

473
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,373
                  Next up,      
        we can start red quinoa.

474
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,776
            And then just water.

475
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,911
So, that's going. The beans     
are going. What's next?         

476
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,713
      Okay, now we're gonna make
              the vinaigrette.  

477
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:03,647
     Very nice.                 

478
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,849
        Lemon peel, orange peel.

479
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,252
  Bunch of ginger.              

480
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,721
         I'm gonna process that 
      just real quick by itself.

481
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,590
   What yard sale               
did you get that from?          

482
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,859
               It's just old!   
                 I like it!     

483
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,527
     I can hear                 
the one squirrel in there       

484
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,795
pedaling his heart out.         

485
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,098
     Okay, now I have to stop it
              just one second.  

486
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,333
Coconut oil.                    
              Coconut oil. Yeah.

487
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:26,136
     This thing                 
is not gonna go another --      

488
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,405
         It will. It'll be fine.

489
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,474
That was orange juice,          
   fresh-squeezed?              

490
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,210
               Fresh-squeezed   
               orange juice.    

491
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:33,277
Fresh-squeezed lemon juice.     

492
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,444
                Fresh lemon.    

493
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:36,814
                    Okay.       
And that's our vinaigrette?     

494
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,816
  Can I taste this?             
                      Yes.      

495
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,551
              It's very zesty.  

496
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,620
 Oh, my God. It's --            

497
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,954
 If you have a cold,            
      come down                 

498
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,990
and have just, like,            
a taste of the dressing.        

499
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,025
There's enough vitamin C in it  
for the rest of your life.      

500
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,092
               It's medicinal.  

501
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,895
Medieval is more like it.       

502
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:55,233
Finally, we're almost           
to the end of the journey.      

503
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,435
I understand why you call it    
  Long Life Salad.              

504
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,236
You have to have a long life    
to be able to make it.          

505
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,104
                    Yes.        

506
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,039
       Hit it.                  
                  Ready? Okay.  

507
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,707
 A whole garden full            
      of kale.                  

508
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,843
The beans that we soaked,       
then cooked, then rinsed.       

509
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:09,313
               And the quinoa.  

510
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,115
           Christmas lima beans.

511
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,450
              Black-eyed peas.  

512
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,051
                   Pecans.      

513
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:15,786
             Dried cranberries. 

514
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:16,921
                  Mangoes.      

515
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:18,722
Plump golden raisins.           

516
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,857
Plums. That's a kicker.         
You don't see that every day.   

517
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,460
         Our citrus vinaigrette.

518
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,731
         Salt and ground pepper.

519
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,733
           Now I'm gonna mix it.
You're gonna get in there,      
     aren't you?                

520
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,138
   This is, like,               
the healthiest thing            

521
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,139
   I've ever eaten              
   on "Triple D."               

522
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,175
   But serve me up              
 a handful of this.             

523
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,078
Killer. Really good.            

524
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,279
This is what I love to eat.     

525
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,081
                 Thank you.     
   Oh, I'm so glad you liked it.

526
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,485
The crunch of the kale,         

527
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,822
the quinoa, the dried mango,    
 the cranberries --             

528
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,224
If you did eat this,            
you would have a long life.     

529
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,558
                    Yes.        

530
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,828
If I lived in Nashville         
or within the surrounding area, 

531
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,763
I'd be by two, three times      
 a week to get this.            

532
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,832
                     Oh!        
          I wish you lived here.

533
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,033
         [ Both laugh ]         

534
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,569
     Here is your Long Life     
          Salad plate.          

535
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,038
      It tastes delicious,      
        and it's awesome.       

536
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,041
 I really do feel like 20 years 
   just got put onto my life.   

537
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,310
             WOMAN:             
      The place is special.     

538
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:14,044
 It just has a lot of character,
          super funky.          

539
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,046
 Listen, I have been            
in some funky joints.           

540
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,582
And where are we?               
I mean, across the street       
from a tire shop,               

541
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,185
next to an old car wash         
that's all graffiti'ed up.      

542
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,186
Which I heard                   
you had a hand in.              
                    That's mine.

543
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,522
             FIERI:             
    And now it's everybody's,   

544
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:27,191
  'cause their customers aren't 
   just using it for parking.   

545
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,994
     It's now a giant canvas    
       for local artists.       

546
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,262
      We have seen some big     

547
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:32,863
  diners, drive-ins, and dives  
         setups before.         

548
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:34,398
     Nothing to this degree.    

549
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,833
  That's going big "Triple D."  

550
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,769
           How's that?          

551
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:43,407
        So, that's it for       
this road trip, but don't worry.

552
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,276
    We got plenty more joints   
 to find all over this country! 

553
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,479
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

554
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,614
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

555
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,150
Hey, if anybody has a food      
  processor at home             

556
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:54,951
     they like,                 
  bring it on down.             

557
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,121
    This thing's                
  on its last leg.
