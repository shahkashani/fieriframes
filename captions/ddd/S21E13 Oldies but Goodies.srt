00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:02,334
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:03,802
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:06,805
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:07,872
          This trip...          

5
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:09,674
                     Ohh!       
  ...we're going old school...  

6
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,477
               This is, like,   
          old-school old school.

7
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:14,746
   ...looking for joints that   
are cranking out the classics...

8
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,882
 I think that's why they've been
  in business almost 100 years. 

9
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,151
    ...on Brigantine Island,    
          New Jersey...         

10
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:20,819
      This is the kind of place 
      people would love to have.

11
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:22,154
  ...a throwback butcher shop...

12
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:23,889
   I like the knife skills, man.
         You're right after it. 

13
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,158
           ...keeping           
   a meaty tradition alive...   

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,559
                     Real deal. 
 Appreciate it.                 

15
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,761
       ...In Leeds Point,       
          New Jersey...         

16
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:30,963
            We are in the middle
                 of nowhere.    

17
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:32,364
  ...a decades-old landmark...  

18
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,898
 I'm gonna give you             
some points right there.        

19
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,302
    ...where the menu rocks,    
   and the view is top-notch.   

20
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:38,303
                I'll be back.   

21
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:39,505
All right, very good.           

22
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:40,906
               All I got to do  
               is get a boat.   

23
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:42,641
  ...and in Des Moines, Iowa... 

24
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:43,975
                  That's...     
    Money.                      

25
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,845
         ...a legendary         
    All-American drive-in...    

26
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,647
             He's been doing it 
               62 years here.   

27
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:51,250
         ...where chili         
      still reigns as king.     

28
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:53,118
               That's the best  
               I've ever had.   

29
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,120
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

30
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,589
     on "Diners, Drive-Ins,     
           and Dives."          

31
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:12,337
 Be right with you.             

32
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:13,605
                 Thank you.     

33
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,607
      So, listen, you guys      
  are saying it all the time -- 

34
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:19,011
  "Guy, the name of the show is 
 'Diners,<i> Drive-Ins,</i> and Dives,'

35
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:20,879
        and we don't see        
    many drive-ins anymore."    

36
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,148
   Well, that's the sad truth.  
     There's not many left.     

37
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,749
               So,              
  I'm here in Des Moines, Iowa, 

38
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,085
     and I hear they've got     
      a legendary drive-in      

39
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,087
    that's owned by royalty.    

40
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,091
 You know I got to check it out.
 This is George the Chili King. 

41
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,496
        It's the classic        
       American drive-in.       

42
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:39,631
       MAN: It reminds you      
     of "American Graffiti,"    

43
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,300
          "Happy Days."         

44
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:44,502
 Food is exactly what you would 
 expect from a place like this. 

45
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,572
       It's old-fashioned.      
           It's good.           

46
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:47,973
            Chili up.           

47
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,908
     What makes                 
George the Chili King so great? 

48
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,976
                    Well,       
           George is number one.

49
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,312
             FIERI:             
   Actually, he's number two.   

50
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:55,314
      George Karaidos' dad,     
           George Sr.,          

51
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:57,249
      was the first to open     
          a chili joint         

52
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:00,452
  after winning a local contest 
      nearly a century ago.     

53
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:04,522
The Des Moines Register crowned 
him "George the Chili King."    

54
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,658
                   FIERI:       
       Started in 1920 downtown.

55
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,792
              Opened this one,  

56
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,927
           made you take it over
              when you were 19. 

57
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:09,862
        Yes.                    

58
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:12,130
             He's been doing it 
               62 years here.   

59
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,532
   That's correct.              

60
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,233
      George the Chili King     
  is a Des Moines institution.  

61
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,269
  His chili is the best-tasting 
         in Des Moines.         

62
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:21,139
        I get it at least       
    once a week, every week.    

63
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,141
     Seriously?                 

64
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:23,575
           Seriously.           

65
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:25,810
            FIERI: Now, was this
             your dad's recipe? 

66
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,812
    Yes, it was.                

67
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,882
    And this pot                
came off a battleship.          

68
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:31,482
         I see "U.S." something.

69
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,418
    And the year                
      -- 1944.                  

70
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,686
             '44. That's crazy. 

71
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,087
We start out with suet.         

72
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,823
              Ground-beef fat.  
   Uh-huh.                      

73
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:38,957
              So, we wait till  
             this renders down. 

74
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:39,958
        Yeah.                   

75
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,359
          Then we drop the meat.
 Right.                         

76
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,628
          Look at that beautiful
                ground chuck.   

77
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,096
    Look at that.               
    Ground chuck.               

78
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:47,232
  You look like you've done this
     before for maybe 60 years. 

79
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,169
             All right, George, 
             we've cooked down. 

80
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,503
  Yeah, now we add              
     the spices.                

81
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,305
     There goes                 
  the chili powder.             

82
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:54,439
                     Cumin?     
     Uh-huh.                    

83
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,574
  Ground allspice.              

84
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:56,575
             Granulated garlic. 

85
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,643
     To give it                 
that I-talian taste.            

86
00:02:58,645 --> 00:02:59,978
            That I-talian taste.

87
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,912
    [ Chuckles ]                

88
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:01,913
   A little salt.               

89
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,048
              Wow, there we go. 

90
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,182
A little cayenne pepper.        

91
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,119
        George is pretty liberal
          with the spices here. 

92
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,254
  Okay, now we put              
the cracker meal in.            

93
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:10,889
        Cracker meal's going in.

94
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:12,991
   In the pot now.              

95
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,192
          I'm trying to, George.

96
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,461
            I'm dusted right now
            by the cracker meal.

97
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,197
              I can't even see. 
I got to wear goggles over here.

98
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,197
                   [ Coughs ]   
   Good job.                    

99
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,265
             Thank you, George. 

100
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:23,534
Now, this cracker meal          
 gives it the body.             

101
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,636
Kind of like a gravy.           

102
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,406
      Now, see,                 
 this is pretty dry.            

103
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:28,606
             I got ahold of her.
                    Yeah.       

104
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,741
  So add more suet.             

105
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:32,811
               When in doubt,   
              pour more fat in. 

106
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,078
        Yeah.                   

107
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,483
      You're at a ratio of about
           65%-35% fat to meat. 

108
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,419
 I think that's why they've been
  in business almost 100 years. 

109
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,623
 We put it in a pan             
     like this.                 

110
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,025
We add water and beans.         

111
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,360
      When we get to this point,
                 we're done.    

112
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:49,628
     We're done.                

113
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,564
    It's got, like, a little bit
        of a gravy consistency. 

114
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,765
        Yeah.

00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,767
I put crackers. I can't         
eat it without crackers.        

116
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,702
              Yeah, got to have 
               some crackers.

         A little bit of cheese?
               You go cheese?   
Yeah, a little bit              
    of cheese.

  All right, I want to make sure
         I do it the right way.

             to be the new guy.

                 Can I have     
           some of these onions?

121
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,510

   The beans also work into that
        velvety smooth texture.

     The chili is fantastic.    

138

     It's kind of gravy-like    
           and spicy.

00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:34,539
   ...and the shrimp sizes up.  

457
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,373
        Whoa!                   
  That's a monster.             

458
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,850
I'm here at the end of the road.
   No, not in a negative way.   

459
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,386
          I'm literally         
     at the end of the road.    

460
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,653
       I'm in Leeds Point.      

461
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,189
     I'm like 20 miles away     
     from Atlantic City...      

462
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,589
     I know. Atlantic City.     

463
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,792
  ...to check out a joint where 
they've been serving it up fresh

464
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,194
           since 1938.          

465
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,963
We're talking three generations.
  This is the Oyster Creek Inn. 

466
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:04,202
Got two Jersey Devil Shrimp     
   in two minutes.              

467
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,805
 There's no disappointment here,
 especially if you love seafood.

468
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:11,276
 I work all week to look forward
    to coming here on Friday.   

469
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:12,876
          Scallop app.          

470
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,412
     Delicious. Incredible.     

471
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,682
      Oyster Creek is like      
     stepping back in time.     

472
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:20,284
    'Cause this local legend    
   has been in the same family  

473
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,819
    for nearly seven decades,   

474
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:22,954
     with owner Bill Kuppel     

475
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:26,424
  taking the reins from his dad 
            in 2003.            

476
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,758
            We are in the middle
                 of nowhere.    
    Yep.                        

477
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,294
     Been here since 1930s,     

478
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,362
  before the federal government 
   bought up all this property  

479
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,764
      as a wildlife refuge.     

480
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,700
 FIERI: These days, Bill's sons 
   are carrying on the legacy.  

481
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:36,633
     Jason's behind the bar.    

482
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:37,835
  And to quote my buddy Emeril, 

483
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:40,905
    Scott's kicking things up   
     a notch in the kitchen.    

484
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:41,973
               Clams Mexicali   
               in the window.   

485
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,975
         I just fell for        
       the Clams Mexicali.      

486
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:47,512
       It's one of Scott's      
       special creations.       

487
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:48,846
   You're not gonna find them   
         anywheres else.        

488
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,715
 What are we making?            

489
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,116
              We're gonna make  
             our Clams Mexicali.

490
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,851
We're about as close            
    to Mexico...                

491
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,586
            Well, I used to live
               in California,   

492
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,121
          so I adopted the name.
 Where?                         

493
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,389
           Well, I was stationed
             at Camp Pendleton. 

494
00:15:58,391 --> 00:15:59,657
Oh, in the military?            
                      Yes, sir. 

495
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,191
    Thank you for               
 your service, man.             
                      Thank you.

496
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,393
Where are the clams from?       

497
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,128
                 Great Bay,     
   right outside the restaurant.

498
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,396
        They come up to the dock
                 right here.    

499
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:06,797
 What kind of clams             
     are these?                 

500
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,733
              These are choice  
              top neck clams.   
   Choice?                      

501
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,669
              Choice top neck.  
            It's a certain size.
How do you know?                

502
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,071
           The clammer tells me.
The clammer tells you.          

503
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:14,605
             He knows his clams.

504
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,708
       All right, we steam these
          for about 12 minutes. 

505
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,211
     We put them in an ice bath,
               cool them down.  

506
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,145
So they stop cooking.           

507
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,547
So they're not gonna            
get all tough on us.            

508
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,082
     All right,                 
now what are we doing?          

509
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,550
            Now we're gonna make
              the meat filling. 

510
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:26,884
              We're gonna start 
              with some butter. 

511
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:28,553
             These are drippings
                from chorizo.   

512
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:29,620
 All right. Next up?            

513
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,022
       Throw in the red peppers 

514
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,356
   and then the diced jalapeños.

515
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,358
You know, I'm gonna give you    
some points right there.        

516
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,259
You said it correctly.          

517
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:36,293
          Well, I'm from Mexico.

518
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,895
You're not from Mexico!

                Dump that in.   

520
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,699
              Browned chorizo.  

521
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:44,836
         And fresh bread crumbs.
              Roasted poblanos.

00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,970
           Chopped up cilantro. 
           We're mixing this up,

523
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,640
    and then we're gonna cool it
    for about 10 to 15 minutes. 

524
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:50,908
    Mm-hmm. Now?                

525
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,709
      We're gonna add the cheese
       to our cool chorizo mix. 

526
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:53,510
        Okay.                   

527
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,379
     This is a longhorn cheddar.

      Clams ready to be stuffed.

 Are we putting them            
   in the broiler?              

531
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,455
 Are we putting them            
    in the oven?                

532
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,524
   We put them in our convection
   oven for about eight minutes.

533
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,192
   Cheese will start to bubble, 
   and they'll be ready to roll.

534
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,927
  What will happen?             

535
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,862
           The cheese will start
                 to bubble.

          Little bit of parsley.

542
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:33,217
     It's salty.                

543
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,554
 A little bit spicy.            
 Great clam flavor.
