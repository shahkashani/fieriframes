   with the pepper at the end --

113
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:02,774
                  dynamite.     

114
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,444
                  Real deal.    
  Thank you.                    

115
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:06,411
               I'm impressed.

      Pulled-pork sandwich.     

117
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,181
    The flavor's fantastic...   

118
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,849
          I love how the bottom 
      of the biscuit gets soggy.

119
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,852
        By the end of the thing,

    Yeah.

  FIERI: And what they're doing 
           with pies,           

123
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,060
   they're doing with thighs.   

124
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,596
    This is the best chicken    
  you're gonna get in New York.

         you must try this dish.

128
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,871
We're gonna make our seasoning  
  for the chicken.              

129
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:34,739
                  No salt?      

130
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,208
   That's gonna be              
    in the brine.               

131
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,410
        We're seasoning it first
              then brining it?

    to the skin.

You're gonna taste it.          

136
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,218
           All right. All right.
It's gonna be good.             

137

141
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,429
...and then we're just          
   gonna cover it               

142
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,132
   with the sugar               
   and salt brine.

                  How long      
            we gonna brine this?

the all-purpose flour.          
                    Just flour? 

147

325
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:30,648
              That's a monster. 

326
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,717
         Give me the break-down.

327
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:35,653
  You want to take              
the bottom leaves off.          

328
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,255
A little bit tougher.           

329
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,323
We're gonna peel the bottom     
leaves and the stem.            

330
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,459
You start seeing just the white 
 part in the middle.            

331
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,794
  It's real tender.             

332
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,596
     Tender meat, kind of like  
    the heart of the artichoke. 

333
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,063
Then we're gonna want           
  to cut it in half             

334
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,398
right down the middle           
    of the stem.                

335
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,532
                   Got it.      

336
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,267
So, get it cut in half.         
              Look at that, huh?

337
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,004
 We're gonna dig out            
all the fibers on the inside    

338
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,339
right down to the bottom        
  of the artichoke.             

339
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,075
  And then they go              
straight in the boiling water.  

340
00:12:57,077 --> 00:13:00,077
            Is the water salted?
Salted, yes.                    

341
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,014
       Okay, so, we let these go
               for 10 minutes,  

342
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,949
                pull them out,  
        hit them in an ice bath.
Yep.                            

343
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,151
            Now we're gonna make
            the Calabrian aioli.

344
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,753
               From Calabria,   
                the peppers.    

345
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,354
       Mm-hmm.                  

346
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,824
And you want to take            
the seeds out of them first.    

347
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,158
        Seeds and stems are off.

348
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,960
  The lemon juice.              

349
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,962
     And we have                
 some Dijon mustard.            

350
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,532
  Puree the pepper.             

351
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,769
                This is gonna   
               be strong, huh?  

352
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:25,703
Probably a little spicy.        

353

354
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:27,905
               All right, so,   
          we're gonna take this.

355
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,440
      Now fold it into the mayo.
Yes.                            

356
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,475
                   Got it.      

357
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,777
                 All right,     
              artichokes done.  

358
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:34,845
The artichokes are ready.       

359
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,780
Take them to the grill.         

360
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,715
                   We got       
           the mesquite rolling.

361
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:40,384
We're gonna brush them with     
a little bit of canola oil,     

362
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,588
and we're gonna season them     
with a little seasoning salt.   

363
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,456
They go right on the fire.      

364
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,091
              Oh, that's nice.  
                 Excellent.

368
00:13:56,135 --> 00:14:00,338
            And then serve that 
       with the Calabrian aioli?

369
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,207
     This is my favorite part --

370
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:04,542
         getting right down here
            to the heart of it. 

371
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,610
              Into a little bit 
               of that aioli.   

372
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,680
           Mmm. Nice and tender.

373
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:09,747
       Just give it a little dip
                right there.    

374
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:10,881
                    Mmm.        

375
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:14,285
    And the kicker is that smoke
            from the mesquite.  

376
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,220
             Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm!

377

             some for yourself.

           My name's not Sharon.

    ever done roasted artichokes

  I've ever had one of the chefs

        quite like this.        

388

    a menu with everything...

...into a high-end, meaty feast.

396
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,929
                    Now we make 
                  the meatballs?
Yep.                            

397
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,931
      We've got                 
 gelatin and water.             

398
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,532
 We're gonna bloom              
 the gelatin first.             

399
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,668
It's gonna kind of hold         
the meatballs together.         

400
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,669
And we'll set that aside.       

401
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:07,271
  Then we're going              
    bread crumbs.               

402
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,873
     Buttermilk.                

403
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,342
       Incorporate all that fat 
  and a little bit of that tang.

404
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,010
Then we're just using           
   the egg yolk --              

405
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,745
just for the richness.          

406

00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,617
    Next, we use                
the gelatin that we bloomed.    

409
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,819
   Get it mixed in              
with the bread crumbs.          

410
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,821
      We've got                 
fresh ground pepper.

          the high end of pork. 

420

00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,244

 form the meatballs.

Fresh-grated lime zest.
