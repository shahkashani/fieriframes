65

                 The marrow

 you're looking for.            

68
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,068
    That's what I'm looking for,
          the bone marrow.      

69
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,335
    Do you really               
 put it in by hand,             

70
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,937
or do you dump the whole thing  
and it splashes everywhere?     

71
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,672
            Dump the whole thing

  Splash!                       

72
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,674
         I do it when it's cold,
         but it's been boiling. 

73
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,409
Oh, well, that takes            
all the fun out of if.          

74
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:25,544

   it gonna take?               

75
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:26,811
           I actually let it sit

76
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,348
 24 hours this sits?            
       I'll let it sit 24 hours.

77
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,882
   What's next?                 
              Chicken carcasses.

78
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,951
And this is the recipe          
that your mom followed?         

79
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:33,952
                    Yes.        
              Back in Vietnam.  

80
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,086
    We'll boil it               
    and skim it,                

81
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,421
 take the impurities            
    off the top.                

82
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:37,756
                  Correct.      
Now we drop the brisket.        

83
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,291
                    Yes.        
              And flank steak.  

84
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,892
   Once that goes               
 for eight hours...             

85
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,294
              Now you drop in   
              the goodie bag.   
  The seasonings.               

86
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,028
         -Dry coriander.        
          -Star anise?          

87
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:46,097
              Real cinnamon.    
          Roasted ginger, onion.

88
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,899
You prefer just tying it        
    versus a string?            
                     Yeah.      

89
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:50,502
            In the water.       
    And let it simmer overnight.

90
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,970
              Then we'll remove 
              the flank steak,  

91
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,906
                the brisket,    
             and the spice bag. 

92
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,908
         Once reduced down,     
    then we will add some sugar.

93
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,510
          -Salt and...?         
            -Ginger.            

94
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,379
              And more onions.  

95
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:01,512
             We add more water. 

96
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,115
    And then we have            
the difficult decision --       

97
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,050
Do we want meatballs?           
Do we want flank steak?         

98
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,651
Do we want raw steak?           
 Do we want brisket?            

99
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,719
    Do we want...               

100
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,454
    The choices,                
    the choices.                

101
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:10,789
              JON:              
     One handful of noodles.    

102
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:14,193
              I'll have         
     the steak/brisket/meatball.

103
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:15,928
  So I start with the brisket.  

104
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,062
    Five pieces of meatball.    

105
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:19,464
             And the steak is   
           the eye of the round?

106
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,265
            Correct.            

107
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,866
          Green onions.         
            Cilantro.           

108
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:23,001
        And white onions.       

109
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,603
