00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,748
  WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE       
IS YOU'RE FOLDING THAT WING     

374
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,750
   INTO ITSELF AND THEN         
IT DOESN'T HAVE A TENDENCY      

375
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,752
  TO DRY OUT AS MUCH.           
IT'S LIKE CHICKEN YOGA.         

376
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,288
WE'RE GONNA PUT THAT            
     IN THE OIL?                
                THAT'S CORRECT. 
               I USE CANOLA OIL.

377
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,690
            THAT'S THE BEST OIL.
     AND THAT'S GONNA GO IN     
THE CONVECTION OVEN AND GET HOT.

378
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,159
              THAT'S RIGHT.     
         MOVE BACK A LITTLE BIT.

379
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:58,229
          WE DO IT VERY CAREFUL.
  YES, WE DO.                   
SKIN SIDE DOWN.                 

380
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,865
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE PART       
     FO THE CHICKEN?            
                     THE BREAST.

381
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,767
             I HAD FIVE BROTHERS
                AND SISTERS.    

382
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:05,169
         I NEVER GOT THE BREAST.
YEAH, I'M A WING GUY.           

383
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,638
MY MOM ALWAYS HAD THE WING.     
  MY DAD HAD THE BREAST.        

384
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,640
MY SISTER GOT THE DRUMSTICK,    
     'CAUSE SHE WHINED.         

385
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:13,311
   WE WANT TO FRY IT 15 MINUTES.
          THEN I TURN IT.       

386
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,780
       AND THEN COOK 15 MINUTES 
          ON THE OTHER SIDE.    

387
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,782
   IT'S BAKED WHILE IT FRIES.   

388
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,851
NOW I KNOW WE'RE GONNA ARM      
  WRESTLE FOR THE THIGH.        

389
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:23,921
                 NO. THE BREAST.
 ALL RIGHT.                     
LET'S EAT IT.                   

390
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,856
 MMM, THAT'S                    
PRETTY TASTY.                   

391
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,792
IT'S AWESOME.                   
GOOD CHICKEN.                   

392
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:30,328
MOIST, FLAVORFUL, YOU GET       
THE TASTE OF THE CHICKEN.       

393
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,330
 THE BREADING ISN'T             
TAKING ALL THE POWER.           

394
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,932
 MMM, HAVING SOME               
OF THAT THIGH, HUH?             
               I'M GONNA TRY IT.

395
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:36,968
LOOK AT THAT.                   
               YOU CONVINCED ME.

396
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,005
      I LIKE THE BREAST BETTER. 

397
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,541
     IT'S GOT A CRUST ON IT     
        THAT'S EXCELLENT.       

398
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,676
   SEASONED VERY WELL, AND IT   
   DEFINITELY TASTES HOMEMADE.  

399
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,013

                  AFRO BURGERS. 

413
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,248
     THIS IS THE BEST BEEF.     
THIS IS 10 POUNDS OF ANGUS BEEF.

414
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,584

    GO IN 10 POUNDS?            
                       OH, YEAH.

   IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPICY FOOD,
     YOU WON'T LIKE THIS DISH.  

416
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:32,857
                  BREADCRUMBS...
 ALL OF THE PEPPER AVAILABLE    
IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES.

             BROWN SUGAR,       
       CHOPPED VIDALIA ONIONS...

419
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,131
IT'S A LITTLE SWEET.            
                  CHILI POWDER, 
                 CAYENNE PEPPER.

420
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:43,067
                THIS IS NUTMEG. 
               THIS IS CINNAMON.
GRANULATED GARLIC.              

421
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:46,137
                       THE SALT.
WE'VE GOT 9 POUNDS              
OF HOT CHILI FLAKES             

422
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,139
MIXED INTO 2 POUNDS OF MEAT.    

423
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,141
WE'RE GOING TO COMMENCE         
      THE PROCESS               

424
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,511
OF BURNING OUR                  
  PALATE OFF.                   
          THAT GIVES IT PIZZAZZ.

425
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,746
EGG? NOW WHAT ARE               
  WE GONNA DO?                  

426
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,749
          WE HAVE TO WEIGH IT UP
            INTO 6-OUNCE BALLS. 

427
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:01,685
       IT'S A LITTLE OVER, BUT--
I DON'T WANT TO BE              
KICKED OUT OF CAMP.             

428
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,687
DEAD ON.                        
           TAKE ONE OF THE BALLS

429
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,556
             AND YOU FLATTEN IT,
             THEN FOLD IT OVER. 

430
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,092
             FOLD THE PAPER BACK
              AND THEN ROLL IT. 

431
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,894
         OKAY, THEN WE WRAP THIS
             IN CELLOPHANE.     

432
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,964
               WE ROLL ONE TIME,
                 THEN WE FOLD.  

433
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:14,966
                  AND THEN ROLL,
                    ROLL, ROLL. 
OKAY.                           

434
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,967
            NO, THAT--DID YOU   
         SEE ME DO IT LIKE THAT?

435
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,370
YOU WANT IT TO LOCK IN          
    AS WE ROLL IT.              

436
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,306
YOU WANT TO RACE                
   THIS TIME?                   

437
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:25,309
 AND HE'S FIRST                 
INTO THE PLASTIC.               

438

HUH? WHAT DO YOU THINK?         

439

               I MIGHT HIRE YOU.

440
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,119
      PUT 'EM IN THE FREEZER    
   TILL WE'RE READY TO COOK 'EM.

441
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,922

                NICE AND FROZEN.
 THOSE GOTTA GO DOWN FOR        
A LONG TIME THOUGH, HUH?        

442
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:40,390
           OH, ABOUT 25 MINUTES.
OKAY, SO YOU UNWRAP IT.         

443
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,526
   AND THEN SOAK 'EM            
IN THE BARBECUE SAUCE.          

444
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,595

          YOU'RE HAVIN'         
        THE EAR SANDWICH.       
                     I AM.      
               IT'S REALLY GOOD.

467
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,053
DON'T FEAR THE EAR.             

468
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,589
LET'S GET IT ON.                
                           OKAY.

469
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,058
          I LIKE TO EXAMINE 'EM.
OOH, THOSE ARE FRESH.           

470
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:51,328
              THERE'S NO HAIRS. 
            SEE? THAT'S GRISTLE.

471
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,531
JUST A TICKLE OF MEAT           
       THERE.                   
                      I KNOW IT.

472
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,732
I KNOW, DON'T PLAY              
  WITH YOUR FOOD.               

473
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:58,002
       AND THEN I'M GONNA PUT IT
           IN MY CROCK-POT.     

474
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,004
       MM-HMM,                  
SALTIN' UP THAT EAR.            

475
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,340
GRANDMA'S RUB, A LITTLE BIT     
      OF SUGAR, SALT.           

476
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,875
                 CUMIN, PAPRIKA,
                  CHILI POWDER. 

477
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:08,345
THEY'RE VERY PLAIN, SO THEY NEED
   A LOT OF SEASONING ON 'EM.   

478
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,615
               THEN THE GARLIC. 
              THEN ADD MY WATER.
OH.                             

479
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,016
ADD A LITTLE VINEGAR.           

480
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,018
     IT'LL GO DOWN              
FOR ABOUT EIGHT HOURS.          

481
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,554
COVER THAT UP,                  
  PLUG IT IN.                   
           AND I PUT 'EM ON LOW.

482
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:19,156
  YOU KNOW WHAT? I JUST--       
TIME HAS GOT AWAY FROM ME.      

483
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,092
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO.           

484
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,627
I'LL BE BACK "EAR"              
      LATER.                    
             NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

485
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,629
        YOU WANT TO EAT 'EM NOW.
RIGHT "EAR,"                    
 RIGHT NOW.                     

486
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,499
       THIS'LL BE THE HIGHLIGHT 
             OF YOUR DAY.       

487
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:31,168
   I'M EXCITED.                 
LET'S JUST DO THIS.             

488
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,371
 YOU BE AS LIBERAL WITH         
THAT MUSTARD AS YOU WANT.       

489
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,574
THERE YOU GO.                   
EXTRA, EXTRA.                   
                  CHOPPED ONION,

490
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,509
                  THAT GIVES IT 
                 A LITTLE ZING. 

491
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,912
          THAT DOESN'T LOOK BAD,
                  RIGHT?        
NO.                             

492
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,783
I MEAN, THAT PART--             
  THAT DOESN'T--                

493
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,886
THAT SCARES ME.                 
             WELL, JUST BITE IT.
                 THAT'S ALL.    

494
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,790
                        EAT IT. 

495
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,692
DON'T PUSH IT                   
IN MY MOUTH.                    

496
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:58,529
  YOU'RE EXCITED                
TO SEE ME EAT THIS.             
                      YES, I AM,

497
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,531
              BECAUSE I KNOW    
           YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT.

498
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,134
IT'S TENDER.                    

499
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,670
IT IS<i> TENDER.</i>                   

500
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:09,540
  SEE? THE CARTILAGE COOKED     
DOWN TO A NICE TENDER STATE.    

501
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,275
IT IS VERY TASTY.               

502
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,277
  I WOULD CALL IT               
"NATURAL BOLOGNA."              

503
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:15,613
I DIDN'T REALLY THINK I WAS     
GONNA BE TOO BIG OF A FAN.      

504
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,949
ONCE YOU'RE "EAR,"              
   YOU LOVE IT.                 

505
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:20,684
          REALLY MOIST,         
      AND NOT TOUGH AT ALL.     

506
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,820
         THIS PIG EAR SANDWICH--
                YUM-YUM.        

507
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,755
          I WOULD RECOMMEND IT. 

508
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,625
     TRUE SOUL FOOD CLASSIC.    
                 SOUL AND FAMILY
                  GO TOGETHER.  

509
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,559
FEELS LIKE HOME.                
       LIKE I REMEMBER          
      WHEN I WAS A KID.         

510
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,495
        IT'S LEGIT, HUH?        
IT'S LEGIT.                     

511
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:33,830
      WHEN IT'S MEANT TO BE,    
   THINGS LIKE THIS JUST HAPPEN.

512
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:36,700
 YES, IT CERTAINLY DOES.        
  I'M LOOKIN' FOR MY MOTHER     
  TO COME OUT THE KITCHEN.      

513
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,969
I WANT TO SPREAD MY FOOD        
   ALL OVER THE CITY.           

514
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,372
     I WANT EVERYBODY           
TO COME AND ENJOY MY FOOD.      

515
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:43,841
                    GOOD STUFF. 
                   I ENJOYED IT.
GOOD. I'M GLAD.                 

516
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,843
   SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP.  
     I'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME     

517
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,379
          ON TRIPLE-D--         
 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

518
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:51,448
THE BREAST GETS DRIED OUT.      
                 THAT'S BECAUSE 
                YOU OVERCOOK IT.

519
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:54,719
WELL, YOU'RE NOT COOKIN'        
    THE THIGH ENOUGH.           

520
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,587
          AND IT'S NOT AS TASTY.
NOT AS TASTY?                   

521
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:58,356
                             NO.
I'M OUTTA HERE.
