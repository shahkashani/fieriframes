1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,534
       So when I come off       
     the road from doing DDD    

2
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:04,670
   the first thing I wanna do   
     get home to my kitchen     

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,538
        and cook my food        
         for my family.         

4
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:07,739
     And after a few weeks,     
         I got to be...         

5
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,808
       Dad, can we just...      
         I mean, please,        

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,677
     we'll go to restaurant     
       at least one time.       

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,412
      They start to revolt.     

8
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:14,546
   So I came up with the idea,  

9
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,882
     "How about we reach out    
  to some of our favorite chefs 

10
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,217
          and had them          
      send us dinner, huh?"     

11
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:21,420
        I like that idea.

00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,883
      beautiful prime skirt     
             steaks.            

114
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,417
       When these marinate      
         at restaurant,         

115
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:40,619
         you let them go        
       for how many days?       

116
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:41,886
           Three days.          
         I sent you some        

117
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,821
        already marinated       
       because, you know,       

118
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,091
       we don't have time       
       to wait three days.      

119
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,825
     You set me in that food    
       that I can survive       

120
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,428
      on Gilligan's Island      
    by myself for three days.   

121
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,631
     Absolutely. That was...    

122
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,432
      [Guy] Are these gonna     
     go onto the grill now?     

123
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,367
           Of course.           

124
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,635
     Cook it to your liking.    

125
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,370
      [Guy] The skirt steak     
      is one of my favorite     

126
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,505
        -pieces of meat.

00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,574
     dredge for the onions,     

128
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,843
         we're gonna put        
   some plain flour in there,   

129
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,579
       granulated garlic,       
       Hungarian paprika,       

130
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:10,649
   the black pepper, and then,  
      some season and salt.     

131
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:11,783
   Hunter, while you're there,  
           you can put          

132
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,719
       the carrot soufflé       
       in oven to warm up.      

133
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,855
       The sliced onions,       
      you're gonna dredge.      

134
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,124
        [Guy] Okay. While       
     he is doing that, Zig.     

135
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,726
     [Ziggy] We're gonna do     
  the Jewish chimichurri sauce. 

136
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,328
            -[laughs]           
          -Were making

      -Jewish chimichurri?      
        -Yes, basically.        

138
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,333
   [laughs] Put some schmaltz   
            in this.            

139
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,735
           -Some what?          
       -Chicken schmaltz.       

140
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,736
   [Guy] It's the chicken fat.  
      If you haven't cooked     

141
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,604
        with chicken fat,       
  you're not living my friend.  

142
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,473
         No, you're not.        
    And then, we're gonna add   

143
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,674
          -the garlic.          
        -[Guy] Red chili.

     [Ziggy] Pinch of salt,     
      the chopped parsley.      

145
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,612
        [Guy] I love this       
    because this is blooming,   

146
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,881
     and a lot of times with    
 the chimichurri is not cooked. 

147
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,415
           All right.           
  I'm gonna drop these onions.  

148
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:45,750
         [Guy] Drop them        
        like they're Hot.       

149
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,787
  -Drop them like they're hot.  
           -Thank you.          

150
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,358
    [Ziggy] Some apple sauce    
 and sour cream for the latkes. 

151
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:54,559
        [Guy] Gonna salt        
    this when they come out?    

152
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,495
          [Ziggy] Yes.          
       Give it a little...      
        [speaks Yiddish]        

153
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,496
         [Guy] Gorgeous.        
    Zig, take a look at this,   

154
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,632
         -you like that?        
    -Those looked beautiful.    

155
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,834
    Okay. So fry up a couple    
        of those latkes.        

156
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,904
      Yeah. This is torture     
    for those of us at home.    

157
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,972
     [Hunter] Don't overfeed    
  yourself in the first round.  

158
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,508
        [Guy] I know it's       
    the first round, Hunter,    

159
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,309
        don't talk to me        
     when I'm getting ready     

160
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,644
   to get into my matzah ball.  

161
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:16,248
    I used chicken feet that    
   give it such a good flavor.  

162
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,516
     You know, how you go on    
     some on those plans now    

163

       I want matzah ball       
          of the week.          

165
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,722
    We can do a subscription    
          if you want,          

166
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:26,591
     not a problem. [laughs]    

167
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,527
     Let's put it together,     
         let's schmear.         

168
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:31,396
            -Schmear?           
  -The Jewish chimichurri sauce

  <i> Beautiful. On top of that,</i>   
     <i> those onion strings.</i>

   <i> -Yeah. Don't be bashful.</i>    

172
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,937
         <i> On the side,</i>          
 <i> two of the latkes, and then,</i>  

173
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,542
     take a nice thick slice    
     of that carrot soufflé.    

174
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:45,477
   What's in a carrot soufflé?  

175
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,678
         [Ziggy]<i> Carrot,</i>        
      <i> onion, egg whites,</i>       

176

           -Delicious.

          [Ziggy]<i> Yes.</i>          

178
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,353
        [Guy] The flavors       
         are fantastic,         

179
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:56,821
        the caramelizing        
          of the meat,          

180
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,690
          so it's nice          
    and sweet and then, boom,   

181
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,092
           you cut it,          
     you cut it with that...    

182
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,961
       With that schmaltz,      
  the parsley, and the garlic,  

183
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,564
      and the chili flake,      
  then you give the nice crunch 

184
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,433
        with the latkes,        
        the potato still,       

185
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:09,568
          inside of it.         
      And then, the soufflé     

186
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,571
       is nice and light,       
          and delicate.         

187
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:13,905
       -Outstanding, dude.      
           -Thank you.

       All right, Hunter.       
     You start cleaning up,     

193
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,953
     I'm gonna take a brief     
      break and enjoy this.

216
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:20,371
         Bul means fire         
    and the gogi means meat.    

217
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,506
           -Fire meat?          
     -[Joe] Yeah. Typically     

218
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:22,774
    you take a lettuce wrap,    
        put a little bit        

219
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,243
   of the meat that you like,   
       some of the sides.       

220

        -Good job, buddy.       
        -All right, man.        

224
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,318

          fried chicken

   with a mango gaucho sauce.   

227
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,924
    Oh, Korean fried chicken.   

228
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:42,660
     Finger licking, finger     
  licking, finger licking good. 

229
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,462
    You set your grandmother    
           in the box.          

230
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,798
            -[laughs]           
             -Soju.             

231
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,467
 [Joe] Kind of a Korean spirit. 

232
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:50,135
          Soju just put         
        a little bit in?        

233
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:50,868
              Yeah.             

234
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,271
     Soju need two bottles,     
           all right?           

235
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,673
            -[laughs]           
             -Okay.             

236
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:57,275
   You said soju two bottles,   
           there's 14.          

237
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,877

240
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,882
        it pairs with all       
      of our chicken wings.     

241
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,284
     What makes Korean fried    
        chicken different       

242
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:07,418
   from regular fried chicken?  

243
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,354
      [Joe] It's the spice.     
   It's the kick that you get   

244
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,621
          -in the end.          
       -So let's the wings

        the Dae Gee sauce       

246

        Have Hunter puree       
     the onions, the apple.     

248
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,363
 -[Guy] We need that in a bowl? 
     -[Joe] Yeah. In a bowl.

   ground ginger in the bowl,   

250
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:21,766

            in there,

00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,772
          -Puree this?          
           -[Joe] Yes.          

254
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,374
       Put it in the bowl       
         and mix it up.         

255
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,443
      Did you get the, uh,      
           soy sauce?           

256
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,443
    And water in there also.    

257
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,579
      So chicken wings in,      
        at the restaurant       

258
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:35,847
     this will go 24 hours?     

259
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,449
           -Yes, sir.           
     -Is there one location     

260
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,851
           -or 17 now?          
    -We have five locations.    

261
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,387
        -Under-achiever.        
           -[laughter]          

262
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,988
         [Joe] So we got        
     the mango gaucho sauce,    

263
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,525
   puree those fresh mangoes,   
       and some of those,       

264
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:49,794
     uh, Korean red peppers,    
       corn syrup, garlic.      

265
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,463
      Hunter, if you wanna      
    get some of those lemons,   

266
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,398
    squeeze those into there.   

267
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,400
    Tell me about this batter   
        that we're making       

268
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,801
     for the chicken wings?     

269
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,670
       [Joe] There's a fry      
    and a pancake batter mix,   

270
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,805
      so it's a one to one,     
      six ounces of water.      

271
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,807
      Six ounces of water.      
           Fantastic.           

272
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,676
     And this supposed to be    
        about the texture       

273
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,545
       -of tempura batter?      
         -Yes, exactly.         

274
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,414
      Keep on adding water      
      until it gets creamy.     

275
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,617
      -Chef, is this, uh...     
          -Oh, perfect.         

276
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:13,751
    [Guy] The sauce has made.   

277
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
            We've got           
      the wings marinating.     

278
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,822
      I mean, there's a lot     
   still going on here, right?  

279
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,557

     to clean some this up.     

282
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,496
    We got to let these wings   
  marinate a little bit longer,

316
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:43,408
      fast enough. I mean,      
     it's light and crunchy.    

317
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,809
    It's like a hard tempura.   

318

     You can even send those    
       to folks pare baked      

319
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,347

 -Great little sweetness to it.

  <i> How would you describe it?</i>   

334
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,579
       [Armando] Chihuahua      
       is land-logged so,       

335
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:22,914
       it has a lot to do       
         with proteins.         

336
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,649
        -Barbacoa tacos.

            -Come on.           
         -[Nadia] Yeah?         

339
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,922
       That's not at all.       

340

        -What's her name?       
            -Paloma.            

343

    You have your hands full.   

347
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,737
   -They sent a whole cooler.   
    -[Guy] I always recommend   

348
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,405
       that you just send       
    the whole cooler itself.    

349
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,673
             -Yeah.             
 -Peace, love and Tacos Chiwas,

353
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:58,817
  usually say every morning is, 
    rajas con queso gorditas.   

354
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:01,352
  So, rajas is gonna be onions,

       with the gorditas.       

358
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,027
    Flour, baking soda, salt.   

359
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,296
        We wanna disperse       
   the shortening throughout,   

360
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,630
            -correct?           
    -[Nadia] That's correct.    

361
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:16,301
       Add water with milk      
    and you wanna go slowly.    

362
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:21,639
          Not too slow.         
    Speed it up a little bit.   

363
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,575
       [Guy] So, typically      
      ball these up, chef?      

364
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:24,775
        -About this big?        
          -Yeah. Yeah.          

365
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:27,444
     And then let them rest     
            24 hours            

366
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:28,646
   -and then we're good to go?  
             -Yeah.

00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:29,781
 Where do you wanna start next? 

368
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,783
         So, let's start        
          on the rajas.

00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,785
 [Guy] Raw onions and serranos, 
           right here.          

370

      [Nadia] You're gonna      
           saute them,          

371
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:37,522

        Salt and pepper.

        A pinch of cumin.       

373
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,725
      So, we're gonna have      
   to blend some cream cheese   

374
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,861
          -with water.

          and skinned.          

377
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,736
 [Nadia] Let's add a little bit 
       of asadero cheese.       

378
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:54,606
      We get it all the way     
     from Juarez, Chihuahua.    

379
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,541
     It tastes like a really    

380
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,544
     super big creamy jack.     

381
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,212
      What can I do to get

383
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,881
   Pour lard and let it melt.   

384
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,617
  While Hunter is working that, 
         can I get some

386
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,687
  Roll these, hand pound them,  
      what's the game plan?     

387
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,556
           If you have          
        a tortilla press.       

388
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,690

00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:33,645
          -[Nadia] Yes.         
   -[Guy] And now, what? Ham?   

399
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,246
        -That's correct.        
       -[Guy] I don't know      

400
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,781
     what you call this dish    
         but right now,         

401
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,983
 -this is meat lover's delight. 
        -This is a staple       

402
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,452
    and all-Mexican parties.    
     You can never go wrong     

403
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:42,720
      -with piccolo charro.     
            -Charros?           

404
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,389
    -What does charros mean?    
  -It's like a Mexican cowboy,

00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,658
           -a charro.           
     -[Guy] Got it. Got it.     

406
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,725
       And the next thing       
      we'll be to add what?     

407
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,594
      -[Nadia] Pinto beans.

           Add water.           

410
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,734
          Let them boil         
     for about five minutes.    

411
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,871
           All right.           
   So, the refried going down.  

412
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,273
   Did you put the chicharron   
          to finish out         

413
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,675
      the rijo la charros.      

414
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,344
 We forgot the main ingredient. 

415
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,879
         So, the crunchy        
          chicharron...         

416
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,280
      Before you taste that     
   before you put it in there   

417
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,514
     -to make sure it okay.     
              -Hmm.             

418
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,016
             -Yeah.             
    -[Guy] And the last thing   

419
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,017
        -is the cilantro?       
        -[Nadia] Correct.       

420
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,653
    -[Guy] Oh, it's gorgeous.   
     -How are those gorditas    

421
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:16,821
         -looking, good?        
      -[Guy] Looking great.     

422
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,889
        Hunter with a mad       
          knife skills.         

423
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,359
   [Nadia] Smear a little bit   
      of the re-fried beans     

424
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,693
      -inside the gordita.      
             -Okay.             

425
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:24,696
        [Nadia] And then,       
   you're gonna put the rajas.  

426
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,297
     Are we going generous?     

427
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,766
       Go big or go home.       

428
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,901
  And then, you're gonna finish 
   it with the queso asadero.   

429
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,438
    [Guy] And then the beans?   
    Chicharrons and hotdogs.    

430
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,439
         When did my day        
          get so good?          

431
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,642
     Yeah. That looks great.    

432
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,377
    [Hunter] You're starting    
       without me. I mean,      

433
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,644
         I thought we're        
      doing this together.      

434
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,646
          -That's good.         
         -[Guy] Sister,         

435
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,915
      I'm telling you what.     
           These beans          

436
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:46,317
      with the 95 different     
         pieces of meat,        

437
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,720
        you put in there.       

438
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:49,654
   It's a meal within itself.   

439
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,322
       And the chicharron,      
          you're happy          

440
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,424
          when you find         
       that little nugget.      

441
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,662
 [Hunter] Dad, there's a little 
     pocket of the lightness    

442
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:58,863
          -right there.         
     -[Guy] It's everything     

443
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,799
   you love in a chili relleno  
          but not fried         

444
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,867
          and the roast         
   of the peppers, fantastic.   

445
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:06,804
      The cream cheese adds     
      that real nice tang.      

446
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:09,340
    [Hunter] I also love like   
   that creaminess at the end   

447
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,608
            of it too           
        from the asadero.       

448
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,410
  I'm gonna tell you something. 
           This is...           

449
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,544
      This is enough, okay?     

450
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,413
      We're just gonna call     
        quits right here.       

451
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,748
       Except for the fact      
        that you get one        

452
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,684
         of the DDD OGs         
        from season one.        

453
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,619
         We'll be back.         
       Don't go anywhere.       

454
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:22,820
        You're gonna love       
        this last piece.        

455
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,923
    Seriously. I'm gonna have   
        to go for a walk.       

456
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,092
     [upbeat music playing]     

457
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,829
          Welcome back.         
    DDD in the backyard doing   

458
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,365
        a little takeout.       
  I'm telling you what, Hunter? 

459
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,566
      -How are you feeling?     
             -Full.             

460
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,569
    [Guy] Well, the show that   
  had ended with Tacos Chiwas.  

461
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,438
    Ziggy almost took us out    
          from getting          

462
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,572
     at Ziggy's in Houston.     

463
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:44,308
     And I'll tell you what,    
       Dae Gee in Denver,       

464
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,443
     Joe is not nice either.    

465
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,645
   So, we were basically ready  
    to say goodnight, folks.    

466
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:48,846
      Thanks for tuning in.     

467
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:51,582
      But we can't give up      
       on a funky drive-in

      experience with pizza     

473
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,460
        that many people

00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:06,864
         -at that time.         
   -Now, Hunter. I went there   

476
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,399
   when we first started DDD.

481

     [Charlie] I can't tell     
   to you all of these things.  

482
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,476
   -I would have to kill you.   
        -Is it... It's...       

483
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,610
     You'd have to kill me?     
      So, you probably add      

484
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,480
  some oregano, and some basil. 

485
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,615
 Just be glad you got this far. 

486
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,418

488
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:30,555
    Charlie, how are things?    

489
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:32,623
      We're keeping it real     
     with the one location.     

490
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,759
    Still got the push button   
         at the drive up        

491
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,561
        where people come       
      and order the pizza?      

492
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:37,695
   [Charlie] We had it replace  
             the one            

493
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,764
    -that you saw originally.   
       -[Guy] Whoa, whoa.       

494
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,499

           Whoa, whoa.

496

             -Yeah.             
      -That's what's called     

499
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,374
         -a curve tray.         
       -[Guy] That's about      

500
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,309
    as old-school as it gets.   

501
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,177
  I mean, right on the window.  

502
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:53,777
         Happy birthday?        

503
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,446
  Today is my birthday, buddy.  

504
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,582
          No, it's not.         
        Hang on a second.       

505
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:00,384
    Oh, there you go, Nadia.    

506
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:01,585
   Today is Smokie's birthday.  

507
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,454
      How perfect is that?      

508
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:04,455
      You wanna wear that?      

509
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,390
          -Not so much.         
      -Happy birthday, man.     

510
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:09,527
      -Thank you very much.     
           -Oh, yeah.           

511
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,861
       Figured you'd like       
   to have something like that  

512
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,464
     -for your outdoor oven.    
     -[Hunter] That is sick.    

513
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,866
      Why can't I have that     
        as a belt buckle?       

514
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,469
       Looks like a weapon      
      from<i> Game of Thrones.</i>     

515
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,670
        We're gonna make        
      a meatball sandwich.      

516
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,605
    We're gonna have a pizza    
      with whatever topping     

517
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,607
         you want on it.        
   And then we're gonna bread   

518
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,542
        some onion rings        
        and fry those up.       

519
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:28,613
       These onions rings       
          are the bomb.         

520
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,481
     Pizza and onion rings?     

521
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,616
          That's right.         
  Because it's to the baseline. 

522
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,418
      Walk me through these     
          onion rings.          

523
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:37,621
      You want four bowls,      
        egg wash, flour,        

524
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,424
       egg wash, breading.      

525
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,292
        Use one hand dry,       
          one hand wet.         

526
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,493
 I know the old one hand dry... 

527
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,495
  [Guy] Oh, we had the old wet  
    and dry hand around here.   

528
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,763
  [Charlie] Put pressure on it. 
          Pack them on.         

529
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,632
          There you go.         
   Otherwise, when you fry it,  

530
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,566
        it won't hold up.       

531
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,436
       So, what is in this      
        meatball mixture?       

532
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:52,803

         -[Charlie] Yes.        
   -Heat these meat sauce up?   

537
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:04,582
    Walk me through it again.   

538
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,516
     I didn't tell you then.    

539
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,450
    I'm not telling you now.

         Nice and light.        

544

   Let's see how your toss is.  

545

549

      you've seasoned this.     

550
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,805
   Yeah. We got some of salt,

     Well, we saute those up    
   with a little bit of onion,  

553
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,678
        seasoned them up,       
     adds another dimension     

554
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:37,415
    -of flavor on that pizza.   
      -I've loaded this up.     

555
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,350
   We are going supreme, baby.  

556
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,551
         -Look at that.         
      -I think, that's just     

557
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,621
          -about right.         
        -[Guy] All right.       

558
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,423
      What are we gonna do      
    with these hoagie rolls?    

559
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:46,891
    [Charlie] Cut the hoagie    
            in half,            

560
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,426
     put the meatballs on it    
       with a little sauce      

561
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,428
      and parmesan cheese.      

562
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,699
          There you go.         

563
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:59,103
     [Hunter] That is an OG     
 meatball sandwich right there. 

564
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,239
      The amount of flavor      
     inside of the meatball     

565
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,773
      is way over the top.      

566
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,775
          Super tender.         
    And the meat sauce again,   

567
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,845
    it's so nice to get back    
   and have a reunion with it.  

568
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,381
   Delicious. But don't worry,  
          there's more.         

569
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:11,715
         All right, Dad.        
      Onion rings are done.     

570
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,784
       -How's that pizza?       
     -[Guy] Check that out.     

571
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:16,120
        -Not bad at all.        
 -[Guy] A little salt on those, 

572
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:16,721
       Hunter. Coming out.      

573
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,589
        Look at, Charlie.       
          You tell me.          

574
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,857
     I mean, that one Hunter    
       took a bite out of,      

575
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,659
         but you tell me        
   that's not the right crisp   

576
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,794
   -and not the right crunch.   
           -Well done.          

577
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:27,732
         -Golden brown.         
      -Oh, the right ratio      

578
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:31,268
        of crunchy batter       
        to awesome onion,       

579
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,202
           fantastic.           

580
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,137
       Let's dig into it.       

581
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,405
        House made crust.       

582
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:37,608
       Nice slice of pie.       

583
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,610
       Reminds me of pizza      
         as little kid.         

584
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,612
          -Old school.          
   -Not too fancy in quality.   

585
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:42,879
            Handmade,           
     scratch made, homemade.    

586
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:44,615
       -[Hunter] Mmm-hmm.       
     -[Guy] It's a dynamite     

587
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,885
         piece of pizza.        
       I applaud you all.

           -Thank you.
