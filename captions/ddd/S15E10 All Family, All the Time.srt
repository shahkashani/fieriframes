THAT MEAT IN THERE AT ALL?      
                     NOT AT ALL.

284
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,968

285
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,970

286
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,239

      A LITTLE BIT OF SWEETNESS.

430

       IT WORKS TOGETHER WITH   
    THE RAVIOLI INCREDIBLY WELL.

434
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:11,342
                   I SAID,      
            "THAT'S RIDICULOUS."
