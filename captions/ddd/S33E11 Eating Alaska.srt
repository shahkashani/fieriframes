 so I can multitask.            

113
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,425
                       Got it.  
              Ooh.              

114
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,693
We're gonna put this            
    in the oven.                

115
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,094
Cilantro and relish,            

116
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,096
      tomatoes,                 
  Korean chicken...             

117
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,298
                I'm gonna go    
                with the idea   

118
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,367
               that the plate   
           might be a bit small.

119
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:58,570
...guacamole, sour cream,       
   fusion sauce...              

120
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,172
               So if you want   
                to get this,    

121
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:01,840
             order on a Thursday
                 for Sunday.    

122
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,108
  ...sesame seeds.              

123
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,643
  This is the salsa             
that's served with it.          

124
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,511
                     And?       
   And a partridge              
   in a pear tree.              

125
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,180
Would you like a fork?          

126
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,248
      You can't eat nachos      
          with a fork.          

127
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,651
            You can't eat nachos
                with a fork.    

128
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,186
              That's crazy town 
                right there.    

129
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:16,454
                You got acid,   
               umami, creamy,   

130
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,790
                salty, meaty,   
               cheesy, bean-y.  

131
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,792
         That's a lot.          
          That's a lot of Yee's.

132
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,794
               You are putting  
       so many flavors together.

133
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,462
          I was a bit worried...
I figured.                      

134
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,664
     ...they were gonna compete.

135
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,998
               They're playing  
               well together.   

136
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,201
    This is like a multicultural
                 playground,    

137
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:32,737
              and there's a lot 
    of different games going on.

138
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,140
            That right there was
           dodge ball hopscotch.

139
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,808
           [ Laughs ]           

140
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,144
              When you look up  
           Mexican-Korean fusion

141
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,079
      in the Flavortown library,

142
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,482
             that's the picture 
                 you'll see.    

143
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,083
    Four minutes                
   on the chicken.              

144
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,952
 We get nachos about once a week

145
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,087
       so all the goodness      
       that goes with it.       

146
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:51,223
 Nachos with a fork,            
is that legal in Juneau?        

147
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:52,691
          I don't know,         
       but the problem is       

148
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:54,826
     that I want to put more    
       of this in my mouth      

149
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,628
    than I can with my hands.   
  Okay. Okay. Okay.             

150
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,830
    Two tofu tacos, order up!   

151
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,265
   V's is almost a hidden gem.  

152
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,632
     You walk through a door    

153
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,968
 of what looks like it would be 
       an office building       

154
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,770
     and go down the stairs     
 that almost look like a cellar.

155
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,439
   GUY: How cold is it down here
               in the winter?   

156
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,507
  I would think that it would be
             frozen underground.

157
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,776
No, we have this new thing      
   called heaters.              

158
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,979
         So when did you give up
           on the comedy career?

159
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,982
  WOMAN #1: Feels comfortable,  
  lots of light, lots of color. 

160
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,251
  It's one of the places I like 
 to come just kind of hide away 

161
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,652
   from the rest of the world.  

162
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,388
        When we come back, we're
      gonna make something else?

163
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,457
              -Yes.             
       -Korean short ribs.      

164
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,792
            WOMAN #5:           
     I love the short ribs.     

165
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,593
       They've got kind of      
  a sweetness and a spiciness.  

166
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,662
   They should be               
falling off the bone.           

167
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,529
         We'll see you in a bit.
                We're at V's.   

168
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,364
         Something else.        
                        Bye-bye.

169
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,067
              Paint the walls,  
            making the sandwich,

170
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,135
                 can we get     
          both of them together?

171
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,069
  Paint the walls.              
                Paint the walls.

172
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,271
      Slicing.                  
                       See?     

173
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:42,140
               That's just how  
           "Karate Kid" started.

174
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,408
                Welcome back.   
                 "Triple D."    

175
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,810
        Hanging out with Hunter.
        We're in Juneau, Alaska.

176
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,079
We found this funky little joint
                in a basement   

177
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,615
             with this character
       named Venietia Santana...

178
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:53,017
  I want to eat them right now. 
               Ah.              

179
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,087
              GUY:              
 ...the V behind V's Cellar Door

180
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:58,623
        who's cooking up        
  a wild Asian-Mexican mash-up. 

181
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,225
       You can't go wrong       
   with anything on the menu.   

182
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:04,429
  Everything is delicious from  
popcorn to nachos to short ribs.

183
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,897
             Korean short ribs. 

184
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,232
              MAN:              
     You bite into the meat,    

185
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,568
      and then there's just     
  this wonderful Korean flavor. 

186
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,570
       The short ribs come      
   with the kimchi fried rice,  

187
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,038
            which is            
      my absolute favorite.     

188
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,972
          V, what's on the menu?

189
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,040
     Short ribs.                

190
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,708
       They're out of long ribs.
                   Sorry.       

191
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,576
  First, we'll make             
   the marinade --              

192
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,378
gluten-free soy sauce,          
     canola oil,                

193
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,847
 rice-wine vinegar,             
 garlic-chili paste.            

194
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,117
                     Okay.      
   That's an aggressive whisk.  

195
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:27,652
Now we're gonna put together    
our bulgogi marinade --         

196
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,988
sweet onions, sesame oil,       
 rice-wine vinegar,             

197
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,325
pear, salt and pepper,          
  garlic, ginger...             

198
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,660
                  Mary Ann.     

199
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,595
...green onions...              
            More soy.           

200
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,198
...apple, brown sugar.          

201
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,334
                  Alright.      
         So coat it 2 1/2 hours.

202
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:43,602
              What temp are we  
               gonna cook at?   

203
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,270
      375, 385.                 

204
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,872
       Well, 390, 390, 395, 395,
                  not 400.      

205
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,475
             400, 400, 400, 400,
               410, 410, 385.   

206
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:51,943
                 Boom, sold.    

207
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,612
We're gonna put together        
our paste for our kimchi.       

208
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:55,947
                    Okay.       

209
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,348
Oyster sauce, gochugaru,        

210
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,952
   garlic, daikon,              
green onions, water.            

211
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,487
                   Salted,      
            rinsed napa cabbage.

212
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,289
                  How long      
            you let this set up?

213
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,091
Anywhere from 5 days            
     to 25 days.                

214
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,559
                   Dig it.      
        Make the fried rice now.

215
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,293
  It's kimchi rice.             
It's not a fried rice.          

216
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,762
             Why do you call it 
              not a fried rice? 

217
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,964
Because it's not fried as hard  
  as a fried rice.              

218
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,032
                    Okay.       

219
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,233
     You go ahead with the rice,
                 fried rice.    

220
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,367
  Butter and oil...             

221
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,568
              That's not gonna  
               fry it at all.   

222
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,503
  ...the kimchi...              

223
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:20,438
         Now the rice will go in
                and not fry.    

224
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,174
...salt and pepper, fusion      
sauce that we made earlier.     

225
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,375
        Okay.                   
       Ready.                   

226
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,643
                Let's see it.   

227
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,779
Our cabbage, which we serve     
in our slow marinade.           

228
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,448
It's rice-wine vinegar,         
gluten-free soy sauce,          

229
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,851
sambal and canola oil.          
                         Got it.

230
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:37,588
Short ribs, fusion sauce        
  and sesame seeds.             

231
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,857
            First, I'm gonna try

232
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,992
             the nonfried kimchi
                 fried rice,    

233
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,861
             which is dynamite. 

234
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,130
              I like the butter 
                  in there.     

235
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,731
    Yeah, there's no dryness    
         in this at all.        

236
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,867
            Love the little tang
               of the kimchi.   

237
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,201
   If you look at that short rib
               the wrong way,   

238
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,469
              it'll fall apart. 

239
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,472
               Lot of balance.  

240
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,607
                Stabbed him.    

241
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:58,943
         Great soy, great spice,
                great acid...   

242
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,078
                 great fat.     

243
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,413
           Do you have any kids?
  No.                           

244
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,149
              Do you want one?  
      No.

246
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,285
       Sesame seed these.       

247
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,086
Just such a great mix           
     of flavors,                

248
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,689
    and I've got                
the short ribs here,            

249
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,290
      which are                 
falling off the bone.           

250
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,225
           A lot of dance moves.
                It's like V.    

251
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,827
         V does the dance moves,
              and she does it.  

252
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,762
                  Can I get     
             these two together?

253
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:18,963
    VENIETIA: Nice and neat.    
      We eat with our eyes      

254

   Everything is made with love,
    and that's one of the things

256
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,569
     I love about the food here.

257
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:27,238
 If I had my way, I would simply
       order one of each,       

258

318
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,854
              After seven days

319
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,055
             we're gonna put it

320
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,457
          But before we do that,
        we got to make a spritz.

321

        Okay.

328
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:39,204

   on the smoker?               

329
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,471
               About 12 hours,  
                 about 220.     

330

                         Tender.

332
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,410
No question, there's a lot      
of good flavor in that.         

333
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:46,945
        Peppers and onions here.

334
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,747
                   This is      
           rendered brisket fat.

335
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,015
              I put bay leaves  
                  in there.     

336
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:51,082
     I got you.                 

337
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,017
              Now this is ready 
              for the flat top. 

338
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,019
              American cheese.  
                 Good stuff.    

339
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,087
         Give it a little steam.

340
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,356
       Is that                  
an actual trash-can lid?        

341
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,758
                  It is, yeah.  
       That is your style       
          right there.

           Ciabatta roll toasted
               on both sides.   

343
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,629
Cue the mayonnaise.             
               Got this mayo.   

344
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,430
                 There we go.   
That's a normal portion?        

345
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,631
                  Yes, sir.

  Thank you, hand.              

350
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,978
  It's outstanding.             

351
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,980
  What do you think             
   it is, Hunter,               

352
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,114
      that sets                 
this sandwich apart?            

353
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,849
I want to see if my kid

      can't really go wrong     
        with that, juicy.       

356
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,454
You got great texture.          

357
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,723
  It's super rich.              

358
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,924
It's unconventional,            
but I'll tell you what.         

359
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,660
  I would order it              
 and order it again.            

360
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,462
                    Thank you.  
  Breakfast, lunch and dinner.  

361
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:39,130
   I was gonna say              
I'll come back tomorrow, too.   

362
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,364
              Okay.             
         We can do that.        

363
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,400
     One Philly cheesesteak.    
This is my buddy, Brian,        

364
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,335
that helped build my house      
a couple different times.       

365
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,803
  What do you think             
of the Philly cheesesteak?      

366
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,472
           I just like the sweet
               of the onions,   

367
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:51,876
         the spices in the meat,
        the cheese, very creamy.

368
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,211
   CHAD: Alright.               
  Chicken is done.              

369
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,412
          What happens          
       during the winter?       

370
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,547
          It's snowing sideways,
               but we're open.  

371
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,616
             We're here to serve

   for a food truck in general

         is a huge deal.        

374
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,888
 I've seen in the freezing rain,

375
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,823
         people lined up        
        around the block.

 One Cowboy Sundae!             

377
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:09,627
      The Cowboy Sundae is      
   a heaping pile of goodness.  

378
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,629
    Who can beat French fries   
           with sauce           

379
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,765
         and pulled pork        
      and coleslaw on top?      

380
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,834
GUY: Alright. What else         
you got up your sleeve?         

381
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,168
        I've got a Cowboy Sundae
               that we serve.   

382
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,570
So you even make a sundae       
     on Friday?                 
                       Yeah.    

383
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,839
  Just changing up              
 the whole calendar.            

384
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,707
         We're actually not open
              on Sunday, so...  

385
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,042
          I'm so lost.          

386
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,444
            Now we're gonna make
    some dry brine for our pork.

387
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:27,444
       Hit it.                  

388
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,114
                Caster sugar,   
         garlic powder, paprika.

389
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,382
 Shouldn't you have             
   some castanets               

390
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,117
when you say it or something?   
          Right, right.         

391
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,919
                Fennel seed,    
                chili powder,   

392
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,121
                black pepper,   
              Alaskan sea salt. 

393
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,456
              Nice.             
                The rub goes on.

394
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,924
              They go straight  
               on the smoker.   

395
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,058
  How long are they             
gonna go on the smoker?         

396
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,326
             Until they're done.

397
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,928
You know, that's a good         
 motto to work with.            

398
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,864
         You know, I mean, yeah.
For you, come on down,          

399
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,064
 and we'll cook them            
 until they're done.            

400
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,199
         I mean, I'd say roughly
               about 8 hours.   

401
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,534
        Okay.                   

402
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:51,469
           So now we got to make
          some barbecue sauce --

403
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,137
                  ketchup,      
      chili sauce, onion flakes,

404
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,073
            apple-cider vinegar.

405
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,340
       More of that birch syrup.

406
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,009
     Is that a popular thing    
    around here, birch syrup?   

407
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,944
Quit birching about it.         
       It's popular around here.

408
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,280
    Birch, birch,               
 that's all you do.             

409
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,616
       Black pepper, Santa Maria
             barbecue seasoning,

410
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,751
            Worcestershire sauce
                  as well.      

411
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:07,885
 I got to try this.             

412
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,954
    Here, Hunter.               

413
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,422
            That's...           

414
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,024
    It's an oldie               
 but a goody, folks.            

415
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,093
         That was good.         

416
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,294
  That's delicious.             

417
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,829
     It's tangy.                
     It's sweet.                

418
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,364
  The onion flakes              
   are different.               

419
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,432
                          Cool. 
Here's the pork butt.           

420
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,301
          Nice and fall apart-y.

421
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,502
     That's a word, I guess.    

422
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,237
I'm Jerry Fall Apart-y.         

423
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,706
  We got the bark,              
great flavor on that.           

424
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,974
          Hand-cut French fries.

425
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,643
 So funny when they             
always say hand-cut.            

426
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,311
I mean, what would you do,      
cut it with your foot?          

427
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,445
I face-cut these fries.         

428
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,914
                 So this is     
         a rosemary-fennel salt.

429
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,315
        Throw that on the grill.

430
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,852
Add a bit of that barbecue sauce
                that we made.   

431
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:42,587
                Right on top    
               just like that,  

432
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,588
              our savory slaw,  
               barbecue sauce.  

433
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,991
      Reason we call it a sundae
       is because of the height.

434
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,326
       Tower of savory goodness.

435
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,528
The tower of pain is what       
you should be calling it.       

436
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,865
I'm chiseling off a side        
  of the avalanche.             

437
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,003
  Oh, look at that.             
   It's delicious.              

438
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,005
I mean, of course the barbecue  
has got to be great,            

439
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,207
   but what makes               
  it is the fries.              

440
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,742
     That and the coleslaw.     

441
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:06,010
     The combo.                 

442
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,613
Nice job, buddy.                
                    Thanks, man.

443
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:09,948
   WOMAN #6: The Cowboy Sundae  

444
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,150
          really holds          
  a special place in my heart.  

445
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:15,086
   It's one of the best dishes  
       on the menu by far.      

446
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,221
      Pucker Wilson smokes      
          his own pork,         

447
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,957
          and so I love         
        the pulled pork.        

448
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,892
Now you know there's not        
really a Pucker Wilson.         

449
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:22,026
         Yes, I do know.        

450
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,628
Sorry, I didn't mean            
    to break it.                

451
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,829
Please don't cry, kids.         

452
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:27,098
       I've been a big fan      
       from the beginning,      

453
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,966
      and I'll keep coming      
    until he shuts his doors,   

454
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,434
     which I hope is never.     

455
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,702
Still don't get the name.       

456
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,904
  Think the guy is              
 a little bit crazy,            

457
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,172
     but you're                 
   gonna enjoy it.              

458
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:35,306
We'll see you in a bit          
   on "Triple D."               

459
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,842
  Great job, Chef.              
     Thank you.                 

460
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,311
         GUY: Coming up,        
       one crazy family...      

461
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,713
               Are you elves?   
                Do you sleep?   

462
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,314
  ...makes an Italian pizza...  

463
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,315
      Nice job.                 

464
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:45,717
  ...with their Alaskan roots.  

465
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,318
    So we lay out               
the reindeer-sausage patties.   

466
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,386
 It's not something             
  I say every day.              

467
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:54,959
                     ♪♪         

468
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:55,960
              Alright, Hunter.  

469
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:57,895
         For our final stop here
                  in Juneau     

470
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,099
         and it's your birthday,
     what is your favorite food?

471
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,166
     Everything.                
      I mean...                 

472
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:03,367
     No, it can't be everything,
                   Hunter.      

473
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,835
          What is your favorite,
               the number one?  

474
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,704
    What does your brother think
              is a food group?  

475
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,172
 Oh, you know what?             
       Pizza.                   

476
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,308
       I'm taking you to a place
       where it's a full family,

477
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,777
  I mean, the son, the daughter,
         the mother, the father.

478
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,979
             They've got a funky
           wood-fired pizza oven

479
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,382
       in a trailer right across
          from the cruise ships.

480
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:18,316
           You're gonna love it.

481
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,151
            This is Forno Rosso.

482
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,521
              King crab pizza.  

483
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,723
      I'm from New Jersey,      
    the land of great pizza,    

484
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,658
      and I've never tasted     
       anything like this.      

485
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,794
Pepperoni in the oven.          

486
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:32,262
  Juneau is not full of awesome 
little pizza trailers like this.

487
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,465
       No, this is the only one,
               and we love it.  

488
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,467
        Probably because        
  the little trailer comes with 

489
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:40,604
 their big-time wood-fired oven 
 manned by the Kotlarov family, 

490
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,541
         who have become        
       multitask masters.       

491
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,142
  We still have our other jobs  
             still.             

492
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,210
         Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

493
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,612
                How many jobs   
          does this family have?

494
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:48,880
             What does everyone 
                  else do?      
            Too many.           

495
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,148
      I work for a doctor,      
     and he works for Noah.     

496
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,150
   Noah Fisheries.              

497
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,485
  We went to Italy              
for a work assignment.          

498
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,087
             We all fell in love
      with the culture of Italy,

499
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,089
         and we kept just, like,
       making pizzas after that.

500
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,623
            NAKENNA:            
    I got a margherita here.    

501
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,091
What's makes this pizza         
     so special?                

502
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,293
                  WOMAN #7:     
          The local ingredients.

503
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,362
       Like, the reindeer pizza,
          they get their sausage

504
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:05,630
      from right here in Alaska,

505
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,765
          and they use our local
     hometown beer in the sauce.

506
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,635
  The crust is nice and flaky,  
         very flavorful.        

507
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:11,902
     GUY: You make all the dough
               in the trailer?  

508
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,638
Yes, sir.                       
          Alright. Let's see it.

509
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,706
        Okay.                   
 This is a poolish.             

510
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,706
           How long have you had
                this starter?   

511
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,707
Four years.                     
          It's awesome.         

512
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,642
                     Amen.      
   Yeast, flour.                

513
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,710
We're gonna add water.          

514
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,245
  Salt will go in.              

515
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,581
The olive oil is added          
  at the very end.              

516
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,917
             And now we're gonna
            get into making pie.
Correct.                        

517
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,985
              Which one are we  
              gonna make first? 

518
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,253
The rein-beer pizza.            

519
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,921
  So what I love is             
  the entertainment             

520
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,056
that you get in the back,       

521
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:35,193
the full construction           
sound and the beeping.          

522
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,595
    KYM: We are going to cook   
        reindeer sausage.       

523
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,598
I never pictured reindeer       
 in the plastic bag.            

524
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,933
I always just thought           
   they had horns               

525
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:43,734
and walked around               
  in the field.                 
         Oh, they were.         

526
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,269
   How do you know              
  how much reindeer             

527
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,404
        is in                   
the reindeer sausage?           

528
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:47,738
         It's about 60%.        

529
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,006
And the rest of it is...        

530
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,274
              Pork.             
                   HUNTER: Nice.

531
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,410
    So we lay out               
the reindeer-sausage patties.   

532
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,278
It's not something I say        
     every day.                 

533
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,813
What does it taste like?        
            Caribou.            

534
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,415
   Oh.                          
                   Well, if you 
             ever had caribou...

535
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:58,682
 Well, there you go             
        then.                   

536
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,685
     It tastes very similar     
     to a breakfast sausage.    

537
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,220
Breakfast sausage.              
              Yes.              

538
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,222
        Okay.                   
So we're braising in beer.      

539
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:05,823
       They're gonna taste      
          much better.          

540
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,092
So that goes in the oven.       
      About 15, 20 minutes.     

541
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:10,494
          It's about 700 degrees
             in there right now.

542
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,629
     Crumble it?                

543
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:12,730
              I actually cut it 
             into small squares.

544
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,232
   I can't get any              
of the questions right.         

545
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:15,766
What else is gonna go           
    on this pizza               

546
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,969
besides the reindeer sausage    
that tastes like caribou?       

547
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,570
We don't know what caribou      
    tastes like.                

548
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,906
  It's a white sauce that I make
            in the oven as well.

549
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,975
Okay.                           
            Butter and shallots.

thin-sliced red onions.         

565
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,532
        Reindeer sausage.

had her make one for you        

570
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,008
being it's your birthday.       

571
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,211
            Very hot.           
                 Very, very hot.

572
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:01,946
       How do you do that?      
    I can't eat it that fast.   

573
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,814
You bring it towards your mouth,
and you open your mouth,        

574
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,217
and then you bite down.         
       Crazy.                   

575
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,152
What do you think, Hunter,      
is the key to this pizza?       

576
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,287
          The red onion         
         and that sauce.        

577
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,023
You can get all that beer flavor
            in there.           

578
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,691

  Super nicely, it's a new word 

581
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:19,296
    that I think complements    
    the sausage really well.    

582
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,765
I think you're right            
    on all of it.               

583
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:21,899
It's part sausage pizza.        

584
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,233
  It's part fondue.             

585
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,502
It's part French onion soup,    
    creamy, rich,               

586
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,438
 a little tang to it            
coming from that white sauce    

587
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,441
because of the shallots,        
nice dough, tender, firm,       

588

595
