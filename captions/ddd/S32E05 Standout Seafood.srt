00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,042
    moved here from San Fran    
          20 years ago.         

223
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,245
    The elephant                
  in the room is...             
             Hey, hey, hey, hey.

224
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,380
       I'm trying to hit the gym
                a little bit.   

225
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,982
   The other one.               

226
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,585
Why's this Irish-Scottish guy   
own a fusion Asian sushi bar?   

227
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,120
              -Yes.             
      -'Cause we missed it.     

228
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,189
We kind of took it upon         
ourselves to do it ourselves.   

229
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:39,458
     FIERI: With the help of    
    a little Asian immersion.   

230
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,594
I went to Thailand and started  
taking cooking classes up there.

231
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:43,861
            -Really?            
             -Yeah.             

232
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,331
I teach Thai classes now        
because of my passion for it.   

233
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,933
  Table 10 rush -- Tom Kha Gai. 

234
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,868
   This Tom Kha Gai steamer --  
       it's definitely got      

235
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,871
     some Thai flavor in it     
     with some coconut milk.    

236
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:55,607
     Clam steamers, mussels,    
        scallops, shrimp.       

237
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,341
     If you're into seafood,    
          it's awesome.         

238
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,409
                 So what are    
             we gonna get into? 

239
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,678
A Tom Kha Gai steamer.          

240
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,212
We're gonna start off           
with a Nam Prik Pao,            

241
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,482
 which is a kind of             
a sweet Thai chili paste.       

242
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:06,351
Toasted Thai chilies,           
dried shrimp, kosher salt.      

243
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,486
And I do warn you, this might   
choke you up a little bit       

244
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,022
     fume-wise.                 
         I hate when it happens.

245
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,223
 Culinary technique.            

246
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,225
              Such a good thing 
    for the base of the blender.

247
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,028
This is oil that I roasted      
the garlic and the shallots in. 

248
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,863
Add my dry ingredients.         

249
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,099
So while that's toasting,       
I'll add the palm sugar --      

250
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,634
    a little bit                
  more umami in it              

251
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,302
    than regular                
   granular sugar.              

252
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,771
  Roasted shallots,             
a little roasted garlic,        

253
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,907
  galangal root --              
a unique flavor there --        

254
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:31,242
 tamarind -- this is            
our sour component --           

255
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,310
    shrimp paste.               

256
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:33,511
               You do too much  
           of that shrimp paste,

257
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,046
               it's gonna blow  
             the whole dish up. 

258
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:38,383
Yeah. Fresh coriander,          
just a little bit of water.     

259
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:41,519
I'm gonna drown in my own drool,
               you know that?   

260
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,787
Slurry that all together.       

261
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,189
 Before I blend it,             
we add the fish sauce           

262
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,924
 and the lime juice             
  to finish it off.             

263
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,726
               So this is not   
              curry in a hurry. 

264
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,928
     Definitely.                

265
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,263
       -That's fantastic.       
           -Thank you.          

266
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,463
             All right, next up.

267
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,932
We're gonna make our broth      
for our steamer dish.           

268
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,801
It is kind of an infusion,      
 or like making tea.            
                 Hit it.        

269
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,403
Coconut milk, water,            

270
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:00,071
    fresh chopped               
 bruised lemongrass,            

271
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,339
fresh galangal root,            

272
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,274
   and then lastly              
 some Thai chilies.             

273
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,609
 I don't want to get            
   too crazy hot,               

274
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,878
  but this gives it             
 a nice fruity bite.            

275
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,146
 Drop that right in.            

276
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,749
Sugar salt, fresh lime juice,   
     fish sauce,                

277
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,216
      and then                  
 makrut lime leaves.            

278
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,818
       And that's just gonna sit
   there and steep for how long?

279
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,953
 Minimum two hours.             

280
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,421
Now we're gonna marinate        
 the softshell crab             

281
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,689
in Sriracha overnight.          

282
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,357
We're gonna dredge it           
in the potato starch            

283
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,026
     and fry it                 
 for about a minute.            

284
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,161
          -I'm excited.         
   -All right, let's do this.   

285
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,897
Got our broth ready to go.      
Got my clams going in.          

286
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,232
  Let these kind of             
   start to open,               

287
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,633
 and then we'll add             
    our scallops.               

288
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,769
       Mussels will go off quick
  with their little, thin shell.

289
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,704
Tiger prawns, tomatoes,         

290
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,572
  wide, extra-large             
   rice noodle --               

291
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,107
deep fryer, 400 degrees.        

292
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,309
     Oooh!                      
               Hi. I'm fried.   
                I'm crunchy.    

293
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,912
Yeah. We're gonna go ahead and  
drop our shellfish into this,   

294
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,447
 and then I'm gonna             
  finish the sauce.             

295
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,716
Take our curry paste,           
     swirl that,                

296
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,718
 snap, crackle, pop             
  over our noodles,             

297
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,119
add the softshell crab,         

298
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,321
 finish it with some            
  Thai micro basil.             

299
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,656
           I'm fly with my Thai.

300
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,791
And we are good to go.          

301
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:57,061
That's gonna be hot.            

302
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,463
That was a bold bite.           

303
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,932
     Here's my piece, my friend.

304
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,934
      I wanted that to be great.

305
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,337
           Okay, it's not great.
              It's phenomenal.  

306
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,672
     Thank you.                 

307
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,808
   I mean, that seafood couldn't
           be cooked any better.

308
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,409
     It couldn't be any fresher.

309
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,078
         It's incredible flavor,

310
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,679
                but it's not    
         beating your palate up.

311
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:17,082
             It's fresh veggie, 
               sweet coconut,   

312
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,884
   the little touch of the fried
        softshell crab on there,

313
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,886
          and the little texture
            of the fried noodle,

314
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:24,022
      little kiss of the acidity
               of the tomato.   

315
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:27,692
     I mean, it just -- the list
          goes on and on and on.

316
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,027
     Thank you.                 
   That was nice.               

317
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,562
You broke that down nice.       

318
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,230
              That's your song  
             right there, baby. 

319
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,032
      Tom Kha Gai steamers.     

320
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,901
             WOMAN:             
  The broth is a little sweet,  
  but it's also got that spice. 

321
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:40,105
  The fried crab is delicious.  
It's like a seafood potato chip.

322
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,907
  Crispy noodles, and they get  
   a little tender and chewy.   

323
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,509
The scallops melt in your mouth.

324
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,978
This is not what I was expecting
when I came to Chico.           

325
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,513
     It's good, clean food.     

326
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,981
  I think a lot of people think 
 of Chico as this college town, 

327
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,584
       but it is becoming       
      a foodie destination.     

328
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,453
          Just being in         
      an agricultural area,     

329
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:58,656
   we have access to a lot of   
 really delicious, fresh produce

330
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,991
      as well as fresh fish     

331
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,527
       'cause the ocean's       
     not terribly far away.     

332
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,729
   We're hanging out in Chico   
  at a joint that you probably  

333
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,264
  wouldn't expect -- a raw bar. 

334
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,865
     But when we come back,     
     the chef is gonna make     

335
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,734
         something else         
   that'll just blow our mind.  

336

449
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,142
   All right, what do you get   
        when you combine        

450
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,878
 a marine biologist and a chef? 

451
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,413
     No, this is not a joke,    
            you guys.           

452
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,480
 I'm really serious about this. 

453
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,882
  You get a funky little joint  

454
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,817
  right here on the main street 
      of Vancouver, Canada,     

455
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:22,954
  that's serving up locally and 
 sustainably harvested seafood. 

456
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,756
    This is The Fish Counter.   

457
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,425
       Two crispy oysters       
      and a bouillabaisse.      

458
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,628
 This is the place where people 
 who know fish come for seafood.

459
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,131
       Your oyster Po'boy.      

460
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,899
         WOMAN: They'll tell you
              what's available, 

461
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,166
                what's fresh,   
              what's in season. 

462
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,102
  They'll tell you the fishermen
            who caught the fish,

463
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,303
            and they'll tell you
               how to cook it.  

464
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,838
         And that's just        
     the fish-counter side.     

465
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,773
    FIERI: That knowledge is    
       dished out by owner      

466
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,309
      and marine biologist      
         Mike McDermid.         

467
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,178
       And in the kitchen,      
         Chef Rob Clark         

468
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,313
          is cooking it         
  as fast as they can catch it. 

469
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,648
        The cod, please.        

470
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,384
   FIERI: Together, they take   
    their mission seriously.    

471
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,519
       We demonstrate that      
      you can have a local,     

472
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,989
          responsible,          
    sustainable seafood shop    

473
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,323
   and still stay in business.  

474
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,526
It becomes, with our customer,  
an education process.           

475
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,461
             So it's education, 
                conservation.   

476
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,063
I mean, if you look at          
our case, it's super minimal.   

477
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,264
           I want to try it all.

478
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,933
      And we'd love you to      
     taste the Keta Salmon.     

479
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,401
    That's a fish and chips.    

480
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:11,736
        I've never heard of fish
     and chips done with salmon.

481
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,404
   MAN: The place is known for  
       its fish and chips.      

482
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,006
      I don't think anybody     
       does it any better.      

483
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,474
    CLARK: Two-piece salmon.    

484
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,674
            WOMAN #2:           
         This is unique.        

485
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:18,876
       You don't just get       
     your random whitefish.     

486
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:21,479
   It's one of the underdogs,   
         unsung heroes.         

487
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,214
    -What's kicking this off?   
         -Tartar sauce.         

488
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,949
Simple, fresh ingredients.      

489
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:27,551
         -Regular mayo.         
    -Lemon juice, cornichon.    

490
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,153
       Ground-up little pickles.

491
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,821
       -Parsley, tarragon.      
            -Got it.            

492
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,824
   Chopped capers,              
      shallots,                 

493
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,225
  and a little bit              
    of dry dill.                

494
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,094
       This'll just improve with
           a little bit of time.

495
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,094
Yeah, about two hours.          

496
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,629
           -Next step?          
            -Batter.            

497
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,097
                     Up!        

498
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,098
                 Batter up.     

499
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,500
     Oh, that's                 
 an American thing.             

500
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,836
                  Is that?      
     No, you guys play baseball.
    I'm just kidding.           

501
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,570
 All-purpose flour,             
     rice flour,                

502
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:47,772
     quite a bit                
  of baking powder.             

503
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:48,706
          Quite a bit, for sure.

504
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,708
     Cornstarch,                
and a touch of salt.            

505
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,110
Soda water, a little bit        
   of local beer.               

506
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,645
You're getting the effervescence
               from the beer,   

507
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,780
              the effervescence 
            from the soda water.

508
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,449
So one of the techniques        
      we use is                 

509
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,252
frozen stainless-steel plates   
that keep the batter cold.      

510
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:02,720
                 The colder,    
          the lighter and airier

511
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,122
               it's gonna puff  
       when it hits the hot oil.

512
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,456
            -Exactly.           
            -Love it.           

513
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,657
         And what type of salmon
        is this we're gonna use?

514
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,259
Harrison River wild Keta        

515
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,561
    caught by the               
Chehalis First Nation.          

516
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:11,796
It's a meatier fish.            

517
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,064
  We're just gonna              
    batter this,                

518
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,265
put it on the cold plate.       

519
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,732
                 And we fry.    

520
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:16,934
            So, fresh-cut fries,

521
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,202
       and what kind of potatoes
               are we getting?  

522
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,604
   Local Kennebecs              
    from Langley.               

523
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:22,173
And then some salmon            
   fit for a king.              
                        Wow!    

524
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,209
             That right there --

525
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,977
        that's got a good amount
                 of flavor,     

526
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:30,948
       not oily one bit, and you
          get some great crunch.

527
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,083
          Batter's not too much.

528
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,085
             It's not competing 
               with the fish.   

529
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:37,088
          Tartar sauce -- that's
     a nice balance right there.

530
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,824
              Fries are legit.  

531
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:41,158
             Give me the rundown
                on the slaw.    

532
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,095
Kale, cabbage, rice vinegar,    
 and celery shoots.             

533
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,797
           Nice juxtaposition to
        the salty-fried-crunchy.

534
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,499
         Nicely done, my friend.

535
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,501
     And a two-piece salmon.    
             Enjoy.             

536
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:51,902
        Ah! It's so good.       

537
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,237
It has, like, the perfect crisp,

538
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,239
         but also, like,        
        a softness to it.       

539
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,440
              MAN:              
  There's a lot of good flavor  

540
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,175
      with the tartar sauce     
         and the fries.         

541
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,777
          It's also highlighting
              a salmon species  

542
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,579
              that isn't often  
                cooked with.    

543
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,114
Which is the perfect fish       
to do for fried fish.           

544
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:04,315
                 Absolutely.    

545
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:07,184
   They respect the resources.  
           100% local.          

546
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,320
     If it's not available, even
  though you love to carry it...
     Don't have it.             

547
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:12,056
      If it's not harvested from
      the responsible fishermen,

548
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,724
             you don't carry it.
  We don't have it.             

549
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:16,060
       Okay, here we go --      
        Sturgeon Banh Mi.       

550
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,928
 Does sustainability            
      mean that                 

551
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,531
you have to lack in flavor,     
it has to lack in quality?      

552
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,533
       Oh, definitely not,      
  elsewise I wouldn't be here.  

553
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,734
             -Okay.             
     -This stuff is amazing.    

554
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,469
  One BC Bouillabaisse, please. 

555
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,071
   BC Bouillabaisse is kind of  
        like a fish stew.       

556
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,340
      It has some shellfish     
  and some other fish in there. 

557
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,677
         And then it has        
  a really nice garlic element. 

558
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,812
  A French classic,             
but a BC version of it.         

559
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,347
              You're taking me  
             from fried seafood 

560
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,683
      to gently poached-in-broth
                  seafood.      

561
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,017
              -Yes.             
          -I like that.         

562
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:43,354
Little bit of olive oil,        
some onions, garlic,            

563
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:45,623
 some salt, fennel.             
     Love that amount of fennel.

564
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,424
I'm basically starting          
with the harder vegetables      

565
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,159
 and moving towards             
     the softer.                
          As they'll cook down. 

566
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,629
Peppers, bay leaves,            
  and some saffron.             

567
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,264
        -Let that bloom.        
           -Tomatoes.           

568
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,900
It'll take about 15, 20 minutes 
for this to cook down.          

569
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:56,834
  This is our base.             

570
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,302
    Now we go --                
we cook it to order.            

571
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,770
            In the seafood tank,

572
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,639
              you have baskets  
         of different shellfish.

573
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,708
              You can't get it  
          any fresher than that,

574
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,042
        unless you're pulling it
               out of the sea   

575
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,711
          and you're standing on
           the back of the boat.

576
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,179
 So, we'll just get             
a little bit of the base,       

577
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,246
   get some clams.              

578
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,715
            The hardest to open,
             the thickest shell.

579
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:11,982
        Yep.                    
    Few mussels.                

580
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,985
    Let's talk about this garlic
         puree that goes on top.

581
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,453
It's roasted garlic confit.     

582
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,255
Feed in a little bit of         
vegetable oil and puree it up.  

583
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,123
          I'd like to smear that
             on some sourdough. 

584
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,191
                    Wow.        
           That's a good dollop.

585
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,525
        Yeah.                   
   Some sablefish.              

586
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,127
 You guys call them             
 Alaskan black cod.             

587
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,462
Wild northern coho salmon,      
  some Pacific Cod,             

588
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,864
some sockeye, some ling.        
           I'm a big ling fan.  

589
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,767
And we're gonna wait            
about 30 seconds, and --        

590
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,936
   -Just enough to wake it up.  
              -Yep.             

591
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:34,671
All the little gems in the crown
     right on top of this thing.

592
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,074
Little bit of extra oomph.      

593
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:40,745
                     ♪♪         

594
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:43,013
      Mmm. There's that textural
             element to veggies 

595
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,683
    and the tomatoes, which adds
          this really nice bite.

596
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,618
                Then you have   
             this garlic confit 

597
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,553
              that adds a real  
              nice body to it.  

598
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,021
                Then you have   
              fresh shellfish.  

599
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,757
                It's tender,    
         but it has a completely

600
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,960
              different profile 
             than the fish does.

601
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:58,495
         And then to have a nice
       little variety of fish --

602
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:03,034
     so simple, yet so delicious
                and refined.    

603
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,369
             Oh, shut the front 
               and back door.   

604
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,371
       Bouillabaisse is up      
          for table 71.         

605
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,906
  MAN: Every bite you're taking 
     is something different.    

606
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,440
   It's also something fresh.   

607
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:14,378
  Everything orchestrated like  
    a little symphony of yes.   

608
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,780
   WOMAN: It really highlights  
         how this place         

609
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:18,783
   uses every part of the fish  
   and nothing goes to waste.   

610
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:20,518
           It's really          
      fin-to-tail cooking.      

611
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,452
          -Fin-to-tail.         
      -One chowder, please.     

612
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,321
    It's by far the best spot   
     to come and get seafood    

613
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,389
          in Vancouver.

        around the world.       

615
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,060
           FIERI: We heard about
            the fresh-fish case.

616
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,394
             We heard about you 
                 as a chef.     

617
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,730
  We heard about the sustainable
        attitude and enthusiasm.

618
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,598
     I think you've knocked both
        of them out of the park.

619
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,201
               Congrats, man.   
   Thank you.

          [ Laughter ]          

628
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,686
                I don't know.   
    I caught an edge on my foot.

629
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,154
       I about came over on you.
