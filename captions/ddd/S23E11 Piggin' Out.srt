00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,502
   Mozzarella cheese, as much as
             it's not Colombian,

118
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,638
      there's a nice stringiness
                   to it.       

119
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,106
                    Mmm.        

120
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,909
   And that sofrito really works
               with that pork.  

121
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,511
             Mmm. Great flavor. 
              Nice and tender.

 Appreciate it, Guy.            

124
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,717
       Perfectly crunchy,       
     but a very soft inside.    

125
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,253
You can't go wrong with choosing
    any of their selections.

00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,855

127
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,723
        I like this place

128
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,124

133

 and to see it all come together
          in one plate,         

134
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,267

137

           a veteran,           

138

139
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:37,609
        Pig Latin plate.        

140
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,344
 That plate is just phenomenal. 

141
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,947
      There's beans, rice,      
       and then plantains.      

142
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,949
       The pork's tender.       
 It works really well together. 

143
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,351
                 All right,     
     what are we getting to now?

144
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:47,819
All right, here we're going     
to be doing the mojo            

145
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:48,420
for the Pig Latin Plate.        

146
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:49,554
                    Okay.       

147
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,089
First, it starts off            
 with orange juice.             

148
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,557
  Salt and pepper.              

149
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:53,558
    Some garlic.                

150
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,692
              A lot of garlic.  

151
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,962
   Oregano. Cumin.              

152
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,764
     Olive oil.                 

153
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:01,066
And then some lime juice        
to give it a little sour kick.  

154
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,636
All right, so we're getting     
   the pork butt.               

155
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,505
   Put some holes               
    in it first.                

156
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:07,906
Then the mojo marinade.         

157
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:11,776
  A little oregano.             
Cumin. And black pepper.        

158
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:12,977
            So it is pork again.

159
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,512
    It is done in a Latin style,

160
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,782
      but a completely different
                 direction.     

161
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:20,318
Cover it up.                    
                325 for 8 hours.

162
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,653
            We ready to do this?
It's ready to go.               

163
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,588
    Let's do it.                

164
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,523
                Look at that.   
              Just pulls apart. 

165
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,925
              Nice crust on it. 

166
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,194
               That will work.  

167
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,596
We're gonna get some rice.      
 We got some beans.             

168
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:34,132
We got some tomato base,        
cumin, oregano, sazón.          

169
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,734
             Not Vidal "Sazón." 

170
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,268
Gooey plantains for you.        

171
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,939
    Pile of meat.               
Top it off with cheese.         

172
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,407
              A little cotija?  

173
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,875
Some cilantro right here        

174
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,477
  and a lime wedge              
 on top of the meat.            

175
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,611
   Do what you do.              

176
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,484
             Mmm. The mojo pork 
             is righteous, dude.

177
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:56,821
                Oh, my gosh.    
       That has got it going on.

178
00:05:56,823 --> 00:06:00,692
    The beans, it's like they've
      been cooked down for days.

179
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,560
               Nice little bit  
               with the rice.   

180
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,696
              And then the mojo 
                on the pork.

00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,842
      and get it rolled up here.

234
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:58,844
        Okay.                   

235
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,978
Oh, that's where I left         
     that thread                

236
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,247
from my sewing machine.         

237
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:03,648
We're gonna tie it off          
     with this?                 

238
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,249
                    Yep.        

239
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,651
        Next?                   

240
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,586
             We're gonna hit it 
            with a little sugar.

241
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:09,921
       A lot of sugar, actually.

242
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,122
                Toss that one   
              in there for me.  

243
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,057
           That's a little sake.

244
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,193
        And?                    
                            Soy.

245
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,128
 Water?                         
                    Yep.        

246
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,797
     Fantastic.                 
Now we're gonna cover this up.  

247
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,131
  How long is this              
   gonna marinate?              

248
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,333
                 Overnight.     
  Okay.                         

249
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,534
     Then we pop it in the oven.

250
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:24,269
              450 for an hour.  
Got it.                         

251
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,870
           And 250 for 2½ hours.

252
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,805
All right. Let's get into it.   
What are we doing now?          

253
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,674
                  Tsukemen.     
        Condensed chicken broth.

254
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,209
  What's in there?              

255
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:34,145
    Chicken backs, chicken feet,
             chicken wing tips. 

256
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,481
You know, I just really often   
enjoy a good chicken foot.      

257
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,082
             We already strained
                  this off.     

258
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,552
  Some miso paste?              

259
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:42,486
                    Sake.       
  Got it.                       

260
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,356
                      Sugar.    
     Okay.                      

261
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,224
 And bonito flakes?             
                            Yep.

262
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,225
               And the kombu.   

263
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,827
Kombu is dried seaweed.         

264
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,895
So think of the kelp            
coming up like this.            

265
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,665
We just dried it out and drove  
over it with a steamroller.     

266
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:54,699
                 In they go.    

267
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,167
      You took                  
 the fun stuff away.            

268
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,502
            Give it a good stir.

269
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,504
We're just gonna let this simmer
             a few more minutes,

270
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:00,771
               get everything   
               mixed together,  

271
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,240
         and it's ready to serve
                on the line.    

272
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,642
                     ♪♪         

273
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:08,313
So, we've got a cross           
between a miso soup --          

274
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:12,117
    "miso" hungry               
 and "miso" stupid.             

275
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,452
Is this the key broth           
   for the Dramen?              

276
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:16,454
       No, the main broth we use
              is a pork broth.  

277
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,389
This is chicken on pig?         
                            Yep.

278
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,524
All right, next one.            

279
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,126
               This is called   
               Tantanmen tare.  

280
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,327
      It's a spicy sesame paste.

281
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,928
                 Chili oil.     
   Okay.                        

282
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,464
               Minced garlic.   
Got it.                         

283
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,200
                   Ginger.      
             Sambal chili paste.
Got it.                         

284
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,269
                 We got the     
             sesame paste here. 
Whoa!                           

285
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,204
                  We'll get     
             these fried onions.

286
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,538
                Fried garlic.   

287
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,807
   I like the way               
   this is going.               

288
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:39,610
               Sake. Vinegar.   

289
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,612
                 Tamari soy.    
Got it.                         

290
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,748
       Water?                   
                    Yep.        

291
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,818
        Some more of that kombu.

292
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,353
Float that right in there       

293
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,221
with the 9,000 other            
    ingredients.                

294
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,157
              Salt. And sugar.  

295
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,625
Whoa, right to the rim.         

296
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,226
     How long is                
  this gonna cook?              

297
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,094
           Half hour to an hour.
Okay.                           

298
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,429
All right, now let's put        
this thing together.            

299
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,966
     Sliced up,                 
   ready to torch.              

300
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,968
Hit it with some mirin.         

301
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,636
           And just put a little
                crust on it.    

302
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:05,837
       Mm-hmm.                  

303
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,839
          See the drool come out
          of my mouth just then?

304
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,440
  Nice color to it.             

305
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,644
And we'll strain some of        
our pork broth into a bowl.     

306
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,311
    That's that.                
                        Okay.   

307
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,447
        Now we go chicken stock.

308
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,182
             And then the tare. 

309
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,116
        Yep.                    

310
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,185
              Grab the noodles. 

311
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:25,723
And we're gonna add a scoop     
of the Tantanmen paste.         

312
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,458
   Couple greens.               
      Yu choy.                  

313
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,794
It's similar to bok choy,       
  Chinese broccoli.             

314
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:34,132
Caramelized onions here.        
Japanese pickled bamboo.        

315
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,401
No egg?                         
              No, I'm driving.  

316
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:37,535
         I'm trying to cut down.

317
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,537
     And hit it                 
with this pork belly.           

318
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,072
  A couple peanuts.             

319
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,607
Korean chili flakes.            

320
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,609
Black and white sesame.         

321
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,210
   More chili oil.              
                           Okay.

322
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,146
          All this for one dish.
Yep.                            

323
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,148
  Black garlic oil.             

324
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,350
   A couple leeks               
    on top there.               

325
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:53,752
 There you go, sir.             

326
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,757
                    Mmm!        

327
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,227
             It gets more wicked
              with every bite.  

328
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,963
              Wow. Outrageous.  

329
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:07,098
         This is brothy and rich
                  and deep.     

330
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,499
              There's not a lot 
                of fat in it,   

331
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:13,104
            but it has that real
   coating-the-mouth feel to it.

332
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,774
           That funky garlic oil
               coming through.  

333
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,443
              The pork belly's  
                 outrageous.    

334
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,178
        Is slurping appropriate,
                    or...       

335
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,713
   I think that's               
the proper way to do it.        

336
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,381
                [ Slurping ]    

337
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,451
              If they made this 
          in the 50-gallon drum,

338
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,319
                I'd be having   
              a hot tub in it.  

339
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,856
      The broth is perfect.     
       It's super savory.       

340
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:32,857
           It's spicy.          

341

               50 or 60 items.

          Let it rest overnight.

  And then they go              
   to the smoker?               

500
