   of the Kansas City Chiefs,   
      Coach Reid, and say,      

222
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,946
         "Listen, buddy,        
    where are we gonna eat?"    

223
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,614
     We're goin'                
  to a butcher shop             

224
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,082
   that's also the              
greatest sandwich shop          

225
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,217
you've ever eaten at.           

226
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:00,886
         -The real deal?        
         -The real deal.        

227
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:01,820
        What's it called?       

228
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:03,288
    The Pigwich!                

229
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,956
       By the way, Gruden       
     gave me his permission.    

230
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,024
       -Yeah, yeah, yeah.       
        -Come on, Coach.        

231
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,225
          [ Laughing ]          
          -Yeah, yeah.          

232
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:09,561
                 Go, Chiefs!    

233
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,162
            Walkin' in, bánh mi.

234
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,431
     It's just so fantastic.    

235
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,765
     Do you want                
some pork chops today?          

236
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,033
        Over at the local       
          pig section,          

237
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,636
     you can get all of your    
     locally sourced meats.     

238
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,838
         Pigwich is the         
       restaurant portion.      

239
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,573
         You can get sandwiches,
                  burgers.      

240
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,643
       It's all good Kansas City
                growth, man.    

241
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,578
             We're sittin' here 
               in farm country  

242
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,780
           and we're gettin' the
         freshest farm there is.

243
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,049
             FIERI:             
 And, for Alex Pope, this means 
   a roster of all-star meat.   

244
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,117
        Were you trained        
      as a butcher, or...?      

245
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,386
    I was trained               
as a restaurant chef.           

246
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:35,786
I started bringing in           
    whole animals               

247
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,188
   'cause I wanted              
the best-quality products       

248
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,856
       for my restaurants.      
-What's your restaurant's theme?

249
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,326
Everything's a sandwich,        
mostly beef and pork.           

250
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,194
       If you're into pig,      
        get the Big Pig.        

251
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,196
          Big Pig in the window!

252
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,132
         It's an amazing        
        pulled pork patty       

253
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,668
      and then, they top it     
   with this pork tenderloin.   

254
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,336
       Pork on top of pork      
         on top of pork.        

255
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,672
So, we're gonna make            
    our Big Pig.                

256
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:54,806
                Better not be   
                any reference   

257
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,741
   about any present company.   
        -[Clears throat]        

258
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,810
         What's our first step? 
The house barbecue rub.         

259
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,545
              For the pork butt 
        that we're getting ready

260
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,347
            to smoke.           
     -Sea salt, brown sugar,    

261
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,616
paprika, garlic powder,         
    ground cumin.               

262
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,551
         -Black pepper.         
          -Ancho chile.         

263
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:07,886
 A little wild card:            
   ground ginger.               

264
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,621
  We actually like              
to let it rest overnight.       

265
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:11,155
             Very nice. And what
            are we smokin' with?

266
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,092
    Hickory wood.               
250 for five-ish hours.         

267
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,027
Pull it off and we put it       
through our meat grinders       

268
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,497
 on the kidney dime,            
which gives us big chunks.      

269
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:19,564
  Add ground pork.              

270
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:20,966
                 Cooked raw,    
              comin' together.  

271
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,701
   Little bit more              
of our barbecue rub,            

272
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:23,768
   minced garlic,               

273
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,236
ground bacon trimming           
from the butcher shop.          

274
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,371
         Get your patty.        
         -Eight ounces?         

275
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:27,505
  Five and a half.              

276
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,307
          -That's big.          
           -And boom.           

277
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,375
                 Next step.     
              What are we into? 

278
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,643
  Pork tenderloin.              

279
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:32,978
          Now, wait, wait, wait,
         wait, wait, wait, wait.

280
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,312
          I'm no butcher, but...

281
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,580
Those are bone-in chops.        

282
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,049
Tenderloin is almost always     
not an actual tenderloin,       

283
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,651
  it's a tender --              
 two words -- loin.             

284
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,053
   To tenderize it              
 a little bit more,             

285
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,455
        we do                   
 a buttermilk brine.            

286
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:44,922
Hot water from the tap.         

287
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,058
Salt, garlic powder,            
    black pepper,               

288
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,260
   fresh rosemary,              
ice-cold buttermilk.            

289
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,663
      -Brined for how long?     
   -24 hours. Up to 48 hours.   

290
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:52,531
            -Got it.            
       -Standard breading,      

291
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,132
so, we're goin' flour,          
    whisked eggs,               

292
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,866
  and breadcrumbs.              

293
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,535
                Fry that all    
              and we're getting 

294
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,737
               a couple sauces  
                  on this?      

295
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,071
   We're gonna do               
  a barbecue sauce.             

296
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,740
     We're gonna do a ranch.    
   -Would it be easier, Coach,  

297
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:02,940
            if we just asked him

298
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,075
                 the things     
           that he<i> doesn't</i> make?

299
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,610
               'Cause I think   
             he makes shoelaces.

300
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:07,011
              I think he's also 
                 a cobbler.     

301
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,279
         I love cobbler.        

302
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,814
     Oh, no, you're talking     
     about the shoe cobbler.    

303
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,149
      I gotcha. I'm alert.      
         -Like you said.        

304
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,216
    -I thought we were goin'    
          -"Cobbler?!"          

305
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,685
       -right to dessert.       
           -[Laughing]          

306
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,486
       The ranch dressing is one
          of your claim to fame.

307
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,555
          Let's see it.         
       -So we've got eggs,      

308
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,290
  salt, sour cream.             

309
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,358
                You wanna do    
                the drizzle?    

310
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,093
     Canola oil.                

311
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,294
         These guys will be able
              to work this out. 

312
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,629
             I'll be right back.

313
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,230
  You know, wouldn't it be nice 
     to have hair like that     

314
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,299
   and then the little foofoo   
          on the chin?          

315
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,533
You can pour a little           
faster, now that we --          

316
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,102
                It's a little   
           half-hour show, guys.

317
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,905
 Alright, so we got             
fresh rosemary, scallions,      

318
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,908
   minced garlic,               
celery seeds, fresh sage.       

319
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,909
               Little vinegar.  

320
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,978
  And a little bit              
  of brown mustard.             

321
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,312
      Fresh ranch dressing.     
        -Are you hungry?        

322
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,114
       I brought my towel.      
           I'm ready.           

323
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,716
   So, we got our               
 pulled pork burger.            

324
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,785
Three cheeses: pepper Jack,     
 cheddar, Provolone.            

325
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:49,120
      I don't even know that you
         have a board big enough

326
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,256
             to list everything 
              that is on this.  

327
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,457
So, we're gonna start           
     with ranch.                

328
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,259
    Top bun gets
