(woman) THREE UP ON ONE,        
    HOLD THE MUSTARD.           

99
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,558
THREE HOT DOGS                  
FOR TWO PEOPLE,                 

100
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,560
THEY SAY THREE UP               
     ON TWO.                    

101
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,562
SO I'M GONNA CALL THEM          
   OUT TO YOU, OKAY?            

102
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:53,231
SEVEN UP THREE.                 
              SEVEN UP ON THREE.

103
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:54,900
TWO ONION, MUSTARD.             
                             NO.

104
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,501
                 TWO HOLD CHILI.
HUH?                            

105
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:59,504
                YOU HAVE TO HOLD
                 THE CHILI IF-- 
    MAYBE I NEED                
TO GET SOME TRAINING.           

106
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,974
 IF YOU WANT ONION AND MUSTARD, 
 THEN YOU SAY, "HOLD THE CHILI."

107
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:05,043
             THAT WAY I KNOW    
         IT'S ONION AND MUSTARD.
SO I DON'T HAVE TO SAY          
   "HOLD THE CHILI?"            

108
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,512
  IF YOU WANT ONION AND MUSTARD,
      YOU SAY HOLD THE CHILI.   

109
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,514
              IT'S A LOT EASIER.
OH, BECAUSE IT                  
HAS MUSTARD--                   

110
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,383
   OH. OKAY,                    
FORGET IT THEN.                 

111
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,851
      THEY WASTE NO TIME--      
 TWO UP ON ONE OR ONE UP ON TWO,

112
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:16,321
        AND THEY HAVE IT        
   OUT TO YOU IN NO TIME FLAT.  

113
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,790
ANDY, HE WOULD HAVE EIGHT       
OR NINE HOT DOGS LINED UP       

114
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,927
   ON HIS WRIST AND ARM--       
9 OF THEM DONE IN 30 SECONDS.   

115
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,329
I WANT TEN.                     
             I CAN'T.           
  THE ELBOW JOINT'S RIGHT THERE.

116
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,931
SEVEN.                          
            I CAN'T DO TEN, GUY.
               I CAN DO EIGHT.  

117
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,401
YOU CAN DO 12 NOW.              
        UP TO MY SHOULDER BLADE.

118
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,935
YOU GRADUATED.                  

119
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:33,405
   I HAVEN'T EVEN TAKEN IT TO   
 THE COLLARBONE OR EARLOBE YET. 

120
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:36,341
   <i> AND AFTER THEIR LINED UP,</i>   
<i>ANDY'S THROWING IN SOME FRIES--</i> 

121
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:39,211
      <i> BALTIMORE STYLE...</i>       
    THE GRAVY IS WHAT MAKES     
       THE FRENCH FRIES.        

122
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,947
  <i> AND EVEN THAT'S HOMEMADE.</i>    
 YOU GOT GRAVY                  
ON YOUR FRIES?                  

123
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,550
                      (man) YES.
 THIS IS THE FIRST PLACE I EVER 
  HAD FRENCH FRIES AND GRAVY.   

124
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:48,152
              (Guy) FRENCH FRIES
                  AND GRAVY?    
     I WAS, LIKE,               
    12 YEARS OLD,               

125
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,154
          AND I'VE BEEN         
     EATING THEM EVER SINCE.    

126
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,156
             I KNOW             
      IT'S A FAVORITE HERE.     

127
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,158
         MAYBE IT'S JUST        
       A BALTIMORE THING.       

128
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:56,160
SO YOU DIP THE FRY              
  IN THE GRAVY?                 
                           YEAH.

129
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,363
CAN I TRY ONE? NOTHING          
WRONG WITH THAT AT ALL.         

130
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,765
         THEY'RE THE BEST FRIES.
I'D DIP THE DOG IN THAT--       
        MY HAND.                

131
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:03,835
      HE'S GOT GREAT FOOD.      
NOW WHAT DO YOU NORMALLY        
 HAVE WHEN YOU COME IN?         

132
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,837
                 I USUALLY GO   
               FOR THE SLIDERS. 

133
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,839
      THE SLIDERS               
ARE THE LITTLE BURGERS?         
                 LITTLE BURGERS.

134
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:09,374
             WHAT ARE YOU USING?
CLARIFIED BUTTER.               

135
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,843
       REALLY? EACH ONE OF THEM 
      GOES ON THEIR OWN LITTLE--
YEAH.                           

136
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,845
THEY EACH GET THEIR OWN         
   DEDICATED PUDDLE.            

137
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,581
 IF YOU'RE GONNA USE FAT, THAT'S
  THE KIND OF GOOD FAT TO USE.  

138
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,583
               SO YOU THROW     
           SOME CHEESE ON THERE.

139
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,585
                 HIT IT WITH    
            A LITTLE ONION WATER

140
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,255
      FOR SOME STEAM AND FLAVOR,
      AND NOW YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.
YEAH.                           

141
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,789
                         MMM.   

142
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,791
             I GOT TO TELL YOU, 
             THE BUTTER CRUST...

143
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,326
                IS REALLY GOOD. 

144
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:29,861
                    IT'S JUICY. 

145
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,597
   THAT'S ABOUT AS GOOD A BURGER
     AS YOU CAN GET ANYWHERE.   

146
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,799
      <i> UNLESS YOU WANT ONE</i>      
       <i> WITH CONEY SAUCE.</i>       

147
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,669
  NOW THAT RIGHT THERE          
IS A CONEY ISLAND BURGER?       
   THAT'S A CONEY ISLAND BURGER.

148
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,671
          IT'S NOT LIKE         
      A REGULAR HAMBURGER.      

149
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,673
       SOME ONIONS, CHILI       
       AND STEAMED BURGER.      

150
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,275
       IT'S LIKE MEATLOAF       
          WITH ONIONS.          
I GOT TO HAVE                   
ONE OF THOSE.                   

151
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:46,078
               SO WE'VE GOT     
           GROUND BEEF AND EGGS.

152
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,146
(ring)                          
                I LIKE THE RING.

153
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,682
         IT'S LIKE WE'RE CALLING
         PEOPLE TO FOOD SERVICE.
A LITTLE BIT OF SALT,           
       PEPPER.                  

154
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,483
              PRECISE MEASURING.
VERY PRECISE.                   

155
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,419
                     OKAY. WHOA.
WE ADD LITTLE BIT               
   OF GARLIC.                   

156
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:56,487
   WE GOT A LITTLE BIT          
OF WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE.        

157
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,957
        (muttering indistinctly)
  YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.           
YOU TELL TELL ME HOW TO.        

158
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,559
       JUST SAY IT FAST, 'CAUSE 
        NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW.  

159
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,561
           SO THE BREADCRUMBS.  
         YOU GONNA EYEBALL THIS?

160
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,030
WE EYEBALL IT, AND THEN         
HAVE TO START MIXING IT.        

161
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,567
AND IF YOU CAN HOLD THE BOWL,   
  I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT.     
            SO I'M SPOTTING YOU?

162
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,569
          THIS IS KIND OF LIKE--
THIS IS MY WORKOUT.             

163
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,571
A LITTLE MORE BREADCRUMBS.      
               MORE BREADCRUMBS?

164
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:15,039
OKAY, NOW WE'RE JUST GONNA      
SCOOP IT OUT, BALL 'EM UP,      

165
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,175
AND I THROW THEM IN HERE.       
    <i> THEN HE'S BREADING THEM</i>    
      <i> WITH CRACKER MEAL.</i>       

166
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,644
SHAKE IT UP A LITTLE BIT        
THERE AND PAT THEM DOWN.        

167
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,114
          SO THESE ARE GONNA GET
                 FRIED UP.      
    WE COOK THEM                
ALL THE WAY THROUGH,            

168
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,716
 AND THEN WE PUT THEM           
IN A COOL DOWN STAGE.           
 <i> OVERNIGHT TO TIGHTEN THEM UP.</i> 

169
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,718
      <i> THEN THEY STEAM THEM</i>     
          <i> WITH ONIONS</i>          

170
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
<i>AND TOP THEM OFF WITH PAPRIKA.</i>  
        (Guy) IT'S DONE.        

171
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,189
      I CAN PULL THAT OUT,      
        PUT IT ON A BUN,        

172
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,191
    HIT IT WITH SOME ONIONS,    
     A LITTLE CONEY SAUCE--     

173
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:36,194
 TIME TO EAT. MMM.              
IT'S KIND OF SWEET.             
                 IT'S THE ONION.

174
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,196
SURE IS MOIST.                  
                     IS IT GOOD?

175
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,365
OH, IT'S GREAT.                 

176
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,734
THAT'S A HIT.                   
       MMM. ALWAYS GOOD.        

177
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,803
     IT'S GREAT. THAT'S ALL     
     I CAN SAY. IT'S GREAT.     

178
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,871
     (man) HASN'T CHANGED.      
             THERE YOU GO, JOHN.

179
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,274
         IT'S THE SAME. THE FOOD
         IS STILL THE GREATEST. 

180
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,943
    THIS IS WHAT BALTIMORE'S    
           ALL ABOUT.           
THIS PLACE IS A LANDMARK.       

181
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,546
               IT IS A LANDMARK.
                 IT'S A LEGEND. 
       MY MOM CAME HERE.        

182
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,148
       MY DAD CAME HERE.        
               HOW LONG HAVE    
           YOU BEEN COMING HERE?

       I'M HERE. ONE DAY        
   I'LL BRING MY CHILDREN UP.   

184
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,953
       WE ARE COMFORTABLE       
      DOING IT OLD-SCHOOL.      

185
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:05,023
    THAT'S THE KIND OF JOINT--  
   I WANT TO EAT WHERE HE COOKS.

00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,428
                  YOU WANT 'EM  
                 ABOUT 170, 180.

389
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:00,231
 YOU DON'T WANT 'EM SITTING AND 
  BOILING AWAY. THAT'S A NO-NO. 

390
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,233
             I'M GONNA GET      
      YOUR INGREDIENTS TOGETHER.

391
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,635
AND YOU CUT EVERYTHING          
      TO ORDER.                 
               I--ON EVERYTHING.

               GOT THAT HOT DOG 
               IN A STEAMED BUN,

393

                 ONIONS GO NEXT,

           UNIQUE GREEN RELISH. 

395
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,978
        IT'S GOT TO BE THAT WAY 
      IF YOU WANT A CHICAGO DOG.

396
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,580
         COUPLE OF SPORT PEPPERS
           AND THE CELERY SALT. 
CELERY SALT.                    

397
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,449
               AND MUSTARD--    
          THAT IS A CHICAGO DOG.

398
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,653
MMM. GREAT DOG,                 
  NICE SNAP.                    

399

400
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,189
BUN STEAMED PERFECTLY,          
      VERY GOOD.                

401
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,724
                 WHERE YOU FROM?
CHICAGO.                        

402
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,327
       HOW DID THIS STACK UP    
   IN THE WORLD OF CHICAGO DOGS?
VERY GOOD.                      

403
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,796
                A LOT OF ONIONS,
                LOTS OF MUSTARD.
THE SPORT PEPPERS,              
   THE RELISH                   

404
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,598
AND THEY PUT A WHOLE PICKLE     
      ON THERE, TOO.            
IT'S ALL DONE RIGHT.            

405
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,400
   <i> BUT IT ISN'T ALL HE'S GOT.</i>  

406
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,803
  SO WHAT ABOUT MAKING ME       
ONE OF THOSE DRIVE-IN DOGS?     

407
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:41,072
                 GOT TO MAKE    
             THE COLESLAW FIRST.
  THAT SHOULD BE                
ANOTHER ADVENTURE.              

408
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,474
   MY WHOLE THING WITH COLESLAW 
    IS CONSISTENCY OF THE CUT.  

409
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,943
OH, SO YOU REALLY               
TAKE IT DOWN, HUH?              
                           YEAH.

00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:48,746
   AN ONION HERE, NICE AND FINE,
      REAL FINE CHOP THERE,     

411
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,414
         A LITTLE BLACK PEPPER, 
              CELERY SALT.      

412
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:51,683
             THIS IS THE SUGAR. 

413
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,885
       SHAKE IT ALL TOGETHER,   
     GET IT ALL MIXED IN THERE. 

414
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:56,154
           ALL WE GOT TO DO NOW 
            IS PUT THE MAYO IN. 

415
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,955
               LOOKING GOOD.    
           WE MADE OUR COLESLAW.

416
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:00,224
            SO WE GOT TO MAKE   
        A BATCH OF CHILI FOR YA.
GONNA CUT THAT ONION FRESH.     

417
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,627
         ABSOLUTELY. IT DEPENDS 
         WHAT I'M USING IT FOR. 

418
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,029
         IT MIGHT BE FINE       
   OR JULIENNE OR BIGGER CHUNKS.

419
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,231
          MAYBE OLD JIM'S TOOTH 
         ISN'T WORKING SO GOOD, 

420
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,633
        AND WE GOT TO, YOU KNOW,
          SOFTEN IT UP FOR HIM. 

421
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:11,635
       LET'S GET OUR PAN GOIN'. 

422
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,637
WELL, I LIKE THE WAY            
      YOU ROLL,                 

423
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,839
BUT HOW ABOUT JUST, LIKE,       
 A LITTLE CLICK LIGHTER?        

424
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,176
   I LOSE THOSE, AND THEY BREAK 
   DOWN, AND THEY'RE WORTHLESS. 

425
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,643
         GET SOME OIL IN THERE. 

426
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:21,912
   COVER 'EM. KEEP ALL THE YUMMY
     ONION MOISTURE IN THERE.   

427
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,315
        GET SOME GARLIC GOING.  
       I JUST LOVE THAT GARLIC. 

428
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,317
            LITTLE HABANEROS,   
        CAREFUL WITH THAT STUFF.

429
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,319
     WHOO-HOO. GROUND BEEF HERE,
             SOME MORE.         

430
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,255
SO REALLY NO MEASUREMENT STYLE, 
   JUST KIND OF EYEBALL IT,     

431
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,924
LIKE, YOU FEEL GOOD.            
            YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW
             HOW MUCH YOU NEED. 

432
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,327
       PUT A LITTLE LID ON THERE
          FOR JUST A SECOND.    

433
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,795
            LITTLE BLACK PEPPER,
                LITTLE CUMIN.   

434
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,398
 ARE WE GONNA BE EXPERIENCING   
ANY CHILI POWDER IN THAT CHILI? 

435
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,133
          NOPE, JUST THE CUMIN. 

436
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,735
   NOW I'LL LET ALL THOSE JUICES
    FLOW RIGHT INTO THE ONIONS, 

437
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,937
            AND I JUST PUT      
       CRUSHED TOMATO IN THERE. 

438
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,940
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE             
  HOW THIS GOES.                

439
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,409
        ALL RIGHT, I GET        
 A LITTLE SPLASH OF WATER HERE, 

440
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:53,610
             AND THEN WE'RE JUST
             GONNA LET IT BOIL. 

441
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:56,280
                    MMM.        
            YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY.
DUDE, WHY'S THIS CALLED         
     THE DRIVE-IN?              

442
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,616
   YOU KNOW, MY WIFE MADE IT UP,
       AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.    

443
00:16:58,618 --> 00:16:59,950
WOW. IT'S GREAT.                

444
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,019
I LOVE ONIONS IN MY SLAW.       

445
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:04,422
FOR AS SIMPLE AS IT IS,         
      IT'S GOOD.                

446
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,824
           AND WE HAVE THAT ALSO
              ON HASH BROWNS.   

447
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,160
        WE HAVE A NEW PIONEER   
     WHO PUTS IT IN AN OMELET...

448
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,761
I GOT THE T-BUD,                

449
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:13,164
GOT THE SWEET FROM THE COLESLAW,
    THE SPICY FROM THE CHILI.   

450
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,498
          ALSO ON FRENCH FRIES. 

451
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,634
        WHO'S GOT THE DRIVE-INS?
DRIVE-IN FRIES,                 
 THEY'RE GOOD.                  

452
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,236
                   FOR A WHILE, 
                     CAREFUL.   

453
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,170
AND THAT'S THE FRYER?           
                THAT'S MY FRYER.

454
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,439
THIS DOESN'T HAVE               
  A THERMOSTAT.                 
             I'M THE THERMOSTAT.

455
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,975
NOW YOU DOUBLE-FRY,             
  I WOULD ASSUME.               
                   YES, EXACTLY.

456
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:27,178
  OH, MAN, THEY'RE LOOKING GOOD.
       THEY'RE LOOKING GOOD.    

457
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,981
      THAT'S RIGHT OUT OF       
THE LEWIS AND CLARK CAMPING KIT.
                     ABSOLUTELY.

458
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,316
          I CAN DO ALL THIS FOOD
               WITH A HUBCAP    

459
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:35,119
        ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.
  AT LEAST THAT                 
DOESN'T SCARE ME.               

460
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,121

00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,251
              SALAMO'S HIS NAME.
OKAY, LET'S DO                  
 THE SALAMO.                    

489
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,920
 ALL RIGHT, GET A LITTLE BIT OF 
GARLIC, LITTLE BIT OF HABANEROS.

490
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,389
AND, AGAIN, WE'RE GONNA CUT     
   EVERYTHING TO ORDER?         
                     ABSOLUTELY.

491
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,457
                AND ALL BURGERS 
               ARE HAND-FORMED. 

492
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,126
     GET IT ALL MIXED IN THERE. 

493
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:51,128
             ANGUS BEEF--ABOUT  
           1/3 A POUND, USUALLY.

494
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:53,598
 NICE AND FLAT, I LIKE IT FLAT. 
GET NICE AND DONE IN THE MIDDLE.

495
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:54,999
LOOK AT THAT.                   

496
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,401
                 YOU WANT CHEESE
                    ON YOURS?   
OH, YES, PLEASE.                

497
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,871
       ALL RIGHT. THINK YOU WANT
          LETTUCE AND TOMATO?   
LET'S DO LETTUCE                
   AND TOMATO.                  

498
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,573
DOES THE KNIFE                  
 HAVE A NAME?                   
        LOOKS LIKE IT WAS DAVE'S
              AT ONE TIME.      

499
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:05,009
WHO WAS DAVE?                   
      HE CAME IN, AND I GAVE HIM
        A PHILLY CHEESESTEAK,   

500
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:07,211
             AND HE GAVE ME     
         A BUNCH OF NICE KNIVES.

501
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,545
VOILà, LE BURGER.               

502
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,147

503
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:12,549
   GOT THE GARLIC,              
DIDN'T GET MUCH HEAT.           

504
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,551
OOH. THERE'S A LITTLE HEAT.     

505
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:16,754
SURE YOU DIDN'T GET             
THE SCOTCH BONNETS?             

506
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:18,089
GOOD BURGER.                    

507
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:19,690
AND HOW MUCH?                   
                        4 BUCKS.

508
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,493
   FOR 4 BUCKS, DUDE,           
THAT KILLS ANY FAST FOOD.       

509
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,696
    THE FOOD IS GOOD. IT'S FAST.
          IT'S INEXPENSIVE.     

510
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,498
         (man) AMAZING.         
IT'S MY MAIN STAPLE.            

511
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,368
       WHAT'S THIS GUY INHALING?
 SPICY, SPICY                   
ITALIAN COMBO.                  

512
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,770
ALL RIGHT, LET'S MAKE           
 THE ITALIAN COMBO.             
                      ALL RIGHT.

513
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,773
       WE GET THAT BUN STEAMING,
          LOCALLY COOKED BUN.   

514
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,708
              NOW WE GOT TO GET 
             THE SAUSAGE GOING. 

515
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,644
                IT'S DEEP-FRIED 
               AND THEN GRILLED.
(whistles)                      

516
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,045
 ALL RIGHT, WE'LL LET THAT COOK 
     UP FOR A LITTLE WHILE.     

517
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,247
THERE WE GO.                    

518
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,382
THAT'S LIKE TENDERIZING         
   A CHICKEN BREAST             

519
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:48,386
WITH A BASEBALL BAT.            
       I MAKE MY AU JUS TO ORDER
              WITH GARLIC.      

520
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:50,454
    PUT ANY OIL                 
IN THAT GARLIC OR--             

521
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,723
         I PUT A HUNK OF BUTTER.
HUNK-A HUNK OF BUTTER.          

522
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,925
                         SALT.  

523
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:57,461
     WE JUST WAIT TILL THIS GETS
      BROWNED UP A LITTLE BIT,  

524
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,797
        THEN I PUT MY ROAST BEEF
          RIGHT ON TOP OF THAT, 

525
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,531
   THIN-SLICED VIENNA ROAST BEEF
         ALL FROM CHICAGO.      

526
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:03,000
                      COVER IT, 

527
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,802
    LET THE GARLIC AND BUTTER   
COOK INTO THE BEEF A LITTLE BIT.
OKAY.                           

528
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,738
                 ALL RIGHT, MAN.
OH, LOOK AT THAT.               

529
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,140
                         CHEESE?
OKAY.                           

530
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,408
WHAT ARE YOU DIGGING FOR,       
          PAT?                  
                    THE HABANERO
                      FOR YA.   

531
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:15,279
THIS IS A HONKER.               
                         MM-HMM.

532
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:18,949
        IT'S GOT THE FLAVOR,    
     THE TEXTURE, THE SALTINESS.

533
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,419
   I MEAN, SAUTéING THE GARLIC, 
    HITTING THE MEAT IN THERE,  

534
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,887
             THAT'S GOOD STUFF. 

535
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,889
I GOT TO GIVE YOU PROPS ON THAT,
  MAN. THAT IS--THAT WAS GREAT. 

536
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,358
IT'S FANTASTIC.                 

537
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,759

      AND A FRIENDLY PLACE.     

539
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,764
