00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,201
           Hey, there.          

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,669
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:07,139
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:08,807
          This trip...          
Look at this.                   

5
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,676
      ...we're seeking out      
        the standards...        

6
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:13,278
    Yes!                        
   ...that totally stand out.   

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,013
         Knock your mama        
     out the rocking chair.     

8
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,216
We don't typically use          
that line on "Triple D."        

9
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:20,752
   FIERI: In Jackson, Wyoming,  
      rock-star Mexican...      

10
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,621
              There were sopes  
          at the bottom of this.

11
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:25,090
 ...with high-altitude attitude.

12
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:26,692
This would be outstanding       
   in California.               

13
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,894
 This is remarkable             
all the way out here.           

14
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,963
       Then in Long Beach,      
          California...         

15
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:32,965
I'm a brain surgeon.            
I just do it through            
their belly.                    

16
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:36,234
      ...a colorful bistro      
    serving up local food...    

17
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,903
  It's a huge hit.              
It's really delicious.          

18
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:39,971
     ...with artistic flair.    

19
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,239
   You're painting              
your own masterpieces.          

20
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,841
  And in Carmel, California...  

21
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:43,908
    Calm down, G.               
   You're dancing.              

22
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:44,976
              Ooh!              

23
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,778
             FIERI:             
  ...tag-teaming with G. Garvin 

24
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,181
        on some righteous       
       East Coast Italian.      

25
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:50,182
      Just a bada, no bing.     

26
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:51,183
         FIERI: My man.         

27
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:52,651
          Three words.          
        Forget about it.        

28
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:53,718
                    Ooh.        

29
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,988
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

30
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,322
         on "Triple D."         

33
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,402
          So, I'm here          
    in this cool little town    

34
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,338
    called Carmel-by-the-Sea,   
           California.          

35
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,474
       Great restaurants,       
   lots of cool little shops,   

36
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:17,276
             and I'm hanging out
             with my buddy here,

37
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:19,010
                  G. Garvin     
       from The Cooking Channel.

38
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,679
               Now, G., I know  
            what you're wanting.

39
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,148
     You're saying, "Get me some
     really good barbecue sauce,

40
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,217
         some sweet potatoes --"
Oh! No barbecue.                

41
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,618
         Then how about Italian?

42
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,920
          This is Little Napoli.

43
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,225
       Ravioli going down       
   with the Arrabbiata sauce.   

44
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:34,693
      WOMAN: It's so good.      
         And I just know        

45
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,095
        that I'm getting        
      something authentic.      

46
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,330
              PèPE:             
 Chicken parmigiana, here we go.

47
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:39,565
   It just embraces everything  

48
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,099
       that Italian life        
       is supposed to be.       

49
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,836
   FIERI: That's because since  
 1989, owner and chef Rich Pèpe 

50
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,305
       has been serving up      
         family recipes         

51
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,975
      you don't usually see     
        outside the boot.       

52
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:52,177
  A lot of people               
  don't understand              

53
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,179
    how regional                
  Italian food is.              

54
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:56,181
       With all my grandparents 
     coming from Southern Italy,

55
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,516
                that's where    
              we really focus.  

56
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:58,650
     That's what I grew up with.

57
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:00,251
           And also, being from 
           New Jersey, you know,

58
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,920
      if you don't put good food
                on the table,   

59
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,522
      somebody's gonna get hurt.
             Truly.             

60
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:04,790
          [ Laughter ]          

61
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,527
              PèPE:             
 Cannelloni tricolore, pick up. 

62
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:09,661
      Love the cannelloni.      

63
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,797
      It's such a surprise      
        when it arrives.        

64
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,733
  It has red, white, and green  
     like the Italian flag.     

65
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,468
           Tricolore.           
    Three colors, my brother.   

66
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,736
Come on!                        
             My man.            

67
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:18,737
 So, how we starting            
      this off?                 

68
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,005
Working the stuffing            
     right now?                 

69
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,073
                  Yes, sir.     
Hit it.                         

70
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:23,275
            Pèppoli extra virgin
                 olive oil,     

71
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:26,611
              onions, zucchini, 
   yellow squash, and mushrooms.

72
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,214
             Fresh ground pepper
                over the top.   

73
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,083
      Little bit of kosher salt.

74
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:32,551
            So, we're just gonna
               cook that down   

75
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:33,885
              for just a couple 
                 of moments.    

76
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,153
Just sweating it a bit.         

77
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,554
         Just sweating it a bit 
    'cause it will cook later on

78
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,357
                when we make    
            the cannelloni roll.

79
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:41,092
             Chicken coming in. 
        This is grilled chicken.
Okay.                           

80
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,295
          Just a little parsley 
        at the end just to fold.

81
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:46,165
         Basically, that's done.

82
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,500
            Now we're gonna make
              the pesto sauce.  
Got it.                         

83
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,469
                   Garlic.      
                Fresh basil.    

84
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:52,538
    A lot of it.                

85
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,073
                 Olive oil.

                Blend it just   
        for a couple of seconds.

88
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,314
           I don't want to heat 
          that cheese up at all.

89
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:04,649
I like you leave a little       
texture to it. Okay.            

90
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,318
      Let me get after that     
         for you, boss.

       on the show, baby.

 I get to do what I want to do. 

96
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,660
Okay. Now we'll fold in         
a little heavy cream.           

97
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,329
Now you make your own pasta,    
      as well.                  

98
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:18,530
                   We do.       
 Wow.

            And one, two, three.

102
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,172

 little salt water.

               What can I say?  

110
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,889
               Now we can take

00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,456
              Let's take a look 
              at our cioppino.  

227
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,723
 Mmm, it's gorgeous.            

228
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,926
              Pasta coming out  
                of the water.   

229
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,395
         Oh!                    
    Look at that.               

230
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:45,864
               A little sauce   
               over the top.    

231
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:50,001
      And now we are gonna go in
              with our seafood. 

232
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,470
Look at this.                   
             Right over the top.

233
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,073
             That's like grandma
                used to make.   

234
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,474
     Fresh parsley over the top.

235
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,409
              Little chili oil  
                over the top.   

236
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,877
        Ohh.                    

237
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,346
      I don't want to hurt you. 
   I don't want to hurt you now.

238
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,215
               Cioppino rosso.  

239
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:04,282
 You make the pasta,            
 you make the sauce,            

240
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,483
you roast the shells,           

241
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,519
you live in the house           
    of Pèpeville.               

242
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,889
    Oh, the sauce is bananas.   

243
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:14,025
  Nice spice to it.             
Pasta's not overcooked.         

244
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,961
  This is spicy, just the right 
         amount of heat.        

245
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,097
It's gorgeous.                  
        Oh, it's spot-on.       

246
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,298
  I make cioppino.              

247
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,034
It's one of my favorite         
  personal dishes.              

248
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,102
This is outstanding.            

249
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,370
            Oh, yeah.           
               That means a lot.

250
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,973
                 Thank you.     
   Mmm.                         

251
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,608
        Okay.                   
    Now I'm done.               

252
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,110
               Cioppino rosso.  
                  Andiamo.      

253
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,914
  WOMAN: It makes you feel like 
   you're in the Italian coast  

254
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,849
     with fresh seafood that    
  just jumps out of the water.  

255
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,385
              MAN:              
 It's pretty much the only place
   that we can come and get it  

256
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,387
     where it's very similar    
   to how we make it at home.   

257
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,189
       Pèpe knows exactly       
        what he's doing.        

258
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,790
     Little bit of shallots.    

259
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,659
  What you've done,             
how you're doing it,            

260
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,594
   you're a lover               
of the Italian culture,         

261
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,062
and you really exude that.      

262
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,697
                      Wonderful.
Very nice to meet you,          
        Chef.                   

263
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,737
        FIERI: Coming up,       
     in Jackson, Wyoming...     

264
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,405
          I can't shovel this in
                fast enough.    

265
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,873
         ...Mexican-made        
     with old-school style.     

266
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,409
This is the only one in Jackson.
         I'm pretty sure of it. 

267
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:05,377
  That's gangster.              

268
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,919
          So, I'm here          
      in Jackson, Wyoming,      

269
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,721
     and I'm about two miles    
     from the center of town    

270
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,389
         over in kind of        
        the locals' area.       

271
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,859
 Now, when you think of Jackson,
      what do you think of?     

272
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,259
Well, of course, outdoor sports.

273
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,262
   But when it comes to food,   
       what kind of food?       

274
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,731
   Well, one of the first that  
   would come up is wild game.  

275
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,399
         Then you'd have        
        some steakhouses.       

276
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,867
        But do you think        
        of Mexican food?        

277
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,602
         Well, you don't        
    until you try this joint.   

278
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,737
         This is Pica's.        

279
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,476
                    MAN:        
         Marinated shrimp tacos.

280
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:39,944
          You can tell          
    that what they're making,   

281
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,813
     they're making because     
  they love what they're doing. 

282
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,080
 Chicken mole plate.            

283
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,949
       You know, it's like      
   when you go down to Mexico   

284
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:48,019
  and someone fixes you a dish  
 in a place you'd never expect. 

285
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,554
    That's what you get here.   

286
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:52,556
   FIERI: That someone is chef  
    and owner Andy Parazette,   

287
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,825
          a So-Cal dude         
    who left behind the surf    

288
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:58,229
    to open up this mountain    
        taqueria in 2001.       

289
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,297
   Were you always              
in the restaurant business?     

290
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,232
               After college,   
              I started cooking 

291
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,968
                 and learned    
              different dishes  

292
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,969
            from different parts
                 of Mexico.     

293
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,104
               Tinga sopes up.  

294
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,442
   The sopes are so homemade.   
       They're delicious.       

295
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,377
What are you gonna make us?     

296
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:15,246
              We're gonna make  
            tinga chicken sopes.

297
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,914
       Tinga?                   
    What's tinga?               

298
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,384
           That's a traditional 
        Mexican type of chicken.

299
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:20,518
     Get going.                 
    I'm starving.               

300
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,720
                 All right.     

301
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:25,122
     So, this is the dried masa,
                salt, water.    

302
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,258
                There you go.   

303
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,927
                    Done.       
        Good.                   

304
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,862
    This is about               
as old-school real deal --      

305
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:31,930
 where did this one             
     come from?                 

306
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,331
               Down in Mexico.  

307
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,333
This is the only one in Jackson.
         I'm pretty sure of it. 

308
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,534
  That's gangster.              

309
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:39,604
   Now we're gonna roll the masa
                 into balls.    

310
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,773
              Over the plastic. 

311
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,344
             You don't press it 
                  too hard.     

312
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,680
           You want to keep them
               a little thick.  

313
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:51,082
                 All right.     
              So, you take it.  

314
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,216
                   FIERI:       
      And when we make the sope,

315
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,417
               especially with  
             this tinga chicken,

316
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:54,819
               it's gonna have  
            some moisture to it.

317
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,488
        So this kind of gives it
        a little well to sit in.

318
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,755
        Yeah.                   
                 Okay. Let's go.

319
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,091
     Now we make                
 the chicken tinga.             
                         Hit it.

320
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,092
     Canola oil.                

321
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,861
Heat up julienned onions.       

322
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:06,898
FIERI: So, the onions           
  are caramelized.              

323
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,566
Now the chicken?                
                    The chicken.

324
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,303
                And you pour    
              the tinga salsa.  

325
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,906
               Tinga salsa has  
             guajillo chillies, 

326
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:18,042
              Morita chillies,  
       fresh tomatoes, and beer.

327
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,310
          Dried Mexican oregano.

328
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,913
 So, cook this down,            
let the chicken absorb          

329
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,314
all of this great flavor.       

330
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:26,184
                 We cook it     
           for about 30 minutes.

331
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,184
   Okay, brother.               

332
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,252
Chicken tinga is done.          

333
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,587
     Sopes down.                

334
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,523
You just put a little fry       
      on these.                 

335
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,691
They'll still be tender.        

336
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,528
 If you've never had            
   a sope before,               

337
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,729
you have got to try them.       

338
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,063
One of my favorite things.      

339
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:39,998
 What kind of beans             
    are we using?               

340
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,066
      We're using refried beans.
Okay.                           

341
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,401
With lard?                      
                 With lard.     

342
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:44,802
        Yes!                    

343
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,671
             Our chicken tinga. 

344
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,810
  Romaine lettuce,              
    white onion.                

345
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,945
  There were sopes at the bottom
              of this earlier.  

346
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,279
       Tomato.                  

347
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,681
   Chipotle salsa.              

348
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:58,282
   Mexican cheese.              

349
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,818
     Sour cream.                

350
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,891
              It's outrageous.  

351
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,627
          I can't shovel this in
                fast enough.    

352
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:12,330
               The sauce fits.  
  The sopes got a little crunch.

353
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,499
               Nice and thin.   
            Holds together well.

354
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,302
                    Mmm.        
                Outstanding.    

355
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,236
     All right.                 

356
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:24,108
     MAN: Well, the chicken     
        is super tender,        

357
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,376
       kind of falls apart      
        when you bite it.       

358
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,712
     The sauces are amazing.    
              I love the sauces.

359
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,247
        Everybody in town       
        comes to Pica's.        
This is the place to go.        

360
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,248
 Here are your tacos al pastor. 

361
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,117
   You get kind of a melting pot
               here of folks,   

362
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,385
             you know, that come
              to Jackson Hole.  

363
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:37,722
       We get people from Texas,
        New Mexico, California. 

364
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,290
      All those different people

365
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,058
            have different ideas
                 of what --     

366
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,527
 Different expectations.        
       ...Mexican food is, yeah.

367
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,130
       We're from Ecuador.      

368
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,264
              What do you think 
                of this food?   

369
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,467
I come to this place            
two to three times a week.      

370
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,870
    My whole family likes it.   
      I bring my kids here.     

371
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,738
          Posole verde.         

372
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,706
             Posole, for me, is 
       a comfort food, you know?

373
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,341
             WOMAN:             
      It's extremely fresh.     

374
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,677
     The cabbage, the pork,     
     everything is just --      

375
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,479
          it's amazing.         

376
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,681
             So, we're gonna do 
          the pork posole verde.

377
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,016
       And so, what we have here

378
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,618
             is fresh tomatillos
               and jalapeños.   

379
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,021
             Next we take water 
                and fill it.    

380
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,957
             They're gonna cook 
           for about 25 minutes.

381
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,226
    We're gonna take a sauté pan

382
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:18,495
       and take julienned onions
                 and garlic.    

383
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,898
And let that just sit           
and caramelize down.            

384
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,599
                    Yep.        
    So, we're gonna strain this.

385
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,804
And then we'll puree them.      
                            Yes.

386
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,975
                And then we add 
                a little cumin. 
Ground cumin.                   

387
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,545
    Let 'er rip.                

388
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,715
So, now we're gonna take        
the blended-up tomatillo        

389
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:40,318
and jalapeños and refry it      
     in the pot.                

390
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,787
Then we're gonna add            
  the chicken stock             

391
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,856
and our salt and pepper.        

392
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:48,693
While that's cooking,           
I'm gonna cut up our pork.      

393
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,030
         And we're gonna cook it
         in this pan with what? 

394
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,799
Yellow onion and garlic.        

395
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:58,202
    And cook that               
for about 45 minutes.           

396
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,336
     All right.                 
 Pork's ready to go.            

397
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,605
                 PARAZETTE:     
          Everybody in the pool.

398
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:02,473
     Big splash.                

399
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,208
               And our hominy.  

400
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:08,313
         And we let it cook for 
       another 20 to 30 minutes.

401
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,014
                 All right.     

402
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:16,354
             So, fresh cabbage. 

403
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,555
                Fresh onion.    

404
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:18,556
               Mexican cheese.  

405
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:19,824
               Fresh cilantro.  

406
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,625
               Twist of lime.   

407
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,194
         And the fried tortilla.

408
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,732
Got a little Valentina          
     hot sauce?                 

409
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,035
         Mm.                    

410
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,570
And not that this needs         
     hot sauce,                 

411
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,172
but there's just something about
all the times I've had posole   

412
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,908
 that I got to have             
a little bit of that tang.      

413
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:44,248
 It's the freshness             
   of the cilantro              

414
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,284
and the crunch of the onion     
  and the cabbage.              

415
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,487
And the pork is ridiculous,     
 fall-apart tender.             

416
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,657
        Mmm!                    

417
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,258
        Snap!                   

418
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,661
   There's your posole verde.   

419
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,195
     It's kind of addicting.    

420
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:01,532
            The spicy           
    with the sweet and tangy.   

421
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:05,737
 When you live in a destination 
    resort like Jackson Hole,   

422
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,606
  one of the places you always  
      recommend is Pica's.      

423
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:09,807
And I'm gonna tell you          
   something, man.              

424
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,276
This would be outstanding       
   in California.               

425
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,878
 This is remarkable             
all the way out here.           

426
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,280
     Great job.                 
                   Thanks a lot.

427
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:22,820
 FIERI: Up next, an artist/chef 
  in Long Beach, California...  

428
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:23,888
                   Au jus!      

429
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,023
           ...working           
     her culinary canvas...     

430
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,025
That's a rock-star dish.        
   Nice job, girl.              

431
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,361
     ...with a full rainbow     
           of flavors.          

432
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,030
Ladies and gentlemen,           
give it up for the chef.        

433
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:42,106
 So, I'm here on Atlantic Avenue
   in Long Beach, California,   

434
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:45,376
in the Bixby Knolls neighborhood
      to check out a joint      

435
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:48,245
      where the chef/artist     
   is painting her creativity   

436
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,114
  on the canvas and the plate.  

437
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,916
 This is The Factory Gastrobar. 

438
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,255
                   Au jus!      

439
00:15:57,257 --> 00:16:00,658
     Presentation is great.     
 The ingredients are different. 

440
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,326
  The menu changes constantly.  

441
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,729
             Spanish fish tacos 
               in the window.   

442
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:07,598
   Self-taught chef and owner   
        Natalie Gutenkauf       

443
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,201
 opened this comfort-food joint 
            in 2009,            

444
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:13,604
   combining her two loves --   
          art and food.         

445
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,006
                  Order up!     

446
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,207
     This is all                
you've wanted to do,            

447
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,408
        be in                   
the restaurant business?        

448

           and unique.          

559
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:34,398
      There is nothing else     
      in this area like it.     

560
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
You're painting your own        
masterpieces and it's unique.   

561
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,002
Ladies and gentlemen,           
give it up for the chef.        

562
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,770
          [ Applause ]          

563
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,141
        So, that's it for       
   this trip, but don't worry.  

564
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:47,011
 There's plenty more "Triple D" 
  joints all over the country!  

565
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:49,013
     I'll be looking for you    
            next week           

566
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:50,948
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

567
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,149
  Just so you know,             

568
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,684
the show was over, like,        
  five minutes ago,             

569
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,953
but we are continuing           
  to mow this down.             

570
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,421
     "Triple D" after hours.    

571
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,523
       Behind the scenes.       
              Mmm!
