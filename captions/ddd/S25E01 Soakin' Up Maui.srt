00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:04,336
I'm Guy Fieri, and we're rolling
    out on a special edition    

2
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:07,239
     of "Diners, Drive-Ins,     
       and Dives" in Maui.      

3
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:10,342
        Oh, boy! Hold on.       

4
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,011
 And we've got an island guru...

5
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:13,145
                 [ Laughs ]     

6
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:15,414
       ...my brudda Reno,       
         riding shotgun.        

7
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:16,682
          You eat a lot         
          of moco loco?         

8
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,617
              Eat a lot of loco 
               loco moco moco.  

9
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,886
 First, true Hawaii classics... 

10
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:22,153
         I'm making sure        
       it's okay for you.       

11
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:23,822
      ...that are more than     
        a full meal deal.       

12
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:25,157
        That's dynamite.        

13
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:27,492
     Plus, a Southern-style     
           pit-stop...          

14
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,161
  I should probably just start  
        eating these now.       

15
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:32,097
  ...bringing big-time barbecue 
       right to the beach.      

16
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,132
            Oh, man!            

17
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:34,033
             Then...            

18
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:35,834
                 [ Laughs ]     

19
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,569
         ...the freshest        
         of the catch...        

20
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:38,970
         -That's legit.         
         -This is legit.        

21
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:41,106
         ...turned into         
  a mouth-watering masterpiece. 

22
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,374
          Look at that.         

23
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,109
     Honestly, I don't know     
     if I can eat any more.     

24
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,844
       I might have to go       
       outside, lay down.       

25
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:48,046
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

26
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,949
         when "Triple D"        
       rolls through Maui.      

27
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:06,198
          So, I'm here          
      for a special edition     

28
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,600
     of "Diners, Drive-Ins,     
       and Dives" in Maui.      

29
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,535
        Now, to make sure       
  that I keep everything legit, 

30
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,872
  I invited my buddy Chef Reno  
 from Fresh Catch over on Oahu. 

31
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:15,140
                Now, brother,   
                where are we?   

32
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:16,541
We're on the Hana highway,      

33
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,343
  about two minutes             
from Kahului Airport.           

34
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,012
      -Or the Maui airport.     
         -There you go.         

35
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:22,147
                 Fantastic.     
  So, I know you fly into a town

36
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,482
       and you want a "Triple D"
           experience right now?

37
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,351
                Don't worry.    
         You're in a good place.

38
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:27,786
             This is Da Kitchen.

39
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,490
       The Hawaiian Plate.      

40
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:32,558
           Home of the big food.

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,093
     Poke bowl,                 
meat loaf in the window.        

42
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:37,028
  Da Kitchen really represents  
      the local food vibe.      

43
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,897
It's really what we eat         
 here on the island.            

44
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,699
 Deuce musubi is up.            
     Pick it up.                

45
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,701
         Mariah and Les         
         are fantastic.         

46
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:45,971
    Mariah running the front    
  and Les in the back, cooking. 

47
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:47,506
      He's a mad scientist      
           back there.          

48
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,040
                     Ow!        

49
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,044
 FIERI: But Les Tomita came into
 this gig as a nightclub owner. 

50
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:53,711
Ulti-moco in the window.        

51
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,314
    You see, after investing    
     in this joint in 2000,     

52
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,583
    his partner stiffed him.    

53
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:59,985
   But instead of bailing out,  
         he doubled down        

54
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,721
     and brought in his club    
      manager Mariah Brown.     

55
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:05,057
    -Deep fried Spam musubi.    
           -Thank you.          

56
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:07,192
  FIERI: Now together, they're  
        running the joint       

57
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,927
and serving what they know best.

58
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,529
      I grew up                 
  eating this food.             

59
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,731
  Island soul food,             
island comfort food.            

60
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,399
I know what it's supposed       
   to taste like,               

61
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,668
smell like, look like.          

62
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,605
       So he's nailing it       
    with this local classic.    

63
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:22,140
      The Notorious B.I.G.      

64
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,875
    FIERI: A.K.A. loco moco.    

65
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,945
      That's Hawaii's go-to     
       for big appetites.       

66
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:30,081
What we're gonna do is fried    
rice, patty, cheese,            

67
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:33,018
SPAM, Portuguese sausage,       
     and bacon.                 

68
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,886
          It's so good.         
          It's so big.          

69
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,355
        It's just insane.       
              Okay.             

70
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:37,489
            What are            
        we making first?        

71
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,091
 We're making chili             
for our Notorious B.I.G.        

72
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,426
   It's a moco --               
  one of our mocos.             

73
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:42,894
          -It's a moco.         
        -Moco loco, yeah?       

74
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,429
             You eat            
       a lot of moco loco?      

75
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,897
              Eat a lot of loco 
               loco moco moco.  

76
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,899
    Mocomocomoco. All right,    
      let's get into this.      

77
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,568
 Just a little oil.             
  Put in the bacon.             

78
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,571
     Next SPAM.                 

79
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:55,773
The Portuguese sausage.         
Onions. Bell peppers.           

80
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,576
Okay, we're gonna move          
this all to one side,           

81
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,044
 and now gonna bring            
   the burger in.               

82
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:00,245
                 Is it 80/20    
                on your beef?   

83
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:01,313
 80/20 on the beef.             

84
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:02,714
 Now that we browned            
     our meats,                 

85
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:04,048
    we're adding                
  our tomato sauce.             

86
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,317
         -Chili powder.         
             -Okay.             

87
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,319
  Now we're adding              
  the kidney beans.             

88
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,787
A little salt and pepper.       

89
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,321
        How long is this        
        gonna cook down?        

90
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,057
     15 minutes.                

91
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:13,792
         Okay. What are         
        we making, boss?        

92
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:14,859
     Hamburger.                 

93
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,928
     Liquid egg.                

94
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,996
Sweet-bread bread crumbs.       

95
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:20,665
           Mayonnaise.          
        -Hawaiian butter?       

96
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,467
    Ground pork.                
   Chopped celery.              

97
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,536
   Pureed onions.               

98
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,870
    Salt. Pepper.               

99
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,539
Pinch of celery salt.           

100
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,141
  And then we just              
 mix this burger in.            

101
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,144
   Patty this up.               
We cook them to a medium.       

102
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:33,745
    And then when you're done   
           cooking it,          

103
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:34,879
           you put it           
          in the gravy?         

104
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,015
Juices come out from            
the burger into the gravy.      

105
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,616
     And it makes the gravy     
         more flavorful.        

106
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:39,884
 Way more flavorful.            

107
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,086
        All right, chef.        

108
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,687
    We're making                
   our fried rice.              

109
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,155
    A little bit                
  of bacon grease.              

110
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,692
   Brown the SPAM.              

111
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,527
       Put in                   
our Portuguese sausage.         

112
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,499
     Thought you would dance    
          or something.

224
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:45,096
         Nice char on the meat. 
         This is the island one.

225
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,165
             That teriyaki sauce
                  is magic.     

226
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,568
             Oh, that potato mac
                  is mean.      

227
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,836
        -Good. All right.       
      -It's potato and mac?     

228
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,905
              -Yes.             
           -The key --          

229
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,373
       you get the garlic       
     and you get the ginger.    

230
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,509
    It's there. Then you get    
      the note of the salt.     

231
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:58,776
           So it's not          
          overly sweet.         

232
00:07:58,778 --> 00:07:59,878
          Look at that.         

233
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,714
      Is it the real deal?      

234
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,582
          This is the real deal.
        I'll give this one a 10.

235
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,650
         10!                    

236
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,852
     All right.                 
 I got to thank you.            

237
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,321
        All right, guys.        
    I got a kalbi ribs here.    

238
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,991
         They're juicy.         
    Every bite is just yummy.   

239
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,060
           Nice char.           
 You just can't stop eating it. 

240
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:18,129
  This is a must-stop, kind of  
   like a tourist attraction.   

241
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,531
        You really better       
      bring your appetite.      

242
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:22,267
   I mean, it's just something  
     you got to experience.     

243
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,202
          Funky joint.          
     Welcome to the island.     

244
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,604
      -Exactly. Good food.      
           -All right.          

245
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,539
      You can be my brother now.
        Little work on your tan.

246
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,074
             Brudda.            
         Nice job, chef.        

247
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:30,308
     Thank you.                 

248
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:33,745
          Coming up on          
      our Maui adventure...     

249
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,146
    -Can I have another one?    
            -Unh-unh.           

250
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,414
        ...a funky little       
         smoke shack...         

251
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,816
       This is competition      
            barbecue.           

252
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,485
      ...puts some "howdy"      
          into "aloha."         

253
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,553
     You chose to treat this    

254
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,955
   like you got a little place  
        down in Memphis.        

255
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,233
                 All right,     
              my brother Reno,  

256
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,968
              time for a little 
            mainland food, okay?

257
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,303
                    Now,        
           where are we exactly?

258
00:08:58,305 --> 00:08:59,504
        Well,                   
we're in Kihei, bro.            

259
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:02,106
This is known for, like,        
windsurfing, kite surfing,      

260
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,441
snorkeling, shopping.           

261
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:05,810
    You know what they should be
   known for from what I'm told?

262
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:09,347
    Some out-of-bounds barbecue,
     'cause this is Fat Daddy's.

263
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,719
        Who's Your Daddy?       
           platter up!          

264
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,255
        By far the best barbecue
        I've ever found on Maui.

265
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,789
             SERVER:            
 Brisket for you there, my man. 

266
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,925
Puts a perfect barbecue         
 smile on your face.            

267
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,394
   Pulled chicken sandwich up.  

268
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,795
Love makes good barbecue,       

269
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:26,264
and you can taste the love      
  in all his food.              

270
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,799
  FIERI: Which comes from owner 
   Chris Schobel's childhood.   

271
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,801
I grew up smoking meats         
  in Pennsylvania.              

272
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,337
I've just always loved it.      

273
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,006
   Loved it so much he bailed   
     on his Wall Street job,    

274
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:38,076
    went to culinary school,    
        landed in Hawaii,       

275
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,411
      and ended up reviving     

276
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:42,948
          a struggling          
     barbecue joint in 2013.    

277
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,616
            Schobel:            
   Hot barbecue in the window.  

278
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:47,285
               Great flavors,   
                 rich bold.     

279
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,419
          Rib plate up!         

280
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,954
Saint Louis-style rib.          

281
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,356
       Ah. It's too good.       

282
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,691
 So, let's talk about barbecue. 
     What kind do you make?     

283
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,159
We're going a little bit        
 of North Carolina,             

284
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,161
a little bit of Texas.          

285
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:57,428
          So, let's get         
        into the dry rub.       

286
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,598
Chili powder. Kosher salt.      
Some cumin. Paprika.            

287
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,169
Some course ground pepper.      
And then some nice brown sugar. 

288
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,636
 Now we're gonna rub            
     some ribs.                 

289
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,038
           So, let me           
          ask you this.         

290
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,373
     Do you do the majority     
         of your smoking        

291
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,576
    in an old filing cabinet?   

292
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:12,510
          -No, no, no.          
              -No?              

293
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:13,912
       I have                   
a Southern Pride smoker.        

294
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,246
                    I got       
      the Hawaiian Pride smoker.

295
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,580
     You guys want to watch     
         a little clip?         

296
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,049
         -What was this?        
           -A cabinet.          

297
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,450
        It was a cabinet,       
           wasn't it?           

298
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:23,454
     Honestly, he does make     
    the best smoked octopus.    

299
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,656
So, the smoker, what temp       
are you running this at?        

300
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,692
        We smoke the ribs       
          at about 208.         

301
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:28,859
      Not 209.                  

302
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:29,927
            Not 207.            

303
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,062
    And how long                
  are you gonna go?             

304
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,197
   We go about four and a half  
         to five hours.         

305
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,066
       -Wow. That's nice.       
           -All right.          

306
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,134
        I should probably       
  just start eating these now.  

307
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,204
     Nice bark. Pulling away    
   from the bone a little bit.  

308
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,140
   And don't take your silver   
         skin off, huh?         

309
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,608
No. I like the crunch.          

310
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,210
       What are you doing?      
        Oh, that was fly.       

311
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,213
    So, we'll bring this in.    
              -Yep.             

312
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,947
     All right, let's do it.    
         Barbecue sauce.        

313
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,749
     Once again,                
a little bit Texas-style.       

314
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,284
  I put the vinegar             
 and a little spice.            

315
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:56,754
We like to use our beef fat     
  from the brisket.             

316
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:57,955
               Why do you use   
                the beef fat?   

317
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,624
You know, it just adds          
that layer of flavor.           

318
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,826
       Animal fat has got       
      10 times more flavor      

319
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:02,893
       than anything else.      

320
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:03,962
       Onions.                  

321
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:06,631
And then we use just            
a straight base of ketchup.     

322
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,299
            -Got it.            
    -Little bit of molasses.    

323
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,301
       Yeah. That's a lot       
       a bit of molasses.       

324
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,836
     The "wash your sister"     
             sauce.             

325
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:12,970
The "Wor-ces-ter-shire."        

326
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,038
          You know how          
          to say that?          

327
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,306
      "Wor-she-sher-sher-shire."

328
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:16,640
             "Wor-shter-shire." 

329
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:17,775
             "Wor-shter-sheer." 

330
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,443
       I'm gonna put that       
          on the list.          

331
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,712
  All right. Salt.              

332
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,513
   -Is this our vinegar kick?   
      -That's our vinegar.      

333
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,182
Apple cider vinegar.            
   Garlic powder.               

334
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,717
      Then for                  
a little bit of kick...         

335
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,185
     So a little hot sauce.     

336
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,220
   And then we add              
the juice of one lemon.         

337
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,989
We let it go about 35,          
     40 minutes.                

338
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:32,657
          Looking good.         

339
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,658
  So, let's cook up             
  a half rack, huh?             

340
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,393
      Give it a quick char.     
             -Right.            

341
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,929
A little baste just for         
a little more caramelization.   

342
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,432
           And you cut          
       the ribs for them.       

343
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:41,866
        Yeah.                   
 We keep it simple.             

344
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,403
     Reno, you can see that     
    these are six of my ribs.   

345
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,805
           You can't put a plate
 like this in front of a big guy

346
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,541
              and not expect me 
                 to eat it.     

347
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,975
           All right.           
            One rib.            

348
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,079
      Mmm. Delicious, huh?      
         -Amazing, bro.         

349
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,748
   Tender, really good smoke,   
           nice bark.           

350
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,151
       There's a big range      
       in barbecue, okay?       

351
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,353
          And you chose         
          to treat this         

352
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,421
   like you got a little place  
        down in Memphis.        

353
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,756
    That's a really good rib.   

354
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,158
    -Can I have another one?    
            -Unh-unh.           

355
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,692
          [ Laughter ]          

356
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,895
      All right. Go ahead.      

357
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,697
      And there's the rack      
      of ribs for you, bud.     

358
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:13,865
 They are fantastic.            

359
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,232
       MAN: Really smoky,       
       and they're tender,      

360
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,835
       but you still have       
   a little bit of bite left.   

361
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,969
             You know, it's nice
        to have ribs done right.

362
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,704
       And the pulled pork      
          for you, sir.         

363
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,306
           What is good barbecue
                   to you?      

364
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,976
 Has a nice texture,            
    falls apart,                

365
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:29,047
caramelized on the outside,     
tender, and full of flavor.     

366
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,582
               Full of flavor.  

367
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,518
  FIERI: And killer Q's got to  
  pair with some serious sides, 

368
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,321
     which is where Chris is    
   really getting bold on us.   

369
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:38,455
Probably one of the best        
corn breads you could ever taste

370
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,326
          in the world.         
       -Oh, boy! Hold on.       

371
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:44,929
 Ah, the corn bread             
   is so, so good.              

372
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,465
      SCHOBEL:                  
 Pretty good, right?            

373
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,133
        That's fantastic        
           corn bread.          

374
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,335
                 Oh. Moist.     

375
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:52,470
Comes from the big secret       
ingredient -- creamed corn.     

376
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:53,738
          Now look at that, huh?

377
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,674
         Ah, look at you        
    showing it to the camera!   

378
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:59,944
        Looks like we got       
  a professional on our hands.  

379
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,747
 From all the sides             
 to his smoked meat,            

380
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,282
    he just does                
 his food perfectly.            

381
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,083
     Fire up the burnt ends!    

382
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,818
 It's the fatty ends            
   of the brisket,              

383
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,220
      and then                  
he slow-cooks them --           

384
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,822
nice, crisp bark on there.      

385
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:12,490
        Just delicious --       
    they melt in your mouth.    

386
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:15,159
   FIERI: And great burnt ends  
    start with great brisket.   

387
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,428
          Look at that.         

388
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,963
                  Wow, bro.     

389
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,100
  SCHOBEL: That is              
a 12-hour-smoked brisket.       

390
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:24,435
    You gonna serve this up how?
  What are you gonna do with it?

391
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:26,504
We're gonna make this           
into the burnt ends.            

392
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:27,906
        -All right, chef.       
           -All right.          

393
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:30,174
We just like to take            
the top, the cap, off.          

394
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,443
            See that?           
    -Ooh, look at that juice.   

395
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:33,644
                   The cap      
              of the brisket -- 

396
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,246
 That's this part --            
   a lot fattier.               

397
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:38,316
We trim it up, cube it.         

398
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,918
   Should be just enough chew   
    to it, just enough smoke.   

399
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,853
                     Oh!        

400
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:43,655
      That's the real deal      
          right there.          

401
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,923
  All right, so, now he's doing 
    a secondary cook on this.   

402
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,059
             You put it back for
       another two, three hours?

403
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,660
Two, three hours, yep.          

404
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,063
   The ones I like to look for  
        have nice crust.        

405
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,932
  You see it almost looks like  
    a little piece of jerky.    

406
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,200
         All that color         
          right there?          

407
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,735
      That's all the smoke.     
        Burnt end sauce?        

408
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:59,737
 Yes, it is. Tangy.             

409
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,672
        -Dude, fantastic.       
       -That's good stuff.      

410
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,740
            It's like prime rib.

411
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,008
          Like nuggets          
         of friendship.         

412
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,677
             Oh. That's amazing.

413
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,212
   -It's competition barbecue.  
        -Oh, thanks, man.       

414
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,147
    Flavors are all balanced,   
        they're spot-on.        

415
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,883
     The sauce is dynamite.     

416
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,619
            Ah, man!            

417
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:15,820
         Burnt ends up!         

418
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,022
      Can't get any better      
       burnt ends on Maui.      

419
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,024
The smoke is just driving       
  through the dish.             

420
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,426
Get a double order so I can     
have it for lunch tomorrow.     

421
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,361
                Amen to that.   

422
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,896
   Throwing up on it, Roscoe.   

423
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,564
Love the barbecue here.         

424
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,232
Really puts the "wowee"         
    back in Maui.               

425
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,567
         Excellent job.         

426
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,836
      Probably the best barbecue
      I ever eat in Hawaii, bro.

427
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,304
Thank you very much.            

428
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,505
          Means a lot.          
            -Amazing.           

429
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:37,041
   The godfather of one island  
       of "Triple D"-ness       

430
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,377
       passing the torch.       
             -Nice.             

431
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:44,848
    Up next, we're hooking up   
 with Reno's partner in crime...

432
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,187
 How did my show just turn into 
 an infomercial buddy love fest?

433
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,121
           ...for some          
      out-of-bounds poke...     

434
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,323
             You taught me well,
                   Rennie.      

435
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,325
          ...served up          
       in some crazy ways.      

436
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,294
    People normally do this?    
       -Oh, not like this.      

437
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,938
         So, here we are        
        on the final stop       

438
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,006
         of this awesome        
      "Triple D" Maui tour.     

439
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,743
              Chef Reno, you're 
              calling the ball. 
              What do you got?  

440
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,210
   Well, you know               
how much I love my poke, bro.   

441
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,611
                Yes, I know.    
       You got four restaurants.

442
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,080
                He makes poke   
             everywhere he goes.

443
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,882
This is my protégé, bro.        
 He's the real deal.            

444
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:18,950
               The real deal.   

445
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:20,551
This is the real deal           
  right here, man.              

446
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,820
           This is Like Poke...?

447
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:25,689
        WOMAN: Ahi katsu.       

448
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,358
                It's the best   
       food truck on the island.

449
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,093
          I got a shoyu         
        ginger coming up.       

450
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,629
You cannot get fresher          
    fish anywhere               

451
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,564
unless you get it out           
of the ocean yourself.          

452
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,566
      FIERI: That's 'cause      
    for Chef Danny Kalahiki,    

453
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,368
   life is definitely a beach.  

454
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,304
               Aloha! Welcome.  
  What can we get for you today?

455
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,572
         As a local boy         
       and ex-pro surfer,       

456
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:44,842
     this dude knows a thing    
      or two about seafood.     

457
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:47,044
 ...I got two shoyu             
 ginger pokes ready.            

458
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,513
   Then after culinary school   
  and working in local joints,  

459
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,316
          he opened up          
      his own truck in 2009     

460
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,585
      and made it all about     
         his lifestyle.         

461
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,454
 Everything in here             
 is fresh every day.            

462
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,922
I keep it super simple,         

463
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:00,257
  because I'm lazy              
and I want to go surfing.       

464
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,860
         Okay. And where did you
             learn to cut fish? 

465
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,595
         It wasn't until        
      I went over to Ren's      

466
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,063
      that I really learned     
        how to cut fish.        

467
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,932
                         To who?
            Rennie --           
      Big Rennie over here.     

468
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,334
You see Reno coming, everybody's
        "Oh, Big Rennie!"       

469
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:13,070
                 [ Laughs ]     

470
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,739
Like Poke...? has the best poke 
on the island, hands down.      

471
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,675
           Hey, your fried poke.
                Here you go.    

472
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:19,610
     Very similar to sushi,     
          like sashimi.         

473
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,078
I think the best way to get     

474
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,946
  is when it's raw              
and fresh like this.            

475
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,348
           All right,           
       let's do the fish.       

476
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,950
   Quarter yellowfin fresh tuna.
              Caught yesterday. 

477
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,085
        This is the primo stuff.

478
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,020
             This is what we cut
              the poke out of.  

479
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,756
         Once you put poke cubes
                 into a bowl    

480
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,624
                 and you add    
               all the sauces,  

481
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,093
                  sometimes     
             you lose the fish. 

482
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:37,361
             In order to ensure 
       you still taste the fish,

483
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,429
                I cut it big.   

484
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,831
Jumbo. That's how to cut        
 some poke, Big Dan.            

485
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,700
              I use watercress  
        instead of green onions,

486
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,502
                   opposed      
            to most poke places.

487
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,903
           Red onion.           
  -Little crunch, little sweet. 

488
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:48,106
            And this is a little
               poke seasoning   

489
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,573
                   learned      
             from Chef Ren here.

490
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,308
      Hold on.                  
Let's say "Chef Reno."          

491
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,577
           -Chef Reno.          
           -Chef Reno.          

492
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,046
               Japanese chili   
               pepper powder,   

493
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:56,647
           toasted sesame seeds.

494
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:57,848
           Ginger oil.          
             -Okay.             

495
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,317
       It gives it a nice shine.

496
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,986
               I learned that   
               from Chef Reno.  

497
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,321
See? Getting better.            

498
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:04,789
                  And then      
         we have our poke sauce.

499
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,924
            A little bit of soy,
                 some sugar,    

500
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,726
           and some oyster sauce
                  in there.     

501
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,928
        This is as fresh        
          as it comes.          

502
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,931
        You take about 1/2 pound
                  of poke.      

503
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,871
       It's so tender that      
   before I even bit into it,   

504
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,205
       it started to melt.      

505
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,141
    -I taught you well, bro.    
  -You taught me well, Rennie.  

506
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,609
         You will never         
       find it that fresh.      

507
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,212
          That's legit.         
         -This is legit.        

508
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,815
You can still taste the fish    
even underneath the sauces.     

509
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,683
   They complement              
each other really well.         

510
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:33,751
          I think it's terrific.

511
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,687
Some of my fellow UNLV,         
 Las Vegas friends,             

512
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:39,090
  the Ross family,              
    on vacation,                

513
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:41,092
eating fantastic poke.          

514
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:42,160
 What do you think?             

515
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,694
          -It's great.          
       -It is tasty, huh?       

516
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:46,163
  -First time I've ever had it. 
          -First time!          

517
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,365
       It's very flavorful      
          in each bite.         

518
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,167
Honestly, I don't know          
if I can eat any more.          

519
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,569
 I might have to go             
 outside, lay down.             

520
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,971
             Well, this next one
 is definitely the heavy hitter.

521
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:56,307
          This is the poke bake.

522
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,975
    Baked poke is delicious.    

523
00:17:57,977 --> 00:17:59,110
                 Poke bake.     

524
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,912
    Comes out nice and warm,    
         but still raw.         

525
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,779
     MAN: They put a little     
       furikake seasoning.      

526
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:06,183
      It's like a seaweed,      
   sesame seed, smoky flavor.   

527
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,251
           Phenomenal.          

528
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,519
        Okay, let's do it       
       before I pass out.       

529
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,154
              We're gonna take  
           our fresh poke again.

530
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,922
      That I'm enjoying raw     
         just by itself.        

531
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,924
             We're gonna top it 
      with our everything sauce.

532
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,793
               It's mayonnaise  
            and shoyu and sugar.

533
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:17,728
        Gonna pop it in the oven
            for a couple minutes

534
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,663
            so the top just gets
              all caramelized.  

535
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,732
       Caramelized on top,      
     but just warm through.     

536
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,468
              And then we take  
               island furikake  

537
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,670
              that we all love  
    so much here in the islands.

538
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:28,405
   And then we take a little bit
 of our homemade salad dressing.

539
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,574
           If you got to operate
     heavy machinery after this,

540
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,875
       don't eat this one.      
            -Really?            

541
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,177
                    Yeah.       

542
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,548
               Oh.              
   Do people normally do this?  

543
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,617
       -Oh, not like this.      
      -That's legit, dude.      

544
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,419
        That right there        
           is creamy.           

545
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,955
     It actually takes a lot    
    of the flavor of the fish   

546
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,689
      and the shoyu sauce,      
             onions,            

547
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:49,360
    and kind of wakes it up,    
    so it's super flavorful.    

548
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:50,561
       SERVER: Poke bake.       

549
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,696
               Just that fresh  
fish flavor melts in your mouth.

550
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,098
    It's amazing.               

551
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,700
    There's some of the best    
      food at the roadside.     

552
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,702
               Maui's flooded   
           with high-end dining.

553
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,972
             There's hardly any 
        local affordable dining.

554
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,642
                So my passion   
          is feeding the locals.

555
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:05,843
         Here's your fried poke,
                  sweetie.      

556
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,110
         Have a good day. Aloha.

557
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,779
    If you think                
regular poke is good,           

558
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,648
you should have it fried        
 how Danny makes it.            

559
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,049
 It come out unreal.            

560
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,451
      My kid asks for this      
        every single day.       

561
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:17,321
  So, next we're gonna just take
   that same poke we just mixed,

562
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,923
            and we're gonna make
               our fried poke.  

563
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:21,325
         Now, this to me        
     is a little sacrilege.     

564
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,860
          Look at that.         

565
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:25,128
      I mean, that is about     
    as beautiful as it comes,   

566
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,197
         and we're gonna        
          deep fry it.          

567
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,999
              We're gonna take  
          some of our fresh poke

568
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,800
                 right into     
             our seasoned flour.

569
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,002
       What's in the dust?      

570
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,670
                  It's got      
     a little bit of everything.

571
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,738
                It's...flour.   

572
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,939
       -It's a fry flour.       
             -Yeah.             

573
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:36,740
       And then we're just gonna
           right into the fryer.

574
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,475
           It's gonna be fast --
                 30 seconds.    

575
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,277
           It gets evenly cooked
             all the way around.

576
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,813
          Just in this          
       nice cardboard box?      

577
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,481
             And we just put it 
             right on the plate.

578
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,218
             We top it off here 
         with our crack sauce --

579
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,819
                also kind of    
             developed by Reno. 

580
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:49,887
               It's a spinoff.  

581
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:52,456
That looks like straight        
my sauce, not a spinoff.        

582
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,158
                Pretty close.   

583
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,292
         It's still raw         
         in the center.         

584
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,493
         That's how fast        
         you cooked it.         

585
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:57,695
Just enough crispiness.         

586
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,363
       It's a thin, thin,       
     thin amount of batter,     

587
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,364
          good flavor.          

588
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,033
          Like I said, I learned
              from the master.  

589
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,501
         How did my show        
         just turn into         

590
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:05,036
         an infomercial         
        buddy love fest?        

591
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,371
                 [ Laughs ]     

592
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,706
      The spices are great.     

593
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,374
      The sauce                 
is absolutely amazing.          

594
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,642
I'm liking the marinade.        

595
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,844
   Little bit different flavor  
     than what I'm used to.     

596
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:15,646
       There's a sweetness      
     to it, but really nice.    

597
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:18,049
     Ever time I'm craving poke,
                I come here.    

598
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,917
     You embody being a chef    

599
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,719
  and being a restaurant owner, 
        you love people,        

600
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,854
        you love to treat       
 your ingredients with respect, 

601
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:28,459
    you treat it like it's a    
500-seat fine-dining restaurant.

602
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,727
        You've got a lot        
         to be proud of.        

603
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,995
   Did a good job.              
   I'm impressed.               

604
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:33,997
      Nice job, my brother.     

605
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,533
    I know what you're doing    
   right now. You're thinking,  

606
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,001
          "How do I get         
       all these recipes?"      

607
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:38,935
       Here's what you do.      

608
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,805

        you come to Maui,       

611
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,211
         you don't have         
     to call my brother Reno    

612
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,279

                Aloha, guys.    

615
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:53,984
  Now, to make sure that I keep 
   everything Hawaiian legit,
