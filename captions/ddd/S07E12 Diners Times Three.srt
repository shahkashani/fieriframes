            THIS IS SUGAR.      
WHAT IS IT?

00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,371
      AND YOU PUT               
A LITTLE BIT OF SUGAR.

       OF THE MULLIGATAWNY SOUP.

422
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,913

425
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,987
FIRST, WE START OFF             
 WITH SOME BUTTER.              
          SO WE HAVE ANY HEAT   
        ON THAT THERE, SUNSHINE?

426
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:32,924
 OH, NO. I GUESS YOU NEED HEAT. 
  OUR ONIONS, CELERY, CARROTS.  

427
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,926
WE'RE GONNA LET THAT            
     SIMMER DOWN                

428
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:37,795
TILL EVERYTHING GETS            
A LITTLE TRANSPARENT.           
              SO IT'S ALL       
       A LITTLE TRANSLUCENT NOW.

          WHAT ARE THESE?

00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,684
THAT--GUESS WHAT.               
                THOUGHT IT WAS  
               CHAYOTE AT FIRST,

438
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,019
        BUT IT'S--IT'S AN APPLE.
GRANNY SMITH APPLES.            

439
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,955

           I'VE NEVER HAD THAT. 

440
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,224
   WE'RE GONNA LET              
THAT ALL SIMMER DOWN            

441
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,893
FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES.           
  OKAY. SO NOW IT'S HAD A CHANCE
       TO KINDA SIMMER A BIT.   

442
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,362
 AND WE ADD THE HEAVY CREAM JUST
 TO TAKE THE EDGE OFF THE CURRY.

443
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,831

IT'S READY TO SERVE.

DOES IT EXACTLY RIGHT.          

446
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:19,637
               WHAT DO YOU THINK
                ABOUT THE APPLE?
I LIKE APPLE PIE.

              I'LL MAKE YOU ONE.

 OF THE APPLE FLAVOR,           

449
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:27,177
BUT IT ACTUALLY KINDA REMINDS ME
  A LITTLE BIT LIKE A SQUASH.   
                           YEAH.

 A LITTLE BIT OF CURRY IN THERE.

457

     TO A BOIL, TURN IT DOWN    

482
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,084
AND LET IT SIMMER               
 FOR 12 MINUTES.                

483
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,752
                 NOT 11? NOT 13?
NOPE. NO.                       

484
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:44,221
                             12.
      12 IS THE NUMBER.         
ONCE IT BRINGS THIS TO A BOIL,  

485
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,291
  THE BAKING SODA,              
IT'S JUST A BIG FOAM.           
               SO DO YOU EVER   
             TAKE THE FOAM HOME?

486
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,026
                      E.T. DID. 

487
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,961
    NOW THAT WE                 
SIMMERED THE BEANS,             

488
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,763
              WE'RE GONNA STRAIN
                THE JUICE OUT.  
CHUG! CHUG!                     

489
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,699
        FIRST THING IS MOLASSES.
WHOA.                           

490
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,435
   THE NEXT ONE I USUALLY PUT IN
      IS MUSTARD, BROWN SUGAR.  
THAT'S IT?                      

491
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,703
     THAT'S IT. THIS IS THE REAL
     BOSTON BAKED BEAN RECIPES. 

492
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,638
                AND A LITTLE BIT
                   OF KETCHUP.  

493
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:04,108
        AND THIS IS WHAT        
 WE'RE GONNA USE FOR OUR BEANS. 

494
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,977
             NOW WE JUST GOTTA  
           SET UP THE BEAN PART.

495
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,845
WINNIE THE POOH CALLED.         
HE WANTS HIS POT BACK.          

496
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:10,514
A NICE MOO.                     
     WE'RE GONNA LINE THE BOTTOM
       OF THE POT WITH ONIONS.  

497
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:13,184
WHO TAUGHT YOU                  
HOW TO DO THIS?                 
                  BETTY CROCKER,
                 I THINK IT WAS.

498
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,785
REALLY?                         
              YEAH, I'M SERIOUS.

499
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,454
IT WAS REALLY A BETTY CROCKER?  
 YOU WENT TO SCHOOL WITH HER?   
                           YEAH.

500
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,857
      THEN WE TAKE THE SALT PORK
          THAT WE HAD CUT UP,   

501
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:22,526
    JUST LAYER IT RIGHT IN THERE
      LIKE THAT, AND THAT'S IT. 
NO. SERIOUSLY?                  

502
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,662
     THAT'S IT. NOW WE'RE GONNA 
       ADD SOME OF THE BEANS.   

503
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:27,698
WE'RE NOT GONNA CONTINUE        
 TO LAYER THIS, ARE WE?         
               HECK, YEAH.      
           GET ABOUT HALFWAY UP.

504
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,934
OKAY, YOU'RE DOING              
  ANOTHER LAYER?                
                  AND THEN      
            SOME MORE SALT PORK.

505
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,869
OH, DO IT RIGHT THERE.          
         OH, ALL RIGHT, LET'S...

506
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:34,405
         ANOTHER LAYER OF BEANS.
  NOW HOW OFTEN                 
DO YOU MAKE THIS?               

507
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:37,074
     I MAKE 8 QUARTS IN A BATCH 
        2 OR 3 TIMES A WEEK.    

508
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:40,077
       HOW LONG                 
ARE WE GONNA BAKE THIS?         
            WE'RE GONNA BAKE IT 
          FOR FIVE TO SIX HOURS.

509
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,813
300 DEGREES, 5 TO 6 HOURS.      
              YEP. 5 TO 6 HOURS.

510
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:46,417
         OKAY.                  
ARE THESE THINGS READY?         
             YEAH, GUARANTEE    
         THAT'LL BE WICKED GOOD.

511
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:49,152
ISN'T THAT A DEVO SONG?         
 OH, THAT'S "WHIP IT."          
                  WH--"WHIP IT."

512
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,555
MMM, THAT SMELLS AWESOME.       

513
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,490
  MMM. THE BEANS                
MELT IN YOUR MOUTH,             

514
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,760
THE SAUCE IS SUPER CREAMY,      
      NOT OVERSWEET.            

515
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:58,028
    THIS HERE                   
IS THE REAL DEAL.               
                          IT IS.

516
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:01,098
    I COULD USE                 
A LITTLE MORE SALT.             
  I DO THAT SPECIFICALLY, 'CAUSE
   SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE SALT. 

517
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:04,568
      OH, YEAH.                 
WHERE'D THE ONIONS GO?          
                 YOU'LL GET     
           LITTLE PIECES OF 'EM,

518
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:06,770
          BUT FOR THE MOST PART,
           THEY JUST BOIL AWAY. 
MMM.                            

519
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:09,040
CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS WHAT CAME 
 OUT OF WHAT WE PUT TOGETHER.   

520
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,708
              THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
NICE JOB.                       

521
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:12,176
                         THANKS.
ALL ABOARD.                     

522
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,911
        (woman) QUITE DELICIOUS.
THEY'RE NOT TOO SWEET.          

523
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:16,180
        NOW, TOMMY,             
HOW'D THEY DO ON THE BEANS?     
       OH, THEY'RE UNBELIEVABLE!

524
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:19,250
REALLY GOOD BEANS?              
    YEAH, SOME OF THE BEST BEANS
     AROUND, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. 

525
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:20,751
      GOOD FOOD.                
EVERYONE'S REALLY NICE.         

526
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,654
            STRAWBERRY PANCAKES.
           I LOVE IT.           
    COME HERE ALL THE TIME.     

527
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,389
      THE FOOD IS AWESOME.      
        GREAT SELECTION.        

528
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,923
    JUST A HOME-COOKED MEAL.    

529
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,860
 THERE ISN'T A DAY THAT GOES BY 
 THAT WE DON'T SIT HERE AT WORK 

530
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,795
                 AND LAUGH      
           AND HAVE A GOOD TIME,

531
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,864
          AND THE MAIN OBJECTIVE
              IS TO MAKE SURE   

532
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,666
     THAT EVERYBODY LEAVES HERE 
         HAPPY AND SMILING.     

533
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:38,336
           LET'S GO!            
        (train whistles)        

534
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:40,404
           SO WAS THAT          
   A KILLER ROAD TRIP OR WHAT?  

535
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,939
          DON'T WORRY.          

536
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:44,141
    WE GOT PLENTY MORE JOINTS   
    ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.    

537
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:47,744
    I'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME ON   
 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

538
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,014
HEY, WHOA, YAHTZEE.             
 HEY, I FOUND IT.               

539
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,016
               YOU FOUND IT.    
          THERE'S THE 17th BALL.

540
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:55,552
IT WAS IN THERE. I DIDN'T KNOW  
IF I'D GET IT, BUT I FOUND IT.  

541
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,755
WHOO-HOO!                       
                      (chuckles)
