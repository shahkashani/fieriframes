 Hey, everybody, I'm Guy Fieri, 
      and we're rolling out

00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,074
              Hold on. Hold on.

Thank you, sir.

       ...on sliced bread.      

8
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,880
 Well, that sandwich            
  is off the hook.

And it started here?            

21
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,503
          It started right here.

       here's your burger.

53
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:51,109
    No, we decided we wanted    
        to learn butchery       

54
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,244

          All the food

      FIERI: And a lifetime     
        of determination.       

61
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,060
  I've been cooking             
for about 15, 20 years.         

62
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:09,327
    My hands are                
a little bit different.         

63

              FIERI: It was not

   No.

00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,466
             and you definitely 
          have not made it that.

67
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,868
              You're working in 
                probably one    

68

          of the most physically

69

   John creates these recipes   
        that are amazing.

you, but really highly elevated.

       Philly cheesesteak.      

72
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,482
         The cheesesteak        
    is a phenomenal sandwich.   

73
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,417
 The most amazingly tender beef.

74
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,353
      And there's something     
        about the cheese.       

75
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:35,454
       It's just perfect.       

76
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,823
              This is the hip.  
              Head's up there.  

77
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,759
             Leg came down here.
                      Okay.     
Mm-hmm.                         

78
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,160
      Make sure I give everybody
              the lowdown here. 

79
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,362
        Okay.                   

80
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:46,364
I'm removing the top sirloin    
for our Philly cheesesteak.     

81
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,234
   Talking about great butchery,
             look at the yield. 

82
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:50,569
                   I mean,      
             it's just seamless.

83
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:53,171
Take that. That'll go           
to the butcher shop.            

84
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,307
   This grind will              
become burgers and whatnot.     

85
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,110
           That's sustainability
                right there.    

86
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:00,845
These are gonna go into         
a Cryovac bag in the freezer    

87
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,047
so it's nice and easy           
      to slice.                 

88
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,915
            Slice it super-thin.

89
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,250
               That's the key   
         to a great cheesesteak.

90
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,918
      Yes, sir.                 

91
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,187
All right, so, we're            
getting ready to make           
our beer cheese fondue.         

92
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,056
We're just gonna start          
with a little bit of olive oil, 

93
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:14,259
throw our onions in there,      
raw and pickled jalapeños.      

94
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,462
Deglaze this with a little beer.
Let that reduce a little bit.   

95
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,865
So, we're gonna make            
a little makeshift bain-marie.  

96
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,199
              Processed cheese  

97
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,868
            and helping it along
       with a little whole milk.

98
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,203
A lot of the flavors            
   that we do here              

99
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,006
are kind of like riffs          
  on our childhood.             

100
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,207
             You heard it here. 

101
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,676
We're just gonna let that       
go for about 10 minutes,        

102
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,678
and then we're just gonna       
  drop it back into             

103
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,212
the onion-and-jalapeño          
      mixture.                  

104
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,415
   So, our version              
of a Philly cheesesteak.        

105
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:37,683
               Let's do this.   

106
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,285
We hit it with a hamster wheel  
of butter -- nice, hot grill.   

107
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:44,423
 Throw our sirloin,             
chop it up nice and fine.       

108
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:45,690
                  A little      
         Philly technique there.

109
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,425
   A little salt.               

110
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,361
     We're gonna                
hit it with our deglazer.       

111
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:50,361
                Which is...?    

112
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,231
   It's a mixture               
of soy, garlic powder,          

113
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,433
smoked paprika, and MSG.        

114
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,035
                 Got to have    
          a little bit in there.

115
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,370
                  Next up?      

116
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,972
Little bit of onion confit,     
which we do in butter and oil,  

117
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,507
and then marinated mushrooms.   

118
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,309
                You marinate    
         the mushrooms in-house.

119
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,845
  Also some grilled             
 trumpet mushrooms.             

120
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,714
Then we take a little bit       
 of our mayonnaise.             

121
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,316
                 Holy moly.     

122
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,952
     All right.                 
 Your cheese fondue.            

123
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,121
Turnips with a little bit       
of the mushroom oil.            

124
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:17,255
                  Turnips?      

125
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,456
   Just to give it              
  a little texture.             

126
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,724
A little spring mix.            

127
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,460
    If you're gonna eat the cow,
          eat what the cow eats.

128
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:23,061
And there you have it.          

129
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,831
           It's...a masterpiece.

130
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,270
            First thing's first.

131
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,406
              That cheese sauce 
               is redonkulous.  

132
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:39,144
                The mushroom    
               is outrageous.   

133
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,945
                Your process    
               was fantastic.   

134
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,014
             The meat's perfect.

135
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:44,483
            The roll -- spot-on.

136
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,418
     I got to say that if you're
        a Philly cheesesteak fan

137
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,286
             and you're anywhere
              close to Oakland, 

138
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,622
                 you got to     
             get yourself here. 

139
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,756
                    Mmm.        

140
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,558
  Table 7, please.              
Two cheesesteaks. Let's go!     

141
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,227
    It's a massive sandwich.    

142
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:58,230
      The meat is so tasty,     
  and the cheese is all creamy. 

143
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:00,365
I love the turnips on top of it,
  give a little bit of crunch.  

144
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:01,767
        BLEVINS: Bánh mí        
         in the window.         

145
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:03,301
 I come here, I'll get a snack, 

146
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,903
    and then take things home   
          for the week.         

147
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,706
     I can ask the butchers,    
   "what is this cut of meat?"  

148
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,441
      We found that people      
don't know very much about meat.

149
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,177
   They get really intimidated  
        by butcher shops,       

150
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,978
           and we want          
    the opposite to be true.    

151
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,581
I like that you know which farms
  the animals are coming from.  

152
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,316
            You know            
  that they're humanely raised. 

153
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,184
           And I think          
 you could taste the difference.

154
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,586
            WAITRESS:           
         Fried chicken.         

155
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:22,988
  Our fried chicken             
   takes it home.               

156
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,789
             The fried chicken's
    better than the cheesesteak?

157
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,591
   I -- you know,               
 it's night and day,            

158
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,527
   but it's very,               
     very good.                 

159
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,929
   It totally picks you up. It  
 says, "I'm a chicken sandwich!"

160
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,864
        FIERI: And that's       
         coming up next.        
               See you in a bit.

161
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,773
 FIERI: Right now, "Triple D" is
  hanging in<i> my</i> part of Cali... 

162
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:42,841
      BLEVINS:                  
 Pork belly's down.             

163
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,576
      ...at Clove and Hoof      
         in Oakland....         

164
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,311
C&H burger, table 7.            

165
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:47,646
            ...where            
     a husband-and-wife team    

166
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,915
           are running          
  a butchery/restaurant combo.  

167
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:52,117
How would you describe          
what you're coming into here?   

168
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:55,653
              Locally sourced,  
  farm-to-table, fabulous meats.

169
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,789
             They don't give you
your run-of-the-mill sandwiches.

170
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,991
   Just takes it                
into funkalicious?              
                     You betcha.

171
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,193
  Fried chicken in the window.  
            Let's go.           

172
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,662
               Ah!              
   The fried chicken sandwich.  

173
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:04,863
      You get a little bit      
          of sweetness,         

174
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,465
      little bit of crunch,     
      little bit of savory.     

175
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:07,598
           Incredible.          

176
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
All right, fried chicken.       
 Take a little salt.            

177
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,470
                Chicken thighs. 
  Yeah.                         

178
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:13,071
      Pack them                 
 into a Cryovac bag             

179
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,206
     with thyme                 
and a little bit of garlic.     

180
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,411
And then we're gonna slow-cook  
these at 155 degrees.           

181
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:22,147
           We're gonna sous-vide
   the chicken before we fry it?

182
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:23,381
      Correct.                  

183
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,017
We're looking for optimal,      
perfectly cooked meat.          

184
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,419
       This is a lights-out game
                 right now.     

185
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:28,486
           What are we into now?

186
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,222
We're gonna be making           
  a savory caramel.             

187
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,355
                    Okay.       

188
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,892
So, we're gonna start           
with about a quart of sugar,    

189
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,429
  a pint of water,              
  and some lemons.              

190
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,230
A little bit of black pepper,   
     star anise,                

191
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,431
and cinnamon sticks.            
                        Dig it. 

192
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,834
Then we're gonna add            
   our fish sauce.              

193
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:45,437
    I always love in my caramels
            a little fish sauce.

194
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,572
     So, it adds                
 a nice savoriness.             

195
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,441
  When that reaches             
the proper consistency,         

196
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,576
   we're gonna add              
our bourbon habanero vinegar    

197
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,111
     as well as                 
 our Old Bay butter,            

198
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:55,246
which is softened butter,       
     Old Bay --                 

199
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,981
    [ Record scratches ]        
              Hold on. Hold on. 

200
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,716
             Where does Old Bay 
               come into this?  

201
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,385
The nostalgic flavors.          

202
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:01,919
  That's something              
that I grew up with,            

203
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,188
 and it wants to go             
     on chicken.                

204
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,457
             It tells you this? 
   Yes.                         

205
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,125
So, here's our chicken.         
                       Okay.    

206
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:10,194
A little pre-dredge,            
which is just flour and salt.   

207
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,329
     Little bit                 
  of egg and water.             

208
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,501
Straight into a post-dredge     
 which is AP flour,             

209
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:19,604
  buzzed-up panko,              
garlic powder, Cayenne,         

210
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,473
    black pepper,               
 and potato starch.             

211
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:24,208
 And then we'll go to the fryer,
       flash it, and warm it up,

212
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,410
     'cause it's already cooked.

213
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,544
      Exactly.                  

214
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,213
  We're gonna toss              
in our fish sauce caramel.      

215
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,481
         The fish sauce caramel.

216
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:31,149
Then we're gonna dress it       
 with a little slaw             

217
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:34,753
made with apples, celery,       
  ginger, cilantro,             

218
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,688
hit it with a little bit        
   of pomegranate               

219
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,423
and a little celery leaf.       

220
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:40,859
        Looks pretty fancy-dancy
   for a fried chicken sandwich.

221
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,964
           To call that sandwich
        a fried chicken sandwich

222
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,499
            is to call a Ferrari
                   a car.       

223
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,169
               There's so much  
                  going on.     

224
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:54,505
              One, the chicken  
     is beyond flavorful tender.

225
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,241
               I mean, it's --  
              it's outrageous.  

226
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,143
               Two, the crunch  
                is dynamite.    

227
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,647
                A little slaw   
           at the end -- genius.

228
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,716
           Love the pomegranate,
  little crunch when you get it.

229
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,918
            But I have to say --

230
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,722
              the funk caramel  
                is the bomb.    

231
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:14,258
            Star anise paired up
            with the fish sauce,

232
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,527
      get a bite of the cinnamon
                 back there.    

233
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,997
      It is the funkiest caramel
               I've ever had.   

234
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,732
             That's a sandwich, 
                    man.        

235
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,467
           And there's          
       your fried chicken.      

236
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,402
    Breaded, nice and thick,    
           perfectly.           

237
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:28,340
Pomegranate seeds are the kicker
in the fish sauce caramel.      

238
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,074
          The fish sauce caramel
               is ridiculous.   
 Yeah.                          

239
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,209
                   I mean,      
       what are they gonna have,

240
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,345
         fish sauce caramel corn
                    next?       

241
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,813
              Are we gonna have 
             a savory ice cream 

242
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,281
         with fish sauce caramel

243
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,350
             and some beef jerky
               whipped cream?   

244
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,551
        Is that's what's coming?

245
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:42,019
              MAN:              
  He always puts a neat twist.  

246
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,155
      Every time I come in,     
 I have to taste something new. 

247
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,823
Duck confit in the window.      

248
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,692
 To see that you two            
 are taking this on,            

249
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,160
not only the mastery            
   of butchering,               

250
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,696
getting the farm to table,      
putting it onto the plate,      

251
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,864
  it's remarkable.              

252
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:57,168
        FIERI: Coming up,       
    in Modesto, California...   

253
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,369
 Oh, I like the way             
   this is going.               

254
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,971
           ...a lesson          
       in Food Truck 101.       

255
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,773
Wouldn't you want this guy      
as your substitute teacher?     

256
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:04,376
         ...chalking up         
        some A-plus pork.       

257
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,277
 Sandwich is legit.             

258
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,018
I'm here in Modesto, California,

259
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,621
  in kind of an industrial area 
    right over on 9th Street    

260
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:17,889
     by the railroad tracks     

261
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,291
    and just a couple blocks    
  away from the junior college. 

262
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,727
      I'm here to check out     
      a food truck, and not     
      just<i> any</i> food truck.      

263
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,429
 The chef here -- well, he used 
  to be a culinary instructor,  

264
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,566
   and his employees -- well,   
   they were former students.   

265
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,167
  So the food's got to be good. 

266
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,169
   This is the Food Fix truck.  

267
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,038
             Carnita order's up.

268
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,307
  I love the food at this place 
     because it's different.    

269
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,576
          Root beer pulled pork.

270
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,177
  You've got a lot of different 
      ingredients in them,      

271
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,911
       things you wouldn't      
       find anywhere else.      

272
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,047
     They're very creative.     

273
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,381
             FIERI:             
  And not just in the cooking.  

274
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,250
  Locally grown chef Hank Olson 

275
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,919
  had to do some quick thinking 
   when he added a food truck   

276
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,656
   to his college teaching gig  
          back in 2014.         

277
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,325
                   We did       
       a Kickstarter campaign...

278
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:55,660
Seriously?                      
          ...and raised $20,000.

279
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:56,528
   That's awesome.              

280
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,728
 How do you describe            
      the food?                 

281
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,798
         It's kind of dude food,
                  I guess.      

282
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,066
               A lot of bacon,  
               a lot of pork.   

283
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,734
             Porkstrami pretzel.

284
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:05,670
  I can eat this whole sandwich 
             daily.             

285
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,906
It's just got a burst of flavor.

286
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,273
 What are we gonna make?        
                  Pork shoulder.

287
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,676
     But I cure it like pastrami
  on our homemade pretzel rolls.

288
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,277
          We're making the brine
             for the porkstrami.

289
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,347
              So, this is salt, 
                brown sugar,    

290
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,816
    a little bit of curing salt,
             black peppercorns, 

291
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,686
      some nice green coriander,
            whole garlic cloves,

292
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:24,355
          cloves, arbol chilies,

293
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,558
                mustard seed,   
               and bay leaves.  

294
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,359
 So, we'll let that             
all steep for how long?         

295
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,361
                    10 minutes. 
Bring all that flavor out,      

296
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,430
and to cool it down,            
you have a little ice water.    

297
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:33,564
          And mix that together.

298
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,566
              Get the pork butt 
            and butcher that up.

299
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,302
           [ Shing! ]           

300
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,503
              My pirate sword.  

301
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:39,904
You should wear that            
   with a sheath.               

302
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,840
               Basically, just  
        gonna butterfly it open,

303
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,041
               put little cuts  
                  in here,      

304
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,243
            try to get the brine
             way deep in there. 

305
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,377
   So, we brine it              
    for how long?               

306
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,246
                 Three days.    
   Got it.                      

307
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,780
   What...is this?              

308
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,583
             This is for putting
       the netting on the roast.

309
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,385
Like old butcher style?         
                          Yeah. 

310
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,987
               Take these guys  
              out of the brine. 

311
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,057
 This is a road cone            
   in Flavortown.               

312
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,792
 No, It's beautiful.            
    Look at this.               

313
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,993
     Nice move!                 

314
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,096
              So, we crust this 
      with green coriander seed,

315
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,064
           tons of black pepper.

316
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,265
 Oh, I like the way             
   this is going.               

317
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,800
      We're gonna slow-roast it.
 At what temp?                  

318
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:12,470
For the first half-hour, at 375,
       get a little crust going,

319
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,939
         and then, about another
           hour and a half, 325.

320
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:18,176
    Pull it out,                
let it cool, slice it up.       

321
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,146
              We're gonna make  
             the pretzel rolls. 

322
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:22,347
             There's the water, 

323
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,015
        and then we're gonna add
             brown sugar, yeast,

324
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,885
                a little bit    
              of melted butter. 

325
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,419
                 I give this    
               a little whisk.  

326
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,488
   Let that bloom.              
     And then...                

327
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,358
              All-purpose flour 
       and a little bit of salt.

328
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,493
          We're gonna let it mix
               for 6 minutes.   

329
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,429
             We'll pull it out, 
                let it proof.   

330
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:41,499
             So, now we're gonna
 weigh these out to 5.45 ounces,

331
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,834
roll them into a ball.          

332
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:43,968
We'll let them proof            
   one more time.               

333
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,169
           And then what are you
             brushing them with?

334
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,171
 We're brushing them            
with baking soda and water,     

335
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,906
  and an egg wash.              

336
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,508
                 And that's     
       what gives it nice crust?

337
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,376
The pretzel flavor.             
                       Right.   

338
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,844
   Cut each roll.               

339
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:58,316
Then they go in the oven        
for 350 for roughly 15 minutes. 

340
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,384
             Smells really good.

341
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:02,053
 So, get those guys             
      toasting.                 

342
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,457
 And then we have our porkstrami
               portioned out.   

343
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:06,991
             Just a little mayo.

344
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,860
    <i> Little</i> mayo?               

345
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,194
                 And this is    
                beer mustard.   

346
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,595
Oh, put cheese on it,           
        too.                    

347
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,265
                  No party      
              without Havarti.  

348
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,067
              And just steam it 
                 real quick.    

349
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,135
              Gets that cheese  
                  to melt.      

350
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,404
 That is ridiculous.            

351
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,940
                Throw the bun   
               right on there.  

352
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:24,409
        Dude.                   

353
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,210
        Mmm.                    

354
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,744
    Just the pork               
    on its own --               

355
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,947
pastrami-esque flavor,          
  without question.             

356
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,015
   Now we get into              
  some pretzel bun.             

357
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,422
Anytime I see pretzel           
on something, I get after it.   

358
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,825
This is light on the inside,    
chewy on the outside.           

359
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,828
  So, the Havarti's             
  the right choice.             

360
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,396
        Then                    
when you combine it...          

361
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,766
...with the beer mustard,       
 sandwich is legit.             

362
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,501
                 Thanks, man.   
Spot-on, man. Spot-on.          

363
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,036
             OLSON:             
       Porkstrami pretzel!      

364
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,972
 MAN: The beer mustard is, like,
 really what gives it that kick.

365
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,439
     You just want to, like,    
      just keep diving in.      

366
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,175
      The Havarti cheese --     
          it's perfect.         

367
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:59,043
       Everything's fresh.      
         It's all local.        

368
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,778
       FIERI: And straight      
     out of Hank's textbook.    

369
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,446
      You were                  
a culinary instructor.          

370
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,115
                  I'm still     
       a substitute teacher now.

371
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,650
           From there,          
     he's using his students    

372
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,719
           to help him          
      get this truck going.     

373
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:08,986
     They get out of school,    
       they can come here,      

374
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,255
        learn how to work       
          on the line.          

375
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,656
              Pepper jack club. 

376
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,390
Wouldn't you want this guy      
as your substitute teacher?     

377
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,326
 He's one of the hardest-working
         people I know.         

378
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,395
         They're always         
    matching maybe something    

379
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,063
  that you wouldn't think goes  
      with something else,      

380
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,665
        but it turns out        
       being really good.       

381
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,333
             FIERI:             
  Like soda pop and pork butt.  

382
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,601
          Root beer pulled pork.

383
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:26,204
I wouldn't know it was root beer
    if it wasn't in the name.   

384
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:27,338
Let's get into this.            

385
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,740
                We're making    
        a root beer pulled pork.

386
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:29,941
                 Start with     
             big chunks of pork.

387
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,209
       So just                  
 regular pork butt.             

388
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,211
                   Season       
           with salt and pepper.

389
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,613
              Then we're gonna  
                 sear it...     

390
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,881
                golden brown    
                on each side.   

391
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,215
 We'll bring it out,            
throw it in a hotel pan         

392
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,618
and cover it with the root beer,
      I assume.                 

393
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,886
                    Yep.        

394
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:44,689
             Put it in the oven 
      at 325 for the first hour,

395
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,557
                  then 275      
         for the next two hours.

396
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,892
      Next up?                  

397
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,227
          Next, we're gonna make
   the root beer barbecue sauce.

398
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:52,563
     We have root beer, and then
    we're gonna add our ketchup.

399
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:53,697
        Okay,                   
a little brown sugar.           

400
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,900
               Ground ginger,   
            apple cider vinegar,

401
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,368
      and salt and black pepper.

402
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,369
  And a lot of it.              

403
00:13:58,371 --> 00:13:59,703
                   So once      
          we mix all these in --

404
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,105
   And you'll get               
the barbecue consistency.       

405
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,107
               Once it cools,   
       it thins up a little bit.

406
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,976
                 So, this is    
      the root beer pulled pork,

407
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,378
              falling apart --  
                pork tender.    

408
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,247
Go back on the flattop,         
put a little crust on it.       

409
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:11,249
           Yeah, and just get it
              a little shreddy. 

410
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,851
            Hit it with a little
       root beer barbecue sauce.

411
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,786
              I put mayonnaise  
               on everything.   

412
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,056
    Look at that.               

413
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,924
              A little bit more 
               barbecue sauce.  

414
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,594
                 And this is    
        our sweet-and-sour slaw.

415
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,196
   It's an oil-and-vinegar-based
                   recipe       

416
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,864
                 instead of     
         your normal mayonnaise.

417
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,966
 Mayo. Right. Right.            

418
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,603
The slaw is righteous.          

419
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:32,670
                    Yeah.       

420
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,874
  You have to have              
   the contrast --              

421
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,876
 the sweet root beer            
 and the tangy slaw.            

422
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,211
  If you don't have             
     those two,                 

423
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,146
    you could get               
a little too much root beer.    

424
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,282
But not a bad thing.            

425
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:46,284
      This roll                 
is working perfectly.           

426
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:49,888
It's so thin and so light,      
but creates such a great crust. 

427
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,092
That combo, put together,       
     goes great.                

428
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,494
             OLSON:             
     Root beer pulled pork!     

429
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,095
 It just has so much tenderness 
           in the meat          

430
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,831
       that you just want       
      to go back for more.      

431
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,699
   It's sweet, a little tangy.  

432
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,167
        Well,                   
you call it "dude food,"        

433
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:06,170
but it's just good, simple,     
straightforward, creative food. 

434
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,773
You are the example             
of what people want             
a food truck to be --           

435
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,642
real deal, a lot of integrity,  
a lot of personality.           

436
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,111
And you got these young students
working hard with you.          

437
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,178
I'm proud of you, buddy.        
                  Thanks, man.  

438
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,914
Really proud of you.            
   Excellent job.               

439
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,717
         FIERI: Up next         
    in Key Largo, Florida...    

440
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:20,785
     Hey, look.                 

441
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,186
            ...a ride           
     on the water hangout...    

442
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,454
Now you're in the know.         

443
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,523
          ...serving up         
      some signature catch.     

444
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:28,259
           Wow. I understand why
   this dish is such a hit here.

445
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:39,370
 I'm here in Key Largo, Florida,
      at Lake Largo Harbor      

446
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:40,772
    to check out a restaurant   

447
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,840
        that was started        
     by two pilots in 1950.     

448
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,842
 And that's not the real story. 
       The key here is --       

449
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,243
        Get it? The key?        

450
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,646
      ...is that this place     
   stakes claim to developing   

451
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:51,382
  the most famous fish sandwich 
  that you'll find in the Keys. 

452
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,217
      This is Pilot House.      

453
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,054
Lobster mac and cheese.         

454
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,523
     If you don't come here,    
     you've missed the Keys.    

455
00:15:58,525 --> 00:15:59,724
        The tuna nachos.        

456
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:02,660
Great food and great atmosphere.

457
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,862
     MAN: Dinner, the water,    
     the boats, the sunset.     

458
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,731
        I mean, come on.        
       Can you beat this?       

459
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,732
             FIERI:             
And general manager Mark Charles

460
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,268
        is proud to keep        
 that long-standing vibe going. 

461
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,471
        The Pilot House has been
        the home port for locals

462
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,472
                 since 1950.    

463
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,874
             We pride ourselves 
        on fresh, local seafood.

464
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:19,210
 We're right here at the source,
   and they do a wonderful job  

465
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,679
  of getting from sea to table  
          very quickly.         

466
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:25,483
  FIERI: Thanks to the talents  
 of executive chef Zach Greene. 

467
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,285
  It's so varied in the dishes  
       that they prepare.       

468
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,686
        And it's so good.       

469
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:30,888
     The hogfish macadamia.     

470
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,690
 Hogfish is one of the best fish
        that you can get.       

471
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,693
          It's prepared         
       with a mango salsa.      

472
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:36,961
         It's wonderful,        
     something that the chef    

473
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,363
     does a great job with.     

474
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:41,499
                 The hogfish    
          is, like, the local...
Reef-dwelling fish.             

475
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,633
                     So,        
         what are we gonna make?

476
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:43,901
       This is                  
the tropical fruit salsa        

477
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:45,503
  that'll go on top             
   of the hogfish.              

478
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,104
We're gonna start off           
  with some mango.              

479
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,973
              Why, when you say 
         "tropical fruit salsa,"

480
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:49,907
                do you smile?   

481
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,309
'Cause it's tropical, man.      

482
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,911
Diced red bell peppers,         
    diced papaya,               

483
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:56,314
fresh-chopped cilantro,         
fresh chopped jalapeño,         

484
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,983
 sweet chili sauce,             
and a dash of salt and pepper.  

485
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,051
 Mix all that up...             

486
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,853
           Tropical fruit salsa.
    [ Laughs ]                  

487
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,654
                 All right.     

488
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,322
Here's our fresh hogfish.       

489
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,725
We're gonna butterfly           
this whole fish open here.      

490
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,993
                It looks like   
    you're playing fish origami,

491
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,129
         but why is it all still
          connected to the fish?

492
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,800
For our plate presentation,     
we'll have a skin-on,           

493
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,468
butterflied fillet of fish      
    on the plate                

494
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,670
with a cool type of garnish.    
                         Whoa!  

495
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:20,938
     We're gonna                
salt and pepper that.           

496
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,140
               That's how hot   
                you want it?    

497
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,342
  I want that skin              
to crisp up real nice.          

498
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:25,676
                  I gotcha.     

499
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,946
So, we're gonna go into the     
convection oven just like that. 

500
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:31,816
That'll go about 6 minutes,     
about 425 right now.            

501
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:33,551
         425. Way to convection,
                  as well.      

502
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,620
At home, you would want to      
put that oven on "clean"        

503
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:36,821
   because that's               
 about the only way             

504
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:39,290
 you're gonna get it            
      that hot.                 

505
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,624
              Who's taking over 
                  the show?     

506
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:41,892
     [ Laughs ]                 

507
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:46,163
Toasted crushed macadamia nuts  
for the macadamia crust.        

508
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,498
      A little                  
Japanese bread crumb,           

509
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,234
 some whole butter,             
sprinkle of salt and pepper.    

510
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,302
Crush all that stuff            
      together.                 

511
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,504
            And we'll just throw
              a pat of that --  

512
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,907
    Right on top                
of that fish in the oven.       
                          Ah!   

513
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,375
 Now we're gonna get            
our beautiful piece of hogfish, 

514
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,776
      top that                  
  with a little bit             

515
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,513
 of our fresh citrus            
 butter sauce here,             

516
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,515
our tropical fruit salsa        
right on top of that            

517
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,651
 and fresh cilantro,            

518
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:08,319
  and we are ready              
 for rock 'n' roll.             

519
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,720
                 All right.     

520
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,055
                    Wow.        

521
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,057
      I understand why this dish
             is such a hit here.

522
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,993
                Super-fresh,    
               prepared great.  

523
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:16,994
       Presentation is gorgeous.

524
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:19,931
         I love the butterflying
             technique you did. 

525
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,734
    Nice, bright citrus salsa --
 complements it incredibly well.

526
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,736
                 The crunch

                    Mmm!        

528
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,139
               Knockout, man.   
  Thank you, sir.               

529
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,006
                  Knockout.

        They do it right.       

533
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,613
        They know exactly       
    how to cook hogfish here.   

534
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,481
Lights-out good.                
                      Amazing.  

535
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,416
You picked the spot.

     on a beautiful marina.

      We take the boat here     
          all the time.         

538
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,287
It's just a wonderful experience
        here in the Keys.

00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,223
      FIERI: Which includes     
    a Keys culinary classic.    

540
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,091
It's been around since the '70s.

541
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,027
         Here's the

               Oh, thank you.   

542
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,896
        Harvey was a fish cutter
        here at the pilot house.

543
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,564
                To this day,    
there's Harvey's fish sandwiches

544
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,566
            in almost every menu

     No!                        

545
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:56,900
And it started here?            

546
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,635
           It started right here
             at the Pilot House.

Now you're in the know.

     I love the fish Harvey.    
           I love it.           

549
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,908
         It's basically         
    a grilled cheese sandwich   

550
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,043
      that they've infused      
     with fresh local fish.     

551
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,244
    So, what fish               
  do we have here?              

552
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,513
            Fresh black grouper,
         about 7-ounce portions.

553
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:10,647
                  We've got     
            some seasoned flour.

554
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,049
What's it seasoned with?        

555
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,585
          A little Bay seasoning
 and salt and pepper. That's it.

556
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,987
             Lightly egg-washed.

557
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,321
 Little panko to it.

00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,924
             Into the deep fryer
         with that, 350 degrees,

559
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:22,126
                  It takes      
              about 7 minutes.  

560
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:24,061
                So, we've got   
    our grilled cheese sandwich.

561

  Wheat bread, huh?             

562
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,098
                Whole wheat,    
         sliced American cheese.

563
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,333
               Sliced tomato,   
       we're gonna stick on here

564
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,068
           just to warm them up.

565
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,406
                  Top that      
         with our fried grouper.

566
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:38,676
          Some of our house-made
       tartar sauce -- top that.

567
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:45,149
   And there's your world-famous
         Harvey's fish sandwich.

568
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,618
So if you want to get it        
at the place it started,        

569
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,853
this is where you go.           

570
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:52,823
        Mmm!                    

571
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:55,359
First, the fish is great.       
Really nice and moist.          

572
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,228
I mean, there's great flavor    
in that black grouper.          

573
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,030
  Got a great toast             
    on the bread.

with the whole-wheat move.      

575
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,169
  The tartar sauce              
definitely plays its piece,     

576
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,705
but it's the processed cheese   
   and the tomato.              

577
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:08,972
                    Yes.        

578
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,976
  I can understand              
why the sandwich is so popular. 

579
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,445
This is up in the best fried    
fish sandwich I've ever had.

        The local flavor        
  of the fish, you can't beat.

     knew it became famous,     

585
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,789

    about Harvey.
