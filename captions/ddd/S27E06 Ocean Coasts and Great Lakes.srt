     a little bit               

115
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,022
 with the beefiness             
   of the brisket.              

116
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,792
     Chunks of pickle           
inside the thousand island.     

117
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,696
Basically, what you've got      
    is pastrami bacon.          

118
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:52,630
                    Yeah.       

119
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,032
     And that's                 
 never a bad thing.

      -You should take it.

          -Thanks, man.         

122
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,305
           Pork belly's working.

123
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:02,641
   Every time I eat it, I find  
 something else in the sandwich 

124
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,643
 that just explodes in my mouth.

125
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:05,910
Every once in a while,          
I get to cruise a town          

126

 Have you ever been             
    to Meat BBQ?                

129
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,584
             Quite a few times. 

130
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,718
You don't look like you         
eat here very often.            

131
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,053
              Once in a while,  
               you must do it.  

132
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,388
 You got to go big.             

133
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,923
    FIERI: But it's not just    
  the meat taking center stage. 

134
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,926
The pickle fries are at         
another level of ridiculous.    

135
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:23,862
    JOHNSON: We had a fry slicer
          we weren't using.     

136
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:24,996
                 One night,     
             we started getting 

137
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,265
               a little crazy   
             and a little kooky,

138
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,732
         and we started throwing
           pickles through them.

139
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,267
Just cornmeal and...            

140
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,004
  It's like cornmeal with sugar,
      salt, and Cajun seasoning.

141
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,873
Top three best pickle           
fries I've ever had.            

142
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,408
      FIERI: And the wings      
       aren't bad, either.      

143
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:37,942
  Smoked Wings -- black magic.  

144
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:39,878
         They're crispy.        
   They're juicy. They're hot.  

145
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,012
When you can actually           
      just feel                 

146
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,615
  the chicken fall              
 right off the bone.            

147
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,817
       -What are we doing?      
    -Our brine for our wings.   

148
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,152
               We're gonna do   
               some hot sauce.  

149
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:52,023
Kosher salt, white sugar, plain,
         old Michigan tap water.

150
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,626
            I'm just gonna place
     these right into the brine.

151
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,694
     These are our chicken wings
    that we've brined overnight.

           FIERI:               
  Hit them with the dry rub     
that we hit the brisket with.   

153
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,965
          -Absolutely.          
  -In the smoker for how long?  

154
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,969
            For about an hour   
        and a half to two hours.

155
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,636
    When the come out,          
we fry them before service?     

156
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:07,172
                    Yeah.       

157
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,174
  You have all these            
different wing sauces.          

158
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:12,310
 We have your traditional Kansas
      City style barbecue sauce,

159
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,445
              Carolina mustard, 
              hot garlic sauce. 

160
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,114
                 This is our    
             Cherry Bomb Sauce. 

161
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,382
            We're gonna start   
        with some cherries here.

162
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,317

00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,323
           A little bit of apple
              cider vinegar.

               a half an hour.  

168
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:30,529
     And then we're gonna run it
 in just a regular, old blender.

169
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,932
            Throw in some wings,
    a little bit of Cherry Bomb.

170
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,968
A little bit of the Black Magic,
        which is a coffee sauce.

   you're lucky enough          

174
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,544
to get one of those wings off   
that roasted chicken

that your grandma made,

  that's that wing.             

177
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,616
    Great flavor.               

178
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,085
I think that the cherry         
     and chipotle               

179
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,887

192
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,179
          You got to be careful.

            are just incredible.

195
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,252
            I mean, it's        
     competition-level barbecue.

00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,729
    -This is Shrimp Ceviche.    
           -Thank you.          

233
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,665
  I definitely think that this  
      restaurant stands out     

234
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,933
    in Grand Central Market.    

235
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,801
 FIERI: That's because it's run 
         by this cat --         

236
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,202
      Fernando Villagomez.      

237
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:53,204
  VILLAGOMEZ: Three more minutes
          on the burgers!       

238
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,940
      He moved from Mexico      
    to Canada when he was 21    

239
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,410
    and eventually opened up    
       his first taqueria.      

240
00:07:58,545 --> 00:07:59,677
          FIERI: So you're there
              for five years,   

241
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:00,912
             and then you come  
           to the United States.

242
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,218
          Far end of the market.

243
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:09,554
              He does carnitas. 

244
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,755
               Only carnitas.   

245
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,824
  After six years of killing it 
       with the carnitas,       

246
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,092
      Fernando hit a wall.      

247
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,093
I'm always thinking, like,      

248
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,429
I have to have more skills      
      in the kitchen,           

249
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:21,432
so I say, "You know what,       
I have to go back to school     

250
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:25,169
to learn more about food,       
about cuisine, flavor profile." 

251
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:28,106
  And after all that schooling, 
     he opened up this joint    

252
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,241
      and threw his lessons     
      right into the menu.      

253
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,043
       Octopus Tostada up!      

254
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,979
     The Octopus Tostada --     
        It's very bright.       

255
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:37,248
  It's a fried tortilla with a  
 mound of deliciousness on top. 

256
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,584
  MAN: It's got peppers in it.  
 It's got your cherry tomatoes. 

257
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,586
      It's got your texture     
 that you need from the octopus.

258
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:44,255
               I love octopus.  
               Let me see it.   

259
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:48,059
Water, sake -- give you         
  that Asian flavor,            

260
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,263
but still you have the flavor   
profile of the Mexican cuisine. 

261
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,331
And you learned about Asian food
        when you were at school?

262
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,799
             -Yeah.             
       -Look at this guy.       

263
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:55,800
     Fish sauce.                

264
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,402
              I've cooked with  
              a lot of Latinos, 

265
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,737
      and this is the first time

266
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,139
          I've ever seen anybody
             with fish sauce.   

267
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:07,078
     Again, first time I've ever
  seen star anise in a taqueria.

268
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,213
       Thyme.                   
     Bay leaves.                

269
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:09,748
      Shallots.                 
       Basil.                   

270
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,949
    What do you call basil in...

271
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:12,417
   Basil is basil.              

272
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:14,419
I never use it before           
     in Mexico.                 

273
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:15,420
         No, I've never seen it.

274
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,621
 I've never seen it             
     in Mexico.                 

275
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,156
             Okay, chili diablo 
             We at least know --

276
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,424
        We know this one.       
             -Yeah.             

277
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,560
            So we're just making
      a really nice, light broth

278
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:23,962
           to poach the octopus.

279
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,697
 Mexican octopus --             
    wild octopus.               

280
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,265
   -Wild octopus from Mexico.   
         -Wild octopus.         

281
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:29,433
     Let it cook                
for like 45 minutes.            

282
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,502
                   Got it.      

283
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:31,903
   We already have              
  the octopus done.             

284
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,237
We have to cool it down.        

285
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:34,639
     Ice water.                 

286
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,442
 Once it cools down all the way,
          take off all the skin.

287
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,576
        Yes.                    

288
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:39,577
               Slice it thin,   
             put on the tostada.

289
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,179
     -Put it in the tostada.    
            -Got it.            

290
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,447
                 Make it up.    

291
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:45,183
        Cucumbers,              
red bell peppers, radishes,     

292
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,985
heirloom cherry tomatoes.       

293
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,853
      This is all the chef stuff
              coming out.       

294
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:51,456
 It isn't just chopped tomatoes 
 like you have in pico de gallo.

295
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,124
     Red onion.                 
      Cilantro.                 

296
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,325
                    Okay.       

297
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:55,259
      Cilantro --               
If you're a Mexican --          

298
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:56,394
          It's the state flower,
                  buddy.        

299
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,030
 That's what it is.             
  Sea salt. Pepper.             

300
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,534
Lime juice for acid.            

301
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,469
          And this is made fresh
           every time like this.

302
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:05,870
 Every -- By order.             

303
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,473
         This market is slamming
            and jamming and busy

304
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,275
             and there's a line 
              out of the place  

305
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,011
and he's taking it and making it
             to order each time.

306
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,679
 Then you get ready             
    to plate it.                

307
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,114
                    Okay.       

308
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,719
        Really impressive, chef.

309
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:24,622
                  Gorgeous.     

310
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,157
        Yeah.                   

311
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:28,359
          I'm getting the tomato
 and I'm getting the bell pepper

312
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,361
       and I'm getting the onion
    and I'm getting the cilantro

313
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,630
             and I'm getting all
      of these flavors together.

314
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,967
 This right here is taking what 
 you've learned becoming a chef,

315
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,035
               along with your  
             Mexican traditions,

316
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,037
        and it's delicious, man.

317
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,306
                  Look at       
          that bite right there.

318
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,174
Here's the Octopus Tostada.     

319
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,377
   The octopus is very tender   
           and tasty,           

320
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:46,845
       seasoned properly.       

321
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,513
        MAN: It's spicy.        
          It's lemon-y.         

322
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,248
           It's tangy.          
           It's fresh.          

323
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,983
    It has good presentation.   

324
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,119
             FIERI:             
  That's because Chef Fernando  
  doesn't skimp on the details. 

325
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,321
      Where are the plates from?

326
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,523
They're from Capula,            
Michoacan, in Mexico.           

327
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,191
         You had these specially
           made in Michoacan?   

328
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,392
        Yeah.                   

329
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:02,460
 I think you know in            
 restaurant business            

330
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,929
  you have to have              
 not just the food.             

331
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,465
  It's experience.              
   See this tile?               

332
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,534
   Made in Mexico.              
     The boards?                

333
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,935
   Made in Mexico.              

334
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,070
              I love this guy.  

335
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,005
             SERVER:            
   Here's the Octopus Tostada.  

336
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,740
   WOMAN: All these different   
          food options,         

337
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,542
          but this one          
      definitely stood out.     

338
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,077
        Here's what's happening.

339
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,945
      We're hanging out at Grand
  Central Market in Los Angeles.

340
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,680
               This chef --     
          a guy you got to meet.

341
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,816
           Come back.           
The Patrona Burger's on its way.

342
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:26,484
Patrona Burgers out!            

343
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,421
   It's fresh, it's flavorful,  
  and it's everything you could 

344
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,423
          possibly want         
      in a seafood burger.      

345
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,292
          The tostada, though --
          It's gonna be as good?

346

    and they definitely take    
  their time with every plate.  

359
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,328

 The Patrona Burger's delicious.

364
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,605
     A combination of cheese    
      and shrimp and aioli.

        All right, what's first?

372
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,088
      Okay, mango,              
red bell pepper, chives.        

373
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:37,956
           And then...          

374
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,290
               Let me guess --  
                  cilantro.     

375
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,759
      Cilantro.                 
      Exactly.                  

376
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,427
     I can't believe your middle
          name's not "Cilantro."

377
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:46,765
                    Okay.       

378
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,367
Avocados from the capital       
    of the avocado --           

379
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,768
     Michoacan.                 

380
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:53,371
      You just drop Michoacan in
 as often as you can, don't you?

381
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,506
        -I love my state.       
         -I know you do.        

382
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,976
 So you just toss it            
    all together.               

383
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,710
                 All right,     
            time for the burger?

384
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,979
Wild Mexican shrimp.            

385
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,381
          -Not frozen.          
           -No frozen.

     -Makes big difference.     

387

        Makes a huge difference.

388

   The bun, also.               

390
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,389
This is Oaxaca cheese.          

391
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,991
           Oaxaca cheese is like
             jack mozzarella.   

392
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,126
             -Yeah.             
    -That's gonna be kind of    

393
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:16,060
             what actually holds
           this burger together.

394
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,262
        Yeah.                   

395
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:18,997
         It's like the duct tape
            of Mexican food.    

396
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,932
Now we got the buns.            

397
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,467
                    Okay.       

398
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,602
  And before culinary school, he
called that chipotle mayonnaise.

399
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:26,270
      Lettuce.                  
       Tomato.                  

400
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:31,208
Now we have our shrimp cooked   
with the Oaxaca cheese melting. 

401
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,343
       Onion.                   

402
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,412
      We gonna use              
the avocado mango radish.       

403
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,080
             As much as I think 
            I'm gonna love this,

404
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,081
        I'm still gonna tell you

405
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,684
              I hate it so you  
            got to feed my crew.

406
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:40,752
            MAN: Yes!           

407
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,622
This is for the crunchiness.    

408
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,158
        Done.                   

409
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,493
       I haven't had to bust out
           the hunch in a while.

410
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:52,063
      This one might deserve it.

411
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,702
              I got good news,  
             and I got bad news.

412
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:58,570
      Tell me.                  

413
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,170
               Good news is...  

414
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:01,639
              that's fantastic. 

415
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:05,510
      The bad news is the crew's
    hitting the vending machine.

416
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,379
  When you bite into it, you get
    the saltiness of the cheese,

417
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:09,647
      the texture of the cheese.

418
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,248
  The shrimp's cooked perfectly.

419
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,318
                And then all    
            the accoutrements --

420
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,386
           the shredded lettuce,
            the chipotle mayo,  

421
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,188
                 the tomato,    
               the raw onion,   

422
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,791
            the phenomenal salsa

 expectation level of burgers --

426
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,266
                That is about   
             as high as they go.

   The bread is really moist.

00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,606

        It's not frozen.        

434
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:41,412
 All these extra little toppings
    on it makes it the bomb.

        Gonna eat pizza,        
    got to be the real deal.    

463
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,743
  And when it comes to grilled  
 cheese, what am I looking for? 

464
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,478
    It's got to have a nice,    
         crunchy crust,         

465
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,746
        it's got to have        
       ooey-gooey cheese,       

466
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,214
   and it's got to be unique.   

467
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,882
       And I hear this is       
     the joint to check out.    

468
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,885
             This is            
   the Grilled Cheese Bistro.   

469
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,488
     Nice toast on caprese.     

470
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,090
   WOMAN: When you come to the  
     Grilled Cheese Bistro,     

471
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,825
don't expect plain, old cheddar.

472
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,226
 You name it, they have it all. 

473
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,028
         Your Gooey with        
        a dipper of soup.       

474
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,765
How can I compare grilled cheese
  that I had as a kid to this?  

475
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:11,235
             FIERI:             
 You can't because Dina Taylor's
  taking her childhood classic  

476
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,371
        and elevating it        
     to a whole other level.    

477
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,972
 What makes a great             
   grilled cheese?              

478
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,507
                 Just being     
             a little creative. 

479
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:19,377
           I guess a little more
         gourmet grilled cheese.

480
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,112
          You have your         
       vegetarian options.      

481
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,246
  You have your meaty options.  

482
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:23,647
   You have a seafood option.   

483
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:25,249
   The Lobster Mac and Cheese.  

484
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:28,186
   It's lobster mac and cheese  
 in between two pieces of bread.

485
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:30,254
  The combination of the two -- 
          It's perfect.         

486
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,990
  -So, what are we gonna make?  
   -We're making The Hangover.  

487
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,124
           We put mac and cheese
   inside of the grilled cheese,

488
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,727
           and special occasions
           we add lobster to it.

489
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:39,263
Okay, we're making a bechamel   
we're gonna add this cheese to. 

490
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,932
So go ahead and give me         
  the breakdown here.           

491
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,867
             Black truffle oil, 
              shallots, garlic, 

492
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:47,271
           fresh thyme, a little
    chicken-based flour, slowly.

493
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,673
 -So you're building your roux. 
             -Yeah.             

494
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,676
     We're gonna add the wine --
         3/4 of the bottle.     

495
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,745
      And then I drink the rest.

496
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:57,214
                Heavy cream.    

497
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,416
               Lots of cheese.  

498
00:16:58,551 --> 00:16:59,550
Fontina, cheddar, and mozz.     

499
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,751
             -Yeah.             
            -Got it.            

500
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:03,221
             It'll start melting
            and doing its thing.

501
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,490
       -What's its thing?       
    -It starts getting gooey.   

502
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,757
     Isn't that                 
  the melting part?             

503
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,359
        That's the melting part.

504
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,227
          Mix it with the pasta.

505
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,296
          Next step, we're gonna
             make the lobster.  

506
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:13,765
             Butter.            
             -Okay.             

507
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,834
        Lobster -- tails, claws,
           whatever you want.   

508
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,437
           Fresh thyme in there.
And a little bit of lemon juice.

509
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,505
              Salt and pepper.  

510
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:21,706
Now we start to build           
    the sandwich?               

511
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,907
                    Yep.        

512
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,041
Okay, well, let's get           
 into this, sister.             

513
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:26,044
            Clarified butter.   
         This is cheddar cheese.

514
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:27,578
            The bread comes from
                 New Jersey.    

515
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,847
     People are really surprised
     to see the thickness of it.

516
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,115
     Beautiful.                 

517
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,585
             The mac and cheese,
and we're adding the lobster in.

518
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:35,787
                Seal this up.   

519
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,722
We just entered ridiculous.     
Look at the size of it.         

520
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,390
                Look at that.   

521
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,993
                 Here we go.    

522
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:45,263
                     ♪♪         

523
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:49,200
 When you come in, you want fat,
        you want crunch,        

524
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,602
you want salt, you want...      

525
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:52,603
                 Cheesiness.    

526
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,272
That's the sandwich you get.    

527
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:57,608
I love your cheese sauce        
because it's sticky enough,     

528
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,409
and the way that you            
 built the bread --             

529
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,812
       the amount of time       
 that you let that sit on there,

530
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:05,149
it's really worth it because    
it builds a fantastic crust.    

531
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,284
       You did a good job.      
           -Thank you.          

532
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,818
You did a really good job.      

533
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:10,488
It is the best mac and cheese   
      I have ever had.          

534
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,223
FIERI: So, in case you don't    
      know who this is.         

535
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:15,893
It's the Internet sensation --  
the Queen of Norfolk.           

536
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,028
    This is Abby.               

537
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:18,429
And what do you think           
of this grilled cheese?         

538
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:19,830
        It's super-gooey.       

539
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,832
 The bread adds a perfect crunch

540
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:24,368
   and actually a good amount   
         of flavor, too.        

541
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:26,437
     The gooier the better.     

542
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,305
     Can you say                
   "unemployment"?              

543
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:31,375
As soon as she can drive,       
        I'm done.               

544
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,443
             WOMAN:             
  This is absolutely the best.  

545
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:33,845
      Worth every calorie.      

546
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,514
  FIERI: And the crazy thing is 
   these calories are put out   

547
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,115
         by a real-deal         
          body builder.         

548
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,250
               I was dieting.   

549
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,384
             I was getting ready
             for a competition. 

550
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,053
       I was craving some cheese
            and some bread.     

551
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,121
               That's how this  
              concept started.  

552
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:46,123
 But it's not all carbolicious. 

553
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,992
      There's some veggies      
     thrown in the mix, too.    

554
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,527
       I have Don Quixote.      

555
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,863
        This sandwich is        
     the vegetarian option.     

556
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,932
   It's got mushrooms, olive.   

557
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,134
Next up is going to be...       

558
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,536
            Don Quixote Sandwich
               Grilled Cheese.  

559
00:18:58,671 --> 00:18:59,736
   And why do you               
    name it that?               

560
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,873
             It has the little  
          Mediterranean flavors.

561
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,207
           It's a Spanish novel.

562
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,210
           I just thought it was
     a brilliant name. [Laughs ]

563
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,679
It wasn't just a good name --   
      a brilliant name.         

564
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:09,947
              A brilliant name. 

565
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,882
              We're gonna make  
             the olive tapenade.

566
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:14,885
         Olive oil, lemon juice,
           some kalamata olives.

567
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,019
       Got it.                  

568
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,021
            -Capers.            
         -A ton of them.        

569
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,622
                  Parsley.      
              A little garlic.  

570
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,424
         Blend this up together,
             and it's done.     

571
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,626
That's the olive tapenade.      
All right, next step?           

572
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,428
         Get our sandwich going.

573
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:25,696
              Sourdough bread.  

574
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:28,032
      Spread a little bit of our
        homemade olive tapenade,

575
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,501
    two slices of fontina cheese
            on each side.       

576
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,036
            We're gonna get it  
           covered a little bit.

577
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,237
  One little dome.              

578
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:34,304
     Do you have more domes?    
           -We have...          

579
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,573
One little, two little,         
    three little --             

580
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:36,907
                ...20 domes.    

581
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,109
           We're going to put on
           our oyster mushrooms.

582
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:40,177
             Caramelized onions.

583
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,712
            Roasted red peppers.

584
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,848
              Parmesan cheese.  

585
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,716
                  It's got      
             a nice toast to it.

586
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,319
               And it's ready.  

587
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,654
                There you go.   

588
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:53,257
Great colors, caramelized       
onions, oyster mushrooms,       

589
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,826
roasted red bell peppers.       

590
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:00,597
This is a really nice,          
mature grilled cheese.          

591
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:01,932
   Caramelized onions,          
boom, right off the bat,        

592
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:03,067
you're gonna get sweet.         

593
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:04,401
Roasted red bell pepper --      
you're gonna get sweet.         

594
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,738
But bringing in the acidity of  
those capers and the kalamatas  

595
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,006
is where you really killed it.  

596
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,474
   Really good job.             
And what was the name?          

597
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,609
                Don Quixote.    

598
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:12,743
 Yeah, but what type            
   of name is it?               

599
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,145
           -It's a...           
     -It's a brilliant name.    

600
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:17,214
 Brilliant name for             
a brilliant sandwich.           

601
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,683
    -Don Quixote. Excellent.    
          -Nicely done.         

602
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,885
            The oyster mushrooms
     with the roasted red pepper

603
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:24,155
       and the olive tapenade --
                 Whoo!          

604
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:25,289
                  So good.      

605
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:27,224
       There's flavor down      
        to the last bite.       

606
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:29,226
  Johnny Appleseed right here.  

607
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:32,229
 Everybody needs to come to have
    the grilled cheese here.    

608
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,232
           FIERI:               
I think if you're gonna have    
    a grilled-cheese-ery,       

609
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,434
 you better deliver.            
   You delivered.               

610
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,169
        -All right, cool.       
           -Nice job.           

611
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:42,105
      So, was this a great      
       road trip or what?       

612
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,374
      But don't you worry.      

613
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:46,177
I got plenty more joints to find
     all over this country.     

614
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:47,645
         I'll be looking        
        for you next time       

615
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:50,581
      on "Diners, Drive-ins     
            & Dives"!           

616
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,449
What else you got up            
    your sleeve?                

617
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:52,983
        -The Don Quixote.       
          -Don Quixote?         

618
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:54,585
                    Yeah.       
                Not "donkey."   

619
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:55,719
 I have two donkeys.            

620
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,787
  Taco and Burrito.             

621
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,656
I thought you might have        
 a donkey named "Hotay."
