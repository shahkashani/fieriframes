00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:53,565
     I remember.                

121
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:57,602
              Wap!              

122
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:58,703
        -Did you get it?        
              -No.              

123
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,372
Still don't have one?           
           No, I still need one.

124
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:02,106
        Remember, you were going
   to send me one, but you know.

125
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,241
You didn't get it?              
                        No.     

126
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,976
I figured after six years       
    of "Triple D"               

127
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,845
and everybody showing up        
from around the country.        

128
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:07,713
               No, I bought one.
    Okay.                       

129
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:09,114
        I bought one right after
                  you left.     

130
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,448
        It was a valiant effort.

131
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,250
         We add the red onion...
  [ Whistles ]                  

132
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,720
              ...minced garlic, 
             salt, white pepper,

133
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:15,920
               fresh cilantro.  

134
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,156
          A lot going on to just
               the pork hash.   

135
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,391
       BARDEN:                  
Pork is out of the oven.        

136
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,259
And it just goes into --        

137
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,994
             And it just shreds 
              that easy. Okay.  

138
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,263
           So potatoes are down.

139
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:27,199
Then you take a nice            
generous dose of pork.          

140
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:28,666
             Holy hash, Batman. 

141
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,268
  Delicious verde.              

142
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,771
                       Wow.     
And that is the pork hash.      

143
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,939
                     Mm.        

144
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,075
              That pork is just 
    really tender, great flavor.

145
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,611
           It's not your average
               breakfast hash.  

146
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,414
                 Well done.     
                Killer hash.    

147
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,349
Tell me about the menu.         
What's new? Anything exciting?  

148
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,818
      I've been doing a lot more
            vegan and vegetarian

149
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,419
             and a lot of things
                from scratch.   

150
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,421
   Give me some of              
   the highlights.              

151
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:50,555
    What are some               
 of the key dishes?             

152
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,691
             I'm doing something
          called a Modern Elvis.

153
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,961
      It's a vegan French toast,
          organic almond butter,

154
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,963
            caramelized bananas,
              and vegan bacon.  

155
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,632
        Nice.                   

156
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,901
     So we're going to start    
      with the vegan bacon.     

157
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:06,304
      Maple syrup, tamari,      
     a little smokey smoke,     

158
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,374
      neutral oil, spices.      

159
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,276
   So you have to have a base   
         for the bacon,         

160
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:14,512
    and we use a traditional    
      spring roll wrapper.      

161
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,982
       They idea is to get      
      a full coating on it,     

162
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,985
 and then we'll drop these down.

163
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,787
    They'll start to edge up    
          like a bacon.         

164
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,322
     Now we're ready to make    
           the batter.          

165
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:29,127
  Flour, baking powder, sugar,  
 cinnamon, salt, non-milk milk, 

166
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:32,331
 little cider vinegar, vanilla, 
  and now we'll whisk together. 

167
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,065
 Dredge the bread in the batter 

168
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,134
   and cook it in vegan butter  
          on the grill.         

169
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:39,137
 Then I'm going to slice bananas
      and caramelize those.     

170
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,072
         Now we'll plate        
        the French toast,       

171
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,542
    adding our almond butter    
to the top, caramelized bananas.

172
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,812
      And we'll finish with     
   our homemade vegan caramel.  

173
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:49,347
  Start with the vegan butter,  
        the brown sugar,        

174
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,416
          cashew cream,         
       the non-dairy milk.      

175
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:54,018
          Stir that in.         
  We'll add the rosemary to it. 

176
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,556
        And then quickly        
      whisk in the vanilla.     

177
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,957
         And then top it        
  with the vegan bacon crumble. 

178
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,827
  And here is our Modern Elvis. 

179
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,495
        Modern Elvis up!        

180
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:06,965
  WOMAN: You've got this, like, 
  cushy soft bread, caramelized 

181
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:10,235
        in sweet bananas,       
     and this caramel on it.    

182
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,702
         It's beautiful.        

183
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,039
        MAN: It's syrupy,       
  it's caramel-y, it's crunchy. 

184
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,309
     It's like every texture    
   in one bite. It's perfect.   

185
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,312
Something you treat yourself to.

186
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,114
       Just because you're vegan
                doesn't mean    

187
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,116
           you don't want to eat
       like a fat kid sometimes.

188
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,319
           [ Laughs ] I'm sorry,
           but, like, it's true.

189
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,188
 It's the best line             
    in the world.               

190
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,389
           -I like it.          
       -You're a culinary

00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,724
         gangster girl.         
           -I like it.          

192
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,592
         You are really all that
               and then some.   

193
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,862
Please run for office.          
  I'd vote for you.             

194
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:37,863
                   [ Laughs ]   
You have the right ideas        

195
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,264
and the right energy            
and the right attitude.         

196
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,932
        Yeah, but you're already
       the mayor of Flavor Town.

197
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,133
               There's really   
               no room for me.  

198
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,201
We need some senators.          

199
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,503
                 [ Laughs ]     

200
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,740
    With sweet brunch options   
     like that, my guess is     

201
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,541
      she'd have everyone's     
          vote in town.         

202
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:51,676
        Now coming up...        

203
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:54,078
Giving away the farm on         
that one, old Quince.           

204
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,547
        ...a burger joint       
         with a twist...        

205
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:56,948
           That's a championship
             burger right there.

206
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,218
      ...and a treat is now     
 a "Triple D" deluxe in Dallas. 

207
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,419
     Tell me what happened.     

208
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,221
                BOSO: We have   
               17 restaurants.  

209
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,056
   I'm so happy for you guys.   

210
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,963
   Back in 2009, we discovered  
    this Dallas burger joint    

211
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:15,100
      whose creative combos     
       were out of bounds.      

212
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,369
    These days, they're still   
           stacking up          

213
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:20,172
      plus stirring in some     
       serious sweetness.       

214
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:22,707
      This is Twisted Root      
         Burger Company.        

215
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,445
     Got your fresh for 15.     

216
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,848
    Twisted Root is literally   
    my favorite burger place.   

217
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,249
            Vegabond.           

218
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,919
   This is what Dallas is all   
   about. This is Texas, baby.  

219
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:37,122
      I saw Twisted Root on     
 "Triple D" about 10 years ago, 

220
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,124
   and it made me want to come  
   up here and have a burger.   

221
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,794
     FIERI: That's thanks to    
   Quincy Hart and Jason Boso,  

222
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,997

      who shared a vision.      

223
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,466
How did you come up with        
Twisted Root Burger Company?    

224
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,201
       We met in culinary school
               our first day.   

225
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,270
             All through school,
    we talked about restaurants.

226
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,605
Three hams and a chili.         

227
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:56,274
      We always complained about
     a quality burger in Dallas.

228
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,143
             We said, "Let's get
     this together and do this,"

229
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,010
              and here we are.  

230
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,011
      It's like                 
   a Disney movie.              

231
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:00,879
               A tear coming.   

232
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,013
     [ Laughs ]                 

233
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,750
          Is this the foundation

 Mama's tried and true recipes. 

467
00:16:58,718 --> 00:16:59,717
        What do you got?        

468
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,985
    We have some                
Greek chicken right now.        

469
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,387
        Did you eat this at home
            when you were a kid?

470
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,323
You bet. Whatever Mama          
  has in the oven,              

471
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,991

no matter what it is.

Little garlic, salt,            
  pepper, oregano.

475
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:12,329
Then we just flip it over.      
    Do the same.

  olive oil on top.

   There you go.

of butter inside there.

00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,342
  Wow. Look at how              
   juicy that is.               

485
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,277

                a little bit    

486
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,344
                 of juice on    
             that thing for you.

 all over my shirt!

   chicken seasoned that way,

   it's my mom's recipe, so...

    It's easy to be the hero

 Really, seriously.

    I've made some meatballs.

   I don't know that I've made  
      with any Greek mint.

    Roll them nice and light.

Now, Mama, how many meatballs   
do you get with an order?       

520
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,746
                    Three.      
Sometimes six is okay?

 with 10 sheets of phyllo dough,

         to put another         

544
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,762
         three pieces of

        chunk, plump, and juicy.

00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,351
    Nice.

 Sounds like all my             
roommates in college.           

583
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,020
               Bah, dah, bum.   
                 Seriously.     

584
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:57,521

                 after this.
