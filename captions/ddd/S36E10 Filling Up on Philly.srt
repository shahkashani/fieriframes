124
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,783
  WOMAN: The Wit Or Witowski is 
 their take on the cheesesteak. 

125
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,986
   It's classy, which is tying  
  into our Polish neighborhood. 

126

          It's amazing.         

127

        Now,                    
  what are we into?             

128
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,256
            The Wit Or Witowski.
        That's what it's called.

129
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,791
                So, in Philly   
             you get cheesesteak

130
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,460
                 with onions    
             or without onions? 

131
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:24,329
     We added a "ski" on the end
           so now we Polishized.

132
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,465

              Wit Or Witowski.  

133
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,800
         So Kielbasa is the meat
           of the Polish people.

134
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,669
And you're going to make        
 your own Kielbasa.             

135
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,805
          Paprika, onion powder,
            coarse black pepper,

136
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:36,074
             salt, fresh garlic.

137
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,477
Different than granulated garlic
         which we're adding now.

138
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,678
           Into the ground pork.

139
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,546
 Now, this is going             
 to get mixed up...             

140
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:42,547

142
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,750

143
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,285

145
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,222
        House made cheese sauce.

146
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,024
           Butter, chicken stock
               that we strain   

147
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:53,692

Got it.                         

148
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:57,495
 Granulated garlic, onion powder
    and the coarse black pepper.

149
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,766
 I'm going to whisk it with this
 professional whisk we got here.

150
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,300
 And what's going on            
with the cheese here?           

151
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,702
              So that's a sharp 
              American cheese.  

152
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,237
     I like it.                 

153
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,638
                 So this is     
             the Kielbasa loaf.

              into your mouth.

of Kielbasa launch meat?

                There you go.   

162
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,854
     Add some caramelized onions
               right on that.

          with the cheese sauce.

164

Okay.                           
          Look like a pork roll,
            but it's a Kielbasa.

165

it is part cheese steak.

to doing it on the flat top,    

174

kind of caramelizing

00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:43,694
 It's kind of like a speakeasy. 

233
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:44,829
The old man was selling.        

234
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:45,964
  He was retiring,              
     so he says,                

235
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:46,965
"I want you guys to have it.    

236
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,366
I think you'd be perfect        
      for you."                 

237
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:49,434
         FIERI: What do you guys
                 serve here?    

238
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,302
What was on our dinner          
  table every day.              

239
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,904
    I lost my mom               
  eight months ago.             

240
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,906
That's all her recipes          
   over the wall.               

241
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,108
Spaghetti and meatballs,        
   the crab gravy.              

242
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,776
       Order up, linguine       
         and crag gravy.        

243
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,513
   Nobody makes the crab gravy  
        like Stogie Joe.        

244
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:04,783
Sunday, gravy was a tomato sauce
for a pasta dish, correct?      

245
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,851
                        Exactly.
   But we're going              
to make it with crab.           

246
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:11,455
Yep. So we start with olive oil,
           butter, leeks, onion.

247
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,391
  Celery, bay leaf.             

248
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,527
             Garlic, peppercorn,
           a little bit oregano,

249
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:18,196
             crushed red pepper,
   some fresh parsley and thyme.

250
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,430
 My favorite album.             

251
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,665
               Get that going   
             for a few minutes. 

252
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,467
Raw but clean blue crabs.       

253
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,603
                        Exactly.
And this is the crab            
 of the East Coast.             

254
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:27,138
                            Yes.
Talk about great flavor         
  and sweet.                    

255
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,941
 Old bay, and then we'll cook it
               for 15 minutes.  

256
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,744
 We'll finish it with white wine
        and fresh plum tomatoes.

257
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:33,812
We're going to cook it?         
                           Yep. 

258
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,479
         Four hours, five hours.
Oh, really?                     

259
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,749
            Yup. We macerated it
                for our food.   

260
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,884
I've never seen this.           

261
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:40,952
   That's awesome.              

262
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,687
So it comes with the soup       
   and everything?              

263
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:43,755
                    Yeah.       

264
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,023
Going to grind it up.           

265
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,824
Get the sauce out of it.        
                            Yep.

266
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,226
                 [ Laughs ]     

267
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:50,361
The crab, all that great        
flavor's in the shell.          

268
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,297
You'll get all the flavor,      
 none of the shells.            

269
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,165
                       Exactly. 
This is the next level.         

270
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,067
Did your mom get the chance     
 to see any of this?            

271
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,902
                     Absolutely.
What did she say?               

272
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,105
 "I never taught it             
  to you this way."             
                        Exactly.

273
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,640
I'm just dying to see           
  the end of this.              

274
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,842
                 Crab gravy,    
               add the tomato,  

275
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,444
     butter just to balance out.

276
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,446
    Bring it up temperature,    
     then add the linguine,     

277
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,581
            the salt and pepper.

278
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,515
         Just coat it real nice.

279
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,050
Real nice like that.            

280
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,517
  Smells the part.              

281
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,452
                  Finish it     
          with a little parsley,

282
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:15,854
         extra virgin olive oil.

283
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:16,821
And that's all she wrote.       

284
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,792
      In South Philly, we eat it
     with bread. You got to dip.

285
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,527
Your brothers aren't over here  
 serving the bread,             

286
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,262
  working together              
   as a tag team.               

287
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,130
      Here you go, big guy.     
          I was sleepy.         

288
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,266
     Thank you.                 
Oh, you taking a nap where you? 

289
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:32,404
It is crab on crab on crab.     

290
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,739
 You're getting all             
the flavor you want.            

291
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,541
        Wham,                   
right into the pasta dish.      

292
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,677
  It's Flavor City.             

293
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,178
  Really delicious.             

294
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,614
       Two linguine, crab.      

295
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:45,016
         The crab gravy         
     is really, really good.    

296
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,284
    The crabs just threw out    
           that sauce,          

297
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,087
     and it's unforgettable.    

298
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,354
    Order up, sausage bites.    

299
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,489
   MAN: It's the kind of place  
       where I always say       

300
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:52,757
  the next day I want it again. 

301
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,093
Is the food different in        
South Philly to North Philly?   

302
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,428
      It really is really, yeah.
Really?                         

303
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,562
         It just feels like more
                 authentic,     

304
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,764
    just has like a better taste
        and a better vibe to it.

305
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,965
So this is like no, no --       

306
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,500
   This is like being at home.  

307
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,569
      I'm ordering the same food
           that I've been eating

308
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:05,903
             for like 60 years. 

309
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,171
   And I come over here and say,

310
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,973
       "Wow, it's so much better
               and different."  

311
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,643

     on an Italian classic.     

312

              Stogie Joe Pizza. 

313
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:16,581
     The absolute best pizza    
     in South Philadelphia.     

314
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,583

 just as much fun as eating it.

     And we got more of that    
       when we come back.

If you're not pointing          
at six people at one time,      

324
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,371
             If not, you're not

This is Stogie Joe's brother.

 when he was a kid.

345
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,608
