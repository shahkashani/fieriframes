  This is a bucket

563
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:03,514
                   Kimchi?

564
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,049

our kimchi cheese sauce.        

569
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,190
We have our milk, water.        

570
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,591
We use sodium citrate.          

571

 It prevents the fat

fermented chili paste.          

577
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,272
