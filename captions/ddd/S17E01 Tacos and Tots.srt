118
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,514
                    Okay.       

119
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,984
We have a roasted jalapeño      
and tomato pico de gallo,       

120
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:14,919
pickled radish, apple,          
   which is local.              

121
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:15,920
                I like this.    

122
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,055
    A little bit                
    of cilantro,                

123
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:19,791
 and then we finish             
with the green chili crema.     

124
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,393
And that's our tacos.           

125
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:23,929
          You're out of control.

126
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,201
                   Mmm-mm!      

127
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,670
         Let me break this down.

128
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,005
            'Cause there's a lot
               going on here.   

129
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,775
         The texture of the meat
                    is...       

130
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,147
              ...in my opinion, 
     so many times not regarded.

131
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,549
 But, really, it deserves more  
 respect, and you give it that. 

132
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,485
               That pork butt,  
     the way it's cooked down --

133
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:48,353
          nice and super tender.

134
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,822
    Fortifying it with the tasso
    with a little bit saltier...

135
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:53,024
     definitely some more crunch
             and texture to it. 

136
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,027
  And then each little component
   from the apple to the radish 

137
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,162
         to a little bit of heat

138
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,997
               coming through   
     that roasted chili crema --

139
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,899
             I'm gonna tell you 
             something, brother.

140
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:03,901
            I've had a few tacos
                 in my day.     

141
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,636
            That's a<i> great</i> taco.

142
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,505
     Thank you.                 
          You had me at hello.  
             Excellent job.     

143
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,907
   Thank you, sir.              

144
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,509
  Service, please.              

145
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:13,712
There's something about the pork
    and the radish together.    

146
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:16,848
      It's sweet and salty      
        and it's amazing.       

147
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,383
 This is not your average taco. 

148
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,519
       FIERI: And it ain't      
    your average bar, either.   

149
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:23,988
 This is the only bar in Tacoma 
       that has moonshine.      

150
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,857
             FIERI:             
          That's right.         

151
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:29,394
      Moonshine -- mixed up     
   in 12 off-the-hook drinks.   

152
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:32,864
     And when we come back,     
       they find a partner      

153
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:36,802
      with Aaron's take on      
  the one, the only tater tot.  

154
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,937
         Do the laws of physics 
   cease to exist in my kitchen?

155
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:39,671
        Yeah.                   

156
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:47,245
             FIERI:             
 "Triple D" is at Dirty Oscar's 
 Annex in Tacoma, Washington... 

157
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,447
  Service, please.              

158
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:49,915
        ...where my man,        
       Chef Aaron Grissom,      

159
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,983
       thinks he's cracked      
         the holy grail         

160
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,786
   of deep-fried finger foods.  

161
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:57,322
 An utterly amazing soft potato 

162
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,724
           filled with          
   an amazing creamy Parmesan.  

163
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,993
    Just melts in your mouth.   

164
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:02,994
          What are these called,
                  anyways?      

165
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,196
   Parmesan tots.               

166
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,598
              I think everybody 
       in their culinary career,

167
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,668
        at one time or another, 
 has tried to make the bomb tot.

168
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,003
   It's hard to get them as good
      as they manufacture them, 

169
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,538
               so let me hear   
              about your magic. 

170
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,941
Okay, so, we have boiled        
russet potatoes from Idaho.     

171
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,144
        We just want to let them
                  hang out,     

172
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,278
            keeping some texture
                  to them,      

173
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,480
        but enough mash on them 
       that they'll go together.

174
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,615
  Yep. Absolutely.              
                       Okay.    

175
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,283
       We have                  
our Parmesan cheese.            

176
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:26,218
                    Whoa.       

177
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,886
 Our white cheddar.             

178
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,220
Yeah, quality check.            

179
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,889
     Provolone.                 
Our IQF hash browns.

      Individually Quick Frozen.

181
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,827
              There's something 
            about freezing stuff

182
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,462
        and drawing the moisture
                out of them,    

183
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,297
               and I have done  
          hash brown experiments

184
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,365
                 at my house    
              a million times.  

185
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:41,700
You can never get them          
     that good.                 

186
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:42,901
          You can<i> never</i> get them
                 that good.     

187
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,369
        And that's the sad thing
                   of it.       

188
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:45,637
                 It's like,     
               why do I not --  

189
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,973
    Do the laws of physics cease
        to exist in my kitchen? 

190
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:48,707
        Yeah.                   

191
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,043
I just kind of mix it up        
    just a touch.               

192
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,044
 We have our panko.             

193
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,646
And that's another part         
   of our binder.               

194
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,848
We have cubed Havarti.          

195
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,716
               And some AP --   
             All-purpose flour. 

196
00:06:58,718 --> 00:06:59,584
  Yep. Absolutely.              

197
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,985
     All right,                 
  so, we mix them,              

198
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,121
we let it rest for a day,       
and then we form them.          

199
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,790
      So, you're gonna mix this,
         just let this congeal. 

200
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,058
 A little bit. Yeah.            

201
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,393
         It just does the magic.
     Yeah.                      

202
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:10,996

203
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:12,864
            Now you'll make them
                into your --

               That's a big'un.

208
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:21,873
                    Okay,       
         so, we knock these out.

209
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,208

   Yes.                         

210
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,409
             And go down for...

It's roughly two minutes.       

212

 Tasting-tots time.

221
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:51,969
              just don't really 
              have the texture. 

222

  You don't feel that little bit
         of that potato crunch. 

223
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,308
     They're usually just soggy,

00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:09,987
  Service, please.              

232
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,923
         Tell me about the tots.

233
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:12,991
They'll change your life.       

234
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,926
         WOMAN: I mean,         
    it's potatoes and cheese,   

235
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,729
    and they're fried, so,      
    I mean, that's literally    
    the three best things.      

236
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:18,930
           Oh, my dad.          

237
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,533
              A lot of flavors  
         and a lot of rich food,

238
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:25,203
              and all handmade, 
   scratch-made in this kitchen.

239
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,239
               Again, killer.   
   Thank you, man.              

240
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:30,608
        FIERI: Up next...       

241
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,076
             Wow. That is funky.

242
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,746
         ...we're headed        
     to Denver, Colorado...     

243
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:35,680
               The flavor jets  
               just turned on.  

244
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,082
  ...for an old-school dive bar 

245
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,551
  with serious culinary chops.  

246
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,753
       That's about as righteous
            as you'll find 'em. 

247
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,965
           I'm here in          
   the Highlands neighborhood,  

248
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,434
   about a mile from downtown   
        Denver, Colorado,       

249
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,236
     and about a mile away      
     from Citizen Pictures,     

250
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:00,838
the folks that happen to produce
"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives," 

251
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,640
   but don't let those details  
          confuse you.          

252
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,243
      I'm here to check out     
       a joint that I hear      

253
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:06,912
     has the most real-deal,    
          off-the-hook,         

254
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,846
       outrageous bar food      
          you can find.         

255
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,749
    This is Highland Tavern.    

256
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,988
   Stupid Burger                
   in the window.               

257
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,791
   Much more upscale than what  
 you would consider a local bar.

258
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,592
    Not a Philly.               

259
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,595
       MAN: The attention       
  to having higher ingredients  

260
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,163
       in a dive-bar feel.      

261
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:32,337
     FIERI: Just when owners    
 Brian Sommatino and Andy Stutz 

262
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,739
           had in mind          
when they bought this old joint.

263
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,542
       The building we're in is 
  an old Coors Brewing building?

264
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,477
 Yeah, built in 1901            
      by Coors.                 

265
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:43,347
It's been a bar pretty much     
 from 1901 till now,            

266
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,849
 minus prohibition.             

267
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,622
 So, they kept the suds flowing 

268
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:53,558
   and hired fine-dining chef   
          Jeremy McMinn         

269
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,226
      to build up the menu.     

270
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:58,096
Every dish has a little         
something added to it           

271
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,831
 that just makes you            
    remember it.                

272
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,901
        Like a pork shank       
     braised in ancho chili,    

273
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:05,303
           spare ribs           
     glazed with Dr Pepper,     

274
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,971
     and house-made pastrami    

275
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,307
          he's dropping         
    on<i> this</i> killer sandwich.    

276
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,775
       McMINN:                  
    Bombshell up.               

277
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:14,112
      It is just marvelous.     

278
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:18,450
     So, I assume from pink salt
        and a big, fat brisket, 

279
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,385
           we're gonna get into 
        some kind of corned beef

280
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:21,986
      or a pastrami or something
              along that line?  

281
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,387
 Yeah, we're making             
   some pastrami.               

282
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,789
                    Okay.       
                Get it going.   

283
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,558
  We're gonna trim              
    this guy up.                

284
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:31,663
         Just taking enough off 
   that it doesn't become messy.

285
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:32,930
        Yeah.                   
     Trim done.                 

286
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,799
We're gonna cut this            
      in half.                  

287
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,134
                There we go.    

288
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,604
     All right,                 
 we got kosher salt.            

289
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:40,805
  Some brown sugar.             

290
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,408
    White sugar.                

291
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,542
   Some pink salt.              

292
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:47,011
   Get some honey               
  going into this.              

293
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,147
Dump our water in here.         

294
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,218
     Sachet bag.                

295
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,487
Got some hickory spice,         
  garlic in there.              

296
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,255
  We'll bring this              
    up to a boil.               

297
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,692
  We're gonna cool              
  this brine down.              

298
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,030
       I really like how it just
         cleans out the system. 

299
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,766
   Cool this down               
   with some ice.               

300
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:10,168
            You go about 50/50, 
      so this will cool it down,

301
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,437
              because otherwise 
          you're gonna poach it,

302
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:16,040
 and you're gonna let this brine
               for seven days?  

303
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:16,907
      15 days.                  

304
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:17,876
                  15 days?!     

305
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:19,177
      15 days.                  

306
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,112
              Wow, this thing's 
             gonna be neon pink.
       Yeah.                    

307
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:22,714
   Weight it down               
  with this plate.              

308
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,115
                There you go.   
                 I love it.     

309
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:24,982
             Off to the walk-in?

310
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:25,817
 Off to the walk-in.            
                       Great.   

311
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,654
    All right, so, we've brined,
               rinsed it off,   

312
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:31,722
            now go into dry rub.

313
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,391
 Granulated garlic,             
 ground coriander,              

314
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,860
and ground black pepper.        

315
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,462
Give this a little stir.        

316
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:40,532
    Apply the rub               
     liberally.                 

317
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,999
        It's a good-looking rub.

318
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,936
     Now, how long is this gonna
      go here on the Big Chief? 

319
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,805
      We do it                  
for about four hours.           

320
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,540
   FIERI: I mean,               
the flavor's in this.           

321
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,941
 The curing process             
      is done.                  

322
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:52,143
Now we're just gonna            
put some smoke flavor to it,    

323
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,145
and then for the final process  
     of serving,                

324
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,746
you're gonna steam it           
    for service.                

325
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:56,748
                  Correct.      
       Okay.                    

326
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,882
So, you're pulling it           
   from the smoke.              

327
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,817
          Now we're gonna finish
            the cooking process 

328
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,019
       in the steam, in the oven
                for how long?   

329
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,755
McMINN: It's about three        
  and a half hours.             

330
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,022
                    Okay.       

331
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,892
This is gonna go in the walk-in 
 and cool overnight             

332
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:08,960
 before we slice it.            

333
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,562
                    Okay.       

334
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,764
          So, we're in the thick
               of things now.   

335
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,634
 I should probably just try this
        for scientific reasons. 

336
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:17,569
              That'll be fine.  

337
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,170
                    Mmm.        

338
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,572
                 Very nice.     
    Scien-ticious.              

339
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,108
First, we're gonna butter       
and toast our rye bread.        

340
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,709
 Drop our pastrami.             

341
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,779
Put our Swiss cheese            
        down.                   

342
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:28,847

for about 26 and a half hours.

522
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,591

 and take all that moisture out,

523
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:48,526
         that's what gives them 
   the chance to really puff up?

524
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:49,326
        Yeah.

    to come out.

               on "Triple D."

          in the top 10 coolest.

542

                 Bring over     
            those mouth killers.

543

  We're gonna make              
the chili lime-salt mix.        

547
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:35,973
We got our lime salt.           

548
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,107
 Korean chili flake.            

549
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,309
    Chili powder.               
    A little mix.               

550
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,311
     Season 'em.                

551
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,314

552
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,448
    There you go.               

553
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,449
                Look at that.   

554
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,584
           That's a lot of work,
                   buddy.

     Thanks.                    

557
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,196
           This is how they were
             to be appreciated. 

558
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:03,066
           Fresh, crispy, light,
                 not dense.     

559

               The flavor jets  
               just turned on.

                to shut down

00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,938
              that flavor fire  
             I got in my mouth. 

562
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,139
You want another one?           

563
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,409
          Maybe a little Tebow. 
            Hang on a second.   

564
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:12,743
             That is ridiculous.

565
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,144
         I don't say this often,

566
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,813
 but that's the best chicharrone
               I've ever had.   

567
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,215
       Thanks.                  
  I appreciate it.              

568
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,817
          I'm really taken back,
                    man.        

569
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,885
              MAN:              
     I love the pork rinds.     

570
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,088
     I think they should be     
 prescribed to me by my doctor. 

571
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,423
       Magic in the mouth.      

572
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:26,157
              These are great.  

573
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,358
 Pretty ridiculous.             
                      Yes.      

574
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
Just keep talking. I'm gonna    
just keep eating these.         

575
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:32,630
      One of the best "Triple D"
          experiences I've had. 

576
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,632
            And I've seen a lot.

577
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,334
                     Okay?      
                  There we go.  
      Thanks, man.              

578
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:42,773
          So, that's it         
 for this Flavortown road trip, 

579
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:43,974
      but don't you worry.      

580
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,510
   There's plenty more joints   
     all over this country.     

581
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:47,912
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

582
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:51,215
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

583
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,786
