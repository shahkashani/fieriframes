      Sioux Falls, South Dakota,

26
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,657
             with my good friend
      and chef, Justin Warner...

27
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,527
        Listen, I got so excited
            that you were coming

00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:03,395
               to South Dakota

29
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,063
          I thought, "I've gotta
               get you exposed  

30

              I don't know why  
              it's named this,  

32
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,668
             because chislic has
          an arguable etymology,

33
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,936
         and might be Turkish --

34
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:13,071
              related slightly  
               to shish kebab.  

35
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,073
      So, generally, we think of
              meat on a stick,  

36
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,408

  You know, I love

    we skewered all chislic.

the skewering themselves

106
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:18,329
               that's gonna go  
         on top of our sandwich.

107
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,666
    Some shredded green cabbage,

        cheesy hot plate.       

655
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,009
         The first thing        
     you get is the cheese.     

656
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,344
    And then all of a sudden    
        you start feeling       

657
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:14,945
 a little tingle on your tongue,

658
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,614
    and then your whole mouth   
          goes, "Wow."          

659
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,949
  You take a bite of cornbread. 
        It's like a cake.       

660
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,085
      Fried chicken breast      
        with a meatloaf.        

661
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,087
   There's nothing that holds   
     a candle to this place.    

662
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,890
    It's just love and soul.    

663
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,825
Don't come in here with         
any preconceived idea           

664
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:28,892
of what you're gonna get.       

665
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:29,961
I've only had two dishes        

666
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:31,962
and I've been surprised         
  at both of them.              

667
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,497
 I can only imagine             
what the rest of the menu is.   

668
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:34,898
Nicely done, Chef.              
                      Thank you.

669
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,501
You're gonna love it.           

670
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,904
 Well, that's it for this trip, 
   folks, but don't you worry.  

671
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,039
      There's funky joints      
     all over this country,     

672
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,841
       and I'll be looking      
     for you next time on...

 They don't consume             
   a lot of spice.              

676
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,250
      Why are you speaking      
            so loud?            

677
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,852
 I can't hear, Guy.
