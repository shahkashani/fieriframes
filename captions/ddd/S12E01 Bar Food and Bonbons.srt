       I ROLL INTO TOWN,        

184
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,469
     I LEARN SOMETHING NEW.     

185
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,403
          SO HERE I AM          
      IN ASTORIA, QUEENS,       

186
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:22,740
 WHERE THEY HAVE GOT THE OLDEST 
    BEER GARDEN IN THE CITY.    

187
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,943
        BUT--BUT THEY--         
        BUT I KNEW THAT.        

188
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,012
       WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW       
IS THAT RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET,

189
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:29,014
THEY'VE GOT A FUNKY LITTLE JOINT
       THAT'S SERVING UP        

190
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,815
    SOME RIGHTEOUS BAR FOOD.    

191
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,951
 WELCOME TO THE SPARROW TAVERN.

00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,888
(woman) LAMB RIBS               
 WITH TZATZIKI.                 
         THE SPARROW IS KIND OF 
       A ROCK 'N' ROLL DIVE BAR.

193
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,224
      THE FOOD COMPLETELY       
       CONTRADICTS THAT.        
                   IT'S SO GOOD.

194
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,829
           SLOPPY PORK SANDWICH.
    THE SLOPPY PORK SANDWICH    
       IS FULL OF FLAVOR.       

195
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:46,565
        GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH.
       PROBABLY THE BEST        
         GRILLED CHEESE         

196
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,433
        THAT YOU CAN GET        
       IN NEW YORK CITY.        
        GRILLED CORN ON THE COB.

197
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:51,102
  THEY PUT THE CHEESE ON TOP.   
 IT TASTES REALLY, REALLY GOOD. 

198
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,505
              BABY MIXED GREENS 
             WITH A SKIRT STEAK.
 YOU CAN'T GET THIS, YOU KNOW,  
       AT ANY RESTAURANT.       

199
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:56,308
          WE STARTED OUT JUST   
       AS A DIVE BAR, BASICALLY.

00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,592
      THE BIFTEKI BURGER--      
      EXTREMELY FLAVORFUL.      

206
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,262

00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,065
 IT DOESN'T TASTE ANYTHING LIKE 
  YOUR GENERIC VEGGIE BURGER.   

209
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,734
         IT'S SOMETHING         
    JUST ENTIRELY DIFFERENT.

       JUST A SLIGHT BIT CHUNKY.

364
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,531
 YOU WANT TO KNOW IT'S BLUE     
CHEESE AND NOT JUST SCHMEAR.    
                   YES, EXACTLY.

365
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,733
          WE HAVE WHIPPED CREAM.
CREAM THAT WE'VE                
ACTUALLY WHIPPED?               

366
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:32,203
       THIS IS THE REAL DEAL.   
   AGAIN, EVERYTHING'S HOMEMADE.

367
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,405
    SO THIS GETS FOLDED.        
IT'S A NICE AND LIGHT MOUSSE,   

368
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,407
       BUT HEAVY FLAVOR         
GOING WITH THE SHREDDED BEEF... 
                   THAT'S RIGHT.

369
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,942
AND THE ONION JAM.              
                         MM-HMM.

370
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:41,012
         WE USE CHUCK, TRIM SOME
          OF THE EXTRA FAT OFF. 

371
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:44,215
                SLICE IT ABOUT 2
                  OR 3 INCHES.  
(imitates knife squeaking)      

372
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,150
                           OKAY.
NOW ARE WE GONNA                
  SEASON THIS?                  

373
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:47,484
                OLIVE OIL, SALT,
                   AND PEPPER.  
OAKY.                           

374
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,287
                 NOW WE'RE GOING
                   TO SEAR IT.  
OH, LOOK AT THAT.               

375
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,088
         MM-HMM, PRETTY, HUH?   
      FIVE MINUTES ON THIS SIDE,

376
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,291
       ALL NICE AND CARAMELIZED.
  WE'LL SEAR IT                 
ON THE OTHER SIDE.              

377
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,625
        RED WINE AND BEEF BROTH.

378
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,761
              PUT THE LID ON IT 
            SO WE CAN BRAISE IT.

379
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,831
GONNA GO IN THE OVEN?           
      THREE HOURS. ARE YOU READY
        TO MAKE SOME ONION JAM? 

380
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,233
   ♪ ONION JAM ♪                
HOW DO YOU MAKE IT?             

381
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,202
       OLIVE OIL, YELLOW ONIONS,
            AND RED ONIONS.     

382
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:06,637
 A LITTLE BIT OF SALT           
TO HELP 'EM CARAMELIZE.         
                     AND PEPPER.

383
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,641
YO, GO AFTER IT.                
     IT TAKES ABOUT HALF AN HOUR
       FOR THESE TO COOK DOWN.  

384
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:12,910
          SO THE ONIONS ARE NICE
             AND CARAMELIZED.   
YEAH, THEY ARE.                 

385
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,846
       AND THEN WE'RE GONNA ADD 
     RED WINE, BALSAMIC VINEGAR,

386
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:19,116
       CRUSHED THYME, AND SUGAR.
    THIS IS GONNA               
CONTINUE TO COOK DOWN,          

387
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,319
AND THIS IS GOING ON THAT       
 SHREDDED BEEF SANDWICH.        
                           YEAH.

388
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,187
   AND HERE'S THE ALREADY-COOKED
          MEAT COMING OUT.      

389
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,590
OKAY, SO THE MEAT ISN'T         
 COMPLETELY SHREDDED.           

390
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:29,126
IT'S KIND OF LIKE               
 CHUNK-A-SHRED.                 
     YEAH. AND THEN THIS IS     
THE BROTH THAT IT WAS COOKED IN.

391
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,396
                  WE HAVE IT    
             IN A FAT SEPARATOR.
THOSE LITTLE THINGS             
    WORK COOL.                  

392
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:34,065
                      I LOVE IT.
     HEAT IT UP WITH JUST       
A LITTLE BIT OF ITS OWN BROTH.  

393
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:38,002
   YEP. BAGUETTE WRAPPED IN FOIL

               IN THE OVEN.     

439
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,376
            THE SAUCE THAT GOES 
           ON TOP OF THE CHICKEN

440
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,412

             IT'S TOMATO-BASED, 
           SORT OF MARINARA-ISH.
TASTY?

00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,192
         NOW WE'RE JUST GONNA   
      LET IT COOK DOWN A LITTLE.

448
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,729
                TAKE THE CHICKEN
                OUT OF THE OVEN.

450
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,799
               A LITTLE PARSLEY.
  THE RAGOUT                    
SMELLS AWESOME.                 

451
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,868

LEAKS OUT OF THE TOMATO,        

506
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,901
BUT IT'S ENCASED                
  IN THE PORK,                  

507
