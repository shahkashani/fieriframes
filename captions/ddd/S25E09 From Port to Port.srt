1
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:03,468
           Hey, there.          
         I'm Guy Fieri,         

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,469
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,204
      looking for America's     
        greatest diners,        

4
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,740
      drive-ins, and dives.     
          This trip...          

5
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:08,941
                 Here we go.    

6
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:11,009
      ...we're going coast      
     to coast, port to port.    

7
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,277
Make it happen, baby.           

8
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,945
     In Portland, Oregon...     

9
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:14,880
                 Holy moly!     

10
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:16,147
   ...a neighborhood market...  

11
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,149
  This is a haven.              

12
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:19,350
        ...getting comfy        
    with the family cookbook.   

13
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,753
               Grandma Holly,   
           you taught him right.

14
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,688
       Plus, a straight-up      
         Spanish spot...        

15
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,290
It's a whole symphony           
     of flavor.                 

16
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:27,559
...making tapas a true art form.

17
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:28,961
   One of the most              
  beautiful dishes              

18
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:30,362
   I've ever seen               
   on "Triple D."               

19
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,031
       And in Portsmouth,       
        New Hampshire...        

20
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,499
      Drop it like it's...      
            -...hot.            

21
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:34,766
              GUY:              
  ...I'm teaming up with Hunter 

22
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,102
       for a pork platter       
         like no other.         

23
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,570
It's not a bad thing.           

24
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:39,971
     It's a fantastic thing.    

25
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,906
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

26
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,743
 on "Diners, Drive-ins & Dives."

27
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,724
  So, we're here in Portsmouth, 
         New Hampshire.         

28
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,926
      And I finally get to drive
             the "Triple D" car.

29
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,794
          So, I figured         
       why not take Hunter      

30
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,596
      to get some real-deal     
          Mexican food          

31
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:05,798
     here on the east coast.    

32
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,532
    Mexican food?               
     East coast?                

33
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,468
       Listen, the dude's       
    from southern California.   

34
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,735
   Oh, so he's got              
    to be legit.                

35
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,205
      This is Vida Cantina.     

36
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,676
        WOMAN: Blue-corn        
       fried shrimp tacos.      

37
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,611
  You can't find better Mexican 
    in New England, anywhere.   

38
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:21,279
       -Chicken enchilada.      
      -I can definitely see     

39
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,747
          the heritage          
   coming though on the table.  

40
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,816
  You feel like you're getting  
  a unique Mexican experience.  

41
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,553
   GUY: And owner David Vargas  
  has a good base to build from 

42
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:29,821
     'cause his parents ran     
      a Mexican restaurant      

43
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,756
        when he was a kid       
        in Orange County.       

44
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,626
I grew up eating the traditional
American/Mexican foods.         

45
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,161
There's no disrespect           
    against that,               

46
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:38,163
but there's something           
more traditional that           

47
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,565
  we want to bring              
    to the table.               

48
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:42,634
       So, he took many of      
     his old family recipes     

49
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:45,570
        and amped them up       
 when he started his own joint. 

50
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,973
        -Carnitas tacos.        
       -I love the tacos.       

51
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,708
  I've tried them all, and you  
can't go wrong with any of them.

52
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,310
        Pork belly tacos        
         in the window.         

53
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:53,245
              We do pork belly  
             all the time here. 

54
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:56,247
  It's pretty much a big piece  
      of bacon on the taco.     

55
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,783
            So, Dave,           
      give us a breakdown.      

56
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:00,119
We're gonna make the nixtamal   
for our homemade tortillas.     

57
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:01,786
    We start with               
  some Indian corn              

58
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,188
  that we get from              
 a local farm here.             

59
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,923
 -You know what the nixtamal is?
         -I do not know.        

60
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,959
        What is nixtamal?       
 -So, we're gonna use some lye. 

61
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,928
   -Little calcium hydroxide.   
        -And some water.        

62
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,197
   And let it cook              
for about 45 minutes.           

63
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,533
       And it's gonna eat       
    the skin off of the corn.   

64
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,267
      We'll let it cool...      
           -Overnight.          

65
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,203
  We rinse it a bunch of times, 
   so now you just really get   

66
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,938
     the flesh of the inside    
          of the corn.          

67
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,140
  Then, take it to the grinder. 
          -Pretty cool.         

68
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,276
            I've never seen that
               like that. Wow.  

69
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:25,944
   So, from here,               
    we add in...                

70
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,412
 A little processed masa flour. 

71
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:28,480
       Mm-hmm.                  

72
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,548
   We're gonna add              
 a little warm water            

73
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,949
   with shortening              
   and salt in it.              

74
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,417
  You have to do it             
   while it's hot.              

75
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,019
               You to drop it   
             like it's hot, too.

76
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,688
   Yeah. Drop it like it's...   
            -...hot.            

77
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,090
      -Drop it like it's...     
            -...hot.            

78
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,558
              All right, Chef.  
                What's next?    

79
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,093
   Our pork belly.              

80
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,295
   We basically do              
 an eight-day cure.             

81
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,831
We start off -- black pepper.   
   Crushed garlic.              

82
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,233
   What we like to              
 call "boom" spice.             

83
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:49,501
   It's our secret              
     spice here.                

84
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,303
              Salt.             
   -Fresh bay leaves in there.  

85
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,371
     Pink salt.                 
       Thyme.                   

86
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,840
             -Time.             
            -Th-yme.            

87
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,175
                     Oh.        

88
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,576
  And then epazote.             

89
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,445
   -You know what epazote is?   
 -No. I mean, I've heard of it. 

90
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,181
    In real cultural Mexican    
           cooking...           

91
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:04,783
It's a very predominant         
    Mexican herb.               

92
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,184
And then maple syrup.           

93
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,120
   So that's almost gonna work  
    as your paste, your glue.   

94
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:09,388
            -Exactly.           
           -I like it.          

95
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,655
  Just rub it down.             

96
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:11,924
        Then after it's done...?

97
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:13,859
    We let it sit               
for eight days, rinse it,       

98
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,928
   and then put it              
  in its own lard.              

99
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,064
    Cook it for eight hours.    
            -Dig it.            

100
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,466
                    Wow,        
             that looks awesome.

101
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:22,801
  We have to let it             
      solidify,                 

102
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,938
so we put a couple pieces       
of parchment, some weight.      

103
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,739
      So, that's just gonna     
     sit there and press it     

104
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,408
     right into its own fat.    
            -Exactly.           

105
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,143
         How long's it gonna sit
             in the walk-in for?

106
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:32,677
We like to go overnight.        

107
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,612
           So, this is all cool.
          Now what are we doing?

108
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,281
  We have our masa              
  that's finished.              

109
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:39,951
      How much do you use?      
         Masa or lessa?         

110
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,821
   -We'll go onto our flattop.  
          -Nicely done.         

111
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,090
Then we'll take our pork belly, 
cut it down right here.         

112
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,025
        Almost like big,        
        fat bacon slices.       

113
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,893
 -And then we'll just cut them. 
           -Gorgeous.           

114
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,895
        So, we're just gonna put
    a little crisp on it, right?

115
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,231
Yeah, nice carmelization        

116
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,299
    on both sides               
to kind of add some texture.    

117
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:55,700
               Some more love.  

118
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,902
We'll grab our tortillas,       
   and you can see              

119
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,373
they're starting to do its      
ever-so-popular puff on it.     

120
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,709
We have a little bit of what    
we call jicama slaw.            

121
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:06,311
 Put our pork belly             
    right on top.               

122
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:09,114
              -Ahh.             
     -Mango habanero salsa.     

123
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,248
   Cotija cheese,               

124
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,784
which I call the Mexican        
version of Parmesan.            

125
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,720
 And then everything            
  this time of year             

126
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:16,054
    gets flowers                
    on top of it.               

127
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,522
            -Flowers?           
          -Everything.          

128
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:18,857
            -Got it.            
            -Awesome.           

129
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,058
        All right, ready?       

130
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,528
       You want to go arm around
            when you do it or...

131
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,729
                    Wait.       
                I'm confused.   

132
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,398
I fed you enough when           
you were a little kid.          

133
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,534
          There you go.         

134
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,002
              That is awesome.  

135
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,206
             The fresh tortilla 
              totally makes it. 

136
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,473
              I love the slaw.  

137
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,143
          That pork belly's just
          cooked perfectly, too.

138
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,811
     Yeah, I could eat that     
            all day.            

139
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,946
 So, the tortilla --            
you can taste that nixtamal.    

140
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,548
    You can taste               
  how fresh it is.              

141
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,216
  There's fantastic             
   texture in it.               

142
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,152
The cotija, I like that         
  little saltiness.             

143
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,755
 The pork is really             
the note that sings,            

144
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:51,823
and you do it in such           
a nice, fat slab that           

145
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,759
you're really getting           
some meaty texture in it.       

146
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,761
   If you told me               
 I was getting this             

147
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,429
  at a contemporary             
 Mexican restaurant             

148
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:58,963
    in San Diego,               
I would believe you.            

149
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,899
     Fantastic.                 
        Mmm!                    

150
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,101
    WOMAN: Pork belly tacos.    

151
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,303
         The pork belly         
   is real thick, real juicy.   

152
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,906
  The mango sauce is awesome -- 
  a little hot, a little sweet. 

153
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,042
       The corn tortilla's      
 really fresh, delicious flavor.

154
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:11,443
              Bone marrow steak 
               in the window.   

155
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,712
This place goes above and beyond
    what you would think of.    

156
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,580
  MAN: This actually used to be 
     an old fast-food joint,    

157
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:18,250
and when people walk in, they're
  amazed at the transformation. 

158
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:21,853
     It's bright, colorful.     
It's got this good energy to it.

159
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:25,323
When they have koozies          
for your canned Mexican beer,   

160
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,993
you know that there's a slight  
party attitude around here.     

161
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,796
      They have things that     
  I've never even experienced,  

162
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:32,196
   especially the pig's head.   

163
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,198
We put the head on a platter,   
and we serve it just like that, 

164
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,734
and people build their own tacos
      that way.                 

165
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,403
     That's awesome. We got     
   to get a pig head platter.   

166
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,038
           -Go at it.           
       -When we come back.      

167
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,348
    Welcome back.               
     "Triple D."                

168
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,883
Hunter is leading the show      

169
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,419
on the Hunter and Guy           
"Triple D" experience.          

170
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:55,686
We're at Vida Cantina.          

171
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,089
   Chef David here              
in Portsmouth, New Hampshire,   

172
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,024
is bringing real-deal           
    Mexican food                

173
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,292
    to the folks                
  of the northeast.             

174
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,162
        Fire -- table 31.       
     Two fried shrimp tacos.    

175
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:06,764
 You can't get anything like it 
     anywhere else in town.     

176
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,433
              I'm so intrigued  
                by the menu.    

177
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:09,835
        Pig head platter        
         in the window.         

178
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,169
              MAN:              
  It's literally a pig's head,  

179
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,771
     homemade corn tortillas    
          on the side.          

180
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,839
  WOMAN: It's kind of like have 
       a pulled pork taco,      

181
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,309
   but it's more experiential.  

182
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:18,510
           Let me just          
       get this straight.       

183
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:22,513
       We're talking full       
     split-in-half pig head.    

184
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,714
        Yeah.                   

185
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,984
     Where's Andrew Zimmern     
       when you need him?       

186
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,118
             Hit it!            

187
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,453
  All right, we're              
 gonna make a brine.            

188
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:31,122
Some water, sugar, salt.        

189
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,792
     -A little curing salt.     
  -And a little bit of garlic.  

190
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,059
  And then, once it             
  comes to a boil,              

191
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,329
   we put it into the walk-in.  
        -Cool this down.        

192
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:39,597
Take the brine and pour it      
 right on the head.             

193
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,865
                   You got      
          to clean him up there.

194
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,767
         So, he's gonna         
     sit there and brine...     

195
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,603
       -For a couple days.      
       -Then what's next?       

196
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:45,937
 We'll take it out,             
  give it a rinse,              

197
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,205
   and let it cook              
     in its fat.                

198
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,740
   Basically, confit the head.  

199
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,142
Exactly, eight hours.           

200
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,677
             -Dude.             
       -Then it comes out.      

201
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,146
We let it cool slightly,        
rub it with our salsa verde.    

202
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,083
It's grilled tomatillos,        
 poblanos, serrano,             

203
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,084
      cilantro,                 
 onion, and garlic.             

204
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,554
And then, we fire it off        
in a 500-degree oven,           

205
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:05,423
uncovered so it blisters        
the skin, for about 20 minutes. 

206
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,492
     So, you're gonna get it    
  the chicharrones of the skin, 

207
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:11,329
   and then everything inside   
      is just cooked down.      

208
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,630
   -Bring it onto the platter.  
            -Oh, wow.           

209
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,499
          Look at that.         

210
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:15,767
   We'll serve it               
   with cilantro,               

211
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,037
    onions, lime,               
our house-made salsa fresco,    

212
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,106
    salsa verde,                
 and mango habanero.            

213
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,308
     And then, of course...     
            -Flowers.           

214
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,176
   And a stack of               
our house-made tortillas.       

215
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,447
      And then,                 
 you just go at it.             

216
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,248
      -Where do you start?      
        -You just dig in.       

217
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,116
       -Oh, look at that.       
      -I'm getting in this.     

218
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,852
          Look at that.         
      Right into that jowl.     

219
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:36,588
   -It just pulls apart, huh?   
         -Look at that.         

220
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,457
    So, you grab a tortilla.    
            -Oh, man.           

221
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,794
    That's about as real-deal   
    as it gets, right there.    

222
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,729
            -Mm-hmm.            
     -It's not a bad thing.     

223
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,131
     It's a fantastic thing.    

224
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,065
      I know it's got to be     
   a little unique for people   

225
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,068
      to have this culinary     
           experience,          

226
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,603
     but the truth of it is,    

227
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:54,605
           the flavor           
     when you got the skin,     

228
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,542
  the bone, the fat, the brine, 

229
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,211
  and the roast with that salsa 
    verde over the top of it,   

230
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,080
   I mean, that's ridiculous.   
        -So much flavor.        

231
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:05,816
That's one of the most beautiful
  presentations of roasted pork 

232
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,085
         I've ever seen.        
      -Thank you very much.     

233
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,220
              That one for me?  

234
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,289
                 Thank you.     
             Appreciate it, Dad.

235
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,490
        Even when they're       
        taller than you,        

236
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,792
 you still end up feeding them. 

237
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,095
             WOMAN: Here we go. 

238
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,431
      The best pulled pork      
        you're gonna get.       

239
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:20,765
        So succulent when       
        you bite into it.       

240
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:21,967
   It's an awesome experience.  

241
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,768
             Runner on table 42,
                   please.      

242
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,239
 What you've done is transformed
  a small area of New Hampshire 

243
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,908
  into little cultural Mexico.  

244
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,577
         -It's awesome.         
           -Thank you.          

245
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:33,912
        -Nice job, Chef.        
           -Thank you.          

246
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,314
     I got to head over here    
       and try some more.       

247
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,117
                    Wow.        

248
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,922
     FIERI: Coming up, we're    
      crossing the country      

249
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,657
     to Portland, Oregon...     
              -Wow!             

250
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,525
  ...to a market/restaurant...  

251
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,793
               That is crazy.   

252
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,529
    ...dishing out something    
  I've never quite seen before. 

253
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,731
               This is getting  
              weirder as we go. 

254
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,336
   I used to use a nixtamatic   
   to put you to bed at night.  

255
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,838
                     Me?        

256
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,741
 I would run that in your room, 
     and it was so soothing.    

257
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,113
 I'm here on the northeast side 
      of Portland, Oregon,      

258
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:10,181
  in an area known as Woodlawn, 
       and you'd love it.       

259
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,517
 There's a total community feel,
     a lot of family homes.     

260
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,186
        So, on the corner       
       of Dekum and 13th,       

261
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,254
      you'll find a market      
   that's supporting all that.  

262
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:21,326
    This is P's & Q's Market.   

263
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,794
            MAN: Basic breakfast
                 with eggs.     

264
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,662
       WOMAN: There are 96      
   neighborhoods in Portland,   

265
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,664
         and 95 of those        
    neighborhoods are jealous   

266
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,199
         that they don't        
         have P's & Q's.        

267
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,735
  From the moment I stepped in, 
 I fell in love with this place.

268
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,070
                    BLT.        

269
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,071
GUY: Is it a grocery store?     
   Is it a market?              

270
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,808
 Is it a restaurant?            
Is it a shoe-repair place?      

271
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,743
              It's everything.  
        It's a community center,

272
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,812
            just bringing people
          together through food.

273
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,448
I feel like he's gonna          
break into song with a guitar,  

274
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,484
and he's gonna sing me          
a '60s love album or something. 

275
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,353
    GUY: And when Paul Davis    
       and Emily Anderson       

276
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,487
       opened this place,       

277
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,288
          they added to         
       the small-town vibe      

278
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,224
 with recipes from their roots. 

279
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,559
  I'm from northern California. 

280
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:57,495
    I'm really into seasonal    
         fresh produce.         

281
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,864
     -I'm from Kansas City.     
    -What kind of food is it?   

282
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,298
                It's definite   
                comfort food.   

283
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,635
                  Biscuits      
              and tomato gravy. 

284
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:04,902
    [ Whistles ]                
Tomato gravy, seriously?        

285
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,504
                 Yeah, it's     
            my grandma's recipe.

286
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:08,072
                 She's from     
               West Virginia.   

287
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,173
Oh, this I got to see.          

288
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,508
             WOMAN:             
 Here's the biscuits and gravy. 

289
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,643
    The tomato gravy is heads   
       and shoulders above      

290
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,245
     any other gravy I know.    

291
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:17,448
         And the biscuit        
      from here is amazing.     

292
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,583
               GUY: All right,  
             what are we making?

293
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:19,584
 We're starting off             
   with biscuits.               

294
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,186
    I'm gonna mix               
the dry ingredients,            

295
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:22,787
starting with flour.            

296
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,121
    Add the salt.               

297
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,458
  Cream of tartar.              
  And baking soda.              

298
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,727
And last, chilled butter.       
I'm gonna dump this out.        

299
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,330
 Now we're gonna add            
our buttermilk and cream.       

300
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,065
            I like the crockware
                  and all.      

301
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,067
 Now I'm gonna fold             
     these over.                

302
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,535
               Mess with them   
          as little as possible.

303
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,270
 Now I'm gonna start            
   rolling it out.              

304
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,139
          Right now, on 1 to 10,
               are we excited?  

305
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,273
              Or are we mellow? 

306
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,742
    Even keel --                
 that's how I roll.             

307
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,210
              You always run it 
                 at a five?     

308
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:47,145
                Does anything   
              get you rattled?  

309
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,947
      What happens when somebody

310
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,950
            doesn't deliver your
          produce order on time?

311
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:52,951
        What does it sound like?

312
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,620
Could you be on time            
 next time, please?             

313
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:58,222
    No, it's okay. It's okay.   
    -"It's okay, it's okay."    

314
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,623
             All these are gonna
          bake off at what temp?

315
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,159
              -350.             
         -350, how long?        

316
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,027
          -30 minutes.          
   -And that's all she wrote.   

317
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:06,164
So, this is Grandma Holly's     
    tomato gravy.               

318
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,498
       Is she cool with the fact

319
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,300
         that you're selling off
         the great gravy recipe?

320
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,970
  Yeah, she wanted              
to tell you, "Hello."           

321
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:13,638
She watches your show           
    all the time.               

322
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,972
                Hi, Grandma.    
            How you doing? Okay.

323
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,374
             So, we're starting 
                 off with...    

324
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,910
   -Bacon fat and the butter.   
  -I don't think in my history, 

325
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,645
               I've ever heard  
             of a tomato gravy. 

326
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,179
   It's like this               
 Appalachian thing.             

327
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,514
        Then                    
 we go to tomatoes.             

328
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,183
 -Just regular crushed tomatoes?
              -Yep.             

329
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,118
 Son, we're making tomato sauce,
          is what it looks like.

330
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,252
         No.                    
     No, no, no.                

331
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,055
              I have seen some  
          weird stuff in my day.

332
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:31,389
                   This is      
              taking the cake.  

333
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:34,091
  We're just gonna              
let this simmer for two hours.  

334
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,193
It's reduced by half.           

335
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,061
   I'm gonna pour               
in my evaporated milk.          

336
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,396
         Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

337
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,664
         You didn't say anything
          about evaporated milk.

338
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,798
   That's going in here, too?   
     -Yeah, evaporated milk.    

339
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,533
               This is getting  
              weirder as we go. 

340
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,469
 Then, my whole milk            
that I'll mix with flour.       

341
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,671
    Both of them                
 have been heated up            

342
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,407
to change the protein           
so that it doesn't break.       

343
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,475
                    Wow.        

344
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:51,675
      Gonna add                 
  salt and pepper,              

345
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,878
    and we're ready to plate.   
          -Here we go.          

346
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,747
  It's a good-looking biscuit.  
           -Thank you.          

347
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,148
                It looks like   
             chunky tomato soup.

348
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,751
  Just a sprinkling             
of parsley for some green.      

349
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:01,419
                And a little    
              chopped-up bacon. 
  Yeah.                         

350
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,422
           It's really dynamite.
     It's a really good biscuit.

351
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,759
         It has that velvetiness
         that a tomato soup has.

352
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:10,027
           It's nice and mellow.
            It's a little sweet.

353
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,498
               I do appreciate  
     the bacon crackling on top.

354
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,166
            Yeah, I can get down
         with this all day long.

355
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,969
          In the world of weird,
      you're running an 8.5 now.

356
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,171
         -It's up there.        
        -Grandma Holly...       

357
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,639
              top notch, girl.  
           You taught him right.

358
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,908
  Biscuits and tomato gravy up. 

359
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,709
   Biscuits are really light,   
         but the outside        

360
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,645
  still has some texture to it. 

361
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,180
      Biscuits                  
with tomato gravy --            

362
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,314
    ever heard of               
 anything like that?            

363
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,049
               No, I haven't.   
         It's fantastic, though.

364
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,184
    It's killer.                

365
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,786
      WOMAN: When you come      
      to P's & Q's Market,      

366
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:36,854
     you're not just getting    
       a food experience,       

367
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,590
       but you're getting       
    a full market experience.   

368
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:39,991
   That was very intentional.   

369
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:43,594
 I wanted to bring part of that 
 feeling from my hometown here. 

370
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,997
 And also, we live a block away,
       so we really wanted      

371
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,599
     to have a little market    
      in our neighborhood.      

372
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,867
       You can buy toilet paper,
               ketchup, beer.   

373
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,069
    Toilet paper,               
 ketchup are usually            

374
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,604
     on the top                 
  of my list, also.             

375
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,139
              Great sandwiches, 
                  you know?     

376
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:55,873
             This is            
      the polenta sandwich.     

377
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,341
            WOMAN #2:           
I'm having the polenta sandwich.

378
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,877
 It's, like, totally beautiful. 

379
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,678
     MAN: This polenta makes    
         its own rules.         

380
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,680
     It's ridiculously good.    

381
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,282
               So, we're gonna  
             make creamy polenta

382
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,617
       for the polenta sandwich.

383
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,151
        Yep.                    
We got some boiling water       

384
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,420
that I'm gonna whisk            
  my polenta into.              

385
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:12,022
Now we're gonna let this        
simmer for 30 minutes.          

386
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,757
                Okay, buddy.    
             That thickened up. 

387
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,026
  Now I'm gonna add             
my butter, Parmesan.            

388
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,096
                 Holy moly!     

389
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,497
                Oh, eee, oh.    

390
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,499
    Cream, salt.                

391
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,500
We're ready to pour it          
     in the pan.                

392
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,702
            You happy with that?

393
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,237
Now we're gonna throw this      
   in the walk-in.              

394
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,504
   This will cool,              
      and then,                 

395
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,974
we'll cut a square out of it,   
   we'll fry that.              

396
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,376
              Oh, I like that.  
               Okay, brother.   

397
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,244
We're gonna assemble            
the fried polenta sandwich.     

398
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:36,313
Flame-roasted poblanos          
down on the bottom bun.         

399
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,982
            Big old fried square
                 of polenta.    

400
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,851
Pickled red onions after that.  
      Arugula.                  

401
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,386
   And the top bun              
  with mayonnaise.              

402
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,589
   -And that's all she wrote.   
     -That's all she wrote.     

403
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,526
                    Wow.        
              It's really good. 

404
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,795
               That polenta --  
          that's actually great.

405
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:53,197
  The baby Arugula is phenomenal
             right inside of it.

406
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,799
             Of course, the acid
               coming through   

407
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,867
             from this red onion
                 is spot on.    

408
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,070
                    Mmm!        

409
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,538
               Parmesan cheese  
                 gone wild.     

410
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,540
          The pepper in there --
          that's the hidden gem.

411
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:06,210
          My little sister would
       have loved that sandwich.

412
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,678
     -I'm glad you like it.     
    -Nicely done, my friend.    

413
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,679
       Thanks.                  

414
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,614
               You got to come  
             try that sandwich. 

415
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:10,681
               That is crazy.   

416
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,017
     -Polenta with fries up.    
           -Thank you.          

417
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,886
          -No problem.          
       -It's super creamy.      

418
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,821
         It has a nice,         
      like, cheesy flavor,      

419
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,155
             which I don't know 
             how much cheese -- 

420
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,891
'Cause there's about 400        
pounds of Parmesan in it.       

421
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:22,560
 MAN: So many flavors going on, 
 you're trying to figure it out.

422
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:23,895
        It's impressive.        

423
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:27,164
   P's & Q's is what Portland   
     restaurants should be.     

424
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,566
   Really, really,              
really, really good.            

425
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,435
    -Was that four "reallys"?   
             -Yeah.             

426
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:32,903
     It's a four "really goods."
          What else do you want?

427
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,572
   MAN #2: This is where we'll  
        eat all the time,       

428
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,241
    and this is where we can    
       get our groceries.       

429
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:38,509
I mean, this is a haven.        
Good food by great people.      

430
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:41,379
        Congratulations.        
           -Thank you.          

431
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,180
   GUY: Up next, we're staying  
       put in Portland...       

432
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,115
        Whoa!                   

433
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,983
...to get a true taste of Spain.

434
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,252
  This right here,              
melts in your mouth.            

435
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:52,991
   You'd love it here. I mean,  
    great c-- Great, great...   

436
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:55,793
     great, great, great --     
  there's a lot of great here.  

437
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,398
           I'm here in          
   northwest Portland, Oregon,  

438
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,800
    in an area known as 23rd.   

439
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,535
        It's kind of like       
      the restaurant row --     

440
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:07,071
 to check out a joint that's got
  a little bit of a love story. 

441
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,139
      Let's see, she's born     
   and raised in Puerto Rico,   

442
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:12,543
   meets the guy in Barcelona,  
    Spain, they get married,    

443
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:15,079
   move to the United States,   
     come up to Portland...     

444
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,480
 well, and the rest is history. 

445
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,350
         This is Ataula.        

446
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,753
    Here we have the bravas.    

447
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:22,954
      The food is amazing.      

448
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,755
      It's the most unique      
       restaurant in town.      

449
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,557
 Going to table 45.             

450
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,427
     I mean, I'm from Spain,    
 and when I come here, I'm home.

451
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,896
     GUY: 'Cause this place     
       is all about home.       

452
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,032
         Chef Jose Chesa        
      grew up in Barcelona,     

453
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:37,434
       set out to serve up      
    a true Spanish experience   

454
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,104
    when he opened the place    
    with his wife, Cristina.    

455
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,106
How do you describe great       
Spanish food to people?         

456
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,508
         JOSE: Just pure flavor,

457
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,442
           cooking with the best
           possible ingredients.

458
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,112
  GUY: And of course, plenty of 
     tapas taken up a notch.    

459
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,914
         All the dishes         
      here invite sharing.      

460
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,382
        Okay,                   
I'm finishing carpaccio.        

461
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,785
   WOMAN: The pulpo carpaccio   
           is octopus           

462
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,252
    very, very thinly sliced.   

463
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,988
     I've never had anything    
  like this before in my life.  

464
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,390
 -It's like artwork on a plate. 
    -So, let's get into this.   

465
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,659
          JOSE: We'll always get
         the octopus from Spain.

466
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,594
            We have some onions,
             black peppercorns, 

467
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,329
   and we have the bay leaves.  
         -And that's it?        

468
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,731
           And then, it's really
  important you drop the octopus

469
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,401
          into the boiling water
              for three times.  

470
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:13,538
          Octopus take about 30,
                 35 minutes.    

471
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,538
              All the tentacles 
           are being pulled out.

472
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,674
Okay. And the sucker            
    cups go, too?               

473
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:17,808
                    Yeah.       

474
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,943
             So, now we're gonna
                add some agar   

475
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:21,012
           to the boiling liquid
              from the octopus. 

476
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:22,613
       -Thickening agent.       
             -Yeah.             

477
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,549
             -Okay.             
    -And then gelatin sheets.   

478
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:25,750
    You're gonna                
   melt those in.               

479
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,484
    And now we have the tourine.

480
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,420
                Okay, I grab    
         the thickest tentacles.

481
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,290
     So you have the first layer
      and repeat the same thing.

482
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:35,159
    -So, it's octopus Tetris.   
              -Yes.             

483
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,962
So, the goal is just to get it  
as tight as you can in there,   

484
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,764
      but also                  
let there be the agar           

485
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,699
   and the gelatin              
to bind it together.            

486
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,701
                Which it is.    
  You want to wrap up the sides,

487
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,369
            and we're gonna have
           a piece of cardboard.

488
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,638
Now, that seems pretty          
technical right there.          

489
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,040
               You stack them   
           on top of each other.

490
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:51,508
 -How long is this gonna set up?
    -Overnight in the cooler.   

491
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,178
        Okay.                   

492
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,847
  That's beautiful.             

493
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,182
              We're gonna start 
       with arbequina olive oil.

494
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,984
           Black olive tapenade.

495
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,785
             Sun-dried tomatoes.

496
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,387
    Dr. Tweezer.                
    Dr. Tweezer.                

497
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,622
That's gorgeous, dude.          
  I'm telling you.              

498
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,257
             Parmesan reggiano. 

499
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,926
             Toasted pine nuts. 
            Spanish hot paprika.

500
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,062
              And then we have  
            an olive oil caviar.

501
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:12,597
   Is it olive oil              
   or is it fish?               

502
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,799
             No, it's olive oil.
              Oregon sea salt.  

503
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,534
             Decorate with some 
               edible flowers.  

504
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,470
             And then we finish 
           with some pea shoots.

505
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:20,705
                 It's done.     

506
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,411
I don't think I've ever         
had octopus that tender.        

507
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,946
  This right here,              
melts in your mouth.            

508
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,481
It's a whole symphony           
     of flavors.                

509
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:31,482
          The pine nut.         
             -Yeah.             

510
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,017
   That nuttiness               
  of the Parmesan.              

511
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,152
   It's fantastic.              
   It's balanced.               

512
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,755
   It's creative.               
  Really dynamite.              

513
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,690
   One of the most              
  beautiful dishes              

514
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:40,958
   I've ever seen               
   on "Triple D."               

515
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,693
    Outstanding.                

516
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,162
      WOMAN: Jose's octopus     
      really compares well      

517
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,165
to the best places in Barcelona.

518
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,434
Every once in a while,          
we get the blast from the past, 

519
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,769
   like the famous              
   Chef Benny Lin               

520
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,638
from North Pole, Alaska.        

521
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,773
       What do you think?       
        -Oh, my goodness.       

522
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:59,777
               It's so tender   
        and has all the flavors.

523
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,178
                  Amazing.      

524
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,181
    Everything is beautifully   
prepared, beautifully presented.

525
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:05,983
      GUY: And meticulously     
 researched, 'cause every year, 

526
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:09,319
     Jose and Cristina head     
  back to Barcelona to sharpen  

527
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,588
      their culinary chops.     

528
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,989
     WOMAN: Keeping the food    
       and the atmosphere       

529
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,191
       authentic to Spain       
        is his main goal.       

530
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,726
   And Jose has brought a lot   

531
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:18,596
    of his childhood flavors    
         to this space.         

532
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,332
  GUY: Like a sandwich he says  
 he was obsessed with as a kid. 

533
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:22,867
  Pepita in the window, please. 

534
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,603
   This is melt in your mouth,  
       unbelievably good.       

535
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,938
      It's an other-worldly     
           experience.          

536
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,140
  All right, Chef.              
    What's next?                

537
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:31,809
               The veal stock   
               for the pepita.  

538
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,077
             We have a mirepoix.

539
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,612
     You've got                 
 your bouquet garni             

540
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,813
   with your sage,              
  rosemary, thyme.              

541
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,016
             Got it.            
  -We have veal knuckle bones.  

542
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,885
   -Smeared with tomato paste?  
             -Yeah.             

543
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,287
         Now we're gonna deglaze
               with red wine.   

544
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,421
           Now we got the water.

545
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,489
How long are we gonna           
let this simmer for?            

546
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,557
                 Overnight.     
             And that's gonna be

547
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,958
              the jus that goes 
             into the sandwich. 

548
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,960
All of this is just to make     
the stock that covers the veal. 

549
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,629
          -Absolutely.          
           -Very nice.          

550
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,097
              So, here we have  
              the veal breasts. 

551
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,299
    We're gonna season it first,
              salt and pepper.  

552
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,834
              And now you want  
        to sear off the breasts,

553
00:18:56,836 --> 00:19:00,037
            a nice golden color.

554
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:02,506
  And then, we have the mirepoix
         with the bouquet garni,

555
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,841
             tomato paste, veal,

556
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,310
             red wine, and then 
              we have the stock 

557
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,045
                that has been   
           already strained out.

558
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,247
We'll let that braise           
    for how long?               

559
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:12,583
                 Four hours.    
                450 degrees.    

560
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,919
          We remove the tendons,
               remove the fat,  

561
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:18,255
                  and we're     
        gonna build the tourine.

562
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:21,325
You and your cardboard          
 wrapped in plastic.            

563
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,660
          You stack them on top.
                 The weight.    

564
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,996
        Straight to the walk-in.

565
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:28,465
                  24 hours.     
            So, we need a torch.

566
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,134
        And then, voilà.        
   -Now we're speaking French.  

567
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,804
        Cut it in half, and then
          slice it into patties.

568
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,138
    Look at that.               

569
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,208
Looks like pulled pork.         
Little salt and pepper.         

570
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,676
               Now it's gonna   
       go straight on a plancha.

571
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,945
        Okay.                   
Make it happen, baby.           

572
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,147
          Here with the brioche.
             Horseradish cream. 

573
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:45,750
         Then, we have veal jus.
               Havarti cheese.  

574
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:46,817
                   Roasted      
             green bell pepper. 

575
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,019
                  Straight      
             to the salamander. 

576
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:51,222
             -Whoa!             
         -Coming in hot!        

577
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:53,357
        Place it into the board.

578
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,759
     Along with some hard chips,

579
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,894
              and here we have  
            the pepita sandwich.

580
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,633
That has the richness of,       
like, a prime rib sandwich.     

581
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:05,168
  Big, rich flavor              
coming from that jus.           

582
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,104
The creaminess of the cheese    
really comes through.           

583
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:08,305
   It's delicious.              

584
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,974
Actually, my favorite aspect    
 of the entire thing            

585
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,309
   is the roasted               
 green bell pepper,             

586
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,510
and I don't know why            
       'cause                   

587
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:14,245
   I'm not a huge               
green bell pepper fan.          

588
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,113
            So, that pepper goes
                into the oil    

589
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:18,115
           that's been sous-vide
               with aromatics.  

590
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,651
Okay, so it's not your average  
 green bell pepper.             

591
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,320
 It's great, buddy.             

592
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:25,923
     It's delicious. A great    
 combination of, like, flavors. 

593
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,992
   GUY: My buddy, country-singer
              James Otto here.  

594
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,393
      So, let's talk about this.

595
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,596
All I can say is that my mouth  
is really happy right now.      

596
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,864
     MAN: I haven't been to     
 Barcelona, but I'd love to go, 

597
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,465
      and this is as close      
          as I can get.         

598
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,402
    You love food               
  and what you do.              

599
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,004
   You can feel it              
when you walk into this place.  

600
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,806
I mean, it is evident.          
  Congratulations.              

601
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,808
                 Thank you.     

602
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,676
  So, that's it for this trip,  
        but don't worry.        

603
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:48,812
 There's plenty more "Triple D" 
  joints all over the country.  

604
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,280
         I'll be looking        
        for you next week       

605
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,349
 on "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

606
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,553
So, remember, one thing         
we tell you is you...           

607
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,622
         Do not peel an octopus.
