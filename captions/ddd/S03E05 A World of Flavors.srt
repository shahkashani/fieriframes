               POP IT OVER HERE 
                AND DROP IT IN.

           (Guy) AND WHO MADE UP
               THIS RECIPE?     
 (Eve) IT CAME FROM             
A CHINESE RESTAURANT.           

139
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,341
     I USED TO DO IT            
WITH CALAMARI AND SHRIMP.       

140
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,343
AND THE SERRANOS.               
                  SEEDS AND ALL?

141
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:46,411
THAT'S WHAT GIVES IT            
   THE REAL KICK--              

142
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,479
    THE REAL FLAVOR,            
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.        

143
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,682
SO THEN WE TAKE THE GARLIC, YOUR
   ONION AND YOUR GREEN ONION,  

144
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,216
AND THEN YOUR SERRANOS.         

145
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:54,152
I TONED IT DOWN                 
 A LITTLE BIT.                  
       YOU HAD TO GRINGO-IZE IT.

146
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,087
 FOR THE GRINGOS.               
CRUSHED RED PEPPER.             

147
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,756
GARLIC SALT. THIS SITS          
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS,           

148
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,758
AND THEN WE COMBINE IT          
   WITH THE CHICKEN.            

149
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,628
(Guy) HOT WOK?                  
                  (Eve) HOT WOK.

150
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,564
              FOOD WON'T STICK. 
            YOU'RE GONNA FRY IT.

151
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,167
         PUT THE GREEN ONION IN.
DIDN'T EXPECT THIS ON           
  "DINERS," DID YA?             

152
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,703
     LITTLE TOUCH OF GARLIC SALT
          AT THE VERY END.      

153
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,838
        BRINGS THAT FLAVOR OUT. 

154
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,640
MMM. WOW.

156
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,644
THE CRUNCH IS FANTASTIC.        

157

159
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,784
   I MEAN, THAT'S               
JUST MASSIVE FLAVOR.            

160
