00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,669
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:05,937
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,406
          This trip...          

4
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:09,207
  Oh, my gosh, man.             
   This is crazy.               

5
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,943
       ...we're traveling       
         the country...         
       This is gonna be awesome.

6
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,212
   ...looking for a true taste  
          of the world.         

7
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,615
I don't know that I'm gonna     
be able to eat all of it,       
but I'll sure try.              

8
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:19,017
     In Cincinnati, Ohio...     
You're an amazing cat.          

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,953
    ...the Jamaican joint...    
     Yeah, mon.                 

10
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:22,220
    ...turning up the heat...   

11
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,288
                 You sweating?  
      Oh, yeah.                 

12
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,824
      ...on some real-deal      
          island eats.          

13
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:27,426
It's like an offering           
    to the gods.                

14
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:28,293
                 All right.     

15
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,694
     In Duluth, Minnesota...    

16
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,830
                 My new job.    
   ...the corner Thai spot...   

17
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,432
                   This is      
             the American dream.

18
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:35,834
  ...putting full-on flavor...  
                 Delicious.     

19
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,569
    ...right in their fusion.   

20
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,504
             Look at how pretty 
                  that is.      

21
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,906
 And in Boston, Massachusetts...
That's a nice dough.            

22
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,043
      ...we're jumping off      
      at Italian central...     

23
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:46,178
   If you don't eat that, you're
     out at the next stop, bro. 

24
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,580
   ...where the whole family's  
       along for the ride.      

25
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:49,782
                 Chew, chew.

          [ Laughter ]          

27
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:53,185
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

28
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:55,053
         on "Triple D."         

31
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:07,932
 So, I'm here on Water Street --

32
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,401
         or around here,        
       they say "watah" --      

33
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,269
  because I'm in the financial  
       district of Boston,      

34
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,005
    and I'm here to check out   
       what may look like       

35
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:15,006
          your average,         
      everyday pizza joint.     

36
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,342
      But from what I hear,     
       behind these walls       

37
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:18,410
      is real-deal Italian.

40
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:25,817
      MAN: It's a surprise.     

41
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,952
   It almost looks like a deli  
        from the outside.       

42
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:29,687
      Bistecca.                 

43
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,156
   We may as well be in Italy.  

44
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:32,958
       WOMAN: When you see      
    these beautiful pictures,   

45
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,294
      it really just feels      
        authentic to me.

47
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,865
      FIERI: That's because     
       when Denise Santini      

48
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,834
      and Giancarlo Baldini     
         opened in 2010,        

49
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,237
     they made it all about     
     their Italian family.      

50
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,371
                  You marry     
              an Italian guy... 

51
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:47,772
       I did.                   
          ...you bring him back,

52
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,842
              you get connected 
       with your cousin Bobby...
        Yeah.                   

53
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:51,310
            ...and you guys open
                 this joint.    

54
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:52,310
     Absolutely.                

55
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,978
        And while Denise        
        runs the front...       

56
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,847
         You'd like the rosette?
                 Wonderful.     

57

       ...the boys cook up      
 traditional dishes in the back.
               Porcini cascioni.

58
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,786
    It's an interesting take    
         on a sandwich.         

59
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,189
  It's got mushrooms in there.  
      It's got the cheese.      

60
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,391
             WOMAN:             
 It's thin and flat and crispy. 

61
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:07,993
       This is very nice.       

62
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:10,195
              We're gonna make  
             a porcini cascioni.

63
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:12,464
                 All right.     
      I'm gonna add the sausage.

64
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,000
        And I'm gonna brown this
                a little bit.   

65
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:20,939
               We're gonna add  
          some butter, shallots,

66
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,108
     and we're gonna mix this up
                a little bit.   

67
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,612
 Now, this was full             
when I showed up here earlier.  

68
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,013
                That's right,   
               I had a couple.  

69
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,281
         And that's about right,
                right there.

00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,750

71
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,018
                 It's right     
             on the money, bro. 

72
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,419
                 All right,     
              button mushrooms. 

73
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,887
             With this in there,

74
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,423
 I'm gonna add porcini mushrooms
          that have rehydrated. 

75
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,958
    There we go.                

76
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,026
   We're gonna put              
the steeping juice, as well.    
                  Exactly.      

77
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,095
All this cooks down?            

78
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:45,130
             Cooks down roughly 
             35 minutes or so.  

79
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,767
     Meanwhile,                 
we'll make the dough.           
                You got it, bro.

80
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,101

00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,303
               Ready to roll.   

82
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,504
               We're gonna put  
         the A.P. flour in here.

83
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,173
               Baking powder.   

84
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,177
     I'm gonna add a little milk
          and salt water mixed. 

85
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:00,445
               Sunflower oil.   

86

                    Okay.       
          I'm gonna close it up.

87
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,017
             Do this for about  
           seven minutes or so. 

88
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,855

 Now what do we do?             

97
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,669
        Now we're gonna bring it
               to the roller.

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,786
         Escovitch sauce        
     is a traditional sauce     

335
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,521
      that we use normally      
          on the fish,          

336
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,591
 which is made of natural herbs 
    and spices from Jamaica.    

337
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,860
 They cook it the way I like it.

338
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:11,129
       It's unbelievable.       

339
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,730
              We're gonna make  
          the escovitch snapper.

340
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,199
 Right now, we're gonna clean up
     the fish, the red snapper. 

341
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,402
         But first, we're gonna 
        doctor him up, you know,

342
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,803
                  take off      
      all the unnecessary parts.

343
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:21,139
             Just clean him up, 
 give him a better presentation.

344
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,274
               And then you'll  
            just scale them out.

345
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,942
                 Good to go.    

346
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,945
So, you'll lay a couple cuts    
      into him.                 
                    Yeah.       

347
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,013
         Your choice. You know, 
   you have your fish seasoning.

348
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,282
                 It's a nice    
   island-flavor fish seasoning.

349
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,149
               Lotion him up.   

350
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,551
        What?                   
               Lotion him up.   

351
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,086
  That's a new one.             
I haven't heard this one yet.   

352
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,621
When we're putting this on,     
 what are we doing?             

353
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:37,822
          We lotion up the fish.

354
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:39,023
And let it marinate,            

355
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,625
   and we'll make               
the escovitch sauce?            
                   Right.       

356
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,693
       Got it.                  
         We're gonna do vinegar.

357
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,295
               Scotch bonnet.   

358
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,163
                   Onions.      

359
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,898
                  Carrots.      

360
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,100
               Sweet peppers,   
       just for color and taste.

361

                  Pimentos.     
    [ Whistles ]                

362
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,172
    Then we're gonna finish that
        with some more vinegar. 
    More vinegar?               

363
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:56,641
   And we're gonna              
let that simmer down?           
           Yeah, come to a boil.

364
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,442
How long does that take?        
               About 10 minutes.

365
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,777
      And then                  
once we cook the fish,          

366
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,713
we're gonna dip the fish        
      in that?                  
                  Yes, sir.     

367
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:02,847
   Bye-bye, fish.               

368
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:05,382
    And how long                
   will that cook?              
                 5 minutes.     

369
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,385
              Some yellow rice. 

370
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,254
                 And calalu.    
   What is calalu?              

371
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:10,855
              Jamaican greens.  

372
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:11,923
            And plantains again.

373
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:17,061
    Now we're just gonna dip it 
  on one side, not for too long.

374
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,330
      And then we'll change him 
 and turn him on the other side.

375
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,199
And that's how you do it?       
                 That's it.     

376
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:24,602
            And he's good to go.

377
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:27,739
             I'll finish him off
             with some garnish. 

378
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,476
       Crazy.                   

379

    Outstanding.                

380
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:34,979
The fish is super moist.        

381
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,216
      Not oily.                 

382
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:39,817
The skin is fantastic.          

383
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,354
   The vinegar is               
just the right amount of acid.  

384
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:44,555
    And what's in               
  the yellow rice?

00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,484
 And this is sugar.             

448
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,687
   Then we stir it              
      together,                 

449
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:59,156
   and after that,              
we add coconut milk.            

450
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,759
                  Vinegar?      
        Yep.                    

451
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,094
              And a little salt?
        Yep.                    

452
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,964
And then peanut butter          
 and ground peanut.             

453
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,566
    And that's the peanut sauce.
Yeah, peanut sauce.             

454
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,100
                    Okay.       
     All right.                 

455
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,304
 Now we do pad Thai             
    burrito mix.                

456
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,605
 We start with oil.             

457
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,708
      Now eggs.                 

458
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:22,246
And then chicken, carrot,       
cabbage, fresh garlic,          

459
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:23,847
 and salted daikon.             
                    Okay.       

460
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,449
    Rice noodles.               

461
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,985
 Then we add water.             

462
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,189
And then pad Thai sauce.        

463
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,725
A little bit ketchup            
   for the color.               

464
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:36,127
A little bit paprika.           

465
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,130
And then stir-fry sauce.        
               Stir-fry sauce.  

466
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:39,998
      Scallion.                 

467
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,400
  When it's ready.              
    we add this.                

468
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:45,202
And then put the pad Thai.      

469
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,670
    Peanut sauce.               

470
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,606
   Cayenne pepper.              
                    Okay.       

471
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:49,941
   And we roll it.              

472
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,345
     All right.                 

473
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,214
                  Nice job.     
       Mm-hmm.                  

474
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,420
              That's delicious  
                  pad Thai.     

475
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:08,092
  The fact that you could put it
               into a burrito,  

476
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:10,361
               into something   
        that I can eat portable,

477
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,629
                 is genius.     

478
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,297
     Just the way you rolled it,

479
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,233
       just the way you make it 
       so inviting -- excellent.

480
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,835
                Awesome job.    

481
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,170
     Thank you.                 

482
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:21,705
        That peanut sauce       
         is to die for.         

483
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,242
           The flavor           
    just snaps in your mouth.   

484
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,976
             WOMAN:             
     I get cravings for it.     

485
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,445
     Like, "Oh, I have to go    
           eat that."           

486
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:32,716
    There's a lot of Asian food,
      so what's the difference? 

487
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,184
                 How do you     
             explain Thai food? 

488
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,719
Thai food is more light,        

489
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,255
  and the sauce --              

490
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,123
 It's not too thick             
   like Chinese...              

491
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,858
                   Right.       
...and not too greasy.          

492
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,660
     FIERI: And don't forget    
         about curry...         

493
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,395
        Lamb karee curry        
          for you, Jim.         

494
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,231
  FIERI: ...another Thai staple 
       Pak's got covered.       

495
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,300
     It's a lot more intense    
   than a lot of other foods.   

496
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,868
      The lamb karee curry      
          is the best.          

497
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:53,671
              Okay, what are we 
              gonna make next?  

498
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,939
  Lamb karee curry.             
                    Okay.       

499
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:59,544
  This is the lamb              
that I already cleaned.         
                    Okay.       

500
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:02,547
 So, we're gonna cut            
  in a small piece.             

501
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:03,547
                    Okay.       

502
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,217
And then we will marinate       
    with coffee.                

503
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,019
    To cut down on the gaminess.
        Yeah.                   

504
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:09,487
   And we wrap it.              

505
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,889
           How long are we gonna
             let this marinate? 
     Overnight.                 

506
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,692
          So, the lamb marinated
               in the coffee.   
       Yeah.                    

507
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,761
Now we're gonna sear            
      the lamb.                 

508
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,629
Paper towel, please.            

509
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:21,966
Oh, it's a nice stand.          

510
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,767
          [ Laughter ]          

511
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,403
                 My new job.    

512
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,239
     All right.                 

513
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:29,540
     Smell good.                

514
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:34,112
       So, now we let these sear
               on both sides?   
        Yep.                    

515
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:38,015
          Now we're gonna put it
                  in here?      
        Right.                  

516
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:40,317
      Bay leaf.                 

517
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,452
            And the peppercorns?
        Yep.                    

518
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,187
                 Tricolor.      
       Water.                   

519
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,388
                And 3 hours.    

520
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,256
    3 to 4 hours.               

521
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:46,690
       Until it's really tender.

522
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,126
        Yeah.                   

523
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,661
       And while this is going, 
     we're gonna make the curry?
        Yeah.                   

524
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:54,365
   Here's the oil,              
and then curry paste.           

525
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,334
             Who made the curry?
       I make.                  

526
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,002
            What's in the curry?

527
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:02,272
Lemongrass, dry chili peppers,  
 cumin, and paprika.            

528
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,543
And then boiled potato.         

529
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,611
   Boiled carrot.               

530
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,413
      Zucchini.                 

531
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,215
Then whipping cream.            

532
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:13,017
              So, heavy cream.  

533
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,419
And then the rib.               
                    Okay.       

534
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:16,887
 And stir-fry sauce.            

535
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,289
               Stir-fry sauce.  

536
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:22,092
  So, we will cook              
    a little bit.               

537
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,561
Now rice -- basmati.            

538
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:25,630
                 Basmati?       
        Yeah.                   

539
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:30,168
Then we will dash lemon,        
 and then cilantro.             

540
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,370
    Put the lamb.               

541
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,772
             Look at how pretty 
                  that is.      

542
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,709
 And then we top it             
  with sour cream,              

543
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41,345
  and ready to go.              

544
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,116
        It's a really nice dish.

545
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:46,316
              I like the curry. 

546
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,386
                  I've had      
           a lot of Thai dishes.

547
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:51,121
          This has a very strong
           Indian flavor to it. 

548
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,289
        Yep.                    

549
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,659
              I like the lamb.  
      I like that coffee flavor.

550
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,997
        This shows the diversity
            of the type of food 

551
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,132
      that you have in Thailand.

552
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:02,800
                 Delicious.     

553
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:06,604
  WOMAN: You feel like royalty  
     eating lamb with that.     

554
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,272
       It's just fabulous.      

555
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:10,808
            The lamb is tender. 
   It's just nice and succulent.

556
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,943
      MAN: This restaurant

 Pak is a person who truly cares
      about her customers.      

558
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:19,350
     WOMAN: Besides the fact    
   that she's a fabulous cook,  

559
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:20,551
       she's just the most      
        gracious hostess.

00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,019
             Hello!             

561
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,954
               This is great.   
     This is the American dream.

562
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,222
             Tiny, little place 

563
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,692
       right here on a fast road
             going into Duluth. 

564
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,161
     I don't think people expect
              when they pull in 

565
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:31,295
         they're gonna find food

566
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:32,963
         with such broad profile
                 of flavor.     

567
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,699
               You're awesome.

00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,167
               Got to come see  
                 this girl.     

569
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,971
     So, that's it for this     
   road trip, but don't worry.  

570
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,041
    We got plenty more joints   
  to find all over the country! 

571
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,043
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

572
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,979

           and Dives."

              Look at the mess  
                we made, bro.   

575
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,582
   Wait a second.               
   Wait a second.               

576
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,850
    This is where               
  I've been eating.             
                Ah, come on.    

577
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,387
   Wait a second.               
This is where I've been eating. 

578
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,655
What's going on over here,      
       Bobby?                   
                 I'm sorry, bro.
