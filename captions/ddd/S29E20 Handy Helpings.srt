  The styles that they do here  
 is something totally different.

When you go to Mexico,          
tacos are very simple.          

467
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:41,406
The ingredients are usually     
very fresh and made correctly.  

468
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,540
                       Uh-huh.

471
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,878
      I've tried every taco     
          on the menu.          

472
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,281
    The Chicken Veracruz taco   
     is one of my favorites.    

473
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,484
   A real juicy chicken taco.   
      The taste is amazing.     

474
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:56,020
What are we making?             
               We're gonna do   
          our Veracruzana sauce.

475
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,155
Veracruzana.                    
         So start with your oil.

476
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:01,225
     Peppers and onions, garlic,
             salt, chili flakes,

477
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,626
      and you let it sweat down.
Okay.                           

478
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,029
           We add your tomatoes,
       some olives, some capers.

479
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,697
                  Cilantro,     
              and your epazote. 

480
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,433
So epazote is something         
we traditionally don't find     

481
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,768
in the United States.           
                  Not that much.

482
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,570
    And you only                
   find it in more              

483
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:13,904
of the authentic style          
Mexican restaurants.            

484
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,373
           Yes, that's for sure.

485
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,641
How are we gonna cook           
    the chicken?                

486
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,977
   Add some onion, garlic, salt,
                and bay leaf.   

487
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,178
                Very simple.    

488
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,379
        Simmer for about an hour
                 and a half.    

489
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,515
                We shred it,    
           and we keep the skin.

490
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,050
 Don't want to lose             
the flavor of the skin.         

491
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:27,451
                    Yes.        

492
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:28,853
   Add a little bit of the stock
            to get it simmering.

493
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,387
          We got our Veracruzana
                ready to go,    

494
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,922
           and you just ladle it
                  into it.      

495
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,725

      So then the fried avocado.

497
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,861
You say fried avocado,          
   and I love it.               

498
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,797
 The slurry is just corn starch,
          a little bit of water,

499
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,532
           a little bit of salt.
     What are we gonna          
     dredge it in?              

500
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,134
                 Masa harina    
              and some spices.  

501
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,468
     Masa harina                
  is the same thing             

502
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,070
that you make tortillas         
 and tamales out of.
