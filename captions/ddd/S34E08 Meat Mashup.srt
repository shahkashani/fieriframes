68
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,413
      I mean, has this been     
 the go-to rub the entire time? 

69
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:32,217
   Yes, this is the exact recipe
  we won the Jack Daniel's with.

70
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,352
 Tell us what it is.            

71
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:34,753
     Salt, sugar, brown sugar...

00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:35,753
 Now, wait a second.            

73
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,155
   This isn't just              
regular brown sugar.            

74
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,090
    It's brown sugar that's been
              dried in the oven 

75
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,626
    and put in a food processor.

76
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:43,095
   So, now it's more of a powder
    with a little granule in it.

77
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:44,229
        Aha!

79
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,766
          Paprika, chili powder,

80
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,500
            cumin, white pepper,
            some black pepper...

81
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,902

onion powder, a little Accent --

 And then I'm gonna let you know
                what the two    

85
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,910

that no one's ever guessed.     

87
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:04,449
 Cinnamon and clove?            

88
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,184
You were right on with that one.
            That one's cinnamon.

91
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,521
You're gonna tell me            

92
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,457

        Wait until you taste it.

94
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,393
               The rub I made   
             on the old show -- 

95
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:19,130
           We sold 54,000 pounds
             of that last year. 

96
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,799
                  27 tons.      

97
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,001
All right, so let's grab        
one of those briskets.          

98
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,669
What size are we gonna use?     
                     Around 16. 

99
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,671
        Wow.                    

100
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:26,538
              I'm gonna trim it 
               real lightly --  

101
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,673
           skim fat off of it --

102
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,540
just so I can get some seasoning
             down to that meat. 

103
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,476
You see him run that knife      
   like a surgeon?              

104
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:33,078
   Gonna apply some of this rub.

00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,479
   Okay, let's go.              

106
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,347
Now, what we have here...       

107
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,683
          How long you had this?
    Eight years.                

108
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,217
     Got your money out of this,
                 didn't you?    

109
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,418
        I still have that cooker
                in the museum   

110
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,553
          over at the warehouse.

111
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,021
Yeah, I was just gonna say      
  there's got to be             

112
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,156
      a museum                  
  of Smokin' Guns.              

113
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,225
      Okay, brisket goes down --
                    225?        

114
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,694
   9 to 11 hours.               

115
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:51,029
       All right, now as long as

               like a mentor,

           been able to look at,

118

 ask the good barbecue questions
   to -- "Dr. BBQ" Ray Lampe.

         and test some barbecue.

120
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,972
         I know you are.        

121
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,442
         We knew Dr. BBQ        
   from competing against him.  

122
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,510
     It was just really fun     
       for him to be here.      

123
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:06,578
  He's a good dude.             

124
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,913
         -Look at that.         
           -Beautiful.          

125
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,247
              Man, that's what  
     it's supposed to look like.

126
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,115
         Now we're gonna        
          let it rest.          

127
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,582
                   How long?    
   15 minutes.                  

128
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,919
    15 "I want to pick at it    
  and eat some of it" minutes.  

129
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,321
           All right.           

130
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,389
    Now skim off any fat thicker
      than a quarter of an inch.

131
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,991
   Very nice.                   
       How thick you like yours?

132
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,927
Pencil-thick, just like         
 I was at a contest.            

133
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,528
       Now, Ray, I'm under      
         the impression         

134
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,130
     that you should be able    
       to pull it lightly,      

135
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,465
      it should come apart.     
Exactly.                        

136
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,666
    Stretchiness,               
that's what you want,           

137
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:28,734
but it has to come apart.       

138
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:30,335
                    Okay.       
         Put it on the sandwich.

139
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,737
   Nice, not dry,               
     beautiful.                 

140
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,639
         That rub, dude.        
           Fantastic.           

141
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,741
     I'd risk life and limb     
     for some more of that.     

142
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,143
              MAN:              
     Got a brisket sandwich.    

143
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,878
There's all kinds of great      
barbecue joints around,         

144
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,546
 but the burnt ends             
 are still something            

145
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:44,883
that I remember to this day     
being one of my favorites.      

146
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,084
                Here we have    
               the burnt end,   

147
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,153
   now it was back on the smoker
               for four hours   

148
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:51,757
    after we skimmed the fat off
             and re-seasoned it.

149
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,493
     So, what we're gonna do now
          is cut it into chunks.

150
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:55,560
      Oh, baby.                 

151
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,829
       Took this right out      
         of the center.         

152
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:01,500
        Tears apart like        
      the thin slices did.      

153
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,767
           Holy moly!           

154
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:06,304
    I've had some burnt ends    
           in my day.           

155
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,840
                They up there   
                 somewhere?     

156
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,709
            Gotta be            
        in my top three.        

157
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,311
                  Alright!      

158
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,913

          Made my day.

            the highlights here?

160
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,850
               What do we got?  
       Smoked meat loaf.        

161
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,718
            Was this on the menu
     when I came here last time?

162
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,920
             Oh, no,            
      it's completely new.      

163
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23,121
                This is new?    

164
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:26,792
     Yeah, it's our version     
    of barbecue comfort food.   

165
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,726
                  Barbecue      
              is comfort food!  

166
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,395
           [ Laughs ]           
           Yes, it is!          

167
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:31,829
             What are the meats 
                  in there?     

168
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,466
        We use two parts        
    choice or higher brisket,   

169
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:37,335
          one part pork         
that we grind ourself, in house.

170
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,471
             We use             
  our own meat loaf seasoning.  

171
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:43,341
  It's dried mustard, paprika,  
      a little salt, thyme,     

172
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,544
      basil, black pepper,      
          onion powder,         

173
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:48,346
         garlic powder,         
      and some breadcrumbs.     

174
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,415
And instead of the traditional  
    tomato sauce,               

175
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,950
we put barbecue sauce           
       in it.                   

176
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,152
             Living on the edge,
                 these two.     

177
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,688
          We add eggs,          
      mix it all together,      

178
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,623
       put it in the pan,       
      put it on the smoker.     

179
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,092
                  How long      
          does this go down for?

180
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:01,626
        About four hours.       

181
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:05,363
        It's been one of        
    our best sellers so far.    

182
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,733
            Like that smoke ring
                  on that.      

183

                Super tender.   
          That's good meat loaf.

185

  Here's your smoked meat loaf. 

187

      The meat loaf has got     
     a really good texture.     

188
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,377
    The pork and the brisket    
          meld together         

189
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,313

190
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:23,515
         It's got a good        
       mild smoky flavor.       

191

  And this place is legendary.  

208
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:56,948
  I mean, we're talking over 14 
 years of competition barbecue, 

209
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,351
        over 400 awards,        
     and one killer brisket.    

210
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,154
    This is Smokin' Guns BBQ.   

211
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,290
         But these days,

 the same property?             

214
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,361
            You know,           
     our original restaurant    

215
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,763
  was located right next door.  

216
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,832
    When we decided we needed   
         a bigger place,        

217
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,700
   we had this building built.  

218
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:19,237
  We went from 1,800 square feet
                 to 12,000.     

219
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,439
And then once this got done,    
you tore it down and paved it.  

220

             Yep.

00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,537
