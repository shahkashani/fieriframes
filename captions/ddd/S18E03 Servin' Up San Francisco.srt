          Next, a stop          
     at a food-truck park...    

18

00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,729
I got the chicken-noodle soup

       The matzo-ball soup      
          is delicious.

      Fire up the chicken stock.

64

A little bit of olive oil.

Some mirepoix -- a couple       
of big onions, celery, carrots.

A couple of big chickens.       

67

  Those are big. Those look like
         San Francisco pigeons.

00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,361
      A fistful                 
   of peppercorns.              

71
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,829
             And some bay leaf. 

72
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,631
   A lot of water.

00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,167
                 All right,     
      how long is this gonna go?

74
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,703
   Come to a boil,              
bring it down to a simmer --    

75
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:52,704
  about 90 minutes.             

76
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,506
                 Strain it,     
             shred the chicken, 

77
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,242
       and while that's working,
              we're going to -- 

78
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,510
Make some matzo balls.          

79
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,246
Matzo meal, some salt,          

80
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,181
    a little bit                
of white ground pepper.         

81
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,584
You want to mix that up         
     real good.                 

82
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,919
 That's all the dry.            
Now you got all the wet.        

83
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,455
So, for each cup of matzo meal, 
 you got four eggs.             

84
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:13,325
     1/4 cup of                 
  schmaltz per cup.             

85
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,193
         So, what's the schmaltz
                 all about?     

86
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,862
Schmaltz is flavored            
    chicken fat.                

87
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,864
    You're gonna                
 mix that together.             

88
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,799
  So, all the wet.              

89
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:26,805
                Look at this.   

90
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,740
           That's all she wrote.
            So we let this set. 

91
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,676
      Then, after it forms up --

92
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,877
  Just gonna take,              
 you know, an inch.             

93
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,681
                And how long    
               will they cook?  

94
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:39,351
 They're gonna cook             
 about 45 minutes.              

95
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:41,820
A little bit of schmaltz.       

96
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:47,092
Some mirepoix -- onions,        
some carrots, some celery.      

97
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,161
  They're all nice              
  and sweated out.              

98
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:51,496
  We're gonna throw             
the chicken stock on top        

99
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:54,499
and then let it cook down       
for about 30 minutes or so.     

100
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,901
         Now that's cooked down.
                  Now what?     

101
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,969
  Now we add fresh,             
  shredded chicken              

102
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,439
   from the stock               
and then the matzo balls.       

103
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:05,444
And then we get a little bit    
of cooked egg noodles.          

104
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:08,179
Let it get nice and hot.        

105
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,247
              And then we serve.
That's correct.                 

106
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:09,982
              Word to the bird. 

107
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:11,850
       Ready?                   
                     Here we go.

112
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,464
        Look how hearty that is.
            Tender matzo balls. 

113
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,000
     That's the key right there.

114

                    Mmm.        

115
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:33,004
          Simple, to the point, 
    but I'll tell you something.

116
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,873

So, this puppy goes in.         

140

And start it in some cold water

That's probably true.           

156
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,829
    A little bit

just enough matzo meal.

If you put too much matzo meal  
in, you got a puck of lead.

00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,309
   And that's it.

00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:06,778
             I'm impressed, man.

237
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,981
      I've seen some cool stuff 
  in my day, but this is -- Wow.

238
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,316
It's Korean/Japanese.           

239
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,253
 I'm having the short-rib KoJa. 
   Very unique, very original.  

240
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:18,456
      There's a rice patty      
         on the outside,        

241
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,925
tender short ribs on the inside.

242
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,194
      Absolutely delicious.     

243
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,462
     So, what are we gonna make?

244
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,931
Now we're making our signature  
marinade for our short-rib KoJa.

245
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:32,270
 Soy sauce, sugar --            
   a lot of sugar.              

246
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,539
     Some mirin.                
Japanese cooking wine.          

247
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,675
  We got some sake.             

248
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:37,943
Just a little bit of water.     

249
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:39,477
I'm gonna power it up.          

250
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,346
We're gonna boil it up          
   nice and easy.               

251
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,081
    Let it cool.                

252
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,215
             Now our next step? 

253
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,684
  We're gonna make              
  our root mixture.             

254
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,418
            And this is all part
              of the marinade?  

255
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,421
        Yes.                    
 Korean shingo pear.            

256
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,757
              This is something 
         I have not seen before.

257
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,158
It's kind of like papaya.       
                           Okay.

258
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,761
       Onions.                  
And we're gonna add some kiwis. 

259
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,896
               This right here  
               is pretty odd,   

260
00:09:58,898 --> 00:09:59,965
                 but I like     
             where you're going.

261
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,032
Add some garlic right in,       

262
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,167
   and we're gonna              
 fire this thing up.            

263
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:06,638
          Take me to Flavortown.

264
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,107
Now we're gonna combine it.     
 We're gonna add --             

265
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,643
 So that's our soy and our sugar
    and the mirin and the sake. 

266
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,913
     And water.                 
Next, the fruit puree mix.      

267
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,917
We're gonna add some lemon.     
 Fresh lemon juice.             

268
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,286
Black pepper, sesame oil.       

269
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,388
     Mix it up.                 

270
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,525
              Ooh, that's good. 

271
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,060
  These are toasted             
    sesame seeds.               

272
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,328
                    Very nice.  
Let's give it                   
a nice whisk.                   

273
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,665
             And now we drop in 
                  the meat.     

274
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:34,799
We've got a nice short rib.     

275
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,467
    Mix this up,                
give it a nice massage.         

276
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,605
   And we're gonna              
marinate it overnight.          

277
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,607
     So, we've got our marinated
           meat. Now what step? 

278
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:45,276
We're gonna make the            
garlic-seasoned rice buns.      

279
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,613
 We make it in these            
custom-made aluminum press.     

280
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,014
               That's awesome.  

281
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,317
  First, we have to             
   oil the molds.               

282
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,687
       This is                  
a garlic-seasoned rice.         

283
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,422
We're gonna oil the top,        
      as well,                  

284
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,158
  just to make sure             
  it doesn't stick.             

285
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,562
While I'm doing this --         
Get it nice and flat.           

286
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,564
    There we go.                

287
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,032
     Let it cool                
for about 5, 10 minutes.        

288
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:11,235
   And this is the patty that is
       made in the KoJa burger? 

289
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:12,370
 Yes.                           
                  Awesome.      

290
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,672
 We're gonna put it             
    on the grill.               

291
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:19,978
    Ready to go.                
We're gonna built a KoJa.       

292
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,446
             Check that just -- 
                  Ow, hot.      

293
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:22,847
      Plate it.                 

294
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,782
  Some sesame slaw              
    on top of it,               

295
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,918
a nice chunk of meat,           
    katsu aioli,                

296
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,185
and our second patty.           

297
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,521
               Oh, the meat's   
               out of bounds.   

298
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,189
   You fold it up.              

299
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,591
We're gonna put it in this      
little pouch right here,        

300
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:34,993
just nice presentation.         

301
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,262
We add some more of the         
katsu aioli on top of it.       

302
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:38,997
A little bit of toasted         
    sesame seed.                

303
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,136
      Bite in.                  

304
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,005
              It's outrageous.  

305
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,373
       The meat's out of bounds.

306
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,209
   A little on the sweeter side,
                not as spicy.   

307
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,278
          It's like a rice bowl 
        but not being in a bowl.

308
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,347
       The little bit of lettuce
        that goes along with it 

309
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:59,617
   is kind of like the vegetable
               or the cabbage   

310
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,352
     that you would normally get
               in a rice bowl.  

311
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,087
                  The rice,     
       with its crunchy texture,

312
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,822
    adds something you don't get
               in a rice bowl.  

313
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,157
       This is Asian street food
                at its best.    

314
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:09,894
                This is wow.    

315
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,029
                Mmm! Awesome!   

316
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,164
          Very savory.          

317
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,567
      A little spice to add     
      a little kick in it.      

318
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:21,105
 It has a great rice cake to it,
     and the meat is tender.    

319
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,041
      I can't -- I'm speechless.
               It's that good.  

320
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:24,109
              MAN:              
         Real-deal food.        

321
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:25,643
     The food and the people    
        and the truck --        

322
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,111
 I think it all comes together. 

323
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,846
 They've created something that 
 I've never seen anywhere else. 

324
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,982
      This is the only KoJa     
  that I know of in existence,  

325
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:31,983
   like, on the whole planet.   

326
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,584
             FIERI:             
    You did the truck right.    

327
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,853
       High-tech, putting       
     all these components --    

328
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,122
    These dudes are all that    
         and then some.         

329
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,524
   You guys are the bomb, man.  

330
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:41,926
         KoJa Kitchen --        
   You got to check them out.   

331
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,399
 Coming up, we're headed to the 
southeast side of the Mission...

332
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,733
     I like where<i> this</i> is going.

333
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:52,069
 ...for a Southern comfort spot 

334
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,671
 where the living's always easy.

335
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,139
             It's not very good.

336
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,407
  You should probably put it all
        in the trunk of my car, 

337
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:57,575
          and I'll get rid of it
                  for you.      

338
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,818
       You have got to dig      
         San Francisco.         

339
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,621
      I mean, all the cool      
          little areas,         

340
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,356
       the neighborhoods,       
         the districts.         

341
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:14,158
Well, here I am in the southeast
  side of the Mission District  

342
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,694
      to check out a joint      
    that started in the '30s    

343
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,963
    as an Italian restaurant    
          in a garage.          

344
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,431
   Well, fast forward to 2006,  

345
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,166
      and now it's a funky      
          little joint          

346
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,836
  that's serving up some killer 
     Southern comfort food.     

347
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,037
        Oh, that's right.       

348
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,605
     You got to come kick it    
       at the Front Porch.      

349
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,776
       Table 7, Frito pie.      

350
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,110

00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:39,957
      Dr Pepper short ribs.     

466
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,726
             FIERI:             
 Y'all come back now, you hear? 

467
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,200
             FIERI:             
"Triple D" is at the Front Porch

468
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,869
       in San Francisco's       
       Mission District,        

469
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,872
     where if rocking chairs    
       don't pull you in,       

470
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,140
     the rocking food will.     

471
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,674
      Dr Pepper short ribs.     

472
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,811
    They melt in your mouth.    
   They're absolutely awesome.  

473
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:02,746
                 Dr Pepper?     
            Yeah! Let's do this.

474
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,148
     All right,                 
so, we're gonna season          

475
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,283
our boneless beef short ribs    

476
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:08,752
with a little bit of salt       
and fresh black pepper.         

477
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,288
Super-hot sauté pan.            

478
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,421
     Canola oil.                

479
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,958
And we want to get a nice sear  
   on these guys.               

480
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,561
                Sear-iously.    

481
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,596
 That's a good pun.             
            Thank you very much.

482
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,501
Now we're ready to start        
     the braise.                

483
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,570
We're just gonna go straight    
into a hotel pan here.          

484
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,338
                    Mmm.        
           Smells great already.

485
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,242
We're gonna do mirepoix,        

486
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:34,245
which is a rough chop of        
carrots, celery, onion,         

487
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:37,048
   fresh thyme...               

488
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,583
    bay leaves...               

489
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:41,185
  chipotle peppers              
  in adobo sauce...             

490
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:44,122
homemade chicken stock...       

491
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,722
   and then a lot               
   of Dr Pepper.                

492
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,992
We don't call it Dr Pepper      
short ribs for nothing.         

493
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,128
                 [ Grunts ]     

494
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,264
So, we just want to make sure   
  it's all covered.             

495
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,833
           In the oven how long?
350 for four hours.             

496
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:00,805
All right, so we're ready       
to plate up a short rib.        

497
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,139
Take one of these guys.         

498
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,641
              In their own jus. 
Yep.                            

499
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,278
We're gonna season this with    
a little bit more black pepper. 

500
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,013
A little more kosher salt.      

501
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,949
   Mount it with a little butter
                 at the end.    

502
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:13,551
 It's gonna help it             
     thicken up,                

503
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:15,219
as if it's not already          
    rich enough.                

504
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,487
It's just gonna make it         
a little bit more rich.         

505
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,290
So, we're just gonna let that   
 reduce back there.             

506
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,025
All right, so, we have          
 celery-root puree.             

507
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,360
  A nice spoonful.              

508
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:23,961
                 Beautiful.     

509
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:27,631
Sautéed mustard greens,         
   our short rib,               

510
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,701
and the Dr Pepper braise        
right on top of that.           

511
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,169
And last but not least,         

512
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,238
a little fresh-grated           
    horseradish.                

513
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,374
       I love fresh horseradish.

514
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,645
             It's not very good.

515
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,047
  You should probably put it all
        in the trunk of my car, 

516
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:43,981
          and I'll get rid of it
                  for you.      

517
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,983
    [ Chuckles ]                

518
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:50,454
     The short rib is so tender 
   that it's just falling apart.

519
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:53,390
       You just have to help it 
     with the fork a little bit.

520
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:56,460
           The celery-root puree
              is a great medium 

521
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,529
             for the whole dish.

522
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,732
         The fresh horseradish, 
  along with the mustard greens,

523
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,934
           adds a nice contract 
         to this braising liquid

524
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:04,936
            that's been reduced.

525
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,077
  And the Dr Pepper is just this
  nice round flavor and -- Mmm. 

526
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,212
             Every little piece 
         you did here -- killer.

527
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,414
Awesome. Thank you.             
           I mean really killer.

528
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,315
        Cool.                   

529
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:22,085
  And the Dr Pepper short ribs. 

530
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:25,756
       Juicy, it's tender,      
   and it's flavored amazing.   

531
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:28,292
   You can just take your fork  
 and just break it right apart. 

532
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:29,226
       It's just so soft.

00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:33,698
                It's awesome.

                    Wow.        

546
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:57,255
         This just went from fun
              to really creepy.
