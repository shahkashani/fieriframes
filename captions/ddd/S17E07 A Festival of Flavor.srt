00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,034
 Just let it reduce.            

112
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,235
            And at the end of it
                cooking down,   

113
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:57,970
           what are we gonna do?

114
00:03:57,972 --> 00:03:59,037
We're gonna add a roux,         

115
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,372
and then we're gonna            
 slurry it into it.             

116
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:02,641
We're gonna just add a little   
bit in just to allow it --      

117
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,242
             So, that'll tighten
             all the juices up. 

118
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,511
   Tighten it up,               
 but not too tight.             

119
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,413
               Now we're gonna  
                make the pie.   
 Now we're gonna                
  make the pie.                 

120
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,683
     Then we cut                
     the pastry.                

121
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,321
               Ho, ho, ho, ho.  
                 How much --    

122
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:17,789
           I wasn't trying to be
             Santa Claus there. 

123
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,391
          How big is the filling
               in this thing?   

124
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:22,461
It's a little smaller           
  than a softball.              

125
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,129
     About that.                

126
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,397
     Would you like me to get on
      the cutting side of this? 
 That'd be great.               

127
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,399
Grab a pastry and you stretch it
   over like that,              

128
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,668
and then you cinch it.          

129
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,536
Just stretch it -- You don't    
want to tear the pastry.        

130
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,405
      Then it's                 
  nice and sealed.              

131
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,474
    Take a piece                
   of puff pastry,              

132
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:39,010
cut a strip, and just twist it  
and put it right on top.        

133
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,846
             Doctor, how is one 
               twisting this?   

134
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,821
               Now, these are   
                baked order?    
 We parbake them.               

135
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:52,891
       Parbake them, hold them, 
fire them off in the oven again.

136
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,292
              Does it come with 
             a gravy or a sauce?

137
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,961
With a salad -- a bed of salad  
   underneath it.               

138
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,064
      And some                  
mustard vinaigrette.            

139
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,299
 Just a nice, little            
     bed of it.                 

140
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,834
    There you go.               

141
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,770
              I'm dying to see  
              this inside here. 

142
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,572
              Oh, that's dreamy 
                 and creamy.    

143
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,045
                    Yeah.       
                 All right.     

144
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,646
       I don't think most people
              would anticipate  

145
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,249
                putting this    
             on top of a salad, 

146
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,652
      but you get a nice crunch,
      you get that vinaigrette. 

147
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,320
                 If you like    
               chicken pot pie  

148
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,656
and you want more of the crunchy
    crust that you have on top, 

149
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,591
          this is what you want.

150
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,161
               That's killer.   
    Wait till you guys try this.

151
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:32,998
    Tell me about               
  the chicken pie.              

152
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,799
       It's, like, super savory.
              Tons of chicken.  

153
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,200
             WOMAN:             
    It's like a chicken soup    

154
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,870
    with a great pastry puff    
         outside of it.         

155
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,072
              MAN:              
    A lot of depth of flavor.   

156
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:42,073
       This is chicken pie      
      the way it should be.     

157
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,342
These guys have been setting    
the trend for a long time.      

158
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,011
             Really?            
     Yeah.                      

159
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,947
     It's not your average,     
     you know, corner pub.      

160
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:51,083
    You're gonna find things    
   that are slightly unusual.   

161
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,954
      We're at the Standard Tap,
         and when we come back, 

162
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,155
             we're gonna try... 

163
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,423
        O--                     
                Don't -- Ah!    

164
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,491
                   See you      
              in a little bit.  

165
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:00,692
               Don't you love   
          when I do that to you?

166
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:09,167
             So, here we are -- 
   Standard Tap in Philadelphia.

167
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,903
        And Chef and I have had 
        a fantastic chicken pie.

168
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,971
            Not chicken pot pie 
      because that comes in a...

169
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,640
      Pot.                      
            Thank you very much.

170
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,242
          What are we on to now?
                  Drumroll.     
     Octopus.                   

171
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:18,977
        Oh, really? You're gonna
        give it out that quick? 

172
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:19,878
                 Fire it up.    
                  Octopus.      

173
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,482
  All right, first,             
let's add some water.           

174
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,253
    Then you add                
Spanish onions, celery...       

175
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,588
 fresh grapefruit...            

176
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,590
     oranges...                 

177
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,659
      lemons...                 

178
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:35,794
      garlic...                 

179
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,195
     bay leaf...                

180
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,864
    fresh thyme,                
    and parsley.                

181
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:41,132
         We're gonna let this go
                 for a boil.    

182
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,934
   We're gonna add              
    the octopus.                

183
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:45,470
      All right, so, the octopus
        is not gonna get any -- 

184
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,739
     no salting, no tenderizing,
                 no nothing.    

185
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,208
No, it's fresh octopus,         
so it doesn't need it.          

186
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,210
                    Nice.       

187
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,613
              We're going to... 

188
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,481
We're going to make a marinade  
  for the octopus.              

189
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:59,017
Start with some garlic.         
 Crushed red pepper.            

190
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,018
                     Oh!        

191
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,487
Little bit of celery seed.      
   Fresh parsley.               

192
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,355
    What's up with the red chili
         flake there, sunshine? 

193
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,423
Got to get some heat.           

194
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,625
Got some fresh thyme            
    and oregano,                

195
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,961
   a little salt,               
   white pepper...              

196
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,563
     vinegar...                 

197
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,364
   lemon juice...               

198
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,100
     olive oil,                 
  blend, and whisk.             

199
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,703
                 The octopus    
              is gonna go down. 

200
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,171
            Are we gonna cut it 
           before we drop it in?

201
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,906
We're gonna pull it apart       
   with our hands.              

202
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,375
   Tear it apart.               

203
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:25,043
                 Now I know     
               you're serious.  

204
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,344
   [ Laughs ]                   
                     Okay.      

205
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,180
                   We done?     
    We're done.                 

206
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,716
                So, how long    
               was this down?   

207
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:32,784
   A couple hours.              

208
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,918
              Just till it's -- 

209
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
         I mean, it literally is
             fall-apart tender. 

210
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,388
    So, you just                
   tear it apart.               

211
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,790
You leave the suckers on,       
and you throw it in there.      

212
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,059
   Marinade up. And then, are we
    gonna grill it for service? 

213
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,595
We're gonna grill it            
    for service.                

214
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,933
Caramelize the octopus.         

215
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,000
  Pretty good.                  
                 Ready to rock? 

216
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,068
    Ready to go.

               The chicken leg  
                is the best.    

329
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,319
    You got to go               
with that dark meat.            

330
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,521
                    Yeah.       

331
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,791
It's a little score so the sauce
will get down in there,         

332
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,193
  and also it helps             
  create the crust.             

333
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,528
And we're going to skewer       
   that onto this.              

334
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,429
                    Yes.        

335
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,600
  Okay, so, we get              
all the sauce in there.         

336
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:19,804
      Let it go                 
   for overnight.               

337
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:23,074
All right, so, now you go in,   
   around, down --              

338
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,475
Skewer it through.              
                      Yes.      

339
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,210
How many pieces will you put    
    on a skewer?                

340
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,846
                 Two pieces     
                in one order.   

341
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,683
             Okay, it's going in
                the tandoori.   
      Yes.                      

342
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,053
  So, 15 minutes.               
                     Yeah.      

343
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,225
                     Yeah.      
      Yeah!                     

344
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,059
                 Thank you.     

345
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:44,429
    Is that ghee                
 or is that butter?             

346
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,164
                It's butter.    

347
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,065
           This is the cilantro.

348
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,902
               And now you are  
             going to taste it. 

349
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:02,313
                 [ Laughs ]     

350
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,448
                 It's good?     

351
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,250
This is out of bounds.          

352
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,451
                 [ Laughs ]     

353
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,452
Super rich flavor --            
a little bit of spice,          

354
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,188
little bit of ginger,           
a little bit of garlic,         

355
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,256
roasted down to where           
it's just starting to separate, 

356
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,893
 come off the bone,             
and smoking hot, that is.       

357
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,462
        Wow!                    

358
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,597
  That is some of               
  the best chicken              

359
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:20,598
   we've ever had               
   on "Triple D."               

360
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,734
I am not kidding you.           

361
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,335
        Ohh!                    

362
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:27,138
   WOMAN: It's really tender,   
         a little spicy.        

363
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,406
         Tastes amazing.        

364
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,942
  We had them cater             
his second birthday party.      

365
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,478
            Some Pakistani food 
   for my kid's second birthday.

366
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,213
   We'll do a whole-hog barbecue
                for your 5th.   

367
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,615
     FIERI: Or a whole goat,    
     like the Pakistanis do.    

368
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:41,152
      In Pakistan, goat is      
      a very common food.       

369
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,487
          Goat karahi.          

370
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,889
   All right, so,               
 what are we making?            

371
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:47,692
                We are making   
              the goat karahi.  

372
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,627
              I'm going to boil 
                  that goat     

373
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:52,897
         in ginger garlic, salt,
                 bay leafs,     

374
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,833
                black pepper,   
     and a little bit of cloves.

375
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,902
               And then water.  

376
00:13:57,904 --> 00:13:58,903
    Cook it down                
    for how long?               

377
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:01,105
               It takes, like,  
                 30 minutes.    

378
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,373
      What does                 
   "karahi" mean?               

379
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,776
               "Karahi" means   
                 "the wok."     

380
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:08,046
Do you use a wok a lot          
in Pakistani cooking?           
                      Yes.      

381
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,681
              The ginger garlic.
Ginger garlic mix.              

382
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,384
    What is this                
magnificent mixture?            

383
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,720
                   This is      
           an onion-based puree.

384
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:18,122
           So, I'm going to put 
           a little bit of that.

385
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,124
              Plus the tomatoes 
                   inside.      

386
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,062
              And I'm going to  
                  cover it.     

387
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,196
    And how long                
    does that go?               

388
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,464
              This goes, like,  
                 10 minutes.    

389
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,600
      It becomes more, you know,
         tender and more juicy. 

390
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,001
    So, it really               
     cooks down.                

391
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,671
      And now we are going to do
              the naan for you. 

392
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,606
    N-a-a-n?                    
                   N-a-a-n.     

393
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,342
                Let's start     
                with yogurt.    

394
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,477
             Milk, dry yeast... 

395
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,611
              baking powder...  

396
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,946
                sugar, oil...   

397
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,814
                   eggs...      

398
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,416
                salt, flour.    

399
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,555
       So, we are going to make 
      one garlic and one cheese.

400
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,828
        This is the garlic naan.

401
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,563
             This is going to be
               a cheese naan.   

402
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,597
        Okay.                   

403
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,467
    We call that                
    a quesadilla.               

404
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,573
   And that's it,               
 right on the side?             

405
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,574
           You want to try that?
      Yeah!                     

406
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,843
  I'm down with it.             

407
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,044
        Okay.                   
   Right up here?               

408
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:14,646
                      Oh!       
    Too high?                   

409
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:16,247
                 No, I think    
                 it's okay.     
      Okay.                     

410
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,519
Look at thing puffing.          

411
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,519
               And now you are  
               going to do it.  

412
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,688
        Aah!                    

413
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,258
               Excellent job!   

414
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,627
        Huh?                    
 What do you think?             

415
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,063
                  Let's see     
              our goat karahi.  

416
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,733
            Now I'm going to put
              the yogurt in it. 

417
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:39,937
        Ground cumin, coriander,
               black pepper...  

418
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,407
             little bit of salt,
              sliced ginger...  

419
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:45,543
               green chilies,   
               fresh cilantro.  

420
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,412
      The most important part --
                 the butter.    

421
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,019
   And then we will put a little
   bit more cilantro on the top 

422
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,288
              and a little bit  
                more ginger.    

423
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,156
   All right, so,               
we've got the garlic naan       

424
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,025
and the cheese naan.            

425
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:03,627
  There's the one               
  with the cheese.              

426
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,162
              That's the cheese.
      Mmm!                      

427
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,964
Now, are you supposed to        
  eat this by hand?             

428
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,633
         No, you can use a fork.

429
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:09,701
  Now you tell me.              

430
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,170
    Oh, my gosh!                

431
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,173
The goat cooked down            
    like that --                

432
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,374
 It's super tender.             

433
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,776
A little bit of the spiciness   
 to the creaminess.             

434
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,381
Reduction of the sauce,         
the fresh cilantro in there --  

435
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,449
all those little nuances        
   come together.               

436
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,352
  Oh, I can't stop!             

437
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,656
   All-around delicious dish.   

438
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,326
  It's spicy and always fresh.  

439
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,395
              MAN:              
 There's many different options 
   for ethnic food down here,   

440
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:38,996
       but this is the one      
   that I keep coming back to.  

441
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,131
This is a flavor temple.        

442
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,732
If you live in Arizona,         

443
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,134
anywhere close to Phoenix,      

444
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,536
you haven't checked this        
place out, you are missing it.  

445
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:46,670
      Awesome.                  

446
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,839
   Thank you.                   
                   Thank you.   

447
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:53,410
        FIERI: Up next...       

448
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,611
    Look at that!               

449
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,481
         ...we're headed        
     to Denver, Colorado...     

450
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:59,550
  Just a couple of blocks away  
from the Colorado State Capitol.

451
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,952
   ...where a throwback bar...  
      Oh!                       

452
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:05,356
    ...is turning short ribs    
    into a big-time burger.     

453
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,791
                 That burger    
                  was nuts!     

454
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,134
  I'm here in Denver, Colorado, 

455
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:20,538
  just a couple of blocks away  
from the Colorado State Capitol,

456
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,407
      to check out a joint      
        that's serving up       

457
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:26,344
     some righteous bar food    
to locals and legislators alike.

458
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,646
      This is Prohibition.      

459
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,620
       It's not too fancy,      
   but it's not too pub-like.   

460
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:37,989
   You can drink good drinks,   
         eat good food.         

461
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,025
I've always had a dream         
 of owning a bar --             

462
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,427
a bar with great food.          

463
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:45,496
   FIERI: Well, Jimmy Callahan  
 can scratch that off the list, 

464
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:48,633
         'cause in 2011,        
      he opened this joint      

465
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:51,368
  with longtime buddy and chef, 
           Toby Prout.          

466
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,571
       You know, we're kind of, 
     you know, upscale bar food.

467
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,972
   Not just wings               
 and cheese sticks.             
                      No.       

468
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,176
   You don't expect this type   
 of food from any kind of a bar.

469
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,511
              Kitchen sink up.  

470
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,846
     Everything I've had is     
       just mouthwatering.      

471
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,782
     MAN: Personally, I like    
     the Prohibition burger.    

472
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,184
         Who puts apple         
          on a burger?          

473
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,985
   I got the short rib burger.  

474
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,921
           Oh, my God.          
           Fantastic.           

475
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,188
   So, what are we              
     gonna make?                

476
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,256
             We're gonna do our 

477
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,125
             balsamic braised   
             short rib burger.  

478
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:16,727
      We start, obviously, with 
  salt and pepper -- the basics.

479
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,262
         Now we got our hot pan.

480
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,663
           Gonna oil it up here.

481
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:20,731
       That is                  
a screaming-hot pan.            

482
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,267
       We like a nice, hard sear
                  on them.      

483
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,002
      These are gonna be braised
                for 12 hours,   

484
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,305
            you want to lock in 
   all those juices and whatnot.

485
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,607
         We seared them up good.

486
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,276
             Now we're gonna do 
             our mirepoix veg.  

487
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:37,481
      Carrots, onions, celery --
                The classics.   

488
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,950
        Then we're gonna go with
              our tomato paste. 

489
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,019
                 Hit it with    
            my balsamic vinegar,

490
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:43,820
        a little bit of red wine
                  in there.     

491
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,423
               Peppercorns...   

492
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:48,226
              Bay leaf. Garlic. 

493
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:50,227
        Just gonna let that wine
             reduce just a bit. 

494
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,896
             We're gonna hit it 
         with our chicken broth,

495
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,165
                which will be   
            our braising liquid.

496
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,501
                Fresh thyme.    

497
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58,101
          We're gonna bring this
               up to a simmer   

498
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,972
      and then put it right over
       the boneless short ribs. 

499
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,708
Wrap them in foil, pop them     
in the oven -- How long?        

500
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,443
               We do 12 hours   
               at 200 degrees.  

501
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,111
     Whoa!                      
                 Slow and low.  

502
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,412
It's gonna be butter,           
        baby.                   

503
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:15,653
            I'm gonna go ahead  
     and take one for a service.

504
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,854
   Get a little bit of the sauce
                 in the pan.    

505
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,057
And then let that reduce        
and that's the service sauce?   

506
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,192
                     Yeah.      
      Nice.                     

507
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:23,060
          Now we'll cut our meat
                for portion,    

508
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:24,195
           put it in half again.

509
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:25,596
  That's all going              
       on one?                  

510
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:27,731
               Nice full meal   
                  for you.      

511
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,901
Into the braising liquid        
   that's reduced.              
       Into the braising liquid.

512
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,872
              And that is ready 
                for plating.    

513
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,340
            Toasted brioche bun.

514
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,875
         We have our short ribs.

515
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:41,278
        Just gonna go right down
                 on the bun.    

516
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,213
              Just a little bit 
                   of this      

517
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,683
       beautiful braising liquid
                over the top.   

518
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,118
       Make it nice and juicy --
               messy for you.   

519
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,289
    I want to see               
     this thing.                

520
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,090
    Look at that!               

521
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,859
 It just cut through            
    like butter.                

522
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,766
  Wow. It is rich.              

523
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,368
      It's got                  
 real texture to it.            

524
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,637
It's so nice to have            
the crunch of the onion,        

525
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,639
sweet of that tomato and        
the lettuce all coming through. 

526
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,041
But that braising liquid        
      reduced?                  

527
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,643
         Oh!                    

528
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,247
 You delivered.                 
                  Thank you.    

529
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:17,448
   Well done.                   
                 Appreciate it. 

530
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,183
        Mmm!                    

531
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,451
            Short rib burger up.

532
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:21,786
                 That burger    
                  was nuts.     

533
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:24,054
      Oh, man, this burger,     
  you can't get anywhere else.  

534
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,523
     It's tender as can be.     

535
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,024
      The sauce is amazing.     

536
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,261
  It's one of the go-to joints  
           in Denver?           

537
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:31,595
             I believe so, yeah.

538
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,064
          There you go.         
            My twin.            

539

      I need you to fill in

          So, that's it         
       for this road trip,      

542
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:44,675
   but don't worry -- we got    
   plenty more joints to find

     all over this country.
