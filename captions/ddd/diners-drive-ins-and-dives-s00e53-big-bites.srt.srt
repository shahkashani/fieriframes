1
00:00:01,769 --> 00:00:03,068
Hey, I'm Guy Fieri,
 and you know what I need?

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,671
I need you riding shotgun! I'm
 on my way to Flavortown!

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:09,174
This is "Diners,
  Drive-ins & Dives."

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,076
This trip...
     Ah, hot!

5
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:12,511
We're living large...

6
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,480
Which is bigger,
   the pancake or my head?

7
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:16,181
And going supersized.

8
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,417
Just look at
    the cascading joy.

9
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:20,419
We've got piled-up
  Cincinnati chili...

10
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:22,388
Just went from
   ridiculous to crazy.

11
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,890
Michigan burgers
  stacked to the max...

12
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,458
I don't know where
  to post up on this thing.

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,660
Big-time breakfast
   near Chicago...

14
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,429
Just the food alone
    is three pounds.

15
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:33,032
And a bomb Baltimore
   beef joint...

16
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:35,534
Is there anything wrong
 with this picture?

17
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,871
Where I'm making my boy Duff
  a skyscraper sandwich.

18
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:41,573
Look at the bite
     out of it!

19
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:45,144
That's all right here
 right now on "Triple D."

20
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:57,189
On "Triple D," when we hit
a historic place like Baltimore,

21
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:59,024
well, we've got to use
  the inside track

22
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:01,560
of a buddy who lives here,
 so regardless of the weather

23
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,228
or how busy this dude is,

24
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,764
we're at Charm City Cakes
 to talk to the cake bad boy,

25
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:08,667
Duff Goldman, and find out one
 of this favorite joints.

26
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,036
Call the cops.
Is this where the magic happens?

27
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,271
How you doing?
    Nice to see you.

28
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:14,006
Good to see you.
So you open up the bakery.

29
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:15,274
You've been doing
 this thing here.

30
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:16,675
But you really come
from a culinary background,

31
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:19,745
not just a background
of making incredible cakes.

32
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,047
I've been a cook
   for almost 20 years.

33
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,515
I come to Baltimore,

34
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:26,452
I want to try some
iconic Baltimore food.

35
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:27,920
Locals know,
   got to get pit beef.

36
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:29,521
So where's the best
 place to get it?

37
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:31,056
I think probably Chaps.
 Chaps.

38
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:32,724
Let's get some pit beef.
   All right, let's do it.

39
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:34,460
Oh, sweet.
 Isn't that nice?

40
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:36,261
Come on, let me drive.
     Seriously.

41
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,030
Seriously, can I?
      No.

42
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:40,232
Ah, come on.
 I didn't get to make any cake.

43
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,533
But when we get there,

44
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:43,735
I'll be sure to make Duff
   a Fieri-style

45
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,204
mile-high masterpiece.

46
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:46,505
This is the famous Chaps.

47
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:48,774
This is Chaps.
    Look at that.

48
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,643
You come to Baltimore,
this is what you better see.

49
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,345
And if you don't,
    it's not pit beef.

50
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,480
The charcoal, the pit beef,

51
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:55,681
you're not going to
  get it nowhere else.

52
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:57,449
One medium-rare beef
     on a roll.

53
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,785
It is so tender.
   Just falls right apart.

54
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,453
I'm going to need
    three pit beef.

55
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,754
Done the way you want...

56
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:03,989
Medium-well
 and a medium-rare.

57
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,124
Then sliced thin...

58
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:07,459
Oh, look at that.
   And piled high.

59
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,027
Best pit beef I ever had.

60
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:10,295
It started 21 years ago

61
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,264
when Bob and Donna Creager
   got married.

62
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:15,067
As a wedding gift, my father
gave me this little shack.

63
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,969
For lawn tools,
or what was the reason?

64
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:20,272
Well, no, he said since
 my husband loved to cook,

65
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:23,142
we should put a pit beef stand
 outside of his nightclub.

66
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:25,744
Fry and a rare.
  We started just a grill

67
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,946
and exhaust system
   and a register.

68
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,248
And learned real quick...

69
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,582
Two beef on a roll.
 Thank you.

70
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,017
Bringing in so many fans,

71
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,619
they had to add on
   a dining room.

72
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,020
Is this the best
   pit beef in Baltimore?

73
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,256
Yes, it is.

74
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:38,957
Now, this is...
   It's a bottom round.

75
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,926
You put about six of these
   on to start the day.

76
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,761
And you can smell it
   from as early

77
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,563
as probably 6:00
   in the morning.

78
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:46,431
Put this straight on the grill,
    just like it is.

79
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,966
400, 500 hundred
    degrees usually.

80
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,635
Baker boy, what do you think?
That's about right.

81
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:51,970
That'll melt the gold.
  Where'd your bling go?

82
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,306
Can you get part medium-rare
  and part well-done?

83
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,807
Here? You can get
    whatever you want.

84
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,376
A medium and a medium-rare.

85
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:58,577
They're both rare? Good.
      Yes, sir.

86
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,711
I like rare
 more than anything.

87
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,947
Pulling it rare, cut it.

88
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,949
Look at that!
Now, in about 15 minutes,

89
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:05,517
you're ready to start
 working then.

90
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,120
What're we going to make first?
We'll make a beef sandwich.

91
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:10,122
You can do it.
 Come on, now. Keep pushing it.

92
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:12,524
It got to the point where
 it's really on the rare side.

93
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,193
I mean, we're almost
  tartare right there.

94
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,360
So that goes
 back on the grill.

95
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,495
And then we'll bring
 another piece out.

96
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:17,896
So this is like
  tag-team meat slicing.

97
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,265
Exactly.
 Hey, look at that over there.

98
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:23,835
Oh, what?
   Check that out.

99
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:24,870
Ah.

100
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,272
Now, what do you like
  to put on these?

101
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,441
little horseradish
  on there.

102
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,376
You know, I like
  the little char to it,

103
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,045
but I've got to say,
  the medley of the --

104
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,846
the white onion,

105
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,949
the really nice,
  bright horseradish,

106
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:38,350
a little bit of salt and pepper,

107
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,152
a great roll,
  not too much bread.

108
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:41,253
I hate when you get
   too much bread

109
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,387
and it starts to become...

110
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,555
Nah, it's all
 about the meat.
    Right.

111
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,790
Welcome to Baltimore.

112
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,692
It's spicy, it's moist.

113
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,093
The meat is so tender.

114
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,062
I give it way past a 10.

115
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,563
And there's way more than beef.

116
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,333
If you want a variety,
   the ham, the turkey.

117
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:57,035
I like it.
  And then of course sausage,
     too.

118
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,937
Oh, yeah. What do you got there,
 meat wizard?

119
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,305
Corned beef.
 Yep, they're even pit-grilling

120
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,774
the corned beef
  for killer Reubens

121
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,776
and combos any way you want,

122
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:08,046
and I'm going to be going for
  large and extra-large.

123
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,481
I think we should have it
  every single way

124
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,482
you can possibly make it.

125
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,551
My favorite is the bulldog.

126
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:13,952
A couple slices of cheese,

127
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,622
and we put the sausage on,
 put the beef on.

128
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,023
Get up underneath it like this.

129
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,791
Bring your shoulders
  to protect yourself

130
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,393
when you're at the counter.

131
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,795
You come into my town
 and teach me how to bulldog?

132
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,297
I didn't think the pit beef
  could get any better.

133
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:27,899
It's got a little
  sausage kicker. Mm.

134
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,669
This one's got pit beef,
  ham, and corned beef.

135
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,971
Is there anything wrong
  with this picture?

136
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,840
Actually, no, there's not.

137
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:37,476
When the bread won't
  even wrap around...

138
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:44,082
That is so much flavor,
  sweetness of the ham,

139
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:47,786
that briny, pickle-y spice
  on the corned beef,

140
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,423
and then just a nice smoky
 flavor from the pit beef.

141
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:54,226
This is like sandwich
   engineering right here.

142
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:55,394
Good mouth feel.

143
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:56,995
It is, good mouth feel.

144
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:59,131
You so want a bite of this,
   don't you?

145
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,866
Mm.
    This is great, man.

146
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,401
Well, I like everything
  they got in here.

147
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:05,304
I need a breaded chicken
 barbecue for Colin.

148
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:08,607
They've got the best smoky
 flavor in the whole town.

149
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:10,309
You make these
 great combos.

150
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:12,311
Now, can I custom-build
 my own combo?

151
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,079
Oh, absolutely.
 For my boy Duff?

152
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,981
Sure.
  Yeah?

153
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,215
We'll start with the beef.

154
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:19,151
Some jalapeños down,
    the horseradish.

155
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,652
Okay, now put
    the ham up there.

156
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,721
Cut the burger in half.
    Nacho cheese sauce.

157
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,122
Sausage.
     Pickles.

158
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,391
Little chopped beef, turkey.
  Where are you, Duffinator?

159
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:31,163
My brother, just look
   at the cascading joy.

160
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,531
There you go.
    There's a champion.

161
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,099
Let's cut this in half.
 No, no, no. Don't cut it.

162
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,534
No?
  Don't. If you cut it,

163
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:38,470
it's going to explode.

164
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,739
Look at the bite
    out of that!

165
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,575
Make sure you don't
   lose anything.

166
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,478
Get over here.

167
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,380
Oh, he goes for a double bite.

168
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:49,848
What cheese?
  You got something --

169
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,184
Is there anything right here?
    No, you look fine.

170
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:58,190
Coming up, a funky diner
 in Springfield, Illinois...

171
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,559
Whoa!
   Putting out
  pizza-sized pancakes...

172
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:01,927
That'll make you proud.

173
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:05,197
And a regional favorite that's
 way more than a plateful.

174
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,832
There's no reason
you should leave here hungry

175
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,166
with something like this.
     No, sirree.

176
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,106
So now I'm going to
  take you to a joint

177
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,475
that was an airplane hangar
  in World War II.

178
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:17,909
Then it become a town hall,

179
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:21,446
then, of course,
 it evolved into a restaurant.

180
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,482
Did I mention it's
   a Quonset hut?

181
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,283
Eating good food
 in a Quonset hut.

182
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:27,352
Well, works for me.

183
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:29,221
Quonset huts were the big
  silver buildings

184
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:32,424
the Army put up all over the
 country in the '40s and '50s.

185
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,693
Half a century later,
 in Springfield, Illinois,

186
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:37,662
this one's still standing
 as Charlie Parker's diner.

187
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,698
Robin, small pancake.

188
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,966
Did you buy the building?

189
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,267
Yes.
   Girls, order.

190
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,902
My husband and I
 had come in here

191
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,071
when it was
a restaurant previously.

192
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,540
He said, "You know, I think
we can do better than this."

193
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:49,808
Hash brown.

194
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,410
And I said, "You know,
I think you're right."

195
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:52,744
And my Reuben basket
    and small cake.

196
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,446
So when the restaurant
  became available,

197
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,748
Brenda Shirley
 and her husband made an offer.

198
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,451
You have what experience
  in the restaurant business?

199
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:00,786
None.
   Just a dream.

200
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:01,787
Do you love to cook?
 I love to cook.

201
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,021
And they made it work.

202
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,890
Hot sauce or anything, boys?

203
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:07,826
Cranking out big plates,
 like the Reuben sandwich,

204
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:10,996
homemade stuffed pork chops,
  overstuffed omelettes,

205
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,665
and a local specialty
 you can only find around here

206
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,435
that a friend of mine told me
  I've just got to try.

207
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:19,304
T-ray, Thomas Ray,
 one of my fraternity brothers,

208
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:20,372
and he said,
    "You know what?

209
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:21,506
On 'Diners,
    Drive-ins & Dives,'

210
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,074
you've got to try the..."

211
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,376
Horseshoe.
  Two pieces of toast,

212
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:25,877
a piece of ham on it,

213
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,346
and the ham is cut
  in a horseshoe shape,

214
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:29,781
and then a cheese sauce.

215
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,284
Then french fries
   were put on top

216
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,718
as the nails in the horseshoe.

217
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,854
Wow.
Hamburger shoe.

218
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,789
Cheese sauce.
Some other folks
   will tell your

219
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,025
the first shoe was actually
  made with hamburgers.

220
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:41,793
There you go, girls.
   But these days,

221
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,662
they'll make 'em
 with just about anything.

222
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,130
I prefer the sausage gravy.

223
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,967
The breakfast shoe, they all get
  two pieces of toast.

224
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,803
The scramble.
 Now he's going to add the eggs.

225
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,772
Bacon.
    Look at that.

226
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,640
There's no reason
you should leave here hungry

227
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,576
with something like this.
      No, sirree.

228
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,311
Half cheese,
     half gravy.

229
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:03,081
Oh, it's delicious.
   And the American fries.

230
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:07,185
You've got one breakfast shoe.
   Do you have a scale?

231
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,154
Just the food alone
    is three pounds.

232
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,556
I'm not going to have to eat
 anything the rest of the day.

233
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,525
It's not just the shoes
  that are big here.

234
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,527
Get a load of the pancakes.

235
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:16,895
That's a big pancake.

236
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:19,064
16-inch pancake.
      16-inch?

237
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,432
Did you know what
you were getting into?

238
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,434
I didn't.
That'll make you proud!

239
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:24,135
And how many
    ounces of batter

240
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,171
do we put down
    for the mondo cake?

241
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,206
About 18 ounces.

242
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,641
Which is bigger,
   the pancake or my head?

243
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,276
And way too much.

244
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:33,545
But in this big hut
  of big plates...

245
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:35,380
You can eat that, can't you?
Oh, yeah.

246
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,549
The king of the hill
  is still the shoe.

247
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,984
Probably eat half of it.

248
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,086
I cut it up and hope
   for the best.

249
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,088
I could eat 'em for breakfast,
 lunch, and supper.

250
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,190
I've got to make a special
    shoe for a buddy.
 Okay.

251
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,425
Let's make one of
    those big pancakes,

252
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,594
ham steak, burger patty.

253
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:54,633
How exactly will
    we be moving this?

254
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,268
Slide it under quick
 so it don't stick.

255
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,469
There you are.

256
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:58,770
Hoh!
Very nice.

257
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,071
That's a biggun'.

258
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,940
The ham, the patty.
Do you want eggs on this?

259
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,575
How 'bout three scrambled?
 Three scrambled?

260
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:04,743
Very nice!

261
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,711
What do we serve this on,
    a trash can lid?

262
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,347
We've got a pizza tray.
    Wow, that's hot.

263
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,383
Sausage and bacon temple.

264
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:12,484
Oh, yeah.
    I mean, you know...

265
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:13,718
You've got to fit
the pallet there, yeah.

266
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,453
Right in the middle.
    There we go.

267
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,990
Because this side is more of
   the lunch-y side of it.

268
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,191
Right.

269
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,160
Just hit that
    with some of that.

270
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:25,263
Oh. Hot!

271
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,265
We've got to get all
  three potatoes on there.

272
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,934
He is so going to
  thank me.

273
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:31,169
I don't like to shake off
any of the excess oil.

274
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,305
Throw that on there.
  I think it looks beautiful.

275
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:34,573
You think we should
 just go for it?

276
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:38,777
Go for it.

277
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,046
This is the whole
 horseshoe sandwich.

278
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:42,614
Happy horseshoing.
 Yes.

279
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:44,816
That should at least
   cover you till lunch.

280
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,752
I'll still be
 eating it at lunch.

281
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,590
It's been two hours.
     How are ya?

282
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:54,426
Come on,
   loosen that shirt up.

283
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,561
Get in there, son.

284
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:59,764
Up next, a Cincinnati spot
  where chili is king.

285
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,733
I could eat that six
   or seven times a week.

286
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:04,002
And they're definitely not shy
  with their servings.

287
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,170
Then all you have to do
     is invite

288
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:06,605
15 of your best friends
   over to come eat it.

289
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,644
Texas has its brisket.

290
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,479
California has tacos.

291
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,014
Memphis has barbecue.

292
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,649
New England has chowder.

293
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,184
What does Cincinnati have?

294
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:22,120
That's right,
  Cincinnati-style chili.

295
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,322
Now, Cincinnatians
  go through more than

296
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,358
two million pounds
  of chili a year,

297
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,894
topped with over
 850,000 pounds of cheese.

298
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,029
Now, there's been
   a big debate --

299
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,731
who made it first
  and who makes it best?

300
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,599
Well, everybody
  has their opinion,

301
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,535
but a lot of you wrote in
  and sent me to a place

302
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:38,803
that I've never even heard of --

303
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,873
Blue Ash Chili,
 15 miles north of Cincinnati,

304
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,442
and my question now is,
 am I going to have it two-way,

305
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,579
four-way, five-way,
 or at this joint, six-way?

306
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:48,780
Got a six-way.

307
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,615
'Cause stacking chili
   on spaghetti...

308
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:51,683
Two-way chili coming up.

309
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:54,035
Is something folks
  grow up with here.

310
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:54,736
u nywhere
   in Cincinnati and say,

311
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,237
il
  Is something folks
  grow uI'm getting onions,

312
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,505
I'm getting beans,
    I'm getting cheese.

313
00:10:57,507 --> 00:10:59,207
Correct.
  And here at Blue Ash...

314
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:00,709
Bowl of chili.
    The chili hasn't
    changed at all.

315
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:02,677
Not since this joint
   first opened...

316
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,779
Chili to go.
   Back in '69.

317
00:11:04,781 --> 00:11:06,414
The original Greek owners,
 it's their recipe,

318
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,816
and it's been in their family
 for a long time.

319
00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:09,851
And when restaurant vets
   Nick Insco...

320
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:12,320
Cheese Coney.
  And his wife Charlene
  bought the place...

321
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:15,857
Hi, there.
 They bought the chili recipe
  right along with it.

322
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:17,759
It's a unique flavor.
    It's terrific.

323
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,327
When I see something like this,

324
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:22,163
I know that you're
  either feeding the troops

325
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:25,533
or we are going to make
    a mess of chili.

326
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:26,901
Absolutely,
but we're going to start off

327
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:28,203
with about a hundred pounds
 of ground beef.

328
00:11:28,205 --> 00:11:29,738
A hundred pounds?
Yep.

329
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,972
Fresh ground,
    never frozen?

330
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:32,407
Correct.
   Fill it up with water.

331
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:33,808
We'll just stir it
 to a slurry.

332
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,610
Now we add salt,
 garlic powder.

333
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,379
How long is this going to cook?
Two hours.

334
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:40,682
You've never seen
 a hundred pounds of meat boil.

335
00:11:40,684 --> 00:11:42,951
That's On Golden Meat Pond.
 It is.

336
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,953
Its got to be around
250 degrees, at least.

337
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,054
So now what goes in?

338
00:11:46,056 --> 00:11:47,522
Now we put in the onions,
 tomato paste...

339
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:49,290
That'll put some
    nice color in this.

340
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,592
And then chili spice mix.

341
00:11:50,594 --> 00:11:53,395
Paprika, tomato powder,
   cumin, black pepper,

342
00:11:53,397 --> 00:11:55,029
cinnamon, salt.
Correct.

343
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:56,898
But you won't tell me
    the portions.

344
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,100
Got that right.
 Or the last two ingredients.

345
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:01,269
All we do is just stir it up.
   How long does this go?

346
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:02,837
That's going to go for
about an hour and a half.

347
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:04,372
Now we're going to go ahead
 and open up the lid

348
00:12:04,374 --> 00:12:05,740
and put in the slurry mix.

349
00:12:05,742 --> 00:12:07,675
Now, the slurry mix is water
    and cracker meal,

350
00:12:07,677 --> 00:12:09,210
and that's going to help
   tighten the chili up.

351
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:10,678
Correct.
Right now, we'll go ahead

352
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,046
and set up
for another 45 minutes

353
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:13,248
and allow it
 to steep overnight.

354
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,816
It stays above 140 degrees,
    so it's safe,

355
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,618
and it just sits here
  and melds all the flavors.

356
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,819
Correct.
    I hear that there's

357
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,955
a lot of turf wars
    here in Cincinnati,

358
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:22,457
and where do you think
    you stand in this?

359
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:23,892
I think we have
the best chili in town.

360
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:25,894
And Blue Ash takes it
   even further.

361
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:27,896
Six-way.
Six-way, we top it off

362
00:12:27,898 --> 00:12:29,564
with our beer-battered
jalapeño bottle caps.

363
00:12:29,566 --> 00:12:31,366
So these are your pickled
    jalapeño peppers.

364
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:32,901
Correct.
 Build me a six-way, brother.

365
00:12:32,903 --> 00:12:34,669
Start off with your spaghetti,
  chili.

366
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:35,870
All right,
   so now it's a two-way.

367
00:12:35,872 --> 00:12:37,572
Now it's a two-way.
Onions, kidney beans.

368
00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:39,040
We're going to go ahead
and top it off with cheese.

369
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:41,576
Whoa, whoa!
 Beer-battered
jalapeño bottle caps.

370
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:43,211
It just went from
   ridiculous to crazy.

371
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:45,346
Look at that bite
    right there. Mm.

372
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,081
The chili has
   a unique spice to it.

373
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,316
The onions
    are nice and fresh.

374
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:49,551
And the pasta really works,

375
00:12:49,553 --> 00:12:51,653
cooked al dente,
  which I think is critical.

376
00:12:51,655 --> 00:12:53,588
Having the beans in there,
    there's a texture

377
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,457
that you expect
    to see in chili,

378
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:56,991
but the beans are
  a little bit more whole.

379
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:58,560
Right.
    Then you put

380
00:12:58,562 --> 00:12:59,994
a ridiculous amount
    of cheese on it.

381
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:02,030
That's a great way to do chili.
      Mm.

382
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,164
I could eat that six
   or seven times a week.

383
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,532
Got a six-way to table 30.

384
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,401
The spaghetti and the chili
 is a great mixture.

385
00:13:06,403 --> 00:13:08,369
The jalapeños really
 adds a kick to it.

386
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,537
Tons of cheese.

387
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,905
What else can you
   possibly do with chili?

388
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:13,308
We do a chili Philly as well.
   He's trying to hurt me.

389
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,709
Now selling Philly chili.

390
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,811
Regular Philly cheesesteak,
 they load it up with chili.

391
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:18,513
And homemade roast beef.

392
00:13:18,515 --> 00:13:20,582
Top round. Now, how are we
going to season it up?

393
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:21,950
Start off with cracked
    black pepper,

394
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:24,385
the oregano,
 dehydrated onions, kosher salt,

395
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,821
thyme, crushed red pepper,
  and we've got the rosemary.

396
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:28,990
Mix it thoroughly.
Do you dry rub this in there?

397
00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:30,992
We go ahead and pour olive oil
    over the top round

398
00:13:30,994 --> 00:13:32,494
and we do it on both sides.

399
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:34,662
Rub it up.
 Then we'll go ahead and take
   our spice mixture here,

400
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:36,097
going to generously put it
    on both sides.

401
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:38,099
Wrapped up, and how long
    will this marinate?

402
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:39,367
This'll marinate overnight.

403
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:41,102
Let it sit for a little bit,
    then roast at what?

404
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:42,804
We roast it at 275
  for about 4, 4 1/2 hours,

405
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:44,305
depending on the size
    and the weight.

406
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:46,441
Let it rest.
Cut it half and throw it
 in the slicers.

407
00:13:46,443 --> 00:13:47,909
We're going for
a thin slice of meat.

408
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,777
Look at how thin that is.

409
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:52,213
We're about to medium there.
How are we going to heat it up?

410
00:13:52,215 --> 00:13:53,915
Fresh baked bun
   with some butter on it,

411
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,583
little weight on it,
 get a nice crisp on there.

412
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,785
Throw down our roast beef.
   Little salt and pepper.

413
00:13:57,787 --> 00:13:59,921
Going to season that meat off,
saute the green peppers,

414
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,222
red peppers,
 and some onions.

415
00:14:01,224 --> 00:14:03,658
Sauteed mushrooms that are
sauteed with butter and whiskey.

416
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,693
There you go. So it's a typical
    Philly cheesesteak.

417
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:07,662
Yep. We're going to lay
our provolone cheese over it.

418
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:09,264
Wow, you're really
    building that up.

419
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,833
Put the steam lid over there.
    Little steam helps
    melt the cheese.

420
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:13,101
Absolutely.
   Then all you have to do

421
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,536
is invite 15 of your
    best friends over

422
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:15,803
to come eat it.
 That's right.

423
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:16,938
Take our bun off
 the grill there.

424
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,740
Got that, you're making
    that look easy.

425
00:14:18,742 --> 00:14:19,841
Now the chili.

426
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:20,975
Now we're going to ladle
 the chili over.

427
00:14:20,977 --> 00:14:22,911
This is wrong.
That's our chili Philly.

428
00:14:22,913 --> 00:14:24,913
How much does it weigh?
    Three pounds?

429
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:27,248
A good couple pounds.

430
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,051
Ah. The Philly
    on its own, tasty.

431
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:32,654
Nice toasted bun,
   fresh veggies in there.

432
00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:34,222
The chili,
    it was ridiculous.

433
00:14:34,224 --> 00:14:37,191
You're showing Cincinnati chili
 can go on just about anything.

434
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:39,727
A chili Philly with fries.
I'm a big cheesesteak fan,

435
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:41,996
and if you add
chili to the top of it...

436
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:43,831
Icing on the cake.
 Philadelphia meets
  Cincinnati.

437
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:44,966
The Bengals
    play the Eagles.

438
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,501
Looks like the Bengals
are winning, though.

439
00:14:46,503 --> 00:14:48,770
They're just smothering
    the competition.

440
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:50,738
We've got chili
     cheese fry.
  It's outstanding.

441
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,173
This is my cousin,
     Gene Bob.

442
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:54,309
This guy can eat.
   Take his word for it.

443
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,277
Six-way chili.
  It's the best.

444
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,612
We just make it
  with love every day.

445
00:14:57,614 --> 00:14:59,314
You guys to continue to keep
knocking out the chili.

446
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,315
Thank you.
    Thank you.

447
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,649
Good job, buddy.
    Thanks.

448
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,085
Coming up, a crazy spot
 in Ann Arbor, Michigan...

449
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:06,087
Dave, Dave, Dave!
    Dave, Dave, Dave!

450
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:07,655
Where folks are
  eating burgers 10...

451
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,325
10 patties?
  Or even 20 at a time.

452
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,994
Just keep my hands and feet
 inside the ride at all times.

453
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,334
So when I'm cruising the quad
 at the University of Michigan

454
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,436
in my Mac '67 Camaro,

455
00:15:21,438 --> 00:15:23,938
a question comes to mind --
  where should I eat?

456
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,540
Now, if you ask anybody
  in the student body

457
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:27,609
where to go for the bomb burger,

458
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:30,912
they're going to say
 Crazy Jim's Blimpy Burger,

459
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:32,313
where piling down patties

460
00:15:32,315 --> 00:15:34,916
has become
 a collegiate competition.

461
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:36,884
Regular buns, regular buns.
 What you having, girlfriend?

462
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:38,853
I need two doubles.
 It's the burger you can get.

463
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,021
Mm.

464
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,689
It just tastes better
    than anything else.

465
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,924
Who's next?

466
00:15:42,926 --> 00:15:44,759
You love the Blimpy,
     don't ya?

467
00:15:44,761 --> 00:15:45,793
What do you want?

468
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:47,261
I want a bacon,
   lettuce, and tomato.

469
00:15:47,263 --> 00:15:48,563
A B.L. what?

470
00:15:48,565 --> 00:15:50,264
At this joint,
 you may know what you want.

471
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:51,766
No, like, I want
   hamburger with bacon,

472
00:15:51,768 --> 00:15:54,335
lettuce, and tomato.
   No, no!

473
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:56,504
But you better know
   how to say it.

474
00:15:56,506 --> 00:15:57,839
You want a double
with bacon on it, okay?

475
00:15:57,841 --> 00:15:59,107
Yes, that's what I want.
There you go.

476
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:00,108
That's what you want.

477
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,843
And you've got to
   order in order.

478
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:04,912
What you having, sir?
  Sides, then size.

479
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:06,414
How many patties
did you say you wanted?

480
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,715
Then grilled toppings
   and bun...

481
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,183
And you have nothing
grilled on yours, sir?

482
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:10,485
No.
  Why not?

483
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:12,787
Before you even think
 about choosing your cheese.

484
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:13,955
American.

485
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:15,423
What I want to know is,
  do you want a bun?

486
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:17,158
That's real important to me.
  God, I'm nervous for you.

487
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,360
I know!
  I'm about ready to have
  a nervous breakdown,

488
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:21,496
and I've only made two patties.

489
00:16:21,498 --> 00:16:22,664
Yeah!

490
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,899
Divvy Askew's been
  doing this forever.

491
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,501
I just love this job.

492
00:16:26,503 --> 00:16:27,702
I'm going to cook meat,
     I got you.

493
00:16:27,704 --> 00:16:29,404
I got you, baby.
How long you been doing this?

494
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,439
Uh, I was 14 when
   I started working here.

495
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:33,641
Alongside Rich Magner...
    What do you want
    on your burger?

496
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:35,276
Who was a college kid
   at the time.

497
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:38,379
And I worked part-time
off and on for four years.

498
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:39,981
When Rich came back
  and bought the place

499
00:16:39,983 --> 00:16:43,751
more than two decades later,
 he changed almost nothing...

500
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,553
Yes.
 From ordering etiquette...

501
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:47,689
Anything thrown extra on it?
   No, ma'am, thank you.

502
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:49,357
It's not the military.

503
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:50,425
"Yes, sir. No, ma'am."

504
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:51,659
To the burgers themselves.

505
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:53,027
Single or double?

506
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:55,763
From singles
  to a stack of five,

507
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,398
or any size you want.

508
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,933
Can I get 10
    on a kaiser?

509
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,234
You go, baby!

510
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:02,203
With almost 30 toppings,
   cheeses,

511
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:03,337
and buns to chose from...

512
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:04,772
What are you having
  on this?

513
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,474
The possibilities
  will fry your brain.

514
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:08,076
I got a quad on onion
  with bacon.

515
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:10,144
Triple with bacon,
    banana pepper.

516
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:12,680
Double on onion,
 Swiss cheese,

517
00:17:12,682 --> 00:17:14,382
banana peppers,
pickles, and ketchup.

518
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:15,783
Anything grilled extra
   while I'm cooking it?

519
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,252
No, thank you.
  Good. I don't want to
   do it, anyway.

520
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:19,787
And don't be fooled
  by the floor show.

521
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,890
Lean back. Hey!
   These are
  the real-deal burgers.

522
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:24,759
Outstanding.
    Absolutely awesome.

523
00:17:24,761 --> 00:17:26,828
And the real foundation,
 you believe, of this meat

524
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,796
is it's fresh ground
  by you everyday?

525
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,967
Yeah.
Now we're going to make them
into the 10 balls per pound,

526
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,103
which is 1.6 ounces a ball.

527
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:37,171
That's right,
   it's 8 ounces for 5,

528
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:38,906
which is
    16 ounces for 10.

529
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:41,375
'Cause we go through easily
    500 pounds of meat.

530
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:43,711
500 pounds.
  That's two tons a month.

531
00:17:43,713 --> 00:17:45,413
Some are quints,
    some are doubles.

532
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:46,581
Okay, what kind of burger
   would you like?

533
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,183
Let me get a double
 with hot peppers,

534
00:17:49,185 --> 00:17:51,052
onions on pumpernickel.

535
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:53,488
I need a triple bacon,
  sesame bun.

536
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,289
She has no idea what's coming.

537
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,726
Can I get a quint,
  onions, peppers, bacon,

538
00:17:58,728 --> 00:18:00,261
salami, and mushrooms.

539
00:18:00,263 --> 00:18:03,731
Yes. If I forget it,
    you just eat it.

540
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:04,899
Look at that.

541
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:06,234
Mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup,
 lettuce, pickle,

542
00:18:06,236 --> 00:18:07,735
onion, and relish.
 Here you go.

543
00:18:07,737 --> 00:18:10,972
Baby burger,
    mommy burger,

544
00:18:10,974 --> 00:18:13,908
with the little one, huh?ar

545
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:18,880
Mm. That meat
    is so tender.

546
00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:22,116
Wow, that's tasty, with
 the cheddar and the peppers.

547
00:18:22,118 --> 00:18:23,384
The beauty
 is layering it.

548
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:26,287
You get all your flavors
mingling just the right way.

549
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:30,424
I don't know where to
   post up on this thing.

550
00:18:30,426 --> 00:18:33,494
Look at
   the festival of funk.

551
00:18:33,496 --> 00:18:37,131
So much salami,
    call my mommy.

552
00:18:41,838 --> 00:18:44,872
That's one of our biggest
expenses, is the napkins.

553
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,308
Delicious and messy.

554
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,544
Next.
And you better
 be ready to pack 'em away.

555
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,946
Triple with bacon, egg,
cheese, grilled onions.

556
00:18:51,948 --> 00:18:53,214
Let's see,
    there's the single,

557
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,883
the double, the triple,
  the quad, and the quint.

558
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,285
But why stop at five?

559
00:18:57,287 --> 00:18:58,653
10 patties?

560
00:18:58,655 --> 00:19:01,889
Mushroom, onion,
 Swiss cheese.

561
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,258
I'll just keep my hands and feet
 inside the ride at all times.

562
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,328
Turns out, there's a whole
 competition thing going on.

563
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,297
Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave!
And we don't promote this.

564
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:10,965
No, no no no.
  The record stands

565
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:12,700
at a little over four pounds.

566
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:14,402
And no one's
  breaking that today,

567
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,304
but records are still at risk.

568
00:19:16,306 --> 00:19:19,106
There's a double snack bite
  with a pull-away cheese.

569
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:22,343
Dave Williams is going for
  a personal best of 20.

570
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:23,678
How you feeling right now?
Hungry.

571
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,413
Hungry.
    Oh, you're hungry?

572
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,415
Get the forehead.
Get the pit crew in here.

573
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,383
Some girls showed up
     right here.

574
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:32,353
Her 21st birthday,
 looks like she looks over 21.

575
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:34,088
And Lauren Lobert
     is serious.

576
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,724
I'm a hockey player and I'm a --
   I'm an eater.

577
00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:38,092
What's the most you've done?

578
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,862
Um, 10 in 7 minutes,

579
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:42,997
and some french fries
 and dessert.

580
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:45,366
But today,
  for her 21st birthday,

581
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:48,703
Lauren Lobert's
  going for 21 burgers.

582
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:50,538
I'm doing three sevens.
     Three sevens?

583
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,807
Yeah, seven, 14, 21.

584
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:54,308
Are you really going to
    be able to do 21?

585
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,777
Oh, for sure.
  I think I'm in love.

586
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,846
That is one juicy-looking
    burger, though.

587
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:00,781
Delicious.

588
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,017
Dave, Dave, Dave!
    Dave, Dave, Dave!

589
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:05,786
Round of applause.
     20 patties.

590
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:09,757
He got his 20,
 but she's still chasing 21.

591
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:11,525
I see the end is near.

592
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:12,593
You got it. Do it.

593
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:16,564
Lauren, Lauren,
Lauren, Lauren, Lauren!

594
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:20,434
Okay, that's it.

595
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:22,870
Am I catching some
   eye water over here?

596
00:20:22,872 --> 00:20:25,740
I'm crying
because I'm so happy.

597
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:27,808
Don't leave me hanging.

598
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,944
So was that another
 righteous road trip or what?

599
00:20:29,946 --> 00:20:31,579
But don't you worry.

600
00:20:31,581 --> 00:20:34,215
We've got plenty more joints
 to find all over this country.

601
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:35,883
I'll be looking
  for you next week

602
00:20:35,885 --> 00:20:38,586
on "Diners,
  Drive-ins & Dives."

603
00:20:38,588 --> 00:20:40,554
She's an athlete.
  We have
hockey practice tonight.

604
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:42,056
You have hockey
    practice tonight?

605
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:44,825
I'm just going to tell my coach
 I have the flu or something.

606
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,361
The flu.
