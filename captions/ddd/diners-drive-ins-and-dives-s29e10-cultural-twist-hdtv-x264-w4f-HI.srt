00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:39,611
             -I do.
     -The General's chicken.

136
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,179
    You did a great job, man.

137
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,681
     The flavors are killer.

138
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,449
So if you're going to come
to a funky Chinese joint

139
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,019
in New Orleans, you should
invite three funky brothers.

140
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:48,287
First, from Motley Cue,

141
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,821
 the barbecue team,
  the one and only

142
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:52,591
   Onion, the one
and only Panini Pete,

143
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,926
and then from my favorite
  New Orleans band

144
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,461
 Cowboy Mouth, Fred.

145
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,297
     So, tell me
about Red's Chinese.

146
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,033
   This is like a multi-cultural
     Mardis Gras for your mouth.

147
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:02,234
                 I love it.

148
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:06,471
Here's the deal. I'm going to
have to start stretching it out.

149
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,774
We're hanging out, having
New Orleans-style, funkified,

150
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,108
real-deal Chinese food.

151
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,877
 When we come back,
we're going to make.

152
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,445
                Cheeseburger f--
     Ah-da!

153
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:14,880
                          Sorry.
I'll tell you in a bit.

154
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:16,448
    There you go.
   Get after that.

155
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,649
That's how you do it.

156
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:21,586
         And where are you from?

157
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,121
  From a small town
outside of Madison, Wisconsin,

158
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,657
 called Flavortown.

159
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,059
    Sun Prairie.

160
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:28,327
          [Laughter]

161
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,362
Sun Prairie, Wisconsin.
                    I was going.

162
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:31,897
                 You had me.

163
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:35,400
                     ♪♪

164
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,703
    Welcome back.
"Triple D" hanging out
    in N'Orleans.

165
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,905
We're at a funky joint
called Red's Chinese.

166
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:41,940
Chef Max has rocked out.

167
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,675
    WOMAN: It's an experience
      that sort of gets you

         in New Orleans.

169
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,912
       Alright, guys, coming in.

170
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:50,415
This city is very traditionalist
       with their dishes.

171
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,718
    Red's has had the courage
            to fusion

172
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,586
       New Orleans cuisine
    with a different cuisine.

173
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,522
FIERI: Which means local flavors
     served Chinese-style...

   FIERI: ...and Eastern takes
      on Western classics.

176
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,462
            DARLING:
   Cheeseburger fried rice up!

177
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:06,131
  That's exactly what it is --
    cheeseburger fried rice.

178
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,600
   Pretty much has everything
 that a cheeseburger has in it.

179
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:10,869
 It's almost like a dirty rice.
         It's fantastic.

180
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,471
This is where things are going
to get weird, folks.

181
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:14,206
This is when the New Orleans
 attitude steps in.

182
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,807
             We're going to make
    the cheeseburger fried rice.

183
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,142
But it's going to taste
  like fried rice?

184
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,210
             It's going to taste
            like a cheeseburger.

185
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,378
   In fried rice.

186
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,445
 When you mess with
   the fried rice,

187
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:23,215
   you're messing
  with my emotions.

188
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,783
  So we're going start by making
             the awesome sauce,

189
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,818
  that's this sauce that goes on
        top of the cheeseburger.

190
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,420
 Awesome sauce.
                    Yeah.

191
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:32,924
     We've got pickle chips made
 into a relish, three egg yolks.

192
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,694
     Now I'm going to add minced
        garlic, mushroom powder.

193
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:36,895
      You love
that mushroom powder.

194
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,730
          Drizzling a little bit
                 of soy oil.

195
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,366
   So we just made
pickle-relish-garlic aoili.

196
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,101
                 Absolutely.
    Alright.

197
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:45,971
We're in the awesome zone.

198
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,372
           Now I'm going to fold
               in the ketchup.

199
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:49,941
So, a really fantastic
scratch-made thousand island.

200
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,177
Alright, now we're going to make
    the cheeseburger fried rice.

201
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,446
           We're going to sautee
                some onions.

202
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,181
                      Bacon.
 Copious amounts.

203
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,984
          Now I got ground beef.
Add a little bacon fat in there.

204
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:00,552
       This is where we're going
              to fry the rice.

205
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:02,053
Doesn't get any better
     than this.

206
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:06,291
  White sugar, a bit of mushroom
              powder, lettuce.

207
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,460
        Whoa!
I didn't see that coming.

208
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:11,229
               Roma tomatoes.

209
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,098
             Nacho cheese sauce.

210
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,367
               Awesome sauce.
               Yellow mustard.

211
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:18,670
     Sesame seeds, pickle chips.

212
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,138
How do you eat it?
                  I use a spoon.

213
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,240
You're breaking the rules!
           What rules are there?

214
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,608
      Exactly.

215
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:26,578
 I love fried rice.

216
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,346
               Hawaii Five-0.
You picked it up!

217
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:29,915
Exactly what I said!

218
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,617
Bro, one minute I get a bite
and it's all cheeseburger

219
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,753
    and I'm like,
"Okay, ground up cheeseburger."

220
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,922
The next bite I get is, like,
   all fried rice.

221
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:40,258
You picked the iconic aspects
   of both dishes

222
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,461
and made them really sing.

223
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:43,862
    I can see why
it's such a big hit.

224
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,096
      Spot on!

225
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:49,835
     It tastes like exactly
what its supposed to taste like.

226
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:51,837
        And that ends up
        being delicious.

227
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,439
   The dill pickle on the top
    just makes it authentic.

228
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,808
  Is it fried rice
and a cheeseburger together?

229
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,577
             It's got everything
              but french fries.

230
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,645
Everything but french fries.
    So it passes?

231
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,347
               Oh, I'd say so.

232
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,715
    Pork buns in the window.

233
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:06,585
     It's just a great place
   that is never a bad choice.

00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,019
            FIERI: It's awesome.
              I love the place.

235
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,955
        And you got an open bar,
       you got karaoke at night.

236
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,189
                 This place
              must get rocking.

237
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,225
         It gets weird.
                  It gets weird.

00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,795
  Now, Finn Jr.'s at the helm.

269
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,330
                 Two minutes
              on the schnitzel.

270
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:26,631
     He switched locations,

271
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,967
      but is still carrying
       on his pop's legacy

272
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:32,470
 with this breakfast-lunch joint
  he runs with his wife, Nikki.

273
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:34,406
    That's real,
  real good stuff.

274
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,542
 I'd classify myself
 as an American cafe

275
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,077
with Scandinavian flair.

276
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,445
        Do you speak Norweigian?

277
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:41,680
[Speaking Norwegian]
                        Yatak.

278
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,148
              That's all I have
                 is "Yatak."

279
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,282
One wienerschnitzel.

280
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,684
   WOMAN: The wienerschnitzel
          is very good.

281
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,953
    This is the place to come
           and get it.

282
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,521
      What are we going to make,
                    chef?

283
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,890
We're going to do my brown sauce
for the Wienerschnitzel.

284
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:54,092
I buy an inside round
and I trim it all off.

285
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,627
              You make the meat
           for different dishes,

286
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:58,029
    and then you reserve the jus
     to make for your schnitzel.

287
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,397
      Exactly.

288
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,099
I start with chopped celery,
carrots, sweet garlic.

289
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,535
                    Some garlic.
Onions, tomatoes.

290
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:05,270
                Interesting.
             Mirepoix plus plus.

291
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,772
 Black pepper, salt,
and pickling spices.

292
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,408
You get the roast in,
and more of the seasonings.

293
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,243
          In the oven, how long?
An hour and a half.

294
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,511
     And then we'll take the jus
                 from this,

295
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:15,046
                 and that's
             for the schnitzel.

296
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:18,583
And then I add coffee, burgundy
or red wine, ketchup, and water.

297
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,085
                    Nice.
           See that little move?

298
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,554
Then I get it back in the oven
 and juice it down.

299
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:23,955
           Draining that, and...

300
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,725
Tighten up with our roux
for the schnitzel sauce.

301
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,259
                What's next?

302
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,995
We're seasoning the flour
for wienerschnitzel with salt,

303
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:31,529
crack pepper, and garlic.

304
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,665
                  You love
             that garlic powder.
   I do.

305
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,367
This is a schnitzel,
    and it's done

306
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:36,968
by my father's butcher.

307
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,570
He takes all of his trimmings

308
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:41,072
  and then runs it
through a tenderizer.

309
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,507
                      I love it.
 Dip it in the egg.

310
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,476
And I only dredge it
    on one side.

311
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,378
    Really? I've never seen just
            the one-side dredge.

312
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,380
Yeah, no. I don't want
that much flour on it.

313
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:50,782
   I'm not making
chicken fried steak.

314
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,183
              So that goes down.
    Yeah.

315
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,285
      Flip it over, that's it --
               simple, simple.

316
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:57,622
Then I got some potatoes,
asparagus that I've grilled up,

317
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:00,792
my schnitzel, brown sauce it,
garnish it with a lemon.

318
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:01,960
        And some capers to boot.

319
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,194
        Yeah.

320
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:10,101
 It's a very simple dish, but it
 eats so delicate and so tender.

321
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,137
             You're getting all
            of that rich flavor.

322
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:17,909
    Just the attention to detail
      you take in the schnitzel.

323
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,511
                The perfectly
              cooked asparagus,

324
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,547
          beautiful pan-finished
         finger length potatoes,

325
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,817
    and the piece de resistance,
          really, is this gravy.

326
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:29,220
Try it with some lemon
     and caper.

327
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,022
             As soon as you add
         that little bit of acid

328
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,092
       and the little brightness
         of one of those capers.

329
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,294
            This would be a dish
           I would come to enjoy

330
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,595
         a couple times a month.

331
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,731
                 Fantastic.

332
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,232
        Wienerschnitzel.

333
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,601
         Wienerschnitzel
      has got great flavor.

334
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,704
        It's super-light.
         It's not heavy.

335
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,273
    -It's perfect every time.
         -Capers please.

336
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,341
     It's the little nuances
  that make all the difference.

337
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,776
 Everything's fresh.

338
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,278
I do all my own baking.

339
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,379
                 Wait, wait,
              wait, wait, wait.

340
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,380
   It's tradition.

341
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,815
My dad was a konditor.

342
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,216
                    A konditor?
    Pastry chef.

343
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,319
Konditery is a bakery
   in Scandinavia.

344
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:05,623
I make wheat, rye, sour, French,
    and julekake.

345
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,827
  You can compare the julekake
         to fruit cake.

346
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,829
         Julekake is traditional
                 what times?

347
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,397
     Christmas.

348
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,365
But they eat it all year long
because it's so marvelous.

349
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,034
              It's a marvelous
                  julekake.

350
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:17,602
    That's right.
     [Laughs]

351
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:18,770
              What are we going
              to make with it.

352
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,238
 I'm making julekake
    French toast.

353
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,439
              How do we do it.

354
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:24,242
Unbleached flour, sugar,
    fresh yeast.

355
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,044
                 Let me see
             the block of that.

356
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,479
          Boy, that's a monster.

357
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,514
      Butter --
this is a very rich dough.

358
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,349
                  Is baking
               your zen time?

359
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:32,917
I love baking.
                 What do we got?

360
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,085
 This is cardamom.
                        Okay.

361
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,954
               Lot of cardamom
             in Norwegian food?

362
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,422
     A lot.
                Really?

363
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,224
They love it because when they
went to the Mediterranean,

364
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,359
    the Vikings,
they brought back spices.

365
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,928
Salt, eggs, and whole milk.

366
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,630
It mixes for 12 minutes.

367
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:48,967
Once it's incorporated, we add
the black raisins and citron.

368
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:53,404
 Do you know citron?
It's a candied melon.

369
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,206
                 It's weird.
   You got to put that in there?

370
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,708
  I do traditional.

371
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,077
           Alright, so once this
   is done mixing, what happens?

372
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:00,645
I divide it, proof it...

373
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,013
     Holy moly!

374
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,015
GURHOLT: ...bust 'em down,
 sheet 'em through.

375
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,517
               I love the way
               this is going.

376
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,085
This is 100% egg wash.

377
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,386
          This will proof again.
Right.

378
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,388
               Then to the oven.
  375, 400.

379
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,923
 35, to 40 minutes.

380
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,925
               Julekake loaf.

381
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,693
      You can taste the cardamom
               coming through.

382
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,729
      You get a little sweetness
    coming due from the raisins.

383
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,230
         It's a rich bread cake.

384
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:23,134
We put together the eggs,
heavy cream, and some cinnamon.

385
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,904
Whisk that together,
then we'll dredge this.

386
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,338
               Wow. I like it.

387
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,642
Hit it with some strawberries,
some butter and syrup.

388
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,110
 Make it look cute.

389
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,447
        Delicious, lot of flavor
         without a lot of sweet.

390
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,082
            You get a little bit
               of that melon.

391
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,685
For as heavy and dense as it was
   when it came out of the oven,

392
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:43,354
            it really softens up
and becomes light and pillowy --

393
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,290
       sponginess that you want.

394
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:48,126
Taste it with the lingam berry
and see what you think.

395
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:49,828
      That's Norway right there,
                   buddy.

396
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,729
     Julekake French toast.

397
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,531
      I really like getting
   all the different textures.

398
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,266
        It's kind of more
      like a fruity taste.

399
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,669
  Pour that syrup all over it,
     and it just feels good.

Oh, let me ask these guys.
   'Scuse me, sir.

is putting Indian food
  on top of pizzas?

  [Speaking native language]

     Okay, good.
This must be the place.

426
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,530
This is Curry Pizza.

   Garlic cheese naan sticks.

00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,038
   Indian has always been one
  of my favorite types of food.

431
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,473
   And who doesn't love pizza?

432
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:09,540
    And I can't believe that
      no one's ever thought

433
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,975
   of blending the two before.

    FIERI: At least not here
       in Salt Lake City,

435

        restaurant owner

436
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,749
      Bhinda Singh came up
        with the concept.

437
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,884
          I bought a pizza place
          down in southern Utah.

438
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,920
    Then after that, I was like,
 "Oh, you got Indian restaurant,

439
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,788
         then now you got pizza,
   now why don't we merge them?"

440
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,890
         All the flavors
       just melt together.

441
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,425
Alright, chef. So what are we
going to make today?

442
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,693
             We're going to make
              a Bhinda special.

443
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:29,928

Bhinda panda.

00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,774
 Non-pesto, yeah.
                   Let's see it.

451
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,443
We'll start with milk,
homemade yogurt, baking powder,

452
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,446
 salt, sugar, water,
put our flour into it.

    -Five, to seven minutes.

             -Yeah.

Indian deep dish right now.

00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,393
         What are we making now?

460
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:05,296
 We're going to make
a garam masala for sauces.

461
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,599
 Pomegranate seeds,
  bay leaf, mace...

  white flax seed.

00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,105
             You got the rainbow
              of the flax seed.

466
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:17,275
Yeah. Nutmeg, green cardamom,
 and black cardamom.

467
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:18,743
                 Any Greek?

468
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,778
       Dude, we have just robbed
       the Indian spice counter.

469
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,347
 Cumin seed, cloves.

470
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,182
Black pepper, coriander.

471
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,417
Fennel seed.
         That's a lot of flavor.

472
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:27,986
             You grind it once,
               and then twice?

473
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,221
Yeah. No we're going to make
the honey crepe baste.

474

                        Great.

             -Yeah.

476
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:39,197
Oregano, basil, red pepper
flakes, paprika, olive oil,

477
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,332
then we will rest it
     for a week.

478
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,134
                 So we made
             the garam masala...
   Yeah.

479
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,502
               ...then we made
                the paste --

480
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,737
         all the more to make to
           to make the on sauce.

481
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:47,472
     One sauce.

482
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:49,140
We still got a couple
  more steps to go.

483
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,042
             You're killing me,
                   Smalls.

484
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:54,812
    Whole tomatoes, cumin seeds,
         roasted garlic, ginger,

485
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:57,882
             paprika, add water,
          cook about four hours.

486
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,784
What's the next step?
                The onion gravy.

487
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:04,355
Oil, cumin seeds, roasted garlic
           ginger, salt, onions,

488
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:08,593
water, paprika powder, turmeric,
        let it cook for 7 hours.

489
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:09,994
Onion gravy?
                 Onion gravy.

490
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:11,896
Goes in the sauce?
              Goes in the sauce.

491
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,165
The paste we made earlier, we're
  going to put in there with it.

492
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,300
    Add honey in there, as well.
                Let it cook.

493
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,036
This is the honey curry?
             It is honey curry.

494
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,470
     I like it.

495
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:20,571
Next up, we're going
to make the chicken tikka.

496
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:21,773
             So chicken breasts.

497
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:24,509
  Homemade yogurt,
lemon juice, coloring.

498
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:25,910
             Got to make it red.

499
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:28,413
Chili powder, paprika, salt,
 garlic, and ginger.

500
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:29,747
      Roasted garlic and ginger.

501
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,215
           What are you thinking
                 back there?

502
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,683
 Little bit of oil.

503
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,919
So we are going to let it
sit for 10 hours at least.

504
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,287
                    Okay.

505
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,423
I roast at about 500 degrees
for 25 to 30 minutes.

506
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:39,390
               And now we make
                 the pizza?

507
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,792
  Exactly.
                I'm starving.

508
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,794
We take the dough ball --
a little bit of oil.

509
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:43,795
 Cooks a little bit.

510
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,263
          Oh, puts a little heat
                   on it.

511
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,497
We take the curry sauce.

512
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:47,832
        Fresh-grated mozzarella.

513
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:50,334
Chicken on, roasted fresh
garlic, fresh Ginger.

514
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,636
              It's flavor city
                 right here.

515
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:55,373
         Didn't see that coming.

516
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,075
I still need green onions.

517
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,776
              The 80s said that
          I'd impeach the folks.

518
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:03,081
Basil, cilantro, jalapenos,
garlic salt, fenugreek

519
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,849
                In the oven.
            Look how excited is.

520
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:06,384
 Two, three minutes.

521
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:09,387
It looks like you went and stole
everything off of the pizza line

522
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:10,755
and put it on one pizza.

523
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:14,358
            That's why I call it
             the Bhinda special.

524
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,693
             What do you think?

525
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:19,330
  I think I'll have
   another piece.

526
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:22,533
It's actually going to wreck
pizza for me for a while.

527
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,535
You've brought such depth
   and such flavor

528
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,704
 and such creativity
  and new textures,

529
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,005
like the cauliflower.

530
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,174
You get a touch of the oregano
and the basil in that sauce,

531
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,176
a little bit of the Italian,
and then you come heavy

532
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,979
with everything from
the fenugreek to the cardamom.

533
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,581
The naan is nice, I mean,
     it's thin,

534
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,116
neopolitan-style crust.

535
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,984
So you get that nice cracker
crunch that you want out of it,

536
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,719
but it's still tender.

537
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,857
My expectations were high.

538
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,325
You beat my expectations.

539
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:48,826
                 Thank you.

540
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,328
         Bhinda special.

541
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,263
These are good friends of mine
from a company called Camp Chef,

542
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,531
    and they know
a lot about cooking.

543
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,500
So I think they would be
  the perfect ones

544
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,468
to ask what they think
    of the pizza.

545
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,138
  It's spicy, but there's, like,
           a really good flavor.

546
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,405
        I really like the crust.

547
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,508
   I would say my favorite pizza
               I've ever had.

548
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,443
           -Seriously?
      -I love Indian food.

549
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,044
  It's the marriage
     of the two.

550
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:09,180
              -Yes!
           -Margarita.

551
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,382
  When they do American pizzas,
       they do their own.

552
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:12,984
        And then they do
        create your own.

553
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,185
          You guys are brothers,
                 I take it?

554
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:15,820
             -Twins.
              -No.

555
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,855
       Curry Pizza catered
         for our school,

556
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,557
     and these kids go like,
       "Man, this is great

557
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,192
          cheese pizza.
        Where's it from?"

558
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:23,761
             WOMAN:
They have the mozzarella cheese,
       the paneer cheese,

559
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,531
  which has got a firm texture,
        but it's creamy.

560
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:27,999
                  Next one
             we're making is...

561
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,934
Glaze paneer.
            Walk me through it.

562
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,235
The honey curry sauce
  we made earlier.

563
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,737
              In the same dough
                that we made.

564
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,305
        Yup,
those are all our cheese.

565
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:35,806
             Paneer.
      -Do you make it here?

566
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,208
    Yes.
            They make the yogurt
                   at home

567
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,476
               know they make
             the paneer at home.

568
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:40,077
    On the ends.

569
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,612
Tomatoes, red feta cheese.

570
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:42,680
        Don't forget-a the feta.

571
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,715
     We're going
  to cook this now.

572
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,951
That's arugula.
       The balsamic vinaigrette.

573
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:48,920
I want this monster piece.

574
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:52,323
                     ♪♪

575
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,926
   I love paneer.
It has such great texture.

576
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:57,495
It has more like a barbecue
 sauce flavor to it

577
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,397
   when you mix it
 with the balsamic.

578
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:00,598
  I mean, it's not
  just those eggs.

579
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,333
 The cheese pizza --
      wah-wah.

580
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:05,336
This is a cheese pizza!
That's the real deal.

581
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:06,837
   Congrats, man.
                      Thank you.

582
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,074
       -The glazed paneer.
 -The cheeses all come together.

583
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,043
        -Awesome flavors.
        -It's fantastic.

584
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,077
        Yeah,
you've had a few slices.

585
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,345
             -Maybe?
         -I can see it.

586
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,047
    Maybe I have,
 and don't judge me.

587
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,014
              MAN: Thai peanut.

588
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,149
    GIRL: I love Indian food.

589
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:20,351
    Like, that's my all-time
            favorite.

590
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:23,487
        And I love pizza,
   and so it's like, awesome.

591
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:24,956
    Oh, I'm sorry
 who stole the show.

592
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,123
          [Laughter]

593
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,458
    Chicken with the sausage.

594
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,028
People are going to be
in a hurry for the curry.

595
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,332
         Trademark that.
           -Thank you.

596
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:37,268
  So that wraps this edition of
 "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives."

600
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,843
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,
           and dives."

601
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,712
      What are your kid's names?

602
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:49,413
   Kids are Minder
    and Dopinder.

603
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,049
So my phone is bo-pinder.
                        Hold on.

604
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,684
My mom is Clovinder.

605
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,753
             I'm out, that's it.
                You're not --

606
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,021
       Now you're messing it me.
