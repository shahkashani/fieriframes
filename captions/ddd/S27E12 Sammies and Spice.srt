other beefs back in Chicago.    

55
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,778
     Let's talk about           
breaking down Italian Beef.     

56
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,846
              We're gonna start 
               with our gravy.  

57
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,247
  So, we have broth             
  that's left over              

58
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,782
 from the last round            
    of roasting.                

59
00:01:57,852 --> 00:02:00,986
          Then the onions.      
    Celery next, garlic, pepper.

60
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:03,455
             We use a couple bay
               leaves. Water.   

61
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,589
How long is this gonna go?      

62
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:05,657
        Right around four hours.

63
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,125
              Then we strain it 
             and go from there. 

64
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,328
And this would be the jus       
that's used to heat up the meat?

65
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,929
                  Right.        
   Next?                        

66
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,464
Trimmed eye of the round.       
                   Correct.     

67
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,498
  Big piece of meat             
    to work with.               

68
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:14,599
    We have to make our dry rub.

69
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,801
     We start with onion powder,
           garlic powder,       

70
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:20,205
     oregano, basil, salt, and, 
     last but not least, pepper.

71
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:21,339
        Okay.                   

72
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,441
            Put the beef into   
        the pan with some stock.

73
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,010
        Season the beef heavily.

74
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,612
   Take another quart 'cause you
   want some more juice in there

75
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,347
            so as it's roasting,
         it gives off that steam

76
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,749
   that gives off a nice flavor.

77
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,418
So, we're going to roast        
and steam this at the same time?

78
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,353
               Exactly right.   

79
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:35,753
    Just a little               
  over medium rare?             

80
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,222
                Just a little   
              over medium rare. 

81
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:38,957
Bring it out, let it cool,      
      slice it thin?            

82
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,558
                  Correct.      
            We toast our hoagie.

83
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:42,427
     Now, that's not            
a typical Chicago thing.        

84
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:44,028
                No, it's not.   
             We like to toast it

85
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,297
            because it just adds
       a little bit more flavor.

86
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,065
       I'm with you.            
It's elevating the program.     

87
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:49,434
      You take the beef, and you
       just add into the au jus.

88
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,769
 Just to warm it up.            

89
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,637
          And the idea is not to
      stack it as one big clump.

90
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,506
You want a ribbon it            
when it goes inside.            

91
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,707
             That's a good word.
                I like that.    

92
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:56,842
 Layer it up. Oh...             

93
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,910
       Do you like yours dipped,
           drowned, or dry?     

94
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:00,445
I'll take it dipped.            
         Oh.                    

95
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:03,248

96
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:05,117
                       Okay.    
  The question is,

97
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,852
                Oh, I'm hot.    
             This is the key -- 

98
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:10,389
              it's this balance 
              between the meat,

    So, the hunch               
started from Philly,            

102
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:18,197
but you have to use it          
when you do an Italian Beef.    

103
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:21,199
Have to get a big breath.       
You'll be down for a while.

105
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:26,271
 Aw, that's so good.            

106
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,006
The meat cut perfectly thin.    

107
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,341
 Light and delicate.            

108
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,409
Almost gets the texture         
   of filet mignon.             

109

The bun doesn't die.            

110
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,214
I think the toasting thing      
     is what everybody

       -Food's incredible.      
          -Sliders up!          

459
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,049
   Cauliflower up!              

460
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,250
              The culture here  
              is like no other. 

461
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,453
     Because owner Dan Lance    
          is all about          

462
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,255
       creating community       
        and giving back.        

463
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,324
I was doing a non-profit        
raising money for adoptions.    

464
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,258
            -Really?            
             -Yeah,             

465
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,927
      it wasn't                 
going well by myself.           

466
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,131
So, he called buddy Sean Gafner,
 who was cooking in California, 

467
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,199
    and pitched a crazy idea.   

468
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,268
       How about we design      
   something that's for profit  

469
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,870
      and use some of that      
        to fund adoption?       

470
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:41,406
FIERI: Fast forward a few years,
    and this place is jamming   

471
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,541
 thanks in part to a unique dish

472
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,610
        quickly becoming        
        a local favorite.       

473
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,479
      -Bangin' Cauliflower.     
 -Bangin' Cauliflower is a must.

474
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:51,015
 When you come in here and eat, 
 everyone has it on their table.

475
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:54,818
        Nice and crunchy.       
  It's got a spicy sauce on it. 

476
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,020
        FIERI: Alright, what are
            we making, boss?    

477
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,422
  So, we're making              
  the Bangin' sauce             

478
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:58,556
for the Bangin' Cauliflower.    

479
00:15:58,691 --> 00:15:59,390
              "Bangin'" as in,  

480
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,224
         "This thing's bangin'!"

481
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,292
    It's bangin'.               

482
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,760
           Let me see the magic,
                  homie.        

483
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,162
First, we bring some hoisin     
and sweet chili together,       

484
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,563
kind of meld the flavors.       

485
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:09,166
Orange juice, lemon juice,      
lime juice -- all fresh squeezed

486
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,568
   'cause it's got              
to taste like fruit.            

487
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,236
  Bring to a boil,              
 whisk it together.             

488
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,172
Then, we strain it into         
just the sriracha mayo.         

489
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,806
              So, a little fat  
             and a little heat. 

490
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,508
     We just put a              
quarter cup into here.          

491
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,176
              Oh, just a touch? 

492
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,310
Yeah, that's powerful.          

493
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,645
   That's a lot of              
 citrus and hoisin.             

494
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,581
             That's bangin'.    
        That'll definitely work.

495
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,782
           Now onto cauliflower.

496
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,517
 All the dry ingredients        
we whisk together first.        

497
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,987
Some rice flour, kosher salt,   
fresh-ground black pepper,      

498
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:32,790
a little granulated garlic,     
    dark chili powder,          

499
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,659
and some fresh-ground           
     cumin seed.                

500
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:35,660
                   Got it.      

501
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,194
Whisk that together,            
and then add in the water.      

502
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,929
        Alright. Dredge and fry?

503
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:39,930
   Dredge and fry.              

504
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,532
           It's not very heavily
                  coated.       

505
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:42,400
   No, it's light.              

506
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:43,400
   And what are we frying it in?

507
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:44,135
   Rice bran oil.               

508
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:44,869
               Rice bran oil?   

509
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,270
    Yeah.                       
                I like it.      

510
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:47,738
        360.                    
 Crispy cauliflower.            

511
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:51,542
And it gets bangin'.            

512
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,277
   Now we top with              
some fresh scallion.            

513
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,880
                     ♪♪         

514
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,683
 I'll tell you what -- you can't
        call something "bangin'"

515
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,417
              unless it tastes  
                 like that.     

516
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,551
     Thank you.                 

517
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:03,087
            That's legit.       
    The rice flour's the kicker.

518
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:06,958
       Any other batter would've
           burned up on you.    

519
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,492
              It adds a little  
               bit of crunch.   

520
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,161
      You still get cauliflower.

521
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,629
           The acid in the sauce
            countering the fry  

522
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:15,099
             and the sweet with 
             the fat of the mayo

523
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,968
                and the punch   
               of the sriracha  

524
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,836
              is all just done  

525
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:21,572
    in this little micro-balance
             just the right way.

526
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,241
          That's one of the most
            simplistic recipes  

527
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,776
   I've ever seen on "Triple D,"
        and it's dynamite.      

528
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:26,777
                Awesome job.    

529
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,912
  And the Bangin' Cauliflower.  
             Enjoy.             

530
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:32,316
It has a great kick,            
but it's refreshing and cool.   

531
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,985
             I know that when   
           I bring my kids here,

532
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,319
                they will eat   
              their vegetables. 

533
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:36,386
Every time you come,            
you got to get them.            

534
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:37,989
   Steak Frites, coming over!   

535
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,858
           The Roost was exactly
           what Longmont needed.

536
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,861
 Cool bar. The rooftop patio -- 
      it brings so much to      

537
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,329
   the community and downtown.  

538
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:49,067
   All their food is local --   
     local beef, local pork.    

539
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,534
       Plating                  
Perfect Pork Burgers.           

540
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,136
               The pork burger  
               is phenomenal.   

541
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:54,806
   It is so delicious. I have   
 tasted nothing like it before. 

542
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,407
           Just an awesome dish.

543
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:57,541
               Alright, chef.   

544
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,212
We are making the Perfect       
Pork Burger patties.            

545
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:04,081
First, you got to sauté         
the aromatics in sesame oil.    

546
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,949
                    Okay.       

547
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,550
    Fresh garlic,               
fresh-ground ginger.            

548
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,618
  You don't want to             
   over-caramelize              

549
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,886
  'cause those are              
delicate ingredients.           

550
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,421
                  I gotcha.     
  Chili sambal.                 

551
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,956
Deglaze with soy sauce.         
Let it cool down a little bit.  

552
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:13,758
                    Okay.       

553
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:14,892
So, this is my buddy            
    Clint's pork                

554
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,427
he raises right here            
    in Longmont.                

555
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:17,895
    What's Clint's ranch called?

556
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,096
Buckner Family Farms.           

557
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,165
          He's raising the pork,
             has it butchered,  

558
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,633
  has it ground, and you get it?

559
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:23,701
 That's right.                  
                 Love it.       

560
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,237
   You add in the               
aromatics, scallion,            

561
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,638
      cilantro,                 

562
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:29,039
fresh basil, kosher salt...     

563
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,841
              And fresh-ground  
                black pepper.   

564
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,043
   ...fresh-ground              
    black pepper.               

565
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,177
                 Like that.     
                 Like that.     

566
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,779
  And you just make             
  a perfect patty.              

567
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,848
        How are we gonna prepare
        this Perfect Pork patty?

568
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,582
   We're gonna push             
the Perfect Pork patty          

569
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,984
into the perfect ring mold.     

570
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,253
Now we take it over to          
the planch and make it perfect. 

571
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:45,056
          [ Laughter ]          

572
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:45,856
 Now we make kimchi.            

573
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,058
                  Napa cab.     

574
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,460
I love Napa cabbage because     
the texture is perfect.         

575
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,994
              So, we take that, 
               start salting?   

576
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,396
        Sure.                   

577
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,665
         Draw out all that extra
  moisture, and then some water.

578
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,801
Mix it up, cover with plastic,  
 room temp, at least 12 hours.  

579
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:58,936
Here's the Napa cabbage.        

580
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,738
 We've strained off             
  the excess water.             

581
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:04,341
   Fish sauce, sambal,          
green parts of scallion,        

582
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:05,008
   fresh ginger...              

583
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:05,943
                 Holy moly!     

584
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,678
  ...fresh garlic,              
   a little sugar.              

585
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,814
     Three weeks in the walk-in?
  That's right.                 

586
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,617
        And that's the mount    
    for this perfect pork patty.
Yeah.                           

587
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:14,751
So, these buns are from the     
bread ladies across the street. 

588
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,353
                   Got it.      
 The Bangin' sauce.             

589
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,355
       Oh, really? Bangin' sauce
       makes another appearance?

590
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,157
 Some of our kimchi             
   on the bottom.               

591
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,425
 Perfect Pork patty.            

592
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,427
            Lot of pressure when
          you call it "perfect."

593
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:26,030
Blistered shishitos just tossed 
in a little salt and lime.      

594
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,898
My buddy Mark also grows        
 these here in Longmont.        

595
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,500
                I'm down with   
             the shishito move. 

596
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,435
Top it with the brioche bun.    

597
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,904
      Perfect.                  

598
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,040
                     ♪♪         

599
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,441
                 I don't use    
             the word "perfect."

600
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,510
             It's just too much 
            of an ultimate term.

601
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,579
             It's like "always" 
                and "never."    

602
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,046
   The way I would describe this

603
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,315
             is there is nothing
   I would do different to that.

604
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,185
           The little touch     
      of the shishito, the acid,

605
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,588
             the tang, the funk 
               of the kimchi,   

606
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,256
             you allow the pork 
            to have some flavor.

607
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,991
         You didn't put too much
                into it.        

608
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,928
              The patty itself  
              is really juicy.  

609
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:01,231
         Bangin' sauce should be
        available by the gallon,

610
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:03,467
        and I hear that you guys
     typically put an egg on it.

611
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:04,935
    I'm not a super-big egg fan,

612
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,270
             so I appreciate you
          keeping it -- but this

613
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,272
          right here with an egg
              would put it up   

614
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,140
              into that "pretty 
            righteous" category.

615
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:12,009
             Using that "P" word
              you like to use.  

616
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:15,012
           It's pretty dynamite.
           I mean, it really is.

617
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,948
          I've got the          
      Perfect Pork Burger.      

618
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,751
      The patty has this ginger,
           basil explosion.     

619
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,753
 The shishito gives             
 a nice kick to it.             

620
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,221
   It's cooked to perfection.   

621
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,823
     I love coming here.        
It's fresh food all the time.   

622
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:27,892
   It's delicious.              

623
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,695
        I love the vibe.        
  It's just a fun place to be.  

624
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,363
             You're good dudes. 

625
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:33,764
     I applaud what you're doing
  and how you're helping others,

626
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,766
       and all that love and all
       that appreciation of food

627
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,767
     comes out in what you make.

628
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:39,570
          -Thanks, man.         
            -Awesome.           

629
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,104
          So, that's it         
       for this road trip.      

630
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,440
        But don't worry.        

631
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,976
    We got plenty more joints   
 to find all over this country. 

632
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:46,710
         I'll be looking        
        for you next time       

633
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,714
on "Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives."

634
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,382
       -Perfectly cooked.       
         -Anything else?        

635
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:52,650
It's perfectly moist.           

636
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,718
    Perfectly blistered         
shishito right there, too.      

637
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,520
             Where's your wife? 
             Please manage him.
