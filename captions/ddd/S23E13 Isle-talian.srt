1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,469
 Hey, everybody, I'm Guy Fieri, 
     and we're rolling out,     

2
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:07,339
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives! 

3
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,474
          This trip...          

4
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:09,208
     Here we go.                

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,809
  We got a little island fever. 

6
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:11,676
   It's fantastic.              

7
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,879
 Mixed with big Italian flavor. 

8
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:15,080
   That's totally               
 the way I like it.             

9
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:16,815
   In Plymouth, Massachusetts.  

10
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,150
 You are the pilgrim            
   of Flavortown.               

11
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:20,686
     A chef giving plantains    
         new purpose...         

12
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:21,620
 Now you're gonna do            
     your magic.                

13
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,689
        While winging it        
          with bananas.         

14
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,223
 Banana like banana,            
   banana, banana?              

15
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,758
     In Colorado Springs...     

16
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,226
    Come on down,               
we're having a ball.            

17
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,561
        ...a neighborhood       
        Italian joint...        

18
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:30,829
I wouldn't change a thing       
     about this.                

19
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,698
 ...getting back to the basics. 

20
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,101
 That's a real-deal,            
old-school Italian dish.        

21
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:38,504
 Plus, a Caribbean fusion spot. 

22
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:39,238
 Hear it every day.             

23
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,773
  Putting the rasta into pasta. 

24
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,175
As weird as the whole thing     
sounds, it's really good.       

25
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,445
     That's all right here,     
            right now           

26
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:48,947
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives!"          

27
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:03,195
                     ♪♪         

28
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,197
           So I'm here          
   in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,598
  That's right,<i> that</i> Plymouth.  

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,867
  Now, right down the way here  
        on Water Street,        

31
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,336
 oh, you'll find the Mayflower, 
   you'll find Plymouth Rock.   

32
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:13,404
         And right here         
  in front of Plymouth Harbor,  

33
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,673
  you got a funky little joint  

34
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,209
  that's discovered by tourists 
      and loved by locals.      

35
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:18,577
   This is the Blue-Eyed Crab.  

36
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:24,283
    Picking up jerk chicken,    
       table four, please.      

37
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:25,818
       Really good stuff.       

38
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,152
  WOMAN: The guava pork chops.  

39
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:30,622
I like it 'cause it's different,
      it's creative, fresh.     

40
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,157
 Is this the typical            
    type of food                

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,691
     you'd find                 
in the Cape Cod area?           

42
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:34,826
       You're not gonna get this
               anywhere else.   

43
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,494
  And it's all because of Jim.  

44
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,964
             FIERI:             
  That would be Chef Jim Casey, 
  a food veteran from New York, 

45
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:42,567
who looked to America's hometown
   to open this place in '07.   

46
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,436
 Well, I wanted to see the ocean
                  every day     

47
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,771
                   and get      
               some fresh air.  

48
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,640
And then you're scratch-making  
   all your food.               
                      Yep.      

49
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:51,442
  FIERI: Well, what makes this  
 place unique in these parts... 

50
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,779
            Lobster-crab Creole.

51
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,781
            I went a little more
       with the Caribbean twist.

52
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,249
 Sometimes you see something on 
  the menu you wouldn't expect  

53
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,252
   and you're not sure about,   
      and then you eat it,      

54
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,854
   and it completely blows you  
              away.             

55
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,855
            Banana-garlic wings.

56
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,323
    WOMAN: You wouldn't guess   
     that garlic and banana     

57
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,527
    would pair well together,   
         but it's great.        

58
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:09,661
 Banana like banana,            
   banana, banana?              

59
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:10,795
       There's bananas in there,
                    yeah.       

60
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,131
   That's bananas.              
Okay, well, let's get into it.  

61
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,934
 We're gonna put some star anise
      in there, cinnamon sticks,

62
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,870
               some jalapeños,  
                fresh garlic.   

63
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:20,472
And where'd the recipe          
  come from, Chef?              

64
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,006
             Pretty much flavors
                that I like.    
      Okay.                     

65
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:25,343
Oh, so mine would have some     
tequila, some beef jerky.       

66
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,678
          We could definitely do
                    that.       

67
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,946
             Some fresh ginger, 

68
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,747
           sugar to get a little
         caramelization on that.

69
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:33,084
                Orange juice    
             and some soy sauce.

70
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,287
          All right, so I'm just
      gonna take a few of these,

71
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:36,622
          marinate it overnight.

72
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:38,690
They go to the grill,           
they go in a fryer --           

73
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,559
how do they get done?           
                  We roast them.

74
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,427
                We roast them   
           for about 30 minutes,

75
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,963
     and then we get a nice char
    on them on top of the grill.

76
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:47,098
     All right.                 
Let's hit it, Captain.          
 What are we making?            

77
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,368
       This is the sauce for the
            banana-garlic wings.
   Okay.                        

78
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,769
      We start off with a little
             butter -- unsalted.
  Okay.                         

79
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:52,904
               Pop some garlic  
                  in there.     

80
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,040
              When this is nice 
                and toasted,    

81
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:56,775
               we're gonna put  
   all the other ingredients in.
     Okay.                      

82
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,910
         That's some fish sauce,
             sweet chili sauce, 

83
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,579
                orange juice,   
                maple syrup.    

84
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:01,446
    Kitchen sink.               

85
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:02,714
               Some fresh OJ.   

86
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:03,715
               Banana liqueur.  

87
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,717
    Eye of newt.                
           And some orange zest.

88
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,719
 Wing of bat.                   
              And fresh bananas.

89
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,354
   Kind of weird.               

90
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,924
  So once it starts             
     to simmer,                 

91
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:14,026
 we're gonna drop it            
    and puree it?               
                      Exactly.  

92
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,261
    Smells great.               

93
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:17,529
                 Gonna be good. 
   All right.                   

94
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,464
          Let's get a little bit
                 in the pan.    

95
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,866
So we're just gonna glaze this  
      right up.                 

96
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,568
            Throw five plantains
                  in there.     

97
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:25,971
         Then we throw the wings
                  in there.     

98
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,076
So we're gonna garnish the plate
           with a bit of greens.

99
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,210
               Grab the wings.  

100
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,679
                 Serve this     
          with a tropical cream.

101
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,082
            So what I do is take
              pineapple juice,  

102
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,084
                cook it down    
     with just a touch of sugar.

103
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,152
             And then we fold it
with a little bit of sour cream.

104
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,021
    It's our own ranch dressing.

105
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,157
              And we garnish it 
        with a little scallions.

106
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,296
That's Flavortown passport      
    right there.                

107
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:54,766
Kind of like a calypso band     
   meets Metallica              

108
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,102
  with Eric Lindell             
doing the lead singing.         

109
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:58,303
               That's exactly   
            what I was thinking.

110
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,971
I mean, it's all over           
     the board,                 

111
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:06,311
picking up that fish sauce,     
 picking up that OJ.            

112
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:07,779
 I get a little bit             
    of that tang,               

113
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,247
I'm getting the star anise      
   coming through,              

114
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,449
  with just a bite              
  of that cinnamon.             

115
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:12,650
And then you get yourself       
a little plantain with it       

116
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,652
  and a little bit              
 of the tropical...             
                       Cream.   

117
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:18,056
              It's SPF 40, too, 
              so we're all set.

     Zinc oxide.                

119
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,726
         They're juicy,         
       they're very tasty.      

120
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,996
         A little sweet,        
 a little heat, a little spice. 

121
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,733
     The dipping sauce, too,    
   is just out of this world.   

122
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:28,933
        Picking up seafood stew!

123
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,268
           I feel like          
      I'm in the Caribbean.

    WOMAN: You're almost like   
  in old San Juan or something. 

125
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,071
        It has that vibe.

          All the bright colors.

127
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,007
  And it has that island feel.  
      And so does the food.     

128
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,210
      Jerk chicken in here      
        is really great.

       It's a plantain sandwich.

   One of the best sandwiches

a righteous sandwich.

       of tourist central,      

140
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,102
but that doesn't stop the locals

141
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,371
        from making this

 and the food that goes with it.

146
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,983
    FIERI: Served straight up   
        or on a sandwich.

             Plantain Sandwich. 

148
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:24,188
  Instead of bread, you have a  
 friend plantain is your crust. 

149
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,390
         It's wonderful.        

150
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:26,958
FIERI: All right, brother,      
what are we into now?           

151
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,594
     We're making the jerk paste
           for the jerk chicken.

152
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:30,862
                 We throw in    
        a little chopped garlic,

153
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,798
               some scallions,  
               chopped onions.  

154
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,533
               Some soy sauce.  
    Okay.                       

155
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,134
              Fresh habaneros.  

156
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:37,936
               Sugar, paprika.  
     Okay.                      

157
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:40,872
          Allspice, dried thyme,
               cinnamon again,  

158
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,774
             and then some salt 
                 and pepper.    
   Got it.                      

159
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:47,678
         Oh!                    

160
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,013
 That's a nice heat.            
                   All right.   

161
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,683
           So instead of putting
  any mustard in the jerk paste,

162
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,885
              I put the mustard 
          right on the chickens.

163
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,220
    Then rub them               
   with the paste.              

164
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:56,821
And then how long we let them   
sit there and marinate?         

165
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,690
            Overnight, 24 hours.

166
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,692
How long is it gonna go on      
 the rotisserie for?            
                Hour and a half.

167
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,230
All right, so now we have       
  a green plantain.             
                         Yep.   

168
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,898
I've had some fights            
     with these.                
                     Yeah.      

169
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,233
   And the greener              
      they are,                 

170
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,435
the more difficult they are     
      to peel.                  
                      Correct.  

171
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,904
              Cut the ends off, 
           go in a little bit...

172
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,307
               Then I take it,  
           cut it right in half.

173
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:17,842
Now, we'll drop that in         
the fryer just till it cooks.   

174
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,444
 Now you're gonna do            
     your magic.                
                       Yep.     

175
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:22,114
Got to press it enough          
   to flatten it,               

176
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:24,716
  but not too much              
 that you break it.             

177
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,184
    Not bad.                    
                 Take a spatula.

178
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,852
Got to be nice to it.           

179
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,054
             Take the next one. 
 Here we go!                    

180
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,324
You'll actually feel it         
kind of give a little bit.      

181
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,260
                There we go.    

182
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,528
 Back to the fryer.             
              About two minutes.

183
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,062
Just so it crisps up            
       enough,                  

184
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,798
but still stays nice            
    and pliable.                

185
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,200
And that's our bread.           
                    That's it.  

186
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,603
             Take this chicken, 
             pull it right off. 

187
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:45,203
               Break it down.   

188
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:50,541
   And now, I just take a little
     bit more of the jerk paste.
  Okay.                         

189
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,343
  And I want to add a little bit
             more flavor to it.

00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,670
 Everybody's having             
    a good time.                

221
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:53,505
What a fun place, man.          

222
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,742
             FIERI:             
Coming up in Colorado Springs...

223
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:00,345
   Another one of               
those swimsuit dishes.          

224
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,880
   ...legit Italian recipes...  

225
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:03,882
 On-point, man.                 
                   Thank you.   

226
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,750
      ...served with a side     
            of flair.           

227
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,285
You got half New Jersey,        

228
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,421
 the rest Colorado,             
and then forget about it.       

229
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,397
             FIERI:             
 So I'm here on Colorado Avenue 
      in old Colorado City,     

230
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,133
     which is a neighborhood    
       of Colorado Springs      

231
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,601
    in the state of Colorado.   

232
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,003
 Wow, that's a lot of Colorados.

233
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,871
 Anyhow, you know how everybody 
         on their phone         

234
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,740
     has an app for finding     
    this place or that place?   

235
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,676
       I don't need that.       
  You see, because I have GPS.  

236
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,412
          That's right,         
 that's the Guido Pasta Search, 

237
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:35,413
    and this is what I found.   

238
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:36,581
      This is Paravicini's.     

239
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,354
   This is like Sunday dinners  
            at home.            

240
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,688
           That's hot.          

241
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,157
     Every dish is so tasty.    

242
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,494
   It started out with Franco   
  cooking his mother's recipes. 

243
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:51,830
        FIERI: Which are        
   the southern Italian dishes  

244
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,832
       that chef and owner      
          Franco Pisani         

245
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,635
      has been stirring up      
    since he opened in 2003.    

246
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:57,769
              Forget about it.  

247
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:58,970
              We eat, we drink, 
            we have a good time.

248
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,172
This guy's got it going!        

249
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,508
You got half New Jersey,        

250
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,443
 the rest Colorado,             
and then forget about it.       

251
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,112
         We love Franco.        

252
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,313
     He's not a wallflower.     

253
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,650
       Every guest we have      
  in our house, they come here. 

254
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:12,850
   All our friends come here.   

255
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,520
      It's very comforting.     
       Great comfort food.      

256
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:16,454
                  Arancini!     

257
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,323
      Arancini is amazing.      

258
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:22,327
       Crunchy rice balls       
     with fresh peas inside.    

259
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,595
      MAN: Yeah, I love it.     

260
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:26,298
 The pesto and the Romano cheese
           just pops.           

261
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,134
                 All right,     
  so we're gonna make the pesto.
  Go for it.                    

262
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,136
                Fresh basil.    
      Okay.                     

263
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,604
            Then we're gonna add
            a little bit of oil.

264
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:34,538
                 Pine nuts.     

265
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,007
     Do you make                
the pesto every day?            

266
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,208
                 Every day.     

267
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,711
     Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
    Okay.                       

268
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,279
          [ Whirring ]          

269
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,682
             Forgot the garlic. 

270
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,083
Did you put the garlic          
      in there?                 
              Forgot the garlic.

271
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,685
              It's looking good.
      Andy time                 
you forget something,           

272
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,686
I take another piece            
   of your bling.               
                      All right.

273
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:49,955
    Starting with               
   the gold watch.              

274
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:52,490
              So pesto's done.  

275
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,558
           That's the foundation
                of the sauce.   
      Okay.                     

276
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,094
               I want to make   
      the cream sauce, Béchamel.
  Okay.                         

277
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,630
That you make in-house?         
                        Yes.    

278
00:09:58,632 --> 00:09:59,831
                   Pesto.       

279
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,165
 I like that pesto,             
it's got a little grit to it.   

280
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,701
                   Butter,      
     Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.

281
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:04,636
    There we go.                

282
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:05,637
                    We're done. 
 Let me try this.               

283
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,972
 Now, do you make it            
in the pan each time,           

284
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,173
  or do you make it             
  in large batches?             

285
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:11,910
       No, we make it in the pan
                 each time.     

286
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,444
    You just come               
    and get that.               

287
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,913
Next up, the Arancini?          
                          Yep.  

288
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,580
          Olive oil, red onions.
          I like the red onions.

289
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,049
   They're a little bit sweeter,
           you know what I mean?

290
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,784
        And then we're gonna add
              the Arborio rice. 

291
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,519
 Toast the rice off.            
            A little bit, yeah. 

292
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:22,654
And this is chicken stock.      

293
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,255
      I can see                 
from all the oil floating       

294
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,323
    that this is                
your own chicken stock.         
                   Absolutely.  

295
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,325
                Fresh butter.   

296
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,927
        Some Parmigiano-Reggiano
                   cheese.      

297
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,194
  You're not light              
      with it.                  

298
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,996
              Now a little salt 
                 and pepper.    

299
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,132
All right, so this is gonna go  
for about 45 minutes?           

300
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,333
         Yeah, about 45 minutes.

301
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,535
        Okay.                   

302
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:38,602
        Mmm!                    

303
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,204
    That homemade               
   chicken stock,               

304
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,672
 all the difference             
 in the world, man.             

305
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,742
     Then we're gonna lay it out
              on the sheet pan. 

306
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:46,478
      And then                  
 let this cool down.            

307
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,347
Okay, so this is our risotto    
that's congealed up.            

308
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,082
       Yep, and we're gonna make
   a nice little ball out of it.

309
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,349
    Come on down,               
we're having a ball.            

310
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,118
    You're gonna put your finger
                  in there,     

311
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,621
             put a couple peas, 
           little bit of cheese.
  Okay.                         

312
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,356
                   Flour.       

313
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:01,559
      Egg and then bread crumbs.
 There we go.                   

314
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,027
    How many come               
   with an order?               
                      Three.    

315
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,229
               Three of them.   
   Tree do?                     

316
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,764
  What kind of tree             
      is that?                  
                  Arancini tree.

317
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:08,233
   Arancini tree.               
 Don't you have one?            

318
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,235
     All right,                 
   into the fryer.              

319
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:11,903
       And then we're gonna take
              the sauce we made 

320
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:12,937
            and plate it all up.

321
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:19,310
          More cheese,          
  'cause you don't get enough.  

322
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,445
     That's it right there.     

323
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,513
 That's a nice crust            
      on that.                  

324
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,381
    Look at that.               

325
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,884
Sweet peas in the middle.       
                      Mm-hmm.   

326
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,121
 Believe it or not,             
I still get that chicken stock  

327
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,056
 from the beginning             
   of the risotto.              
                     Mm-hmm.    

328
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:35,927
The fact that you make          
that pesto cream sauce          
  fresh every day,              

329
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:40,165
that basil is so sweet          
  and so delicious.             

330
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,135
        Mmm!                    

331
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,670
     Great job.                 
             Perfect, thank you.

332
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:46,670
     Great job.                 
                    Thank you.  

333
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,406
             WOMAN:             
What I really like is the pesto.

334
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:51,142
   It just kind of compliments  
    the texture of the rice.    

335
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:52,744
     MAN: It's a great dish     
         to get started,        

336
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,612
    get your tongue waking up   
       for what's to come.      

337
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,748
          FIERI: This is the way
        your nona was making it,

338
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,015
                  your mom      
               was making it?   

339
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,817
     Absolutely.                
Absolutely -- maybe better!     

340
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,485
              MAN:              
  This does remind me of Italy. 

341
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,488
       The older building,      
  more of a neighborhood here.  

342
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,157
    FIERI: Which makes sense    
 with a name like Paravicini's, 

343
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,360
  since it basically translates 
   to "for the neighborhood".   

344
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,495
       FIERI:                   
This is a pretty cool hangout.  
It feels like a house.          

345
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:12,830
 Nice open kitchen.             

346
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,499
          PISANI: People come in
and it's like going to my house.

347
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,567
             We make everything.

348
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:16,835
     Everything.                
              Right at the time.

349
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,035
             So if you tell me, 
                    look,       

350
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,437
                I don't like    
             sun-dried tomatoes,

351
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:20,571
              you don't have to 
                 have them.     

352
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,039
                Wedding soup!   

353
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,775
       Franco cares a lot       
         about his food.        

354
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,643
      He wants to make sure     
       everybody's happy.       

355
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,846
      What's your favorite thing
                  on the menu?  
  I like the veal.              

356
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:28,913
               Veal Giuseppe!   

357
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,916
        The Veal Giuseppe       
   is an explosion of flavor.   

358
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,118
      MAN: With the peppers     
        and the sausage,        

359
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,321
     it's tickling your nose    
  before you even start to eat. 

360
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:38,790
  Next up is the...             
                Veal Giuseppe.  

361
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:39,924
   Veal Giuseppe.               

362
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,792
So you just kind of set it up   
that, you know what,            

363
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,995
we'll name something after      
Guy's great-great-grandfather.  

364
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,864
               My grandfather   
                was Giuseppe.   

365
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,732
  Your grandfather              
    was Giuseppe?               
                My grandfather  
                 was Giuseppe.  

366
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,803
When Hunter was born,           
I tried to name Hunter Giuseppe.

367
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,938
And when Ryder was born,        
I tried to name him Giuseppe.   

368
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,406
She didn't go for it.           

369
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:58,076
So the fact that now            
at least we have a veal dish.   
                   Veal dish.   

370
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:59,210
...here in Colorado,            

371
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,678
 that makes me feel             
somewhat more complete.         

372
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,547
         You could put this dish
           on one of your menus.

373
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,015
   Yes, this is --              
                I'd be honored. 

374
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,483
I want to put this dish         
     in my face.                
                    [ Laughs ]  

375
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,320
 Okay, pounding out             
      the veal.                 

376
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:12,489
Dredge it in a little bit       
of salt, pepper, flour.         
                       Yeah.    

377
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,692
  Okay.                         
             Sauteing the veal. 
                Golden brown.   

378
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:17,027
              We're gonna start 
              building flavor.  
     Okay.                      

379
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,563
             Okay, a little bit 
               of red onions.   

380
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:21,766
        Kalamata olives, capers,
              roasted peppers.  

381
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,834
          Spicy Italian sausage.
    Okay.                       

382
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,303
               Cherry peppers.  

383
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,372
Italian cherry peppers, man,    
 you can't beat 'em.            
                Forget about it.

384
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:29,807
         A little chicken stock,
              a little butter.  

385
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,176
            We're gonna let that
                   reduce.      

386
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:33,545
   Another one of               
those swimsuit dishes.          

387
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:36,581
       A little capellini.      

388
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,715
             Plate up the veal, 

389
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,450
              put all the sauce 
         and the goodies on top.

390
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,653
              A little parsley  
                 for color.     
   All right.                   

391
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,555
   And this is how              
  you get it done.              
                     That's it. 

392
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,259
   That's totally               
 the way I like it.             

393
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,962
Not too much flour on it,       
  nice and tender.              

394
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,398
      It's got                  
a lot of bold flavor,           

395
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,866
but then it's really nice       
    and delicate.               

396
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,602
I wouldn't change a thing       
     about this.                

397
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:01,272
 That's a real deal,            
old-school Italian dish.        

398
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,473
If you're gonna name that       
after your grandfather,         

399
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,009
    it better be                
     that great.                

400
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,344
  On-point, man.                
                    Thank you.  

401
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,546
           Plating that Giuseppe
                 right now.     

402
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:09,881
  MAN: What I like about this,  

403
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,482
 it's got that nice spice to it,
    but not too hot, though.    

404
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:14,085
       I love this place.       
        It's my favorite.       

405
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,553
 Well done, brother.            

406
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:16,654
   Well done.                   
              Thank you, buddy. 

407
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,490
        FIERI: Up next...       

408
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,491
   Ready to rock.               

409
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,293
          We're staying         
       in Colorado Springs      

410
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,228
for an island Italian mash-up...

411
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,563
 What a funky dish.             

412
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,465
 ...filled with the unexpected. 

413
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,935
  Who came up with              
this crazy concoction?          

414
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,578
  I'm here in Colorado Springs, 
            Colorado.           

415
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,646
         Got to love it.        
        They got it all.        

416
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,915
   See the Air Force Academy,   
           Pikes Peak.          

417
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,516
They got the Garden of the Gods.

418
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:46,650
         They've got --         

419
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,853
     This place                 
is off the hook, man!           

420
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,722
They got little "Triple-D" kids,

421
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,257
  and a funky joint serving up  
     Caribbean-Italian food.    

422
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,126
      This is Rasta Pasta.      

423
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,227
      Hey, you ever thought     
       about being on TV?       

424
00:14:58,465 --> 00:14:59,397
            Chicken Montego Bay.

425
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,932
             WOMAN:             
   You're gonna get something   

426
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,600
    probably you've never had   
             before.            

427
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,002
   The Tortellini Jamaica Mon.  

428
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,670
   Caribbean and Italian food.  

429
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:08,072
                  Dreadlock     
              Ravioli Sausage.  

430
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,274
      What a crazy idea --      
       and yet, it works.       

431
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,943
 FIERI: Which is what initially 
     hooked husband and wife    

432
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:16,614
Rebecca and Matt Taraborelli and
 Rebecca's brother, Greg Harris.

433
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:17,949
            REBECCA:            
     Rasta Pasta is actually    

434
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:21,218
    a long-time 20-plus years   
        Colorado legend.        

435
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,486
 FIERI: That someone else owned,

436
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,623
   then closed in the ski town  
        of Breckenridge.        

437
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,891
       But this crew liked      
      the original so much      

438
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,361
    they opened up their own    
            in 2009.            

439
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,563
         We like to say         
 we're a Caribbean pasta joint. 

440
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,032
 Hear it every day.             

441
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,567
          Rasta Pasta, let's go!

442
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:40,371
  It's penne with a really rich 
         spicy red sauce        

443
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,706
  mixed with some jerk chicken. 

444
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,708
     It's really delicious.     

445
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,243
  Okay, so this is              
 the jerk seasoning.            

446
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,380
          Basis for a great many
               of our dishes.   
   Well, hit it.                

447
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,182
                 Right here,    
           we got garlic powder,

448
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,384
                onion powder,   
                black pepper.   

449
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,852
                  Cayenne.      

450
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,053
That's a nice little spice.     

451
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:59,190
             We got some basil, 
               thyme, ginger.   
    Got it.                     

452
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:00,524
                 And here's     
             the key ingredient.

453
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,793
                   Nutmeg.      
      Nice.                     

454
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,263
    This is where we really make
              the jerk our own. 

455
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,598
               We're gonna add  
          some red pepper flake.

456
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,999
 Just a little bit,             
       though.                  
       Spice it up a little bit.

457
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,668
              Just a little bit.
  Just a little bit.            

458
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,136
               A little sugar.  

459
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,871
      We got some salt in there.

460
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:15,673
 A tremendous amount            
    of allspice.                

461
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,075
        To really make it jerky.

462
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:18,476
                Now we go to    
            our wet ingredients.

463
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,144
           Habaneros.           

464
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,714
That's culinary masonry.        
                   That's right.

465
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,883
            Hot and good, buddy.
   Okay.                        

466
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:28,419
   Some lime juice              
      in there.                 

467
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:29,687
     Apply this                 
   to the chicken.              
                      Yes.      

468
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,823
             But not traditional
                jerk chicken.   
     Okay.                      

469
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,957
        So I put a little garlic
             in a hot pan here, 

470
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,560
    a little bit of orange juice
              used to deglaze.  

471
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,096
     To that, we'll add our jerk
   seasoning we just made there.

472
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,032
So we're not rubbing the        
jerk seasoning on the chicken?  

473
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,233
                   No, no.      
            We do our own thing.

474
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:46,437
             We give it a bit of
       an orange juice bath now.

475
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,572
   Okay, now.                   
        Boil it in orange juice,

476
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,975
                   I know,      
            it's unconventional.
  There we go.                  

477
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:53,644
  Yes.                          
         Just a dab of soy sauce
                 for color,     

478
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:57,315
             a little saltiness.
And who came up with            
this crazy concoction?          

479
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,650
              The story has it  
             a Cordon Bleu chef 

480
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,985
          was the original owner
               of Rasta Pasta.  
    Okay.                       

481
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,054
         Created all the recipes

482
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:05,122
              and then sold it  
        to this other gentleman.

483
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,592
   So this is like              
the telephone game, dude, okay? 

484
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,860
 It went to zest it             
  with some orange              

485
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,296
to boil it in orange juice      
   for six hours.               
                      Exactly.  

486
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:16,000
     So how long                
 is this gonna cook?            
                   40 minutes.  

487
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:18,736
              So we're cooking  
              our Rasta Pasta.  
   Get after it.                

488
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:19,871
       Starting with garlic oil,

489
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,940
              a little red wine 
                 to deglaze.    

490
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,274
                    Hey!        

491
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:27,812
          We'll add our chicken,
       tomatoes, jerk seasoning.

492
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:28,679
        Okay.                   

493
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:31,349
                Dry spices --   
               basil, oregano.  

494
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,218
         A little chicken stock.
     Okay.                      

495
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,620
           So now at this point,

496
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:38,890
  we cook our par-cooked noodles
                 in the pan.    
   Got it.                      

497
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,023
            We add our marinara.

498
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:40,958
         Oh!                    

499
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,026
               Touch of lime.   

500
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,494
           A little green onion.

501
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,763
      And we are ready to plate,
                 my friend.     
We're ready to rock.            

502
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:57,508
You said you're gonna make      
Jamaican jerk Italian food.     
                      Mm-hmm.   

503
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,844
   That's exactly               
    what you did.               

504
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,512
 A really nice dish.            

505
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,047
Chicken's super tender.         

506
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:06,384
The allspice, the nutmeg,       
 not too much heat.             

507
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:07,585
Pasta's perfectly cooked.       

508
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,653
I mean, finishing it            
  in the pan there,             

509
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:09,921
    I'll give you               
      all that.                 

510
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,323
A little extra lemon juice right
at the end ties it together.    

511
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,924
   Well done, man.              

512
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,059
 What a funky dish.             

513
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,660
        The Rasta Pasta.        

514
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,463
    Chicken and the red sauce   
  is a really good combination. 

515
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,599
Got a little bit of spice to it,
        but not too much.       

516
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,733
    WOMAN: You can't get this   
         anywhere else.         

517
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,668
        Once you come in,       
     you're kind of hooked.     

518
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,805
    When I walk in the door,    
  it just feels like arms open. 

519
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,274
FIERI: Very happy place in here.

520
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,009
                 "One Love"     
         is our primary product.

521
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,679
    MAN: It's about the vibe,   
      the fun, the spirit.      

522
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,347
                   HARRIS:      
    The Natural Mystic Veggetti.

523
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,149
          Curry like in         
       the Jamaican style.      

524
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,350
     With this new veggetti.    

525
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,485
   It's an amazing substitute   
           for pasta.           

526
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:44,421
All right, home slice.          
This is curry powder.           

527
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,956
            We got our turmeric.
  Okay.                         

528
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,958
              Coriander, cumin. 
  Got it.                       

529
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,962
               A little salt,   
       dried mustard, fenugreek.

530
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,429
  Fenugreek! Okay.              

531
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,031
                    Mace.       
     All right.                 

532
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:57,368
              Ginger, cinnamon, 
      and Cayenne for that love.

533
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,902
Smells like the spice market    
     in Bahrain.                

534
00:18:58,904 --> 00:18:59,836
        Okay.                   

535
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,973
                 Next step,     
             make the veggetti. 

536
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,641
I have a buddy named            
   Gary Maggetti.               

537
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,442
             Maggetti, veggetti.

538
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,244
 Hey, Gary Veggetti!            

539
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,846
We're into spiralizing          
    the veggies.                

540
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:11,515
  Now, we use these             
on "Guy's Grocery Games",       

541
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,918
  and these things              
  are wicked-cool.              

542
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,321
 So we spiralize out            
the yellow squash, the zucchini,

543
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,124
     the carrots                
so it will make its own pasta.  

544
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,560
          Nothing but beautiful,
              healthy veggies.  
  Love it.                      

545
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:24,862
        Okay.                   

546
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:27,198
                Salt, garlic,   
                 white wine.    

547
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,732
             Just a dash of soy.

548
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,868
Is that canned pineapple?       
                       Yes.     

549
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,036
                Jerk chicken.   

550
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,939
          A little tab of butter
                at the start.   

551
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:36,941
                  Our curry     
                that we made.   

552
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,543
                   Put in       
           some pineapple juice.

553
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,077

    [ Whistles ]                

555
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,946
            The last little dose
                 of butter,     

556
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,549
        handful of green onions.

557
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:48,386
                 And this is    
             the Natural Mystic.

    [ Chuckles ]                

559
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:56,293
I don't know who thinks about   
putting canned pineapple in     

560
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,163
with chicken with a jerk spice  
     and curry,                 

561
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,699
    but as weird                
as the whole thing sounds...    

562
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,771
The squash and the zucchini     
   and the carrots              

563
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,106
 have got good bite             
      to them.                  

564
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:11,375
 The pineapple isn't            
so identifiable, like,          

565
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,444
    "Oh, this is                
a big pineapple dish."          

566
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:16,380
I tell you something,           
it really is a surprising dish. 

567
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,381
        Mmm!

  Your Natural Mystic Veggetti. 

569
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,385
  It's a combination of things  
 that shouldn't be put together.

570
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,322
   Kind of not something I would
       normally order on a menu.

571
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:27,391
But that's what makes it nice,  
it's just unique and different.

573
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:33,464
   So excited to have a place   
 like this in Colorado Springs. 

574
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:35,599
      You got to stop here.     

575
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:36,601
   Nice job, man.               

576
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,169
      Nice job.                 
 You guys are crazy.            

577
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,605
          So that's it          
 for this Flavortown road trip. 

578
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:42,940
      But don't you worry.      

579
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,209
   there's plenty more joints   
     all over this country.     

580
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:46,677
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time

  FIERI: Hey, you ever thought  
     about being on TV, man?    

583
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:51,816
        Yeah!                   

584
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:53,617
             You have an agent? 
An agent?                       

585
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,286
    I'm gonna put a down payment
              on your contract. 

586
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,954
             What do you think? 
You're the best.                

587
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,222
                I don't know    
          if I'm the best, dude.

588
00:20:58,224 --> 00:20:59,223
        You just stole the show!
