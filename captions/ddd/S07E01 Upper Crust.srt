     WITH PORK BELLYS.          

7
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:18,951
THIS IS THE BEST REUBEN IN TOWN.

8
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:21,353
     AND THIS FAVORITE'S GOT

MMM, FUNK-E-LICIOUS.            

10
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,490
     (Guy)                      
     IN HOLLYWOOD, FLORIDA,     
     A TASTE OF PHILLY.         

11
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,226

     FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS.    

15
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:35,300
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE        
SOME FOLKS NERVOUS IN PHILLY.   

16
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:38,169

           REAL FOOD FANATICS...

 WHO MET AT A FINE DINING JOINT.

43
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:44,970
      I HIRED NICK,             
      HE WAS MY SOUS CHEF.      

44
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,772
         WE ALWAYS REALLY ENJOY 
         MAKING SANDWICHES,     

45
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,773
          SO WE DECIDED TO OPEN 
          A SANDWICH SHOP.      

46
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,909
           THERE'S ALWAYS       
           SOMETHING DIFFERENT. 

47
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,045
     (Guy)                      
     LIKE BUNK'S OWN            
     HOUSE CURED PORK BELLY.    

48
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,380
YOU CAN PUT PORK BELLY          
ON ANYTHING AND YOU'RE          
GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.             

49
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,182
        (Guy)                   
        FROM A PO' BOY...       

50
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:58,917
OH, MY GOD,                     
IT'S SO GOOD.                   

51
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,119
    (Guy)                       
    TO A VIETNAMESE BANH-MI,    
    EVEN THEIR REUBEN.          

52
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,522
         I'M DYING TO TRY       
         THE PORK BELLY REUBEN. 

53
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,924
THIS IS THE BEST REUBEN IN TOWN.

54
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,059
NOT SOMETHING YOU SEE           
ON EVERY SANDWICH MENU,         

55
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,261
BUT I'M DOWN WITH IT.           

56
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,597
         THE CURE IS GONNA BE   
         THESE DRY INGREDIENTS. 

57
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,399
              WE'LL START OFF   
              WITH A LITTLE BIT 
              OF CHILI FLAKE,   

58
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,735
             SOME BLACK PEPPER, 
             FENNEL SEED,       

59
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,537
AND WE'RE JUST GONNA BUZZ THAT. 

60
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,338
I THINK THIS IS ONE OF          
THE BIGGEST MISTAKES            
PEOPLE MAKE                     

61
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:22,273
IS NOT USING                    
REALLY FRESH SPICES.            

62
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,142
     THROW A LITTLE BROWN SUGAR 
     IN THERE.                  

63
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:25,877
            THIS IS LIKE 50/50, 
            SALT AND SUGAR.     

64
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:28,413
YOU MEANT FITTY/FITTY.          
                   FITTY/FITTY, 
                  YEAH, TOUCHE. 

65
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,415
            A LITTLE BIT        
            ON THE BOTTOM FIRST.

66
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,284
YOU'RE JUST GONNA PACK          
THAT BAD BOY RIGHT DOWN INTO IT.

67
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,686
  A LITTLE BIT ON TOP OF THERE, 
  RUB IT DOWN REAL GOOD,        
  A LITTLE GARLIC,              

68
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:36,888
   AND WE'LL PUT                
   SOME OF THIS THYME ON THERE. 

69
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,890
        WE'RE JUST GONNA GRATE  
        A LITTLE BIT OF NUTMEG. 

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,026
A LITTLE BIT OF NUTMEG,         
A LITTLE MORE PATTY, PATTY.     

71
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,028
          JUST RUB IT IN        
          AND IT'S GONNA SIT    
          FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. 

72
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,763
THEN WE'RE GONNA ROAST IT OFF,  
SLOW COOK IT.                   

73
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,665
     YEAH, FOR LIKE FOUR HOURS. 

74
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,366
NOW WE'RE GONNA BEGIN           
THE RUSSIAN DRESSING.           

75
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,435
            IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE, 
            JUST MAYONNAISE,    

76
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,504
      KETCHUP, POMMERY MUSTARD, 
      A LITTLE EGG IN THERE,    
      CHOPPED PICKLES.          

77
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,372
THAT'S A GREAT LOOKING DRESSING.

78
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,174
             JUST A LITTLE SALT 
             AND BLACK PEPPER,  

79
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,110
       RED WINE VINEGAR,        
       A LITTLE WORCESTERSHIRE. 

80
00:02:58,112 --> 00:02:59,978
        THE LAST THING I DO     
        FOR MY RUSSIAN DRESSING 

81
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,046
     IS I JUST STIR IN          
     A LITTLE BIT OF BACON FAT. 

82
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,782
A LITTLE BIT!                   
             JUST A LITTLE BIT. 

83
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,117
MAYBE I SHOULD TRY              
THIS DELICIOUS-NESS.            

84
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,920
MMM, WOW, OH DUDE.              

85
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:11,056
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S FAIR  
TO CALL THAT RUSSIAN DRESSING.  

86
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,791
I MEAN, YOU GOTTA CALL THAT     
LIQUID MOSCOW OR SOMETHING.     

87
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:17,596
SO WE HAVE OUR CURED            
PORK BELLY.                     

88
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,599
NOW COOL IT DOWN, SLICE IT,     
AND MAKE A SANDWICH.            

89
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,734
                       TOTALLY. 

90
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,871
I'LL PUT IT BACK,               
I'LL WAIT FOR THE SANDWICH.     

91
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,273
   WE TAKE SOME DARK RYE,       
   BRUSH SOME DRESSING ON THAT. 

92
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,475
           A LITTLE SWISS,      
           THEN OUR PORK BELLY. 

93
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,477
          A LITTLE FRESH        
          CRACKED BLACK PEPPER, 

94
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,213
                OUR SAUERKRAUT. 

95
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:36,148
              BRUSH THIS DOWN   
              WITH SOME BUTTER. 

96
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,416
TALK ABOUT THE MEANY PANINI.    
            TOSS THIS ON THERE. 

97
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,219
AND YOU PUT THE SLAMA           
ON THE CLAMA?                   

98
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,154
       THAT COOKS FOR           
       JUST A FEW MINUTES       
       TO CRISP UP A LITTLE BIT 

99
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:44,089
              AND FINISH IT OFF 
              IN THE OVEN.      

100
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,091
LOOK AT THAT BAD BOY.           

101
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,827
YOU'VE GOT                      
THE SUBTLENESS OF THE PORK,     

102
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,763
MIXED WITH THE REALLY NICE RUB  
YOU PUT ON IT,                  

103
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,598
YOU SLOW COOKED IT,             
RENDERED DOWN THE FAT.          

104
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,968
YOU GUYS ARE GREAT, MAN.        

105
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,902
I DON'T THINK I'VE ACTUALLY HAD 
A BETTER SANDWICH.              

106
00:03:57,972 --> 00:04:00,038
IT'S SO GOOD.                   

107
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,707
   IT'S A NICE TWIST            
   ON THE TRADITIONAL SANDWICH. 

108
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,976
  I NEED A CURED MEAT SANDWICH. 

109
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,112
TALK ABOUT DIVERSIFIED.         

110
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,847
                        I KNOW. 

111
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,916
       WE'RE TRYING TO DO STUFF 
       THAT WE REALLY LOVE      

112
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,251
  LIKE TRIPE, TONGUE, SALT COD. 

113
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,721
SALT COD AND CHORIZO            
WITH MARINATED OLIVES,          
IT'S AMAZING.                   

114
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,923
(Guy)                           
WAIT A SECOND.                  

115
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,058
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE SALT COD      
AND YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME        
A SANDWICH OUT OF IT.           
                     I SURE AM. 

116
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,327
      THESE ARE TOTALLY FLAVORS 
      LIKE, FROM SPAIN.         

117
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,396
THIS IS THE OLD SCHOOL WAY.     

118
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:27,399
WHY DO THEY SALT COD,           
PRESERVATION?                   
            PRESERVATION, YEAH, 

119
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,334
       SO WE'VE GOT             
       THIS BEAUTIFUL SALT COD, 

120
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,403
              I'M JUST GONNA    
              THROW IT IN HERE. 

121
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,271
WE'VE GOTTA SOAK THIS           
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO            
PULL SOME OF THAT SALT OUT      

122
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:34,940
AND RE-HYDRATE IT.              

123
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:38,143
                 THEN I'M GONNA 
             COVER IT IN WATER. 
LET IT SOAK FOR A DAY OR TWO?   

124
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,478
   A COUPLE DAYS, AND WE CHANGE 
   THE WATER A FEW TIMES.       

125
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,680
            THIS IS THE COD     
            THAT'S BEEN SOAKING 

126
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,816
    WE'RE JUST GONNA TAKE IT... 

127
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,152
SO YOU'D GIVE THAT COD THE NOD? 
         I'M GIVING IT THE NOD. 

128
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,688
      THROW IN JUST A HANDFUL OF
      GARLIC CLOVES.            

129
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:51,890
         WE'VE GOT SOME THYME   

130
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,026
         AND THEN WE'RE GONNA   
         COVER THIS WITH MILK.  

131
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,227
THAT'S WHAT I WAS ANTICIPATING. 

132
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:58,563
    WE'LL COOK IT REALLY SLOWLY 
    UNTIL IT FLAKES APART.      

133
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,766
THEN WE'LL STRAIN IT            
OUT OF THE MILK.                

134
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:03,301
          THEN WE'RE GONNA MAKE 
             A PUREE OUT OF IT. 
OUT OF THE FISH.                

135
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,437
           OUT OF THE FISH      
           WITH A LITTLE BIT OF 
           MASHED POTATO.       

136
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,439
JUST WHAT I THOUGHT             
I WOULD BE GETTING              

137
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,640
WHEN I PULLED INTO              
THIS LOCAL SANDWICH SHOP.       

138
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:11,909
WE'RE GONNA ADD A LITTLE BIT OF 
CRUSHED GARLIC TO THIS.         

139
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,045
       THYME JUST TO BUMP IT UP 
       IN THE FRONT.            

140
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:16,047
WHAT HE MEANS                   
BY BUMPING IT UP TO THE FRONT,  

141
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,849
IT'S GOT THE DEPTH OF THE THYME 
ALL THROUGH THE DISH,           

142
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,985
YOU PUT THAT THYME IN FRESH     
LIKE THAT                       

143
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,453
YOU'LL REALLY GET               
A LITTLE FORWARD TASTE OF IT.   

144
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,922
         WE'RE GONNA ADD        
         A LITTLE BIT OF CREAM, 

145
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,191
A LITTLE BIT OF OLIVE OIL,      
THEN WE'RE GONNA PUREE THIS UP. 

146
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,126
HE'S FLINGIN' FISH.             

147
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,195
OH, IT'S CHUNKY.                

148
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,196
           YEAH, IT'S GONNA     
           BE CHUNKY, FOR SURE. 

149
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:34,065
      WE'RE GONNA ADD           
      JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SALT 

150
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,134
         AND I THINK WE'RE GOOD 
         TO BUILD A SANDWICH.   

151
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,003
WE'VE GOT THESE BEAUTIFUL ROLLS 
FROM A LOCAL BAKERY.            

152
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,871
 TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF OLIVE OIL 

153
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,873
         AND I'M GONNA THROW IT 
         ON THE PRESS           

154
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,108
           JUST TO GET          
           A LITTLE HEAD START. 

155
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,477
 TAKE THE BREAD OFF THE GRILL   
 AND SPREAD THE SALT COD PUREE. 

156
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,546
      THROW IT IN THE OVEN,     
      BROWN IT UP A LITTLE BIT. 

157
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:51,416
 WHILE THAT'S GOING             
 WE'RE GONNA MAKE UP THE SALAD. 

158
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,618
       PARSLEY, A LITTLE        
       THINLY SLICED RED ONION, 

159
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,020
        OIL-CURED BLACK OLIVES, 

160
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,157
SPANISH CHORIZO                 
THAT'S BEEN SLICED AND FRIED UP.

161
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,560
THEN WE ADD A LITTLE OLIVE OIL, 
RED WINE VINEGAR.               

162
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,562
     HERE'S THE SALAD OF FIERI. 

163
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,630
         TAKE THIS AND PUT IT   
         RIGHT ON THE SANDWICH, 

164
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,666
                  CUT IT UP,    
                  AND SERVE IT. 

165
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:14,439
MMM, TALK ABOUT EATING SOMETHING
THAT JUST CONTINUES TO OPEN UP. 

166
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:17,175
OH, THAT'S NICE, THAT'S CRAZY.  

167
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,579
THE TEXTURE AND THE FLAVOR --   

168
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,981
THE CREAMINESS OF THE POTATOES, 
THE SHARPNESS OF THE VINEGAR,   

169
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,450
ALL OF A SUDDEN                 
CHORIZO STORMS THROUGH THE DOOR.

170
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,519
I MEAN, THERE'S SO MANY         
COMPONENTS TO IT.               

171
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,587
IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE            
A GOURMET SANDWICH,             

172
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,523
I DON'T EVEN KNOW               
IF I WANT TO CALL IT GOURMET,   

173
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,792
I WANT TO CALL IT               
FUNK-E-LICIOUS.                 

174
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,660
GET THE FUNK AT BUNK.           

175
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,262
IT'S LIKE A SALTY SALAD         
IN A SANDWICH.                  

176
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:39,598
IT'S REALLY GOOD.               

177
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,666
FRESH INGREDIENTS,              
GOOD INGREDIENTS,               
THEY DO EVERYTHING WELL.        

178
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,468
IT'S THE ONE THING              
THAT PORTLAND NEEDED.           

179
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,470
    WAS A RIGHTEOUS             
    HANDMADE SANDWICH JOINT.    

180
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,472
    A RIGHTEOUS                 
    HANDMADE SANDWICH JOINT.    

181
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:49,407
  WHEN I COME BACK TO PORTLAND, 
  I'M COMING TO BUNK.           

182
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,609
       LOAD THE TRUNK           
       WHEN YOU GO TO THE BUNK. 

183
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:54,012
           I GOTTA MAKE UP      
           ALL MY BUNK WORDS    
           AND SEND 'EM TO YOU. 

184
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,014

           UP NEXT...           

185
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,150

       I LOVE THE CHEESE.       

186

   WE MAKE OUR BREAD EVERY DAY. 

212
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,387
         IT'S ALL IN THE BREAD. 

213
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,455
HOW MANY ROLLS                  
DO YOU MAKE A DAY?              

214
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,324
       BETWEEN 30 AND 50 DOZEN. 

215
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,393
BETWEEN 30 AND 50 DOZEN, OKAY.  

216
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:17,529
       WE START WITH THE WATER. 

217
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:19,464
    THIS IS FRESH YEAST,        
    HEAT IT UP WITH SOME WATER. 

218
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,133
              THEN I HAVE SALT, 
                I HAVE DIAMALT. 
WHO?                            

219
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,402
DIAMALT IS                      
THE FOOD FOR THE YEAST.         

220
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:26,604
FLOUR, 11 1/2 POUNDS            
TO START WITH.                  

221
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,740
WE'RE GONNA MIX IT              
FOR A LITTLE WHILE              

222
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,675
AND THEN WE'LL ADD              
SOME BUTTER AND SHORTENING.     

223
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,011
ANOTHER 12 POUNDS OF FLOUR.     

224
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,212
THIS IS NOT                     
YOUR FIRST RODEO                
IS IT THERE, JOHNNY?            
                             NO.

225
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:36,948
       WHEN THE DOUGH STARTS    
       BEING CARRIED BY THE HOOK
       IT'S READY TO GO.        

226
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,351
NOW WE TAKE IT OUT              
AND WHERE DOES IT GO?           

227
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,752
       IT GOES INTO A DOUGH BOX 
       FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.       

228
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,288
THEN WE PUNCH IT DOWN           
AND IT STARTS TO COME UP AGAIN. 

229
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,624
THIS IS ONE THAT WE'VE PUNCHED, 
FOLD, FOLD, FOLD, AND PUT       
IT BACK.                        

230
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,559
                         RIGHT. 

231
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,595
OH, YOU SHOULD                  
FEEL HOW WARM IT IS.            

232
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,097
WHAT SIZE ARE WE GOING FOR?     
                  4 1/2 OUNCES. 

233
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,367
                THAT IS DEAD-ON.

234
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,569
    I WOULD SAY THAT'S PERFECT. 
THANK YOU, I'M OUT.             

235
00:08:57,638 --> 00:09:00,305
              THAT WAS PERFECT. 

236
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,707
       PUT 'EM ON OUR METAL PAN 
       AND WE'RE GONNA PUT 'EM  
       IN THE METAL PROOF BOX.  

237
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:05,043
IT'S GONNA GET                  
ANOTHER TEN MINUTES             
AND THEN WE'LL ROLL 'EM OUT.    

238
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,511
           WE'LL PRESS 'EM DOWN 
           WITH OUR FINGER,     

239
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,714
     WE WANT TO FOLD IT UP,     
     TURN IT OVER, ROLL IT OUT, 

240
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,916
        THEN I PUT THESE        
        IN THE METAL PROOF BOX. 

241
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:14,051
AND THEY GO ROUND THREE.        

242
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,054
NEXT THING WE'LL DO             
IS SCORE 'EM, BUTTER 'EM,       
AND POP 'EM IN THE OVEN.        

243
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:20,191
       PUSH IT ALL THE WAY DOWN 
       TO THE BOTTOM AND THEN   
       IT WILL STOP.            

244
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,661
'ROUND AND 'ROUND IT GOES.      

245
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:25,396
OH, THESE MUST BE               
THE ONES I ROLLED.              

246
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,666
INTERESTING HOW IT GETS         
A LITTLE CRACKLE TO IT.         

247
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,802
MMM, GREAT CRUST, BUT LIGHT,    
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.              

248
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,204
IT MAKES THE WHOLE SANDWICH.    

249
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,873
  (Guy)                         
  LIKE THE ONE FOLKS HAVE BEEN  
  LINING UP FOR SINCE 1958.     

250
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:37,875
CHEESESTEAK,                    
THIS IS THE SECOND.             

251
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:40,011
IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER.      

252
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:42,213
WHAT WE HAVE HERE               
IS BONELESS RIBEYE.             

253
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,148
IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT FROZEN,  
JUST POP IT IN THE SLEEVE.      

254
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,284
        WE'RE LOOKING FOR LIKE, 
        1/16th OF AN INCH.      

255
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,419
YOU'VE GOT THAT SO THIN         
THERE'S ONLY ONE SIDE TO IT.    

256
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,755
GOES ON THE LINE,               
YELLOW ONIONS.                  

257
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,024
  I'M GONNA PUT A LITTLE BIT OF 
  BUTTER ON THE SIDE.           

258
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,293
ALWAYS BETTER WITH BUTTER,      
AND THEN COVER IT.              

259
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,829
      WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR IT 
      TO GET TO A POINT WHERE   
      WE CAN BREAK IT UP,       

260
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,298
     PUT A LITTLE SAUCE ON TOP, 
     A LITTLE BUTTER AGAIN,     

261
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,367
           MIX IT ALL TOGETHER, 

262
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,569
       AND NOW I'M READY TO PUT 
       MY PROVOLONE CHEESE ON.  

263
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,771
THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE?           
          THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE. 

264
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:11,242
MMM, MMM.                       
          THANK YOU, THANK YOU. 

265
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,844
A LITTLE BIT OF MELTED CHEESE,  
THE THIN SLICE ON THAT MEAT,    
THE ONIONS,                     

266
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,913
ON A FRESHLY BAKED ROLL.        

267
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:18,249
YOU KNOW WHAT THE KICKER        
ON THAT IS, THE BUTTER.         

268
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,651
THE BUTTER'S WHAT DOES THAT.    

269
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:23,054
IT WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE          
SOME FOLKS NERVOUS IN PHILLY.   

270
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,390
               (customer)       
               THIS IS WHAT     
               I COME HERE FOR. 

271
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,525
THIS IS THE BEST STEAK SANDWICH 
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.             

272
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,860
      (Guy)                     
      IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT     
      HOW TO ORDER ONE.         

273
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,862
THIS IS A 95.                   

274
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:35,599
    FOUR KINDS OF STEAK HOGIES, 
    50, 95, 90, AND 9.          

275
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:39,003
"5" IS LIKE AN "S" FOR SAUCE,   
"0" IS "O" FOR ONIONS,          

276
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:42,273
THE 9, YOU TURN IT AROUND       
AND IT'S A "P," PLAIN.          

277
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,609
A 50 IS "S-O,"                  
SAUCE AND ONIONS,               

278
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,678
A 95 IS PLAIN WITH SAUCE,       

279
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,680
AND A NUMBER 9                  
IS TOTALLY PLAIN.               

280
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,149
            SO YOU HAVE THE 50? 
THE 90.                         

281
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:53,218
WHAT NUMBER IS THAT?            
         90, PLAIN WITH ONIONS. 

282
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,886
       A LITTLE BIT OF          
       SAUCE ON THERE, PERFECT. 

283
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,089
            THE SAUCE IS GREAT. 

284
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,959
    (Guy)                       
    FROM AN OLD FAMILY RECIPE   
    LOADED WITH VEGGIES...      

285
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,094
  WE'RE GONNA PUREE ALL OF THIS 
  AND WE'RE GONNA PUT IT        
  THROUGH THAT STRAINER         

286
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,230
               AND IT WILL PUSH 
               EVERYTHING DOWN. 

287
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,165
              I GOTTA TRY THIS. 

288
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,100
        MMM, GREAT,             
        CAN'T DOUBLE DIP,       
        I GOTTA GET SOME BREAD. 

289
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,902
 ANYTHING YOU PUT THAT SAUCE ON 
 IS GOOD.                       

290
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,837
      (Guy)                     
      FROM THE CHICKEN PARM     
      TO THE PASTA...           

291
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,906
     WE COME LIKE               
     EVERY WEEK TO HAVE IT.     

292
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,775
      (Guy)                     
      AND THIS FAN FAVORITE     

293
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,843
        SECOND ONLY TO          
        THE CHEESESTEAK.        

294
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,179
GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN.            

295
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:22,847
       WE'VE GOT FOUR POUNDS OF 
       BREADCRUMBS.             

296
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,783
   WE GRIND OUR OWN BREADCRUMBS 
   FROM OUR BREAD.              

297
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,851
 PECORINO/ROMANO GRATED CHEESE. 

298
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,787
        THIS IS A GARLIC POWDER 
        AND BLACK PEPPER.       

299
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,655
                 FRESH GARLIC,  
                 FRESH PARSLEY. 

300
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:33,124
     RED BELLS, ONIONS, CELERY, 
     THEN WE MIX IT.            

301
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,527
GET THAT ALL INCORPORATED       
AND THEN ADD WATER.             

302
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:38,396
       YEAH, AND THEN           
       WE'RE GONNA ADD OUR EGGS 
       AND LET THAT MIX AROUND  

303
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,532
       AND THEN WE'RE READY FOR 
       THE MEAT.                

304
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:44,135
WHEN YOU PUT THE MEAT IN        
YOU WANT AS LITTLE TIME         
AS POSSIBLE.                    
                         RIGHT. 

305
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,737
             THIS IS ACTUALLY   
             A LITTLE BIT LEANER
             THAN THE 80/20.    

306
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:48,339
SO 85/15?                       
                            YES.

307
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,141
    WHEN IT'S ALL MIXED TOGETHER

308
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,209
               WE MAKE 'EM INTO 
               LITTLE FOOTBALLS.

309
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,279
SO THEY FIT CYLINDERALLY...     

310
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:56,614
       SO THEY FIT ON THE ROLL. 

311
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,750
              SCOOPING 'EM OUT. 

312
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,087
SET, SCOOP,                     
OFF THE PALM OF THE HAND, DOWN. 

313
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,222
WE'RE A GOOD TEAM, JOHNNY.      

314
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,224
I'M GONNA COME AND PLAY         
AT YOUR HOUSE MORE OFTEN.       

315
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,893
THEY GO IN THE OVEN,            
400 DEGREES FOR AN HOUR.        
                        AT 400? 

316
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,563
THEY COME OFF                   
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF COLOR      
ON THE TOP OF IT                

317
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:14,065
AND IT'S STILL VERY TENDER.     

318
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,367
  THAT'S NUTS,                  
  ACTUALLY THOSE ARE MEATBALLS. 

319
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,904
TAKE A ROLL,                    
TAKE A COUPLE OF MEATBALLS      
AND GO IN AT AN ANGLE           

320
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,106
AND PUT SOME SAUCE ON.          

321
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,442
      THE MEATBALL IS AS TENDER 
      AS YOU CAN FIND.          

322
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:28,112
            GREAT TOMATO SAUCE, 
                      NICE JOB. 
THANK YOU.                      

323
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,115
THERE'S NO PLACE BETTER.        

324
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,250
IT'S JUST ONE OF THE THINGS     
YOU GOTTA HAVE.                 

325
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,252
TWO 90s WITH PROVOLONE.         

326
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,320
              A 50 WITH CHEESE. 

327
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,656
               FOR 40 YEARS     
               THIS HAS BEEN    
               THE MEAL FOR US. 

328
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:41,259
ONCE YOU'RE HERE,               
YOU CAN'T WAIT                  
TO GET BACK.                    

329
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,394
CARE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING    
AND DO IT THE RIGHT WAY.        

330
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:46,063

    IT'S VERY NICE TO MEET YOU. 
THANK YOU.                      

333
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,539
      (Guy)                     
      NEXT STOP, CHICAGO...     

334
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:56,674
SOMETHING THAT YOUR MOM MADE,   
BUT BETTER.                     

335
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,542
  (Guy)                         
  FOR JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING.  

336
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:01,012
            OOH, IT'S HOT,      
            TENDER, GREAT ROLL. 

337
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:03,715
       THE GRAVY'S CRAZY, WHAT? 

338
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,255
  HEY, COME HERE, CHECK IT OUT. 

339
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,489
  THIS IS ONE OF                
  THE SMALLEST NEIGHBORHOODS    
  ON THE WEST SIDE OF CHICAGO.  

340
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:15,659
    THIS IS WHERE CAPONE        
    AND HIS BOYS USED TO RUN.   

341
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:18,996
   THIS PLACE RIGHT HERE        
   IS THE DEPOT WHERE YOU GET   
   THE TROLLEYS AND THE BUSES.  

342
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,266
      BACK IN THE DAY           
      YOU COULD GET A RIDE,     

343
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,868
    PICK UP A SANDWICH,         
    OR LAY DOWN A BET,          
    IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.    

344
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,404
    ME TODAY, I'M HERE TO SEE   
    A GUY ABOUT A THING AT      
    THIS PLACE.                 

345
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,675
   THEY GOT THE STUFF,          
   YOU UNDERSTAND, ALL RIGHT.   

346
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:32,810
      NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.     

347
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:36,080
   THIS IS THE DEPOT DINER      
   WHERE YOU HAVE GOTTA COME    
   AND SEE THIS FIVE-STAR CHEF  

348
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,616
  AND WHAT HE'S DOING           
  TO DINER FOOD, OFF THE HOOK.  

349
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,618
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,               
EXPLAIN THIS TO ME.             

350
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,087
THIS IS THE APPLE PANCAKE       
AND IT'S GOT LEGITIMATE         
APPLE IN IT.                    

351
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,956
HOW MANY OF THESE DO YOU ROAST? 
  ONE A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. 

352
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,892
  THE WHOLE TURKEY'S IN THERE   
  AND HALF A PIG.               

353
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,161
         HERE'S YOUR OPEN-FACED 
         TURKEY SANDWICH.       

354
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,296
        IT'S REALLY GOOD.       

355
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,832
IT'S SOMETHING                  
YOUR MOM WOULD MAKE, BUT BETTER.

356
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:57,535
   (Guy)                        
   'CAUSE IT'S ALL MADE         
   BY TRAINED CHEF ROBERT NAVA  

357
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:00,037
    WHO WENT LOOKING FOR        
    A WHITE TABLECLOTH JOINT    

358
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,173
     AND FOUND THIS INSTEAD.    

359
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,575
I LIKE THE HISTORY              

360
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:06,577
AND I LIKE THAT THERE           
WAS NO GOOD RESTAURANT          
IN THIS WHOLE AREA.             

361
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,713
     THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC.     

362
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:10,781
    FRESH INGREDIENTS           
    AND A LITTLE LOVE AND CARE. 

363
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,717
I'LL HAVE                       
THE POT ROAST SANDWICH.         

364
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:14,652
          THE FLAVOR'S AMAZING, 
          IT'S JUST LIKE        
          A POT ROAST DINNER.   

365
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,787
      (Guy)                     
      ONLY YOU EAT THIS ONE     
      WITH YOUR HANDS           

366
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,790
      AND LOTS OF NAPKINS.      

367
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:20,792
               THAT IS A BOTTOM 
               GOOSENECK ROUND? 

368
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,994
BASICALLY, YES.                 

369
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,530
WE'RE GONNA CUT IT ABOUT        
2 1/2 TO 3-INCH SLICES.         

370
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,731
   LOOK AT THAT NICE, WHITE FAT 
   THAT'S GONNA RENDER DOWN.    

371
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,867
IT'S LIKE A BRONTOSAURUS BURGER.

372
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:31,802
FRED FLINTSTONE WAS HERE.       

373
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,072
NOW LIBERAL WITH THE SALT       
AND PEPPER.                     

374
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,940
OIL ON THE GRIDDLE.             

375
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,541
        NOW IT GOES FOR A SEAR, 
        THREE TO FIVE MINUTES   
        ON EACH SIDE            

376
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:39,476
      BEFORE WE'RE GONNA PUT IT 
      IN THE OVEN.              

377
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,546
IT GOES WITH                    
A FRIED ONION GARNISH.          

378
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,614
           OH, THOSE ARE GREAT. 

379
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,950
AND YOU MAKE THE GRAVY FOR THIS.

380
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:48,019
BUTTER, WE'RE GONNA ADD         
THE FLOUR TO THE BUTTER         
AND MAKE THE ROUX.              

381
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:50,021
NOW WE'RE GOING TO POUR IN      
THE POT ROAST LIQUID,           

382
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,356
WHISK IT,                       
ADD A LITTLE WATER,             

383
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,425
AND THE LAST THING              
IS A LITTLE BEEF BASE.          

384
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,627
       IT DOES LOOK LIKE        
       A FRED FLINTSTONE STEAK. 

385
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,496
                         WILMA! 

386
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,565
               WHICH ONE'S GUY? 

387
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,835
ADD A LITTLE MIREPOIX,          
BAY LEAF ALL AROUND,            
ADD SOME WATER,                 

388
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:06,437
COVER THIS, AND WE'RE GONNA     
PUT IT IN THE OVEN AT 375       
FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS.          

389
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,706
THE POT ROAST                   
SHOULD BE READY NOW.            

390
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,574
     NOTHING LIKE               
     A LITTLE POT ROAST FACIAL. 

391
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,510
SEE HOW IT COMES APART          
NICE AND EASY?                  

392
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,379
YOU DON'T THINK                 
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT              
TO TRY IT?                      

393
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,849
LOOK AT THAT, DELICIOUS.        

394
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:20,051
IT NEEDS TO TASTE GREAT         
BY ITSELF                       

395
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,787
SO THE GRAVY IS                 
JUST ANOTHER LAYER,             

396
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,989
IT'S NOT COVERING UP            
WHAT'S NOT RIGHT.               

397
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,791
AFTER YOU SHRED IT              
YOU PUT IT IN THE AU JUS,       

398
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,926
IT ADDS A LITTLE MORE MOISTURE  
AND WARMS IT UP.                

399
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,928
      AND WHAT'S IN THAT BROTH? 

400
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,997
THE SAME LIQUID THAT WE ROAST   
THE POT ROAST IN.               

401
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,999
THE FRIES, THE POT ROAST,       
GRAVY ON EVERYTHING.            

402
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,335
             FRIED ONION RINGS, 
             LOOK AT THAT.      

403
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,737
         OH, HOT,               
         GRAVY DOWN THE FINGER. 

404
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:42,740
  MMM, TENDER, HOT, GREAT ROLL, 

405
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,209
             THE GRAVY'S CRAZY. 

406
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,745
          IT'S NOT JUST SOME    
          THICKENED BEEF STOCK. 

407
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,350
                         WHAT?  

408
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,752
      MAN, CONGRATULATIONS,     
      THAT'S A KILLER SANDWICH. 

409
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,688
JUICY AND TENDER.               
           OH, GRAVY'S AMAZING. 

410
00:15:57,724 --> 00:16:00,958
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT
HAS BEEN A HAPPY SURPRISE.      

411
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,094
OUT HERE I WATCH THEM EAT       
EVERY BITE                      

412
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:05,229
AND YOU SEE                     
THE SMILE ON THEIR FACE.        

413
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,165
WHAT'S MORE REWARDING THAN THAT?

414
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,233
IT'S SORT OF LIKE BEING AT HOME.

415
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,168
   (Guy)                        
   IF YOUR MOM SPENDS ALL DAY   
   IN THE KITCHEN.              

416
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,171
HOMEMADE STOCK,                 
SLOW-ROASTED TURKEY.            

417
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,506
       JUST LIKE YOU FIND       
       AT EVERY DINER.          

418
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,775
YOU LET THIS COOL DOWN,         
SO WE DON'T CUT IT              
AND LOSE THE JUICES.            

419
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,910
     (Guy)                      
     KEEPIN' IT MOIST           
     FOR A HUGE TURKEY CLUB.    

420
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,580
WHAT DO YOU THINK?              
                             NO.

421
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,849
I AM SLOWLY RELEASING MY JAW.   

422
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,918
I LEARNED THAT                  
FROM "WILD KINGDOM."            

423
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,387
LIKE THAT.                      

424
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,989
LOOK AT THAT,                   
THAT IS GREAT.                  

425
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:34,192
TALK ABOUT DRAGGING THE TURKEY  
THROUGH THE GARDEN.             

426
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,394
  (Guy)                         
  OR HOW ABOUT                  
  THROUGH THE GRAVY             
  FOR THE HOT TURKEY SANDWICH.  

427
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,596
 IT'S SUNDAY DINNER ON A PLATE, 

428
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,731
    (Guy)                       
    SUNDAY DINNER ON A PLATE,   

429
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:43,401
    SCRATCH-MADE                
    WITH ALL THE FIXINGS,       
    I MEAN, ALL THE FIXINGS.    

430
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,737
WHOLE-BERRY                     
CRANBERRY SAUCE.                

431
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,339
(Guy)                           
IT'S ALREADY TOUGH ENOUGH       
TO DO THE DINER GIG             

432
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,541
SO YOU TO MAKE IT LESS TOUGH    
ARE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MAKE     
YOUR CRANBERRY SAUCE.           

433
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,810
              YES, THAT'S TRUE. 

434
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,812
LET'S GET THIS GOING.           

435
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,948
    FRESH ORANGE JUICE,         
    NOW SOME FRESH CRANBERRIES, 

436
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,883
   SOME SUGAR, GROUND CINNAMON, 
   AND A LITTLE ALLSPICE.       

437
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,287
       WE'RE GONNA STIR IT UP,  
       LET IT COME UP TO A BOIL 
       FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES.    

438
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:06,290
       I LOVE CRANBERRY RELISH. 
YOU CALL IT CRANBERRY RELISH.   

439
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,826
I DON'T COOK IT AS FAR DOWN     
AS IT WOULD TURN IT INTO SAUCE, 

440
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,962
  LIKE WHAT YOU GET IN THE CAN. 

441
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,097
          I DO IT JUST UNTIL    
          THE CRANBERRY BURSTS. 

442
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,766
           LET THEM COOL,       
           THEN READY TO SERVE. 

443
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:18,102
AND THEN HERE COMES THE TURKEY. 

444
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,171
WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT             
A LIGHT STEAM.                  

445
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,573
       SOMEONE JUST TURNED UP   
       THE SLATHER FLOOD GATES. 

446
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,109
THE MASHED POTATOES,            
NOW A LITTLE GARNISH,           
FRESH CRANBERRY RELISH.         

447
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,377
THE GRAVY.                      

448
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:30,048
 IS THAT AN OPEN-FACED MONSTER, 
 OR WHAT?                       

449
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,318
             OH, THAT'S KILLER. 

450
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,454
           CRANBERRY GREATNESS, 
           LOOK AT THAT SAUCE.  

451
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,755
          YOU SHOULD SELL THAT. 

452
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,925
                OH, YOU DO,     
                THAT'S AWESOME. 

453
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:46,931
 YOU SWING THROUGH EVERY PITCH. 
THANK YOU.                      

454
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,133
THE BEST THING                  
THAT I HAD EVER EATEN.          

455
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:51,202
       IT'S GOT ALL THE FLAVOR, 
       UNBELIEVABLE.            

456
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:53,137
IT MAKES IT FEEL LIKE           
THANKSGIVING EVERY DAY.         

457
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,206
  (Guy)                         
  BUT INSTEAD OF PUMPKIN PIE... 

458
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,742
  I LOST HALF THE RECIPE        
  SO IT'S JUST DONUT HOLES NOW. 

459
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,278
BUD-DA-BUMP,                    
BUT SERIOUSLY, JOHNNY,          
HE'LL BE HERE ALL WEEK.         

460
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,381
       (Guy)                    
       THE HOLE STORY           
       WHEN WE COME BACK.       

461
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,389
               TURKEY SANDWICH. 

462
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,590
  (Guy)                         
  AT THE DEPOT DINER IN CHICAGO 

463
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:17,261
   VETERAN CHEF ROBERT NAVA'S   
   GONE FROM FINE DINING        
   TO FINE DINER.               

464
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,398
IT IS COMFORT FOOD,             
HOME-COOKED.                    

465
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:23,734
THE OPEN-FACED TURKEY SANDWICH, 
THE BEST THING THAT I HAD       
EVER EATEN.                     

466
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,537
POT ROAST LIKE I COULD GET      
FROM MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE.    

467
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,140
   (Guy)                        
   AND JUST LIKE AT GRANDMA'S,  
   THEY'RE SCRATCH-MAKING       
   DESSERT TOO.                 

468
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:32,143
OH, THE MADE-TO-ORDER           
MOCHA DONUTS.                   

469
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,478
THERE'S A HOMEMADE MOCHA SAUCE  
THAT COMES WITH THEM            

470
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,414
THAT'S TOPPED                   
WITH WHIPPED CREAM.             

471
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,150
   EGGS AND FLOUR, ALL-PURPOSE, 

472
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:42,687
      BAKING POWDER,            
      A LITTLE VANILLA,         
      GOOD PURE VANILLA, SUGAR. 

473
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:45,289
SO AT LEAST YOU DON'T HAVE THIS 
DOWN TO A COMPLETE SCIENCE.     

474
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,291
      NO, I'M STILL WINGING IT. 

475
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,293
                 THEN THE MILK. 

476
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,562
    SO BEAT IT UP A LITTLE BIT. 

477
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,364
        WE LET 'EM SIT          
        FOR AT LEAST 30 MINUTES 

478
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,433
 BEFORE WE EVEN DARE SCOOP ONE. 

479
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,235
THE ELASTICITY COMES OUT OF     
THE GLUTEN AND WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

480
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,437
THIS IS NOT HIS FIRST RODEO.    

481
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,706
OR DONUT BOWL.                  

482
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,641
                OKAY, DOUBLE-D, 
                DOCTOR DINER,   

483
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,909
  WHAT ARE YOU PRESCRIBING NOW? 

484
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,645
NOW, IT'S DONUT TIME.           

485
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,847
            IS THERE MUSIC NOW, 
            A DANCING DONUT?    

486
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,249
SEE, DONUT TIME.                

487
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,986
 OKAY, DOCTOR DINER'S           
 GOING OFF THE DOCTOR DEEP END. 

488
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,121
            PRE-MEASURED SCOOP. 

489
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:20,191
FIVE OF 'EM, WAIT A SECOND,     
THEY'RE GONNA POP UP TO THE TOP.

490
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,393
    WOW, LOOK HOW BIG THEY GET. 

491
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,261
 WHEN THEY BROWN ON BOTH SIDES, 
 THEY ROLL OVER?                

492
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,130
SOMETIMES THEY DO               
AND SOMETIMES THEY RESIST,      
SO WE GIVE 'EM A LITTLE FLIP.   

493
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,267
   YOU JUST HAVE TO TRAIN THEM. 

494
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:31,468
AS THEY EXPAND                  
THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW            
THEY'RE FINISHED COOKING.       

495
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:34,605
   HOT OIL NUGGETS              
   DROPPED INTO CINNAMON SUGAR. 

496
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,275
ROLL 'EM AROUND,                
GET 'EM NICE AND COATED         
ON ALL SIDES.                   

497
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,344
      YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO MISS 
         A SQUARE CENTIMETER... 
NO.                             

498
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,013
SOME POWDERED SUGAR             
ON EVERYTHING.                  

499
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:46,017
       VERY QUIET RIGHT NOW,    
       LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,    
       WE ARE IN DONUT SURGERY. 

500
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,885
A LITTLE CHOCOLATE SAUCE --     
HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM,           

501
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:50,087
SWISS CHOCOLATE AND COFFEE.     

502
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,289
WHISK THE CHOCOLATE,            
SAUCE IN THE RAMEKINS,          
CREAM ON TOP.                   

503
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:56,160
MY SON HUNTER RIGHT NOW         
IS GOING, "I SHOULD HAVE        
GONE WITH YOU TO CHICAGO, DAD." 

504
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,896
DOCTOR SAYS                     
IT'S READY TO GO.               

505
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,298
              TAKE TWO OF THESE 
   AND CALL YOU IN THE MORNING? 
YES.                            

506
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,301
         HOT MOLTEN SUGAR FEST. 

507
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:07,238
        MMM, THAT REMINDS ME OF 
        BEING AT THE FAIR.      

508
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,307
             IF YOU'RE GONNA GO 
             AND EAT SOMETHING  
             THIS SUGAR DOUSED  

509
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,377
YOU MIGHT AS WELL EAT SOMETHING 
THAT'S FRESH MADE AND HAND MADE 

510
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,513
     AND ALSO MADE BY A DOCTOR. 

511
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:17,782
                EXCELLENT, MAN. 
THANK YOU.                      

512
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:20,117
INCREDIBLE,                     
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.          

513
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:22,386
            SUGAR EXPLOSION,    
            THEY ARE DELICIOUS. 

514
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:24,588
MESSY, BUT SUPER WORTH IT.      

515
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,857
WHEN YOU COME TO THE DEPOT DINER
BRING A CHANGE OF CLOTHES.      

516
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:29,794
    WHEN PEOPLE ARE VISITING ME 
    I BRING THEM HERE.          

517
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,728
         IT'S AN AMAZING PLACE. 

518
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,931
YOU SAY TO EVERYBODY YOU KNOW,  
YOU GOTTA GO TO THE DEPOT.      

519
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:37,001
THIS ISN'T EVEN WORK,           

520
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,003
THIS IS LIKE HAVING             
YOUR FRIENDS COME OVER.         

521
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,671
WE LISTEN TO MUSIC,             
WE CHIT CHAT,                   

522
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:42,740
AND I COOK THEM                 
SOMETHING TO EAT.               
                  AND THEY PAY. 

523
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,742
   SEE, IF I COULD JUST GET 'EM 
   TO PAY AT MY HOUSE.          

524
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,677
   SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP.  

525
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,679
     I'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME     
     ON "D.D.D." --
