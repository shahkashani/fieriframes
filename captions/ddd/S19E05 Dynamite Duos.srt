00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,133
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,601
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:06,672
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,740
          This trip...          
  Epic.                         

5
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:11,210
       ...we're pairing up      
    with some dynamite duos.    

6
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:12,277
    Sounds good.                

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,613
 In Manhattan's East Village... 

8
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,348
              Ohh! Smell this.  

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,750
    ...the brother-and-sister   
             team...            

10
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:20,752
 Looks kind of like             
 a hip-hop boy band.            

11
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,421
  ...showing off their wings... 

12
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:25,023
These are gonna be outrageous.  
 I can already tell.            

13
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,692
  ...and exposing their necks.  

14
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:29,361
      Top three best goat dishes
               I've ever had.   

15
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,829
      In Miami, Florida...      

16
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,163
So you're an inventor.          

17
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:35,500
     ...a sibling operation     
with a tasty sense of tradition.

18
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,102
     My parents are great cooks,

19
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,838
            and my grandparents 
         were even better cooks.

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,706
  And in Eureka, California...  

21
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,374
   Is this really               
how big this thing is?          

22
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,177
...one couple gives it all up...

23
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,380
So, you guys have taken         
a gigantic leap of faith.       

24
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,250
    ...to tap in to their own   
      particular passions.      

25
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:53,118
Creole-Mediterranean fusion.    

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,319
                    Yeah.       

27
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,388
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

28
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,257
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

31
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,538
  So I'm here in New York City  
      in the East Village.      

32
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,141
  Now, this is pretty familiar  
    territory for "Triple D."   

33
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,610
 Let's see, we got The Redhead, 
    we got the Brindle Room,    

34
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:21,880
 and, of course, John's on 12th 
   right down the street here.  

35
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,748
         Now, we're here        
      to check out a joint      

36
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,950
 where a brother and sister have
 partnered up with some buddies,

37
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:28,486
  and they got this restaurant  
  with a pretty eclectic menu.  

38
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:29,822
      This is Ducks Eatery.     

39
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:40,966
       Everything is just       
    pretty much untouchable.    

40
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,300
   Crispy pig-ear               
   lettuce wraps.               

41
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,570
           Definitely           
     flies under the radar.     

42
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:46,171
      FIERI: Not for long.      

43
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,973
      Word about this joint     
   has ripped through the city  

44
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:52,311
   since it started in 2012 by  
siblings Will and Julie Horowitz

45
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:53,778
       and a few friends.       

46
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,716
 Looks kind of like             
 a hip-hop boy band             

47
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:00,119
with the lead singer            
right here, you know?           

48
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:01,520
           All right,           
   I'm about to simmer these.   

49
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,321
   You can tell that they have  
     a real passion for it.     

50
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,190
Where did you learn to cook?    

51
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,259
My grandparents on both sides   
     were chefs.                

52
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:10,329
I learned out in Colorado,      
   Southeast Asia.              

53
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:11,796
 A lot of influence             
   from traveling.              

54
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,732
         JULIE: We have         
  the jerk chicken wings here.  

55
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,066
         They're always         
       trying new things.       

56
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,002
Goat neck up. Table 5.          

57
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:20,272
   I'm having the goat's neck,  
      and it is delicious.      

58
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:23,675
             So, why goat neck? 

59
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,812
I was in Nepal, and in Nepal,   
they have this famous dish      

60
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,882
that's, like, goat-feet         
 or lamb-feet curry.            

61
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:30,949
We loved the flavors.           

62
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,818
  We wanted, like,              
a big chunk of meat.            

63
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,954
It turned out that the neck     
was perfect for smoking.        

64
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,222
         So let's get into this.

65
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,423
    Fresh garlic.               

66
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,958
     Palm sugar.                

67
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,827
Ground dried Thai chilies.      

68
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:45,764
Here's some star anise,         
coriander, some dried bay.      

69
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:48,700
       We have                  
some black cardamom.            

70
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:49,902
   We're gonna add              
a little green cardamom, too.   

71
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:52,304
         Are we gonna get after 
       the entire spice cabinet?

72
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,506
Big part of what we do.         
Some regular black peppercorn.  

73
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,441
      We get it                 
from southern Vietnam.          

74
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,243
  Juniper berries.              

75
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,611
                Kaffir leaf.    

76
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,118
              Ohh! Smell this.  

77
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,788
       You guys didn't pay your 
subscription for Smell-O-Vision.

78
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,324
Then we start adding all of     
our dried powder ingredients.   

79
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:13,925
           More is getting added
                  to this?      

80
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,394
    So much more.               
 This is just half.             

81
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,662
It needs togarashi chili.       

82
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,331
                Love togarashi. 
 My favorite.                   

83
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,799
Regular old dried cayenne.      

84
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,200
 Some garlic powder.            

85
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,602
 Some onion powder.             

86
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:24,902
 Some mustard seed.             

87
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,605
  We have paprika.              

88
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:29,140
  Yellow turmeric.              

89
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,876
We have some chili powder,      
    brown sugar,                

90
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,679
and a little bit of salt        
      in here.                  

91
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,347
We're gonna start adding in     
some of our liquids.            

92
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,616
Vietnamese fish sauce.          

93
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,618
Dark Thai soy sauce.            

94
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,221
And then we're gonna emulsify a 
little bit of water inside here.

95
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:43,889
 It's great, right?             

96
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:44,823
                    Mmm!        

97
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:45,991
    Get in there.               
    Have a taste.               

98
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,228
                  Get out!      

99
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,231
Now we're gonna take            
   our goat necks,              

100
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,432
and we're gonna place them      
  in our marinade.              

101
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,069
        Necks into the fridge --
                  24 hours.     

102
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,306
Let's get after this.           

103
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,041
 We're smoking with             
 what kind of wood?             

104
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,077
              WILL: Mostly oak  
    and a little bit of hickory.

105
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,514
             About seven hours, 
                 about 225.     

106
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,316
           Let's take these guys
             out of the smoker. 

107
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,118
                    Whoo!       

108
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,721
 These are gonna be             
     outrageous.                

109
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,689
 I can already tell.            

110
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:22,594
    Put it back in the marinade,
            braise it this way. 

111
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,763
         All right, in the oven 
    four and a half, five hours.

112
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,199
                    Whoa!       

113
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:28,266
   WILL: Exactly.               

114
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,368
        Dude!                   

115
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,537
     We got our cast iron going.
Okay.                           

116
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,474
Gonna start off by just throwing
a little bit of butter in there.

117
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,409
       This is our master fat --

118
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,611
                  bacon fat     
       and pickled pastrami fat.

119
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,745
   That's the fat?              

120
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:44,016
This just can't get             
any more ridiculous.            

121
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,950
         Just baste it with fat.

122
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,819
              Spread your glaze 
                a little bit.   

123
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:50,622
        Baste a little bit more.

         Awesome homes,         
       really cool shops,       

240
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,772
     and killer restaurants,    
    like this joint -- Whisk.   

241
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:15,747
   Everything in here is just   
   so fresh and so delicious.   

242
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,081
                  BRENDAN:      
            Cornmeal-fried okra.

243
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,084
   It's the southern, gourmet,  
     low-country restaurant.    

244
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,486
       Shrimp and grits for you,
                    sir.        

245
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,621
   And there's nothing like it  
            in Miami.           

246
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,757
       Fried-green-tomato salad.
               Right on time.   

247
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:33,298
             FIERI:             
  And the man with the plan is  
Miami's own Chef Brendan Connor,

248
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,034
 whose academic pursuits led him
   to the Carolina low country  

249
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,571
  for reasons other than food.  

250
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:41,839
              I heard there was 
         a 7-1 girl-to-guy ratio

251
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,042
   at the College of Charleston.

252
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,577
 And while he did earn a degree 
           in history,          

253
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,445
 he also got a killer education 

254
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,381
     in some of Charleston's    
          best joints.          

255
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:54,385
 And in 2011, he and his sister,
  Kristin, opened up this spot, 

256
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,921
serving up the low-country meals
        they grew up on.        

257
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:59,056
     My parents are great cooks,

258
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,726
            and my grandparents 
         were even better cooks.

259
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:05,596
              And we took a lot 
       of what their basics were

260
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:06,765
              and refined them  
                a little bit.   

261
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,671
And he's even putting a twist on
fresh seafood from the coast... 

262
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,005
            Whole-fried snapper.

263
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,608
     ...by topping it with a    
scratch-made Asian peanut sauce.

264
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,478
    Kind of like a Caribbean    
   meets southern home cooking  

265
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,879
          kind of dish.         

266
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,815
      It's quite flavorful.     

267
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,884
      We're gonna start scoring 
   and preparing this fish here.

268
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,554
         We can use yellowtail. 
         We can use red snapper.

269
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:32,157
    Lane snapper's what they had
                for us today.   

270
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,493
 First thing we do to prepare it
         is cut off the fins -- 

271
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,895
            side and the bottom.

272
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,765
            Next we are going to
                diamond-score   

273
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,635
      so that it makes it easier
               for you to eat.  

274
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:45,570
FIERI: It also gets --          
If we're gonna fry this,        

275
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,038
      it's nice                 
to be able to get in there      

276
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,707
    with some of                
the crunch-a-taciousness.       

277
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,307
 That's an Uncle Bo             
    right there.                

278
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,310
           Crunch-a-taciousness,
                   indeed.      

279
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,711
        Yep.                    

280
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,380
        Okay.                   

281
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,315
            We want to make sure
             it can talk to you 

282
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,983
              when it goes out  
              onto the plate.   

283
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:01,186
         Naturally, a little bit
            of salt and pepper. 

284
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:03,454
              Dredge it lightly 
               in corn starch.  

285
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,522
Oh, nice and crunchy.           

286
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:05,590
                That's right.   

287
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:06,858
Now we'll go to the fryer?      

288
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,926
             To the fryer we go.

289
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,660
    Are we frying               
in anything special?            

290
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,196
Peanut oil? 10-40?              
                     Peanut oil.

291
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,664
  Of course you do.             
You're a low-country kitchen.   

292
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,200
You got to be running           
     peanut oil.                
              Always peanut oil.

293
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,335
                So we've got    
            our whole-fried fish

294
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,672
                ready to go,    
         ready to hit the plate.

295
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:22,140
          Got to take the skewer
              out of the mouth. 

296
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,209
        Epic.                   

297
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:27,078
  And ready for a little bit of 
  that low-country peanut sauce.

298
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,279
    Look at that.               

299
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,415
        I like to finish it off 
        with some fresh cilantro

300
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,484
                 right there    
               in the pocket.   

301
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,418
         Oh.                    

302
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,955
    Look at that.               

303
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,356
  That is awesome.              

304
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:45,964
If you like fried fish          
but you like real fish flavor,  

305
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,166
whereas a lot of times,         
fried fish will kind of get lost

306
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,834
using fish that doesn't have    
  a lot of flavor,              

307
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:53,504
  this is the best              
  of both worlds.               

308
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,906
 The crunchy texture            
 of the fried fish,             

309
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:58,243
all the flavor coming from      
the bones and the skin,         

310
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:01,045
       really,                  
it is the best of both worlds.  

311
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,181
  Outrageous, man.              
    Killer dish.                
                    Thank you.  

312
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:06,117
What's your favorite thing      
    on the menu?                

313
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,452
      Snapper.                  

314
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,254
    FIERI: Is it? Hands down?   
Hands down.                     

315
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,589
      Cooked to perfection.     
        This is our second home.

316
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,792
     I feel like I'm family     
  whenever I come in the door.  

317
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,460
  FIERI: 'Cause comfort food's  
      always been important     

318
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,129
     for the Connor family.     

319
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,265
          Every time we'd go eat
          with our grandparents,

320
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:23,134
   there were biscuits and gravy
    freshly made every morning, 

321
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,136
                fried chicken   
   that'll knock your socks off.

322
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,138
       So he's re-creating      
       that same feeling,       

323
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,874
        even if it means        
doing things a little different.

324
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,876
      We wanted to do ribs here.

325
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:34,278
        We don't have a smoker, 
 so we decided we'd braise them.

326
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,146
               So this is what  
             we came up with -- 

327
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,682
                beer-braised    
               baby-back ribs.  

328
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:41,619
We started with this rub here --
      powdered garlic, onion -- 

329
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,020
                granulated --   

330
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,423
          oregano, chili powder,

331
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,759
              salt and pepper,  
              and brown sugar.  

332
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:50,695
Being from the south            
and the low-country cooking,    

333
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,831
       I mean,                  
what does your grandpa say      

334
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,166
about you not having a smoker   
   for these ribs?              

335
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,501
 [ Southern accent ]            
   "You did what?"              

336
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,903
                 He might be    
          a little disappointed,

337
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:01,305
   but I think the final product
        he'd be all right with. 

338
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,843
                  We get in     
             a nice, meaty rib. 

339
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,778
That's a big baby back.         
     That's a big baby-back rib.

340
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,979
                Now it's time   
              to rub the ribs.  

341
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,216
         Make sure to apply this
               very liberally.  

342
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:22,060
  Now you're gonna              
 let them marinate?             
                      Overnight.

343
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,661
              When they're done 
                 marinating,    

344
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,930
   we'll put them on a hot char 
 grill with some salt and pepper

345
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,733
           to really caramelize 
    the brown sugar on the meat.

346
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,402
               Now that we've   
              charred the ribs, 

347
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,671
   we're gonna add some mirepoix
                   to it,       

348
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,074
      our beer, our veg stock...

349
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:38,809
          ...wrap it in plastic,
                 then foil,     

350
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,477
            and then we're ready
             to go to the oven.

352
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,249
For how long?                   
                About two hours.

00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,278
                   Mm-hmm.      

466
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,680
Put a little bit of our barbecue
               right on that.   

467
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:15,319
   Then we're gonna put a little
   barbecue sauce on this side. 

468
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:21,225
       And this guy has got his 
  brown caramelization on there.

469
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,895
           And then we dress it.

470
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,565
   Is this really               
how big this thing is?          

471
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:28,899
                    Yeah.       

472
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,635
            Gets a little pickle
            and a pepper on it. 

473
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,636
    Look at that.               

474
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,106
 That is ridiculous.            

475
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:43,047
The liquid smoke, the dry rub,  
 the Worcestershire,            

476
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:46,284
    the Humboldt                
habanero hot sauce...           

477
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,921
...all of that together --      

478
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:51,989
That's some of the best         
out-of-the-oven pulled pork     

479
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,057
      I've had.                 

480
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,859
You killed this. Ohh!           
                    Thank you.  

481
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:02,399
   I don't know how they        
   make it crispy and tender    
   at the same time. Love it.   

482
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,868
             WOMAN:             
    The barbecue sauce is --    

483
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,603
      I honestly would like     
      to take a bath in it.     

484
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:08,472
      FIERI: This was my English
      teacher in my sophomore   
      year of high school.      

485
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,208
           This is Mr. Pulitono.

486
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,210
        A man                   
with a mustache my size --      

487
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:15,012
I need a stack of napkins       
to get into this sandwich.      

488
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,480
     See how he sets it up vague
              at the beginning? 

489
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,081
         He's not really talking
               about the food.  

490
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,750
          He's just bringing you
              into the moment.  

491
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,685
      And then                  
you dig in to the sandwich.     

492
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,287
    Mm-mm-mm-mm.                

493
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:24,888
        Ohh.                    

494
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,557
God, that's good stuff          
    right there.                

495
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,758
      Good job.                 
  Really good job.              

496
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,759
You're gonna love this.         

497
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:33,564
 So, that's it for this edition 

498
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,366
     of "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

499

501

     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

502
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:44,108
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

503
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,310
               What do you do?  
Everybody makes                 
  pulled pork.                  

504
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:48,111
  I'm a therapist.              
                  Yes, you are. 

505
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,246
         Tell me about your mom.

506
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,981
      Oh, God,                  
now you're therapisting me.     

507
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,250
              Therapisting you? 
Yes, I coined that word.        

508
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,318
                  Time out.     

509
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,853
     Is that a real word --     
          therapisting?         

510
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,254
                   No, it's not.
      Thank you very much.      

511
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,523
    I might just now bring my   
    English teacher with me.
