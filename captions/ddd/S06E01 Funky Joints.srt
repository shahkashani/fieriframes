135
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,651
I LIKE TO USE                   
FRESH BREAD.                    

136
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,321
MAKE SURE THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN 
    IS COMPLETELY COVERED.      

137
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:25,323
WE'RE JUST GONNA USE            
 THIS FRENCH BREAD.             
                   THESE ARE NOT
                  LITTLE PIECES.

WE WANT THE BREAD IN THE PAN    
    TO BE VERY, VERY TIGHT.     

140
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:33,064
   WHEN WE POUR LIQUID ON THIS, 
    THIS'LL WAY 500,000 POUNDS. 

141
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:35,467
PRESS THE BREAD DOWN.           
IT'S GONNA BE TIGHT.            

142
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:37,869
AND WE'RE GONNA COVER           
      THE TOP.                  
                    MORE LIQUID?

143
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:41,072
WE WANT THE BREAD ON TOP        
   TO BE SOAKED ALSO.           

144
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,608
              LOOK AT THAT MESS.
IT IS SLOPPY,                   

145
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,811
BUT THEY COME OUT GOOD.         
         WE GOT THE PLASTIC WRAP
        TO LOCK IN THE MOISTURE.

146
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,347
     AND THEN WE'VE GOT THE HEAT
       BARRIER WITH THE FOIL.   

147
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,150
             350 IN A WATER BATH
              FOR WHAT? AN HOUR?
TWO HOURS.                      

148
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:53,885
                      TWO HOURS?
YES.                            

149
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,688
                 SO IT'S REALLY 
                GONNA COOK DOWN.
 AND THEN WE'LL                 
TAKE THE TOP OFF.               

150
00:05:56,757 --> 00:06:00,558
WE CRUST THE TOP, AND THEN      
 WE FLIP THE BREAD OVER.        
                  AND THEN BROWN
                 THE OTHER SIDE?

151
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:04,228
         SO YOU DOUBLE-CRUST IT?
   FINE, GIVE                   
THE SECRETS AWAY.               

152
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,431
                        SHH!    
                     OKAY, DONE.

153
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,233
                  AND THE SAUCE.
   <i> THAT'S SCRATCH-MADE, TOO,</i>   

154
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,234
 <i> WITH BUTTER, SUGAR AND COGNAC.</i>

161

289
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,143
DEGLAZE WITH A LITTLE BIT       
      OF RED WINE.              

290
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,080
  ADD SOME, UH,                 
GROUND TOMATOES.                
           WELL, THAT'S ABOUT AS
            TRADITIONAL ITALIAN 

291
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:25,016
             AS YOU'RE GONNA GET
               THERE, BROTHER.  
PUT THIS BACK IN.               

292
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,551
COVER IT WITH A LITTLE BIT      
    OF PARCHMENT PAPER.         

293
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:29,553
IT'S TO CONTROL THE HEAT.       
                HOW LONG IS THIS
                  GONNA COOK?   

294
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,023
   ABOUT FIVE HOURS.            
THE LONGER, THE BETTER.         

295
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,893
             LOW AND SLOW, BABY.
   OUR ELK IS                   
NICE AND BRAISED.               

296
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,896
       WOW. THE DICE IS RIGHT-- 

297
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,431
                    BOB BARKER. 

298
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,833
I'M GONNA TAKE MY MEAT AND THEN 
     THIS BRAISING LIQUID.      
                          OH-HO.

299
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,835
THAT'S GONNA MAKE               
  UP THE SAUCE                  

300
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,170
FOR OUR POTATO ROASTED          
    GARLIC RAVIOLI.             

301
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,306
NICE LITTLE TOSS                
ONTO THE PLATE.                 

302
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,842
          THAT'S A BIG PORTION. 
A LITTLE RICOTTA CHEESE.        

303
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,310
TOUCH OF PARSLEY.               

304
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,178
       MMM. IT'S AWESOME, DUDE. 

305
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,981
               THE ELK IS SUPER 
                MONSTER-TENDER, 

306
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,583
                   SUCCULENT,   
                 NOT DRIED OUT, 

307
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,385
       REALLY NICE RICH FLAVOR, 
              NOT GAMEY.        

308
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,722
 I CHALLENGE ANYBODY TO TELL ME 
 THAT THEY DON'T LIKE WILD GAME,

309
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:06,257
      THEN HAVE THEM TRY THAT.  
     ANOTHER STELLAR DISH, MAN. 

310
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:09,194
      COME TO THIS CRAZY KITCHEN
          AND THINK I'M GONNA   

311

           GET STUFF LIKE THAT--
              THAT'S BIZZARRO.  
I JUST THOUGHT                  
IT WAS AMAZING.                 

312
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,365
      I MEAN, THE SAUCE PICKS UP
         THE FLAVOR VERY WELL.  

313
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,467
IT WAS GREAT.                   
       I LOVE EVERYTHING        
          ON THE MENU.          

314
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,471
 I COME HERE FIVE NIGHTS A WEEK.
  IT'S SORTA SPOILED ME ROTTEN.

00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,473

         IN ABOUT THREE MINUTES.

316
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,475
        (Guy) THE ONE THING I'VE
           BEEN IMPRESSED WITH

            THAT'S A TRUE CHEF. 

319
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:30,615
                      IMPRESSED.
   TO BE ABLE TO COME           
AND BE IN THIS ATMOSPHERE       

320
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:32,149

 PLACE TO GO.

  YOU WANT THEM TO DESCRIBE IT? 

325
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,761

326
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:46,297
   WHAT JUST HAPPENED TO US?"   

327
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,632
                         WOW.

   IT'S DONE?                   
                USE YOUR FINGER.
                  THERE YOU GO.

        THE FUNKY JOINTS,       

335
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,653
  AND THEY'RE USUALLY IN THOSE  
 OBSCURE, OUT-OF-THE-WAY PLACES.

336
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:12,657
        BUT I GOTTA SAY,        
  THIS ONE MIGHT TAKE THE CAKE. 

337
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:15,392
I CAN'T EVEN FIND A STREET SIGN.
    WELL, THERE'S AN ADDRESS.   

338
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,728
 BUT THERE'S NOT EVEN A SIGN ON 
THE BUILDING THAT SAYS THE NAME.

339
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,931
  IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE JAMIE'S,  
       HERE IN SACRAMENTO.      

340
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,133
      AND FROM WHAT PEOPLE      
         ARE TELLIN' ME,

   THIS PLACE IS OFF THE HOOK.  

342
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,804
      GREAT LITTLE DIVE BAR

              IT'S ALL HOMEMADE.
               IT'S ALL FRESH.  

344
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,543
  I GOT A HALIBUT.              
CHICKEN SANDWICH UP.            

345
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,745
  I WOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT EXPECT 
        THIS KIND OF FOOD       

346
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:36,281
     TO COME OUT OF A PLACE     
           LIKE THIS.           
        (woman) PRIME RIB COMIN'
           RIGHT OVER, HON.     

347
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:38,950
      JAMIE'S INCREDIBLE.       
        <i> THAT'D BE OWNER</i>        
        <i> JAMIE BUNNELL.</i>         

348
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:41,352
                  WHO TAUGHT YOU
                   HOW TO COOK? 
    KINDA WENT THROUGH          
THE SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS.      

349
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,754
   <i> HE STARTED AS A SODA JERK</i>   
       <i> WHEN HE WAS A KID</i>       

350
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:46,691
  <i> AND ENDED UP 15 YEARS LATER</i>  
   <i> WITH A JOINT OF HIS OWN.</i>    
     YOU JUST NEED THE DIP.     

351
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,826
         I FOUND THE CHEAPEST   
       RESTAURANT I COULD FIND. 

352
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,762
                 COULD YOU TELL?
DIDN'T EVEN COME                
  WITH A SIGN.                  

353
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:53,898
MIXED GRILL FOR YOU.            
          (Jamie) IT WAS ALWAYS 
        KIND OF A GUYS' HANGOUT.

354
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,100
            YOU KNOW, COME DOWN 
           AND HAVE A FEW BEERS.

355
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,102
         BUT I WANTED TO IMPROVE
         THE FOOD A LITTLE BIT. 

356
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,970
        YOU WANTED TO IMPROVE IT
             "A LITTLE BIT"?    
YEAH, A LITTLE BIT.             

357
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,974
  <i> YEAH, LIKE KOBE CHUCK ROAST</i>  
     <i> AND SMOKED PRIME RIB.</i>     

358
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,109
SMOKED PRIME RIB.               
    YOU GOTTA HAVE THE PRIME RIB
          WHEN YOU'RE HERE.     

359
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,111
 <i> AND THE GARLIC STEAK SANDWICH?</i>

360
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,780
        <i> HE'S DOIN' THAT</i>        
      <i> WITH FILET MIGNON.</i>       
          THIS IS JUST          
        OFF THE CHARTS.         

361
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,783
     OKAY, WE'RE GONNA START OFF
         WITH THE MARINADE--    

362
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:13,651
    SOME WHOLE CLOVES OF GARLIC,
         ADD SOME OLIVE OIL,    

363
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,454
            KOSHER SALT,        
    FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,         
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.         

364
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,791
THERE'S NO SIGN OUT FRONT,      
    BUT EVERY MORNING,          

365
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:21,859
YOU FRESH-GRIND THE PEPPER?     
                          RIGHT.

366
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,861
 AHH, THAT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE,
       DOESN'T IT AT HOME?      

367
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:26,297
         WE'RE GONNA ROAST THIS 
          AT ABOUT 400 DEGREES  

368
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,400
               FOR ABOUT AN HOUR
                  AND A HALF.   
AND THIS IS ALL                 
 JUST TO BEGIN                  

369
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,868
A STEAK SANDWICH.               
                     ABSOLUTELY.

370
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:33,004
      THAT'S GOOD.              
SO THE GARLIC'S ROASTED.        

371
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,072
 OH, IT SMELLS AWESOME. WE'RE   
GONNA FINALLY START MARINATING. 

372
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,608
HEY, HEY, HEY,                  
   I'M NOT--                    
   WE'LL GIVE YOU AN APRON, GUY.
          IT'S ALL RIGHT.       

373
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:39,811
NO, EVEN IN MY OWN KITCHENS,    
   I DON'T WEAR AN APRON.       

374
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:42,012
AND WHAT KIND OF MEAT ARE WE    
USIN' FOR STEAK SANDWICHES?     
                          FILET.

375
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,148
FILET. YOU FEEL                 
  THE MAGIC?                    
             TAKE THE CHAIN OFF.

376
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,217
IT'S LIKE MEAT BLING.           
        YEAH.                   

377
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,219
             SO WE'RE JUST GONNA
              CUT SOME STEAKS.  

378
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,154
THAT'S A NICE LITTLE            
 2 1/2-OUNCE PIECE.             
                           YEAH.

379
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,223
   SO YOU JUST                  
PALM-TENDERIZE IT               

380
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,225
JUST TO OPEN IT UP              
   A LITTLE BIT?                

381
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,160
NOW HOW LONG WILL YOU           
  LET IT MARINATE?              
             AT LEAST OVERNIGHT.

382
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,162
          IT'S ADDING A BIT MORE
            FAT BACK TO A FILET 

383
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:00,565
         THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT
              OF FAT IN IT.     
   THIS IS OUR                  
MARINATED FILET.                

384
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,167
                OH, BE GENEROUS.
                I'M YOUR FRIEND.
STEAKS DON'T TAKE               
   TOO LONG,                    

385
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:06,237
ABOUT 30 SECONDS A SIDE.        
                 GONNA PUT      
            THE BREAD DOWN, TOO?

386
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,771
YEP, SWEET FRENCH ROLLS.        

387
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,840
    A LITTLE BUTTER.            
A LITTLE ROASTED GARLIC.        

388
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,842
                  I'D BE HAPPY  
                 JUST WITH THIS.

389
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,311
TAKE SOME GOOD-QUALITY          
     MAYONNAISE.                
                IN A PIPING BAG.

390
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,180
                  COULD JUST DO 
                THE SPOON DOLLOP

391
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,182
              LIKE WE DO AT ALL 
            THE OTHER DIVE BARS.

392
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,717
                      NOT HERE. 

393
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,920
       YOU'RE KILLIN' ME, JAMIE.
HOW DO YOU LIKE                 
YOUR STEAK, GUY?                

394
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,221
                   MEDIUM RARE. 

395
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:30,261
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.          
                        (laughs)

396
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,795
THAT IS FANTASTIC.              
                           GOOD.

397
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,331
IT'S SUPER TENDER.              

398
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,133
THE BREAD'S GOT A NICE          
    ROASTED GARLIC,             

399
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,267
A LITTLE CRUNCH TO IT.          
  THAT IS RIDICULOUS.           

400
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,937
I AM SO GLAD I DON'T            
 LIVE CLOSE TO YOU.             

401
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:44,208
 I'D BE BROKE                   
AND OVERWEIGHT.                 

402
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,610
          IT'S A GREAT SANDWICH.
 THEY'RE ACTUALLY               
SEARING THE GARLIC              

403
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:49,547
RIGHT INTO THE STEAK.           
         DID ANYBODY TELL YOU   
      WHEN YOU BOUGHT THIS PLACE

404
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,682
         YOU COULD'VE JUST DONE,
        LIKE, BURGERS AND FRIES?
THEY TOLD ME THAT,              

405
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,884
BUT WE'VE GOTTA GIVE THEM       
     SOMETHING GOOD             

406
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,220
           SO THEY'LL COME BACK.
     JAMIE IS A TRUE CHEF.      

407
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,423

             I MAKE ON SATURDAY 
                 AND SUNDAY.    
SO YOU'RE NOT OPEN              
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY,            

409
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,227
BUT YOU'RE HERE COOKING         
 SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.           
                          RIGHT.

410
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,430
 THERE'S SUCH A QUALITY AND CARE
        BEHIND THE FOOD.        

411
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:08,098
       (man) HIS TURKEY IS      
    ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE.    

412
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,967
     BACON HE CURES HIMSELF.    

413
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,902
   HE'S A REAL HANDS-ON GUY.    
BRISKETS?                       

414
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:15,373
                 PORK SHOULDERS.
<i>AND HE'S DOIN' HIS OWN SMOKIN'</i>  
       <i> IN A RIG OUT BACK--</i>     

415
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,642
      <i> EVEN THE PRIME RIB.</i>      

416
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,311
    IT'S A UNIQUE PRIME RIB,    
    AND IT'S DONE PERFECTLY.    

417
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,313
NICE-LOOKIN' RIB EYE.           
      NO BONE.                  

418
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:24,248
 GIVE ME THE RUBDOWN.           
          OKAY, WE'RE GONNA GO--

419
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,317
(laughs)                        
                 WE'RE GONNA GO 
               WITH KOSHER SALT.

420
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,986
    CAYENNE PEPPER. OKAY, WE GOT
       SOME OLD BAY SEASONING.  

421
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,255
OLD BAY ON--                    
               OLD BAY IS GOOD  
             ON ALMOST ANYTHING.

422
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,924
              A LITTLE PAPRIKA, 
            GRANULATED GARLIC...
SO THIS IS YOUR                 
DRY RUB YOU MAKE.               

423
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,860
           CRACKED BLACK PEPPER,
                   OKAY?        
ALL RIGHT.                      

424
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,596
     A LITTLE ONION POWDER,     
SOME SUGAR AND SOME DRY MUSTARD.

425
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,898
NOW WHERE DID YOU               
   LEARN THIS?                  
           JUST PLAYIN' WITH IT.

426
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,334
AGAIN, AT THAT CULINARY         
SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS?          
                   THAT'S RIGHT.

427
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,736
                  WE'RE GONNA   
              SHOW IT SOME LOVE.
NOW ARE YOU GONNA               

428
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:48,672
LET THIS DRY RUB SIT            
 ON HERE FOR A BIT?             
       IT ACTUALLY HELPS IF YOU 
      LET IT SIT A LITTLE WHILE.

429
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,941
          YOU DON'T REALLY WANT 
        TO LET IT SIT OVERNIGHT,

430
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,943
          'CAUSE IT'LL ACTUALLY 
         PULL TOO MUCH MOISTURE 

431
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,479
            OUT OF THE RIB EYE. 

432
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,280
 WE'RE GONNA PUT THE HOOK HERE, 
 AND WE'RE GONNA LET THIS FAT...

433
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,816
   DRIP DOWN                    
AND BASTE IT.                   
               DRIP DOWN THROUGH
                 THAT RIB EYE.  

434
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,819
  I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY       
THROW IT ON THE HONKA HOOK.     

435
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:04,155
       WE'RE JUST GONNA POP IT  
    IN HERE WITH EVERYBODY ELSE.

436
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,357
HOW LONG YOU BEEN               
   DOING THIS?                  
                       22 YEARS.

437
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,692
 ALL RIGHT, SO SIX HOURS?       
HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S DONE?      

438
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,162
                USE YOUR FINGER.
OKAY, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE      
   DIGITAL THERMOMETERS         

439
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:12,563
AND SCIENCE.                    

440
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,833
LOOK AT THAT.                   
            COMES OUT REAL NICE.
              COOKS REAL EVENLY.

441
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:18,168
   AND THIS IS ABOUT THE PORTION
        THAT YOU WOULD GET.     

442
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,705
IS THAT THE PAUL BUNYAN CUT?    
           IT STAYS REALLY JUICY
                COMIN' OUT.     

443
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,840
      IT'S KIND OF A HOT SMOKE. 

444
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,042
 WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT SOME AU JUS
      AND SOME HORSERADISH.     

445
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:28,846
   I GOTTA GET RIGHT IN         
THE CENTER OF THIS BAD BOY.     

446
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,114
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.               

447
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:32,050
THAT'S A REALLY NICE            
   PIECE OF MEAT.               

448
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,052
LITTLE SMOKE FLAV--             
NOW WAIT A SECOND.              

449
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,453
WHERE'D THE AU JUS              
    COME FROM?                  
         THAT ACTUALLY COMES OFF
            OF OUR POT ROAST.   

450
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:39,056

451
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,858
THIS DOESN'T MAKE               
   ANY SENSE.                   

452
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,194
IT'S SOME SUPER-TENDER          
      PRIME RIB,                

453
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:45,129
BUT THAT LITTLE SMOKINESS       
      ON TOP OF IT              

454
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,131
AND HOW IT'S COOKED DOWN        
     FOR THAT LONG--            

455
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,399
THAT'D COMPETE WITH             
ANY PRIME RIB HOUSE.            

456
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,401

SOMETHING, MAN,                 

457
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:53,670

    IT MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH.

   OF GARLIC.

482
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,495
TO GIVE IT A LITTLE BITE,       
      CHILI FLAKE.              

483
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:54,465
                   YOU JUST MAKE
                  THIS STUFF UP.
RIGHT.

FRESH CRACKED PEPPER.           
   THIS IS BRANDY.              

485
00:18:57,103 --> 00:19:00,103
                  AND SOME WINE.
A LITTLE WINE.                  

486
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,840
WE'RE GONNA LET THIS ALCOHOL    
   KIND OF COOK OFF A BIT.      

487
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,808
WE HAVE SOME CHICKEN STOCK.     
                           OKAY.

488
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,844
LET THIS REDUCE DOWN.           
STRAIN OUT THE SHELLS.          

489
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:09,513
                 BREAK THIS DOWN
                  A LITTLE BIT. 
 YOU LEARN THIS                 
IN DIVE BAR 101.                

490
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,515
 THIS IS WHAT                   
THEY TEACH YOU.                 

491
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,651
THIS SHOULD JUST                
    BE SOUP!                    

492
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,920
         NOW WHAT'S GONNA GO ON?
      I'M GONNA ADD             
A LITTLE BIT OF OLIVE OIL,      

493
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,788
A LITTLE BIT OF FENNEL          
AND SOME LEEKS TO IT.           

494
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,257
    ONCE IT'S SAUTéED UP,       
WE'RE GONNA ADD FRESH BASIL.    

495
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,260
A LITTLE KOSHER SALT.           
      MORE FRESH CRACKED PEPPER.

496
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,595
     THESE ARE GONNA BE SAUTéED 
   AND THEN PUT IN TO THE SAUCE.
RIGHT.                          

497
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,597
AND THEN WE'RE                  
GONNA FINISH IT                 

498
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,533
   WITH A LITTLE                
BIT OF HEAVY CREAM.             
            HEY, WE'RE NOT DONE?

499
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,601
THIS IS GONNA COOK DOWN         
     A LITTLE BIT.              
          SO WHILE THAT REDUCES,

500
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,603
                WE'RE GONNA COOK
                  THE SEAFOOD.  
RIGHT.                          

501
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,405
NICE.                           
              DROP THESE INTO   
           SOME SEASONED FLOUR--

502
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,407
   JUST FLOUR, SALT AND PEPPER. 

503
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,409
              FISH IS GONNA TAKE
                 THE LONGEST.   
OH, LOOK AT THAT.               

504
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,411
     NOW DOWN WITH THE SCALLOPS,
        'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT   

505
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,479
        TO OVER COOK THOSE,     
   AND THE SHRIMP GO SUPER FAST.

506
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,882
     OKAY, SO NOW               
ALL THE SEAFOOD'S DONE.         
             PUT A PIECE OF FISH
            RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE.

507
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:47,018
        COUPLE PRAWNS. I'M GONNA
           GIVE YOU A SCALLOP.  

508
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,153
       I'M GONNA PUT SOME FRESH 
     DUNGENESS CRABMEAT ON HERE.
               GOT IT.          

509
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:51,088
 SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE SOME BASIL,
        JULIENNED LEEKS,        

510
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:53,490
       A LITTLE BIT MORE FENNEL,
        A LITTLE CORNSTARCH...  

511
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,026
AND PUT A LITTLE                
  DREDGE ON IT.                 
                 A LITTLE SALT, 
                A LITTLE PEPPER.

512
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,561
AND FRY IT.                     

513
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:59,563
ALL RIGHT, LET ME LOOK          
  AT THAT SAUCE NOW.            

514
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:01,498
          GET A LITTLE TEXTURE. 

515
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,635
IF THIS TASTES ONE-TENTH        
 AS GOOD AS IT LOOKS...         

516
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,904
MMM.                            

517
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,373
  THAT WOULD BE GOOD            
ON JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.         

518
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,442
THE SCALLOP IS DONE             
 PERFECTLY RIGHT.               

519
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:13,577
THE SHRIMP ARE NICE.            
     BIG U-12s.                 

520
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,514
    MMM, I KNOW FOR A FACT      
I DIDN'T DRIVE UP TO THIS PLACE 

521
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,516
EXPECTING TO GET                
EVEN 1% OF THAT.                

522
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:21,652
THAT'S OFF THE HOOK.            
       IT'S WHAT I WOULD        
        CALL FANTASTIC.         

523
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,255
      EXCEPTIONALLY CREAMY      
     AND A LITTLE BIT SPICY.    

524
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:26,790
   IT'S FABULOUS, JUST THE WAY  
    JAMIE DOES IT EVERY TIME.   

525
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,060
       THE FOOD JUST MAKES      
   YOUR TASTE BUDS GO INSANE.   

526
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,061
  IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE PLACES 
        YOU FEEL AT HOME.       

527
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,997
           YOUR SMOKED          
        PRIME RIB, BABY.        

528
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:34,932
  (Jamie) YOU PUT SOME GOOD FOOD
         IN THEIR TUMMIES,      

529
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:37,000
             THROW TWO COCKTAILS
             DOWN THEIR THROAT, 

530
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,002
     AND THEY START TO LIKE YOU,
              YOU KNOW?         
CRAZY HOW THAT HAPPENS.         

531
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,539
THAT'S HOW I GOT                
ALL MY BUDDIES.                 

532
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,540
   SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP,  

533
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,609
     BUT WE GOT PLENTY MORE     
         JOINTS TO FIND.        

534
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,611
     I'LL BE LOOKIN' FOR YOU    
    NEXT TIME ON TRIPLE-"D."    

535
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:49,614
                       NO SIGN. 

536
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:54,885
     I MEAN,                    
WHAT DO YOU THINK?              
                        PERFECT.

537
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:57,555
              TELL ME THAT'S NOT
                  LEGIT, HUH?
