00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,279
That homemade barbecue sauce,   
   it gets me every time.       

334
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:56,281
       Their Anadama bread      
         is to die for.         

335

             FIERI:             
   Which isn't the only thing   

336
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,217
     they're scratch-bakin'     
         in this joint.         

337
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,820
        Cookies. Muffins.       
 They're known for their scones.

338
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,288
       A lot of desserts.       

339
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,890
   The bread is always a star   
      in their sandwiches.      

340
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,492
        Haddock rolls up!       

341
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,494
  A delicious haddock sandwich. 

342
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:12,029
    Pan-fried in what we call   
      that Maine tradition.     

343
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:15,500
   And it's an excellent roll.  
  And it's obviously homemade.  

344
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:16,768
So what are we gonna make?      

345
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,569
      We're gonna make the dough
        for the snowflake roll. 

346
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,037
Why do you call it              
the snowflake roll?             

347
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,974
   You put the flour on the top.
   And it kinda looks like snow.

348
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,241
Let's get into it!              

349
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,544
       All right. So we'll start
        with some local honey.  

350
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:29,047
                    Water.      
               Active dry yeast.
Got it.                         

351
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,314
              High-gluten flour.

352
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,917
   So canola oil. And some salt.

353
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,719
                And then,       
         some all-purpose flour.

354
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:35,854
How long is this gonna go?      

355
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,455
         Oh, five minutes or so,

356
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,924
         till it's smooth       
   and comes together in a ball.

357
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,392
       -And then, I'll --       
      -So it speaks to you?     

358
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,861
             -Yeah.             
        -It is ready now.       

359
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,196
   How long's that              
gonna take to proof?            

360
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,065
        -15, 20 minutes.        
  -Then we're gonna portion it? 

361
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,334
Yep.                            
               Ooh, you got     
          two hands goin' on it.

362
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:52,470
Yeah, you wanna                 
do it with me?                  

363
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,672
            I can't get the left
              hand to respond!  

364
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:57,608
    -I know, isn't it funny?    
   -The right hand, I'm good.   

365
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,944
Yeah, you are.                  
              It's the left     
         hand that's a hot mess.

366
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,412
  That's okay!                  
I press 'em down                

367
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:03,014
  and put a little              
more snow on the top.           

368
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,549
Flour keeps it soft.            

369
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,016
         And how long does it go
            in the oven for?    

370
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,285
       -About 18 minutes.       
            -Next up?           

371
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,554
The dredge for the haddock.     

372
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:10,688
           -Fantastic.          
           -Cornmeal.           

373
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,825
Hot paprika, Hungarian.         
   And black pepper.            

374
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,159
Mix 'er up.                     

375
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,761
             -Okay.             
  -Dip the haddock in the milk. 

376
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,496
Cornmeal mix.                   

377
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,898
  -We gonna get some oil goin'? 
        -And the haddock.       

378
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,767
               And this is fresh
                haddock, local? 

379
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,368
   Yep. I love

                Celeste's famous
                  tartar sauce? 

383
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,510

              I like Celeste    
          just stays back there.

384
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,245

           We never see her.    

385

              [ giggles ].

              Look at that, huh?

388
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:46,591
  This has got fantastic flavor.

Thank you.                      
               It's subtle.     
          It's not over the top.

390
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,662
        Really good ingredients,
              put together      

391
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,630
           in a really nice way.

392
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:55,333
      I feel like I should be   
  eating this sitting on a dock,

393
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,468

394
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,270

         fried fish sandwich.

00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,675

             plus, plus         

397
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,676
                 because        
        you're makin' the bread.

398
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,079
                      Delicious.

399
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,014
       You can go anywhere      
      for a fish sandwich.      

400

      But people come here.     

401
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,084
  They cooked it to perfection. 

402
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,286
        Moist and tender.       
   Just the way it should be.   

403
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,955
   And the bread just makes it  
       all come together.       

404
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,291
 Pickled red onions

                         Thanks.

00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,645
       that's what you can      
         pay it forward.        

445
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,046
This is my kinda church!        

446
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,715
'Cause there's a lot            
of integrity in this.           

447
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,650
          Starting with         
      Chef Laura Rountree,      

448
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,586
     who ditched fine dining    
       for her dream job.       

449
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:58,056
            I didn't really know
             what I wanted to do

450
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,857
          until somebody said,  
         "Here's a thing to do."

451
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:01,125
                  I was like,   
               "That's perfect."

452
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,860
  You can't get any better food 

453
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:05,062
   in any of the higher-priced  
          restaurants.          

454
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,531
         Smoked pork up!        

455
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:09,667
   Today, I got the wonderful   
 smoked pork with the chow-chow.

456
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,803
  Kind of like a pickled relish 
         type of thing?         

457
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,004
          It's awesome.         

458
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:14,938
           So we're gonna make  
         the barbecue spice rub.

459
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,941
    -All right. Get after it.   
            -Paprika.           

460
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:19,010
                 Cayenne pepper.
                  Chili powder. 

461
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,345
      That is some chili!       
You're sure they're not coffee? 

462
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,946
       I know. It's really dark.

463
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,681
          Cumin. Mustard powder.

464
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:25,883
  Shout it out                  
when you know it!               

465
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:27,952
    BOTH: Granulated garlic!    
                      [ Laughs ]

466
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,486
      Brown sugar. Black pepper.

467
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,356
           -And salt.           
           -All right.          

468
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,357
    So this is gonna            
get applied to the butt.        

469
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,493
            Mm-hmm. We put it   
        in the cooler overnight.

470
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,094
How long is it gonna smoke,     
       at what temp?            

471
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,497
                 9 hours at 160.

472
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,699
                 And then we do 
                 7 hours at 250.

473
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,367
 -You really goin' low and slow.
             -Yeah.             

474
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,969
          -And then...          
          -We shred it.         

475
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:47,438
  -How are we gonna serve this? 
   -It goes on a Kaiser roll.   

476
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,906
             -Okay.             
       -With chow-chow...       

477
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,174
Oh, we're gonna make some       
    chow-chow, right?           
                         Mm-hmm.

478
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,508
             So we have cabbage.

479
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,444
                Yellow onion.   
             Mixed bell peppers.

480
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,579
  That's gotta be local         
garden bell peppers then        
                         Mm-hmm.

481
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,048
        -Green tomatoes.        
             -Okay.             

482
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,584
       A little bit of jalapeño.
            And some salt.      

483
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:02,053
        Leave them in the cooler
               overnight.       
I dig it.                       

484
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,787
Okay. So the veggies            
  have been salted.             

485
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,390
 Look at all that liquid        
that comes out of the veg       

486
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:06,723
right there. Next up?           

487
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,793
           We have some mustard 
           seed and celery seed.

488
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,327
              We're gonna toast 
             those a little bit.

489
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,196
    -Oh, not in the toaster?    
        -Right. Exactly.        

490
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,597
Yeah, that's hard               
 to get 'em out.                

491
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,199
            Apple cider vinegar.

492
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,601
         -Water. Sugar.         
             -Okay.             

493
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:18,803
         Ginger powder. Mustard.

494
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,138
   -That's red pepper flakes.   
          -Chili flake!         

495
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,605
           -Turmeric.           
    -Great color out of that!   

496
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,074
            Cinnamon.           
 And then we add our vegetables.

497
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,544
 We reduce it. And it gets kinda
        thick and syrupy.       

498
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,412
         -For how long?         
     -About an hour or two.     

499
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,614
       -Okay. Time to eat!      
          -Time to eat.         

500
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,615
               Put a nice scoop 
               of pork on there.

501
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,085
           The chili mayo.      
     And we make this here, too.

502
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,554
       -And our chow-chow.      
       -Is the bun local?       

503
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,823
         We have it cooked at   
       the culinary school here.

504
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:41,225
          -Oh, really?          
            -Mm-hmm.            

505
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,893
Mm. That's a great sandwich.    

506
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,628
    It's tender.                
It's got good smoke.            

507
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,297
That's the bark line            
    right there.                
                         Mm-hmm.

508
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:47,899
Ooh, that's smoke's             
  comin' through.               

509
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,701
The chow-chow plays             
into it perfectly.              

510
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:51,835
Bun is dynamite!                

511
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,237
 Culinary students              
are doin' it right.             

512
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,905
     -It's a great sandwich.    
          -Oh, thanks!          

513
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,174
           -Nice job.           
           -Thank you.          

514
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:58,042
More chow-chow, please.         

515
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,043
     One minute on the pork!    

516
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,244
      MAN: It's marvelous.      

517
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,647
       The pork is smoked       
         just perfectly.        

518
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,649
    Everything that she puts    
        on this sandwich        

519
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,317
  makes it an awesome sandwich. 

520
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:09,052
 You can see a ministry at work 
 and what it's doin' for people.

521
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,654
A lot of folks can't pay.       

522
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,590
      They're just told their   
   whole lives, in so many ways,

523
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,725
         that they don't deserve
            to eat like this.   

524
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,393
            But I think they do.

525
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,462
And they wanna have             
  an opportunity                

526
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,797
  to have somethin' like this.  
             -Right.            

527
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,399
FIERI: Which is possible because
   of the community volunteers  

528
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,068
  who help the small core staff 
       keep things goin'.       

529
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,271
          WOMAN: I was just here
           two days ago working.

530
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,340
   -I love it. What do you do?  
        -I love hosting.        

531
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:32,143
   Oh, I can see why.           
That smile, right there.        

532
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,879
     I got chicken sandwich     
     and parm fries for you.    

533
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,814
        Today, I'm havin'       
  the smoked chicken sandwich.  

534
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,016
  It's served with a bacon jam  

535
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:42,353
 that is outrageously delicious.

536
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:43,687
What are we makin' next?        

537
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,223
           The brine that we put
              on our chicken.   
Okay, hit it!                   

538
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:50,160
         All right. Water. Salt.
            Sugar. Aromatics.   

539
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,229
So some thyme and parsley?      
   A little peppercorn?         

540
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,697
       Mm-hmm. And the bay leaf.

541
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,032
Let that come to a simmer.      

542
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,234
            -Mm-hmm.            
       -Then cool it down.      

543
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:57,768
Pour it on the chicken.         
Let the chicken brine.          

544
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,637
    And then are we gonna       
put a dry rub on that, also?    

545
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,239
         -Yes, dry rub.         
  -Same spice rub that we did?  

546
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,974
       -And then smoke it?      
           -Yes, sir.           

547
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,242
             -Okay.             
       -And then shred it.      

548
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,376
Great.                          

549
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,245
        -What's up next?        
  -We're gonna make bacon jam.  

550
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,446
        -We start with...       
             -Bacon.            

551
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:11,115
            Bacon! Cook it down,
               drain the fat.   
Okay.                           

552
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:14,184
Pour a little bit of our reserve
