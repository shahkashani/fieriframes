        that makes those        
       pita breads for us.      

114
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,771
How many pitas you guys         
go through in a week?           

115
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,373
                   12,000.      

116
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,976
       Put it on the grill      
          a little bit.         

117
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:06,178
  GUY: What else do we have that
         should be getting done?

118
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,913
       Let's get the fries      
            in there.           

119
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,514
         Now, those have        
     already been blanched.     

120
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:10,982
     Just finish those off.     

121
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,784
         Already grated         
       the cheese for you.      

122
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,452
             Where's the cheese 
             going to go, Chef? 

123
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,188
    That's going to go after    
        you fry the fries       

124
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,324
       and you season them      
      with the Greek stuff.     

125
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,126
        Then you just put       
        a mound of cheese       

126
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,660
   right on top of the fries.   

127
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,796
 Yeah, that's where             
   cheese belongs.              

128
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,998
        Yeah, yeah, yeah.       
      That's up your alley.     

129
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,133
    What type of cheese is this,
                    Chef?       

130
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,268
     It's called kefalotyri.    

131
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,871
               Oh, that's what  
     I was going to call it too.

132
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,339
           I thought we've tried
              all the cheeses.  

133
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,474
You've got to send us           
    some of that                

134
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,542
  so we can put it              
   on a sandwich.               

135
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,877
      You know, the Greeks      
       are the number-one       

136
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,412
       consumers of cheese      
          in the world.         

137
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:42,080
   -That's our next location.   
      -We better get on it.     

138
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:45,616
 -You got to find a spot for us.
-Let's go. I'll show you around.

139
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,886
       Alright. I've got some of
           this pork going down.

140
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,487
           -Beautiful.          
          -Looks good.          

141
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,156
Ryder just gets in there        
     with that.                 

142
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,358
    That's a lot of skewers,    
            Dimitri.            

143
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,161
    You should send some over   
       to Boulder for me.       

144
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,230
      They look delicious.      

145
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:00,632
    Let's make the lemon oil.   
      That's pretty simple.     

146
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,435
       That's lemon juice,      
     salt, pepper, oregano,     

147
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:05,303
  Greek extra virgin olive oil. 

148
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,372
            -Alright.           
     -Whisk that real good,     

149
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:11,710
   then pour it on the kebabs   
     after they're finished.    

150
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:15,313
   I saw that toss and catch,   
             Hunter.            

151
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,649
          I like that.          

152
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,184
                  Alright.      
             So here's the deal.

153
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:22,520
Dimitri, thank you very much for
   sending me enough pork kebabs

154
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,656
            to feed your family,
                 my family,     

155
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,192
           and then whoever else
      wanders into our backyard.

156
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,727
          So we're going to take
       a little break right now.

157
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,662
           Don't worry, Dimitri.
          I won't burn the pork.

158
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,531
            -Thanks.            
     -I'll see you in a bit.    

159
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,739
          Welcome back.         
  A little "Triple D Takeout."  

160
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,274
  We've got Crystal and Joseph  
 over at the Grilled Cheeserie, 

161
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:46,344
        Audrey Jane from        
   Audrey Jane's Pizza Garage,  

162
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,613
        and our buddy Lou       
        from Uncle Lou's.       

163
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,615
       Got my nephew Jules      
           and Hunter           

164
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:51,950
       helping me out here      
         in the kitchen.        

165
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,486
      And we're cooking up      
     more Greek pork kebabs     

166
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:56,221
        than I think that       
         we anticipated.        

167
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,556
             How does this look 
                   so far,      

168
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,090
              our buddy Dimitri 
              from Niko Niko's? 

169
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,358
           -Beautiful.          
             -Good.             

170
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,495
   I've got the other 76 of them
        still cooking over here,

171
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,430
             so I'll be at those
              in just a second. 

172
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,098
                    Okay,       
          so some delicious pita

173
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,100
        that you have brought in
               from New York.   

174
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,436
        Guy, put the pita       
      underneath the kebabs     

175
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,504
          so the juice          
     can get into the bread.    

176
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,040
                         Uh-huh.
     Now take the lemon oil     
         that you made.         

177
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,309
      Put it right on top.      

178
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:18,510
    Nice drizzle.               

179
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,579
                 I am known     
       for my precise drizzling.

180
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,447
    A little salt and pepper    
           there, Guy.          

181
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,717
Take the oregano that I gave you
       and just crush it.       

182
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,652
  -So you got the fries, right? 
              -Yep.             

183
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,921
         Now I just put         
 a whole bunch of cheese on top.

184
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,189
            Oh, yeah.           

185
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,257
     And where does the Tzatziki
               come into play?  

186
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,194
            Tzatziki            
       goes on everything.      

187
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,462
         Now you got to         
          have a beer.          

188
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,596
            Yeah, not right now.

189
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,731
           We still got to visit
             other restaurants. 

190
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,402
  You're just trying to tamper  
 his taste for ours, aren't you?

191
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,204
     You can do it just like    
 you're making a little sandwich

192
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,807
         or just take it        
      right off the stick.      

193
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,542
                    Wow.        
      With the fries on it, too.

194
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:53,611
            And yeah.           
          There you go.         

195
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,480
           Yes, good.           

196
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:58,349
              Wow. Speechless.  

197
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,885
  That was so good.             

198
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,620
     Great pork.                
You got to do that on barbecue  

199
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,355
   if you get that              
barbecue flavor for sure.       

200
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:05,957
But then you get this nice fresh
feeling from the Tzatziki.      

201
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,025
 Come here, Gramps.             

202
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,761
                There you go.   
      You got three generations.

203
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,030
                There you go.   
       Yeah, that's my dad, Jim.

204
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,765
              -Jim.             
           -Hey, Jim.           

205
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,834
  I'm forgetting that we're even
          doing a show right now

206
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,902
             'cause I'm feeding 
                  so fast.      

207
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,037
                And Hunter's    
               exactly right.   

208
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,173
         Doing this on the grill
             is really the key. 

209
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:24,843
    It caramelizes up beautiful.
        The fries are fantastic.

210
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,777
And the cheese that I don't know
                the name of.    

211
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,845
           Kefalotyri.          

212
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,514
              You get that nice 
              Tzatziki clean-up 

213
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,182
      with the shredded cucumber
                  in there.     

214
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,785
         Refreshes palate. Boom.
     You go in for another bite.

215
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,121
             Sometimes it's hard
          to take the restaurant

216
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,522
          out of the restaurant,
                take it home,   

217
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,125
        and have the experience,
but it couldn't feel any better.

218
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,993
                    Man,        
     you did an outstanding job.

219
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,595
    Thank you so much, guys.    

220
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:45,730
       Alright. Let me introduce
       one of the newest members

221
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,598
       of the "Triple D" family.

222
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,000
      Audrey Jane's Pizza Garage

223
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,803
   is a funky little pizza joint
                 that rocks.    

224
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,339
The sausage is great.           
The oregano is dynamite.        

225
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,608
The right-size pepperoni.       
The roasted jalapeños.          

226
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,944
I can't find anything           
    I don't like.               

227
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:01,212
 Watch out for her.             

228
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,881
    Wow. I know what that is.   

229
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,349
       Thank you. We always need
             a good pizza peel. 

230
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,752
  Actually, if you open it up,  
    there's a brush as well.    

231
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:08,887
  HUNTER: Awesome.              

232
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:09,954
                   Tell us      
              what you sent us. 

233
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,556
              Today             
    you're going to be making   

234
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,891
   an amatriciana grandma pie.  

235
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,961
             A what?            
      It's an amatriciana.      

236
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,896
      I call it Patty style     
           at my place          

237
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,632
 because my mom used to make it 
       when I was little.       

238
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:23,101
     My mom's name is Patty.    
 I should have said that first. 

239
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,437
     Let me get the rundown,    
 because I know when we get into

240
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,905
     this kind of a pie tin,    

241
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,173
          we're making          
  a Roman-style pizza, correct? 

242
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,509
 Rome is a little bit different.
    It's a little bit airier.   

243
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,044
   So this is a grandma style,  

244
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,112
 which you're going to push out 
          and let rise.         

245
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,514
   We're doing 100% sourdough.  

246
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,648
                    Okay.       

247
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,717
       Stretch the pizza,       
        oil up that pan,        

248
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,786
        and then sprinkle       
       your sesame seeds.       

249
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,588
          And then lay the dough
               inside of that?  

250
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,723
           You got it.          
        That looks good.        

251
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:46,992
        And after you get       
      that dough in there,      

252
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:48,927
       you're going to rub      
      some more oil on top.     

253
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,194
  And you really want to press  

254
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,931
         from the middle        
 of the dough into the corners. 

255
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,799
      You want to let this proof
                for how long?   

256
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,267
     I say about two hours.     

257
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,136
        You want it to be       
        nice and fluffy.        

258
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,204
             Okay, so the reason
           that you sent me this

259
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,873
                is to make me   
        go through all the work.

260
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,142
     But in the meantime, you've
      already set me a parbaked.

261
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:07,278
          [ Laughter ]          
           You got it.          

262
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,947
      Oh, wow.                  
 Look at the focus.             

263
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,015
              -Wow.             
             -Yeah.             

264
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,951
      Goodness.                 

265
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:16,021
     So now we're back to taking
            one of the parbaked,

266
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,755
               which is great   
because people that are thinking

267
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:18,889
          about ordering this...

268
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,224
      That parbake is key.      

269
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,492
           -Gorgeous.           
             -Nice.             

270
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,161
      Nice toasted sesame seeds.

271
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,564
     -That looks beautiful.     
           -See that?           

272
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:28,499
   So now we're going to make   
     our amatriciana sauce.     

273
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,234
    Render up that guanciale.   

274
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,570
        I love all the cheek fat
     that's going to be in this.

275
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,839
    And once that's rendered,   
    add that onion in there.    

276
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,441
               Garlic going in  
              in just a minute? 

277
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:37,709
              Yeah,             
    I don't want it to burn.    

278
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,177
                   Got it.      
               Got it. Got it.  

279
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,780
      Add your SuperDolce.      
    It's like a tomato paste.   

280
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,614
            And about three cups
              of tomato sauce?  

281
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,183
            Exactly.            

282
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:48,252
      Now, there should be      
some containers of chili flakes,

283
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,922
     salt, and black pepper.    
                           Okay.

284
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,390
       Let that cook down       
       for like a minute,       

285
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,192
    and you're going to whisk   
      that heavy cream in.      

286
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,594
                Now, "whisk"    
               way does he go?  

287
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,195
          [ Rim shot ]          
              -Wow.             

288
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,663
                      Thank you.
           [ Laughs ]           

289
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:01,065
       Now we're going to       
      put the pie together.     

290
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,001
    What temp should I have that
        oven rolling at, Audrey?

291
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,537
       Crank that bad boy       
           up to 575.           

292
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:07,204
      And how much sauce we want
              on here, sister?  

293
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,875
  Oh, oh, wait. We're going to  
 top it with some cheese first. 

294
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,009
        But that's okay.        

295
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,479
     There can be some sauce    
        under the cheese.       

296
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:15,747
             -Uh-oh.            
         -We're talking.        

297
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,348
          You're moving         
        too fast for me.        

298
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,685
                  We're talking.
    I can't keep up with you.   

299
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:23,755
    You should see a package    
      of sliced mozzarella.     

300
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,289
     Make sure it's covering    
         the whole pie,         

301
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,426
   and also you want it really  
   into the cracks of the pan.  

302
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:29,628
            You want            
       that cheese crust.       

303
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,229
   It's all about               
  the cheese crust.             

304
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,630
      Stripe that sauce on.     

305
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,632
   Just like diagonal stripes   
        all the way down.       

306
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,434
             Really making this 
                 look easy.     

307
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,770
     You can just cover it.     
         Just cover it.         

308
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,638
       You're going to lay      
     the caramelized onions     

309
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,040
      on top of the sauce.      

310
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,442
    And the pre-cooked bacon now
            going on after that?

311
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:45,710
           You got it.          

312
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,311
                This thing is   
         getting out of control.

313
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,980
         That's going in        
          the oven now.         

314
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,716
      Since it's parbaked,      
   probably about 10 minutes.   

315
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,385
        Well, there you have it,
           ladies and gentlemen.

316
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:54,786
             We're going to take
       a small commercial break,

317
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,654
              clean things up,  
              take a brief nap, 

318
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,922
    and that pizza will be done.

319
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,724
    We'll see you in bit here on
             "Triple D Takeout."

320
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,126
                  Alright.      
   I get the first lounge chair.

321
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,261
           You guys are going --
     You guys go to the hammock.

322
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,568
         Welcome back to        
       "Triple D Takeout"       

323

    here at the Fieri house.    

324
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,639
  We've got Crystal and Joseph  
 over at the Grilled Cheeserie,

           in Houston,

         at Uncle Lou's,        

327

     our friend Chef Audrey     
from Audrey Jane's Pizza Garage.

328

    Audrey has just walked us   
        through probably        

329
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,118
   one of the more complicated  
     pizzas we've ever done,    

330
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,386
    but it is well worth it.    

331
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,654
        Let me tell you.        

332
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:30,922
              That looks done.  

333
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,857
           -Oh, yeah.           
       -Man, I'm starving.      

334
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,259
                  Pecorino      
            and hand-torn basil?

335
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,795
         Yep, and hit it        
   with a splash of chili oil.  

336
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,930
           Cut it up.           

337
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,065
Guy need those scissors         
  for his hair too.             

338
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,468
            Watch yourself, Joe.
      You haven't even gone yet.

339
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:49,340
Mmm, I like the thickness of    
this compared to super thin.    

340
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:50,942
 I don't have to eat            
six or seven pizzas.            

341
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,209
 I like the volume.             

342
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,677
         Oh, the volume.        

343
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,948
               The sesame seed  
      on the bottom -- gangster.

344
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,416
                And guanciale   
           in the cream sauce --

345
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,019
    You get that nice creaminess
                  from it.      

346
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,153
        A good amount of cheese,

347
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,888
            and I love the skirt
               that it builds   

348
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,389
     falling off the side of it.

349
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,091
                   Between      
         the salty of the bacon,

350
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,626
                the sweet of    
          the caramelized onion,

351
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:13,231
      and then the chickity-chow
        out of that chili oil...

352
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,366
     There is so much flavor    
        embedded in that.       

353
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,035
     That's just ridiculous.    

354
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:19,370
         Well, I'm glad         
  it was worth the wait, boys.  

355
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,039
          When he gets          
    his happy dance going on,   

356
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,173
      that's when you know      
          he likes it.          

357
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,976
                No, that was    
      my burning my mouth dance.

358
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,312
      I want to remind you guys,
             at the end of this,

359
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:29,313
          my distinguished panel
               of assistants,   

360
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,249
               of sous chefs,   
            and camera operators

361
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,984
     will make a decision of who
      is going to get best dish.

362
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,721
And let me remind you, that does
     not involve cash or prizes,

363
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,189
                 just simple    
              bragging rights.  

364
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:39,724
    And by the way, Audrey Jane,

365
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,926
      it looks like Hunter and I
               are the farmer.  

366
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,060
          [ Laughter ]          

367
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,195
           I love it.           

368
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,729
          But not to be outdone,

369
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:49,267
           now it's time to take
 a road trip from the food truck

370
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,603
             into the restaurant
   with the grilled cheese team.

371
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,273
                    Yeah,       
           that's how you do it.

372
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,474
  This is so good.              

373
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:59,944
I'm gonna go into, like,        
a little dream sequence.        

374
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,948
 GUY: Three restaurants now and 
 still the grilled cheese truck.

375
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,550
               This is gourmet  
              right here, man.  

376
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:06,617
          Trace Adkins.         

377
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,552
He came to the truck.           
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.             

378
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,955
      House-made pimento cheese,
        local cheddar, macaroni.

379
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:14,425
He reads the menu and makes it  
sound like a country song.      

380
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,294
     Doesn't get any better     
           than that.           

381
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,897
          Look at this.         
       Three small boxes.       

382
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,167
           Well done.           
       Oh, that is money.       

383
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,767
We heard you didn't have        
   a butter wheel.              

384
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,169
                  CRYSTAL:      
    We felt like you needed one.

385
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,771
  We're having, like, a little  
     mini Christmas in July.    

386
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,907
                    Yeah,       
         it's a cast-iron press.

387
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,243
       Someone gets to put      
       that together now.       

388
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:33,177
        Thank you, guys.        

389
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,312
       What are we making?      

390
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,247
              Our Cubano melt.  

391
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,316
       You're going to be making
              the mojo mustard  

392
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,984
       and the chili honey glaze

393
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,453
           that's going to glaze
              our pulled pork.  

394
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,322
         Walk me through        
      how the pork's made.      

395
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:48,592
        We brine it for 12 hours
    in orange juice, lime juice,

396
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,930
  Tennessee whiskey, and spices,
               herbs, garlic.   

397
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:54,198
            And then we roast it
                 five hours.    

398
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,601
         Sorry, I've got        
 the two mental giants over here

399
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:58,670
        that are working        
     on the sandwich press.     

400
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,271
    You actually                
won't even need that.           

401
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,739
               Yeah, you won't  
             actually need that 

402
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,875
      'cause you have that press
              that we sent you. 

403
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:06,678
            That's the Camaro of
     the grilled cheese presses.

404
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,213
       That's the Camaro.       
         That's the '68.        

405
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,815
        Let's talk about        
         the chili glaze        

406
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:11,883
  that's going on top of this.  

407
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,618
               That's toasted   
               Chile de Arbol.  

408
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,486
              Very, very spicy. 
               Take the honey,  

409
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,755
     and you're going to squeeze
        a couple limes in there.

410
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:19,023
      Bring that up to a simmer,

411
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,826
    and then toss all that glaze
                in the pork.    

412
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:22,960
         Into the oven?         

413
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,362
              Yeah, brick oven. 

414
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,430
 Alright, so while that's going,
         anything else?         

415
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,032
                 Let's make     
              the mojo mustard. 

416
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,568
        I sent you herby mustard
                already made    

417
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,369
                  and then      
            mojo pork reduction.

418
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,172
                 So that is     
             the braising liquid

419
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:37,441
                from the pork   
             that's been cooked.

420
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,110
            Alright.            
  How do we build the sandwich? 

421
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:40,378
                So that bread   
               you have there,  

422
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,514
   that's made here on Music Row
            by Bobby John Henry.

423
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,917
Bobby John Henry.               
              He's making that  
               special for us.  

424
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,453
     He's putting lard in there.
         So it really stands up.

425
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,188
   Alright, any special story   
        about the cheese?       

426
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,324
       Jimmy Jack Johnson,      
     did he make the cheese?    

427
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:55,526
 Jack didn't do it.             

428
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,795
        So we hit the --        
    on the outside or inside?   

429
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,596
            -Outside.           
   -The outside of the bread.   

430
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,532
       -The other outside.      
          -I asked you.         

431
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,668
             The other outside. 
The other outside.              

432
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,136
      The slices of cheese down.

433
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:07,471
   Everything goes              
in between the cheese.          

434
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,941
  We've got delicious rosemary  
           shaved ham.          

435
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,475
             And then mojo pork.

436
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,145
         I would do mojo mustard
       on top of the pulled pork

437
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:15,813
              so it can, like,  
                  soak in.      

438
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,148
               Pickles on top.  

439
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,750
        And then you're going to
        top it with that cheese.

440
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,951
You got to cut them in half,    

441
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,888
because that way, the cheese,   
it just melts faster.           

442
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,356
 Grill at about 450.            

443
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,557
      Get the shot on this,     
             Ryder.             

444
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,158
Wait, are you making            
 all three at -- No.            

445
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,560
      Does it have on lock,     

446
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:32,297
or do I just stand here and make
   Jules hold it for an hour?   

447
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,431
Well, usually we're not         
  making that many              

448
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,566
on the single like that.        

449
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,101
         We're untrained        
         professionals.         

450
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,437
That should take about          
between two and three minutes.  

451
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,372
     But since we put three     
    monster sandwiches on it,   

452
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:42,974
     do we have enough time     
      to go to commercial?      

453
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,242
                    Yeah.       

454
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:45,977
     Of course we have time     
      to go to commercial.      

455
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,645
  We got another fantastic chef 
            coming up           

456
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:48,846
       after we try these.      

457
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,247
       "Triple D Takeout."      
      See you in a minute.      

458
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,582
          -Don't leave.         
            -I'm not.           

459
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:52,917
I'm just watching the grilled   
cheese. You guys clean up.      

460
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,657
          Welcome back.         
       "Triple D Takeout."      

461
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,727
        I've got Hunter,        
    Ryder running the camera,   

462
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:05,129
   and we have a special cameo  
      from my nephew Jules.     

463
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:08,665
       We've had great pie      
from Audrey Jane's Pizza Garage,

464
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,936
   fantastic grilled pork from  
  Dimitri over at Niko Niko's,  

465
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:14,071
         and our friends        
   at the grilled cheese truck  

466
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,541
 have just delivered Cuban pork 
    with this wonderful bread   

467
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,143
          made by who?          
 What was the guy's name again? 

468
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,679
Bobby John Henry.               
     Bobby John Henry bread,    

469
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,681
     because everybody knows    
         they love that.        

470
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,250
     -Oh, wow. Look at that.    
           -Oh, yeah.           

471
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,353
What are we thinking?           

472
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,756
      The bread's dynamite      
         and the press?         

473
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:34,425
 You get a ton of heat into it, 
     a ton of cheese in it.     

474
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:37,494
     Saltiness of that ham,     
 love the rosemary crust on it, 

475
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,929
  and the richness of the pork  

476
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,032
      with this sweet heat      
      from the chili honey.     

477
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:43,034
      You guys just hit it      
   out of the park every time.  

478
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:44,502
        So fantastic job.       

479
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,972
     But not to be outdone,     
  this guy is a one of a kind.  

480
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:51,241
   Here in Memphis, Tennessee.  
It's a place called Uncle Lou's.

481
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,310
     And he's doing chicken,    
    one of my favorite ways,    

482
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,279
        fried and dipped.       

483
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,980
      Wow, man.                 

484
00:16:56,982 --> 00:17:00,717
If you live within 300 miles    
   of this joint,               

485
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,453
you should be getting           
 yourself over here.            

486
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,855
   Well, Lou, I got to tell you,
         I appreciate everything

487
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,791
            about that fantastic
             chicken experience.

488
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:09,727
         And I'm more happy that
   we just kept out of the brief

489
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,328
   bit of footage of me falling.

490
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,863
 Oh, wait, you fell?            
 I thought Lou fell.            

491
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,067
               Oh, I fell bad.  

492
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,269
           Oh, don't run it now.

493
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,741
          Anybody see that fall?
          [ Laughter ]          

494
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:26,410
           I think I just bought
              the chicken farm. 

495
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,946
 I was gonna ask you if you had 
 slip-resistant shoes on today. 

496
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:31,215
           Slip-resistant shoes?
  No, I got flip-flops on today.

497
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,349
                It's getting    
              that kind of hot. 

498
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,751
Lou, what did you send us?      

499
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,419
          You remember?         
                   What is this?

500
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,555
       That is not<i> a</i> pot.       
        That is<i> the</i> pot.        

501
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:41,359
  That is the day we went from  
     no longer honey-dipped,    

502
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,894
       sweet, spicy love.       

503
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,896
          Like a barbecue sauce.

504
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,832
    No, more like               
a Buffalo wing sauce.           

505
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,834
                 That's like    
              sweet spicy love. 

506
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:52,970
     Note that.                 
    Name change.                

507
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:55,373
    What, did you mail everybody
              Sweet Spicy Love? 

508
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,841
          -Oh, my gosh.         
         -Representing.         

509
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:59,643
  Oh, yeah, I'm already working 
     on my Spicy Love pizza.    

510
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,378
             Love you, brother. 
               That's awesome.  

511
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,247
        Okay, so how do you want
               to start this?   

512
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,582
    Let's go with the vinegar   
           in the pot.          

513
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,584
          Get it warm.          
               Red wine vinegar.

514
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,718
      Those two containers,     

515
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,987
    that's the correct amount   
         of corruption.         

516
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:11,255
  GUY: It's called              
   the corruption?              

517
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,591
          Once you've tasted it,
          you've been corrupted.

518
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,860
     GUY: So we're going to make
     some corruption right here.

519
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,728

             granulated garlic,

 celery salt, some chili powder,
             and hickory smoke.

00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:22,733
            The corruption's in.

      Honey and hot sauce,      
       and it's over with.

     hanging out with you today?

           These are a couple of
  my daughters and my grandkids.

525
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,275
      What a proud grandpa, man.

              I am.             
            Trust me.

           walk me through this.

         The seasonings         
      that you have there,

00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,715
          got to add it         
          to the flour.         

530
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,218
     The salt, onion powder,    
         garlic powder.         

531
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,552
          And you know          
      what that secret is.      

532
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:42,887
      You told me yourself.

534
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,490
You're right. It was that little
          kiss of that cinnamon.

535
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:47,691
           That's from          
      my great-grandmother.     

536
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,227
           We're going to dredge
       the chicken in the flour,

537
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:51,762
                go to the fryer?
           That's it.           
          Five minutes.         

538
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,630
        And I can do the pickles
             with this, correct?

539
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,700
            Correct.            
Oh, you're frying               
those pickles?

 You dump them right in the oil 
  when your chicken comes out.
