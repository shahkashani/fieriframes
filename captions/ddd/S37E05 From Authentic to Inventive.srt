00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,614
White wine, soy sauce,          
    lemon juice,                

234
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,549
shallots, green onion,          

235
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,483
a little bit of ginger,         
       garlic,                  

236
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,619
    "galapeños."                

237
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,153
                 "Galapeños."   
"Galapeños."                    

238
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,622
             Listen, these guys 
              listen to Phish,  

239
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,023
              they can call it  
             whatever they want.

240
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,090
   And some lime.               

241
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,560
         That's a pretty big mix
                 there, pal.    

242
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:50,428
We throw the marinade           
 on the pork belly.             

243
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,829
       That is a power marinade.

244
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,698
    And we hit it               
 with orange juice.             

245
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,100
            And how long is this
               gonna marinate?  

246
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,635
   Could be a day.              
 Could be two days.             

247
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,770
We're gonna cover this          
with some plastic wrap and foil.

248
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,037
Stick it in the oven,           
     five hours.                

249
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,973
      Then we're gonna braise it
          in this actual liquid.

250
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,441
Yes, sir.                       
                Bring it out.   
                Let it cool.    

251
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,976
               Let it congeal.  
 Yes, sir.                      

252
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:07,011
                  Alright.      
   Let's talk about basil creme.

253
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,581
         This is getting weirder
                  as we go.     

254
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,982
     We came up                 
 with these recipes,            

255
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,117
    then we lost                
our recipe book twice.          

256
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,921
So we had to completely         
 rewrite the recipe.            

257
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:17,388
                  Time-out.     
          The whole recipe book.

258
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,790
    I'm not sure                
if somebody stole it,           

259
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,192
if it got dumped in the laundry 
 or the trash twice.            

260
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,394
                 Seriously?     

261
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,995
So first we got our basil,      

262
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,997
  throw our milk in             
   and some salt.               

263
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,666
   Get that going.              
     Strain it.                 

264
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,668
Pour some heavy cream           
     over that.                 

265
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,802
  Mash that basil.              

266
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,737
   And we'll take               
our whipped cream gun,          

267
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,738
give it a little shake.         

268
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,941
    And we've got               
   our basil whip.              

269
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:37,609
         A savory whipped cream.

270
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:38,943
                 Delicious.     
                 Good basil     

271
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,879
          and a nice little move
                on the salt.    

272
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:43,949
      You guys are really crazy.

273
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,416
             Pork belly's done. 
                  Gorgeous.     

274
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,085
Next, we slice it up,           

275
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,686
   and that'll be               
our pork belly pieces.          

276
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,154
          What's the final step?

277
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,222
  We're gonna make              
the spicy honey butter.         

278
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:52,557
             Show me the magic. 

279
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,692
 So we're gonna take            
     our honey,                 

280
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:55,293
dump all that butter            
      in there.                 

281
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,895
           And a little cayenne.
                    Whoa!       

282
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,162
Little bit of cayenne.          

283
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,298
  Heat up the honey             
until it's all melted together. 

284
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,301
       Drizzle on the pork belly
   and finish in the pizza oven.

285
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:04,836
     Yes, chef.                 
                        Got it. 

286
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:06,370
Alright. So we're gonna take    
our mashed potatoes,            

287
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,907
make three little piles,        
sautéed spinach, pork belly.    

288
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,910
            That's a lot of pork
       for a little bit of mash.

289
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,044
 Spicy honey butter.            

290
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,979
 That's just to glue            
 our wonton chip on.            

291
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,381
   And we'll take               
   our basil whip.              

292
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,983
      This is a lot more refined
           than I was expecting.

293
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,386
 That's our Guyute.             
       Booyah.                  

294
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:25,256
                     ♪♪         

295
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:28,392
       Every bite I'm getting is
         a little bit different.

296
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:32,731
      The pork belly's dynamite,
     it's tender, it's unctuous.

297
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,532
             The mashed potatoes
                 are creamy.    

298
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:37,402
         I love the honey butter
  with a little bit of the heat,

299
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:41,272
               but the wonton   
   with the basil whipped cream,

300
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,474
                 that's not     
           what I was expecting.

301
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,809
                    It is       
           definitely delicious.

302
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,880
Alright. We've got a Guyute     
   in the window.               

303
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:52,350
  Pork belly tastes like a big  
 chunk of bacon. It's delicious.

304
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:55,286
    These little chips on top   
    with basil whipped cream,   

305
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,088
   I like to save till the end  
          as a dessert.         

306
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,089
 They knock it out of the park. 

307
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,759
         -All day long.         
         -All day long.         

308
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,093
             MAN #2:            
     The unique environment     

309
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,761
     and the different take     
      on the food, I think,     

310
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,163
     is what brings me back     
           every time.          

311
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,232
    I got Tequila               
Sunfryz in the window.          

312
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,234
          Now, what else you do?
  Because, I mean, I'm expecting

313
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,836
   to get something really funky
           and wicked and weird.

314
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,438
  You know, we are,             
   We're Guyutes.               

315
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
              You know we are.  

316
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,841
And the Disco Biscuit.          

317
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,778
   The Disco Biscuit captures   
         the true taste         

318
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,378
     of what it means to be     
          in the south.         

319
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,580
    It's candy in your mouth.   

320
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,249
         We'll see you in a bit.
              You know we are.  

321
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,918
                What is this,   
            a prison fork, dude?

322
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,787
     Absolutely.                
                      That is...

323
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,388
         I mean, you know, whoo.

324
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,523
   Only the best.               

325
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,525
          Only the best for you.

326
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,328
                Welcome back.   
   Hanging out at Guy Fieri's --

327
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,731
             Oh, no, I'm sorry. 
               Guyutes in OKC.  

328
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:40,865
                See, I almost   
                got it right.   

329
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,867
                We have part    
             of the "Guy" right.

330
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,069
             So these two dudes 
           named this restaurant

331
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,404
     after one of their favorite
                Phish songs,    

332
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,473
               Phish the band.  

333
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,408
          They have put together
             a funky jam joint. 

334
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,277
FRIEDEL: Plating our            
  catfish wontons.              

335
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,813
It's very open and eclectic,    
has food for any flair.         

336
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,081
      Roll the dice and see     
      what you have today.      

337
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,149
      You're gonna be happy     
       every single time.       

338
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,485
You got the Disco Biscuit       
   in the window.               

339
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,820
    The Disco Biscuit's fried   
  chicken on a cheddar biscuit  

340
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,422
with honey glaze and everything.

341
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,290
         It's absolutely        
       out of this world.       

342
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,825
                  Alright,      
          what are we into next?

343
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,161
We're gonna make our Disco      
marinade for our Disco Biscuit. 

344
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,363
      First up                  
is our "galapeños" again.       

345
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,965
    They have their own language
                 evidentally    

346
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,032
            and their own style.

347
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,033
                 Got to have    
              culinary goggles. 

348
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,035
 Absolutely.                    
                  Okay, next up?

349
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,369
We've got our buttermilk.       

350
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,772
So we'll throw our salt in      
     and pepper.                

351
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:21,973
   Blend that up.               

352
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,441
So next, we're going            
to take our chicken,            

353
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,176
      cut them                  
right down the middle.          

354
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:29,046
Throw those into our bag,       
pound these bad boys out.       

355
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,982
            So we're gonna brine
             this chicken breast

356
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,717
             in the buttermilk. 
    How long will this marinate?

357
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:33,785
  At least one day.             

358
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,186
       What are we dredging them
                 in to fry?     

359
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:38,456
Disco flour, of course.         
                    Disco flour.

360
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,592
It's basically just flour,      
    salt, pepper,               

361
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:41,592
 paprika and garlic.            

362
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,994
   Then fry it up               
until it's golden brown.        

363
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,129
               Alright, Chef.   

364
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,464
So we're gonna make our         
  cheddar biscuits.             

365
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,532
                   Let's see it.
 Flour, butter,                 

366
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:48,867
and then we're gonna mix        
       that up                  

367
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:50,535
    until it gets               
a little bit grainy.            

368
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:51,735
        Do you take into account

369
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,738
          how much may be thrown
              out of the bowl?  

370
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,474
      Is that part of the recipe
            development process?

371
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,943
It was on recipe number two,    
 but then on three,             

372
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,011
we didn't do it so...           

373
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,013
          Well, because we don't
                remember one.   

374
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,414
        Two is a distant memory.

375
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,884
             Three, we're pretty
                hard core on.   
Absolutely, Chef.               

376
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:09,687
Got salt, baking powder,        
sugar, little brown sugar,      

377
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,489
some cheddar cheese,            
    regular milk,               

378
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,690
     buttermilk.                

379
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,159
              Hang on a second. 
                Let me check.   

380
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,560
   Let's see if there's anything
             else in the kitchen

381
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:16,561
              we didn't put in. 

382
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,363
We got some heavy cream.        
                Oh, heavy cream.

383
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,697
     That's what else we needed.

384
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,633
    I'm really surprised there's
   no beer in that or something.

385
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,301
  Maybe next time.              
           Yeah, think about it.

386
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,635
                  Put that      
           in the menu revision.

387
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,571
           Mix this up how long?
Three to five minutes.          

388
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,305
 And then it's ready            
  to make biscuits.             

389
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,707
           Portion it in a ball,
                then drop it    

390
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:30,975
               in a greased-up  
                 muffin pan.    

391
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,443
   Then I'm gonna               
stick them in the oven          

392
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:35,780
at 350 for 45 minutes.          

393
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,181
We're gonna take a little bit   
   of honey butter              

394
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,317
and we're gonna make a          
nice little design on the plate.

395
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,318
Put our biscuit down,           

396
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,253
a little bit more honey butter  
      on there.                 

397
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,722
           Wow. It's a big piece
  of chicken. More honey butter.

398
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:46,257
     Absolutely.                
 Drench that thing.             

399
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,325
   To top it off,               

400
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,927
  just a little bit             
   of green onion.              

401
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,863
  That's it, Chef.              

402
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,131
      There's more fried chicken
                    there       

403
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,199
                than there is   
               anything else.   

404
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,401
            The chicken eclipsed
                the biscuit.    

405
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,470
                Great crunch,   
               not super spicy  

406
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:02,006
        but you get a little bit
             of the "jalopano," 

407
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,140
                a little bit    
             of the buttermilk. 

408
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,141
                Look at that.   

409
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,810
               Just soaking up  
             that honey butter. 

410
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:08,346
                Little sweet,   
             a lot of silkiness 

411
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,548
              from the butter,  
       delicious biscuit, light.

412
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,353
          It's rich. It's tangy.
                 Well done.     

413
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,620
                   SERVER:      
      Here's your Disco Biscuit.

414
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,222
            WOMAN #2:           
  The chicken is really juicy.  

415
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,691
       And then the glaze       
    just kind of sets it off.   

416
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,027
    And the cheddar biscuits    
          are amazing.          

417
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,163
        It just all comes       
      together flawlessly.      

418
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,231
 Dragon sauce going,            

419
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,032
      finishing                 
the Franklins Tower.            

420
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,167
     Anybody I meet out of town,
         this is the first place

421
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,369
         I tell them to come to.

422
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,436
Really?                         
                 Absolutely.    

423
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,905
Out of all the joints?          
                 All the joints.

424
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:34,906
        You can't top it.       

425
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,040
                   FIERI:       
           You're just two dudes

426
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,375
            doing the restaurant
          the way you like to go

427
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,709
         and enjoy a restaurant.
            But it's your style.

428
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,045
          It's your way and just
           as funky as Phish is.

429
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,447
              I think the band  
              should be proud.  

430
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:43,648
             Well done, brother.
Thank you, Chef.                

431
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,616
                  This guy.     

432
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,520
        FIERI: Coming up,       
 a true Philly sandwich spot... 

433
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:50,721
    That's legit.               

434
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,056
 ...buzzing up their brisket... 

435
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,590
   It doesn't get               
much more scratch made          

436
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,326
and handmade than that          
right there, brother.           

437
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:57,729
  ...and putting their own spin 
          on a classic.         

438
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,097
It takes cheesesteak            
  to another level.             

439
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:04,635
                     ♪♪         

440
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,504
   I don't think that there is  
      a city in the country     

441
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:08,706
      or city in the world      

442
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,375
         that has a more        
   connected, iconic food type  

443
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,244
        than cheesesteaks       
        in Philadelphia.        

444
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,712
         And every time         
     somebody's coming here     

445
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,113
  or I'm showing up in Philly,  

446
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,116
      people say, "Where's      
   your favorite cheesesteak?"  

447
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,184
     That's like me saying,     
   "Who's your favorite kid?"   

448
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:23,054
 I mean, there's so many amazing
   places with so much history  

449
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:25,990
  and their own style that when 
 I hear about a joint in Philly 

450
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,125
    that's doing cheesesteaks   

451
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,993
     with their own new spin    
          and attitude,         

452
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:29,994
 you know I got to check it out.

453
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:33,598
This is Woodrow's Sandwich Shop.

454
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,199
           Walking in,          
    I need a shrimp po' boy.    

455
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,667
       This sandwich place      
       does its own thing.      

456
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,269
    It follows its own rules.   

457
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,804
        Woodrow's pork up       
          for order 12.         

458
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,605
                 You're here    
          for Kevin's creations.

459
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,207
   I get whatever he tells me   
             to get.            

460
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,343
   FIERI: And all that giving   
        and taking orders       

461
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:48,413
  isn't something new for chef  
     and owner Kevin Kramer.    

462
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,081
So you served our country.      
Thank you, by the way.          

463
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,949
I really appreciate that.       
You were in the Navy.           

464
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,751
       Yes, I got in and I said,
                  you know,     

465
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,353
      "I just want to be a cook.
       That's all I want to do."

466
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:56,754
People want to fly planes.      

467
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,556
 People want to run             
   the artillery.               

468
00:15:58,558 --> 00:15:59,957
And you want to come in         
and you want to cook.           

469
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,492
                    Yeah.       
        Okay.                   

470
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,294
  MAN #3: Kevin comes up with a 
 lot of cool, different dishes. 

471
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,829
      The cheesesteaks here     
          are my go-to.         

472
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,430
                Two whiz wits   
               in the window.   

473
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:09,299
  The Woodrow's whiz wit is the 
   best cheesesteak in Philly.  

474
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,370
    Does a truffle whiz along   
 with the cherry pepper relish. 

475
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,772
   It's that little bit of extra
             that kind of brings

476
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,707
              it really modern  
              and really fresh. 

477
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,175
   FIERI: Now, I'm              
a cheesesteak junkie.           

478
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,044
 Anybody that knows             
the hunch on "Triple D"         

479
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,512
 knows that it came             
    from Philly,                

480
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:22,913
     from eating                
  the cheesesteak.              

481
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,115
 You're elevating it            
    a little bit.               

482
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:26,650
           We're gonna be making
         the Woodrow's whiz wit.

483
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,252
     Start with our heavy cream.

484
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,321
You're making your own          
whiz versus a lot of people     

485
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,922
that buy it out of the can.     
                   That's right.

486
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,924
               Yellow cheddar,  
              sliced American.  

487
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,794
       This is another American.
                It's Cooper.    

488
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,663
                You're trying   
     to get that nice meltiness.

489
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,598
That's a Philly term --         
     meltiness.                 

490
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,134
               Aged provolone,  
   sliced truffle, salt, pepper.

491
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,869
 Let that melt down.            
   What's up next?              

492
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,671
             Cherry pepper mayo.
 Alright, let's go.             

493
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,074
                Mayo, garlic,   
               cherry peppers,  

494
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,610
       pickles, salt and pepper.
               Blend this up.   

495
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,345
  Finally we build              
    the sandwich?               
                        Yep.    

496
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,947
                We start with   
            our beef fat, steak,

497
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,683
       onions, a little salt and
      pepper, granulated garlic.

498
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,420
 It comes this way.             
             This way or no way.

499
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:03,888
  Pretty hard core.             

500
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,423
             Cherry pepper mayo.

501
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:07,825
              The truffle whiz, 
              meat in the roll. 

502
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:10,294
               One more swipe   
      with the the truffle whiz.

503
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:11,763
That's all she wrote.           
                 That's it.     

504
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:13,231
     Got to get                 
  that hunch right.             

505
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:17,968
                     ♪♪         

506
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,904
Oh, are you waiting for me      
to tell you about this?         

507
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:21,773
   Oh, I'm sorry,               
I was just in the moment        

508
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,908
     of enjoying                
this delicious sandwich.        

509
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,713
  Onions are great.             
The meat's not overcooked.      

510
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,581
The cherry pepper mayo          
       brush,                   

511
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:34,052
that little bit of acidity      
is really key and essential.    

512
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:37,855
      And when                  
 we get to the whiz,            

513
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,389
it takes cheesesteak            
  to another level.             

514
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,524
     Delicious.                 

515
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,393
 I'll take 10 to go.            
     Thank you.                 

516
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,660
       Woodrow's whiz wit.      

517
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,197
             This truffle whiz, 
        I could basically drink.

518
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,999
If there was a truffle          
whiz trough, you'd be at it.    

519
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,067
               Yeah, I would.   

520
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,736
          And the bread         
      is always super soft.     

521
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,137
          It's amazing.         

522
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,273
     My buddy Jay here wrote for
     "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives"

523
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,275
             for nine centuries.

524
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,544
    You know great cheesesteaks,
          living here in Philly.

525
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:00,678
           So give me the hunch.

526
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,479
                 Let me see     
           your best impression.

527
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,214
I've seen you do this           
    many a time.                

528
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,417
         Little neck roll there.

529
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,486
                There you go.   
                 Well done.     

530
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:09,754
    Got to go in                
 for a second bite.             

531
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,155
              You got to go in  
             for a second bite. 

532
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,690
   You cram it all in your face.
                  He knows.     

533
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,559
     Spiced pork going down     
           for Cubano.          

534
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,360
             MAN #3:            
   The food is delicious here.  

535
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,562
    There's always something    
    new and different to try.   

536
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,031
  The coffee brisket sandwich,  
   it doesn't get much better.  

537
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,567
    Coffee, barbecue brisket.   

538
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:23,835
        Brisket -- good,        

539
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:26,704
      crispy oniony-potatoy     
        thingies -- good.       

540
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:27,772
       What's not to like?      

541
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:28,773
Now what are we gonna do?       

542
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,441
             Our coffee barbecue
              brisket sandwich. 

543
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,977
Got it.                         
           We're just gonna save
              some of this fat. 

544
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,045
  This is a secret. I don't like
            telling people this.

545
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,581
Okay, well, let's just keep it  
 between you and me.            

546
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,982
Nobody will know.               
            Nobody's gonna know.

547
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,517
You're not gonna render         
      this down                 

548
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,385
   and cook fries               
   in it, are you?              
                      Not fries.

549
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:45,523
           But we do cook onions
  that we use for this sandwich.

550
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:46,857
Now we'll dry-rub it.           

551
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,327
             Salt, black pepper,
             granulated garlic, 

552
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,463
                chili powder,   
    smoked paprika, brown sugar.

553
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,199
               We're gonna rub  
           the brisket with oil,

554
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,334
               put the rub on   
             and then more oil. 

555
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,670
How are we gonna cook it?       
                Char the outside

556
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:00,938
          and then it's gonna go
                in the oven.    

557
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,939
               200 overnight.   

558
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,007
 Where's your coffee            
     coming in?                 

559
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,276
        With the barbecue sauce.
   Let's see it.                

560
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:06,810
                Butter here.    
                  Shallots,     

561
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,013
            some garlic, coffee,
           basic barbecue sauce.

562
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,282
   You can use whatever you got.

563
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,950
Turned into a cooking show      
      just now                  

564
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,685
     telling us                 
how we can do it at home.       

565
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,822
             Salt, black pepper,
                  bay leaf.     

566
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:18,756
  How long is this              
 gonna simmer, Chef?            

567
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:19,957
                It's gonna go   
             for about an hour. 

568
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,626
Pull out the bay leaf,          
run it through the blender.     

569
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,294
       Get rid of all the chunks
       of garlic and everything.

570
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:25,363
       Chunks.                  
Get rid of the chunks.          

571
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:26,764
What do we have left?           

572
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,298
              We're just going  
           to make the sandwich.

573
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,100
Okay, that's the part           
     I came for.                

574
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,435
      Brisket's out of the oven.

575
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:32,970
        We just slice this down,

576
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:35,373
  put some coffee barbecue sauce
                  in here,      

577
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,309
     toasted brioche bread here,
               yellow cheddar.  

578
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,244
            So with the brisket,
            we almost burn this.

579
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,246
Right, because somebody         
wants to clean that pan.        

580
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,848
             Yes. Onions cooked 
              in the beef fat.  

581
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,383
       The new shoestring fries.

582
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,186
         We're gonna top it off.
                 That's it.     

583
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,654
   It doesn't get               
much more scratch made,         

584
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,689
 handmade than that             
right there, brother.           

585
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,792
 Do I have anything             
     on my face?                

586
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,260
            No, no, you're good.

587
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:57,194
    No? I'm good?               
                      Yeah.     

588
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,862
 Want to go out?                
                 Yeah, let's go.

589
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,799
The brisket is super,           
    super tender,               

590
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,800
really absorbs that sauce.      

591
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,204
Coffee kind of imparts          

592
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,205
    a little bit                
of that smokiness to it.        

593
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,308
And the onions cooked           
 in the beef tallow,            

594
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,077
    that's legit.               
                      Thank you.

595
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,079
             I have             
   a coffee barbecue brisket.   

596
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,280
            WOMAN #3:           
     You get the sweetness,     

597
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:17,682
     you get the bitterness     
        from the coffee,        

598
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,617
 and then you have the delicious
   saltiness from the onions.   

599
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,687
      It just, like, melts      
         in your mouth.         

600
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,021
The house-roasted turkey.       

601
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,957
 It's just good food and that's 
    what brings people here.    

602
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,558
        I would come here       
      every day if I could.     

603
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,694
FIERI: You're making each one   
 of your sandwiches             

604
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:31,795
the way it should be made       
and you're putting a lot        

605
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,297
of your culinary discipline     
      into it.                  

606
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,500
  Congratulations.              
                      Thank you.

607
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:38,903
  So was this a great road trip 
            or what?            

608
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,238
      But don't you worry.      

609
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,040
    I got plenty more joints    
 to find all over this country. 

610
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:45,442
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

611
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,445
 on "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

612
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:48,846
                Break it down   
                in Guy style.   

613
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:49,913
              What do you think 
              of the sandwich?  

614
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,116
 The shaved rib eye             
      is great.                 

615
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:54,252
              It's a lot harder 
               than it looks.   

616
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:55,720
  It's easier to be             
behind the camera, guys.        

617
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:58,656
    I'm having a blast with this
                 right now.
