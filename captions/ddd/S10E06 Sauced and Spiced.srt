 FOR A LONG TIME.               

195
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,841
           IT GIVES IT          
       A MORE RICH FLAVOR.      

196

GOAT IS LEANER,                 

213
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,614

         SOME ARE MORE MOIST.   

227
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,912

         KABOB HALABI.          

473
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,823
 <i> TO A WHOLE RANGE OF FANS...</i>   
                            MMM.

474
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:17,762
<i>INCLUDING COUNTRY MUSIC LEGENDS</i> 
      <i> THE OAKRIDGE BOYS.</i>       
                   THIS IS NUTS.

475
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,096
 THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE LIKE THIS 
          AROUND HERE.          

476
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:22,166
 <i> AND NOTHING ELSE AROUND HERE</i>  
        <i> LIKE THIS ONE.</i>         
         FILET MIGNON.          

477
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,835
      FILET MIGNON KABOBS.      
           <i> COOKED ON</i>           
    <i> A HIMALAYAN SALT BLOCK.</i>    

478
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,971
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WORKS OUT,
    BUT IT WORKS OUT FOR ME.    

479
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,441
     COOKING WITH A SALT BLOCK--
          IS IT TRADITIONAL?    
VERY TRADITIONAL.               

480
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,442
THE MEAT WILL SUCK              
JUST ENOUGH SALT,               

481
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,445
AND WHEN YOU TASTE IT TODAY,    
         YOU'LL SEE.            

482
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:35,846
              YOU'RE GONNA CARVE
                 FILET MIGNON.  

483
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:38,582
  ALL THE SKIN'S TAKEN OFF THIS,
           ALL THE FAT.         
YEAH.                           

484
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:41,318
CUT THE FILET MIGNON            
  INTO MEDALLIONS.              
    SO YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU COOK
     A LITTLE BIT ON THIS SIDE, 

485
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,653
     A LITTLE BIT ON THAT SIDE, 

486
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,988
           YOU'RE GONNA COME OUT
               MEDIUM RARE.     

487
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,723
          MEAT'S DONE. NOW WHAT?
NOW WE'RE GONNA PREPARE         
    THE MARINADE--              

488
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,059
 BLACK PEPPER, THE GARLIC,      
NOW HERE'S CHOPPED PARSLEY,     

489
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,594
LEMON JUICE...                  
                           OKAY.

490
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:53,397
      OLIVE OIL,                
APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.            
   THE ONLY THING I DON'T NOTICE
            IS THE SALT,        

491
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,332
               BUT WE'RE COOKING
                    ON SALT.    
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

492
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:56,667
PUT OUR MEAT IN IT.             

493
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,003
       AND BECAUSE THIS IS FILET
        AND IT'S VERY TENDER... 
YEAH.                           

494
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:02,472
               THE MARINADE GOES
                  VERY QUICK.   
NOT MORE THAN TEN MINUTES.      

495
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,674
THEN WE SKEWER IT.              

496
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,943
      PUT IT HERE,              
GET IT READY TO COOK IT.        

497
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:08,078
     NOW WHAT ARE WE GONNA MAKE?
NOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE            
   THE DRESSING.                

498
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,082
 THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE MARINADE
        THAT WE JUST MADE.      
SIMILAR TO IT.                  

499
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:12,683
WE'RE GONNA START AGAIN         
  WITH BLACK PEPPER,            

500
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:15,219
 GARLIC SMASHED,                
ITALIAN PARSLEY...              
        LITTLE SALT ADDED TO IT.

501
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,887
LEMON JUICE.                    
             YOU WANT ME TO GRAB
                A LITTLE OIL?   

502
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,423
WE'RE GONNA PUT SOME OIL.       
                   IS THAT GOOD?

503
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,757
YEAH.                           
                           OKAY.

504
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,494
NOW WE'RE GONNA WHISK IT,       
AND WE SET IT ASIDE NOW.        
                      EXCELLENT.

505
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,163
              PUT THE SALT BLOCK
                 ON THE GRILL.  
SO WHAT TEMPERATURE DO YOU      
 THINK WE HAVE THIS HERE?       

506
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,765
WHOA. THAT'S SMOKIN'.           
    NOW I'LL GIVE THE VEGETABLES
   AT LEAST A MINUTE HEAD START.

507
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,701
  FLIP THESE?                   
WOW, THAT'S HOT.                
                           YEAH.

508
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:31,969
SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE SMART       
       USE TONGS.               

509
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:36,040
         NOW WE'RE GONNA PUT    
    THE FILET MIGNON SKEWERS ON.
LOOK AT THAT.                   

510
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:36,841
THAT'S COOL.                    

511
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,843
       I'M, LIKE,               
IN STICK MANAGEMENT HERE.       

512
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,111
(speaking indistinctly)         
            ONE TO TWO MINUTES  
              ON EACH SIDE.     

513
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:44,848
  SO IT DOESN'T PUT             
A LOT OF COLOR ON IT.           
              IT WON'T LOOK LIKE
               IF IT'S GRILLED. 

514
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,918
I LOVE IT.                      
           LOOKS LIKE IT'S DONE.
                 THAT'S IT.     

515
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,855
      HERE IS OUR... DRESS,     
 SAME THING FOR THE VEGETABLES. 

516
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,325
           YOU SHOULD SMELL THIS
             RIGHT NOW. CRAZY.  

517
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,127
A LITTLE BIT MORE               
 ITALIAN PARSLEY                

518
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,928
 AND WE'LL COVER IT             
WITH TANDOORI BREAD.            
                TO KEEP IT WARM.

519
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,797
THAT'S RIGHT.                   
            MMM. BOY, TALK ABOUT
                GREAT FLAVOR.

                MEDIUM RARE.    

521
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:07,271
 I GET A LITTLE BIT OF THE SALT,
       BUT IT'S NOT SALTY.      

522
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,473
NO.                             
              THAT'S GREAT. MMM.

523
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,608

               ON TRIPLE "D"    

524
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,744
          THAT WE'VE EVER COOKED
            WITH A SALT BLOCK.  
ALL RIGHT.                      

525
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:17,681

           TENDER STEAK         
 BUT SEASONED WELL, REALLY GOOD.

527
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:23,687

         SOME INCREDIBLE FOOD.  
     MOUSSAKA EXTRA SPICY.
