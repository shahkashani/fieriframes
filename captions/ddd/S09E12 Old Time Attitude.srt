00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,696
              PULLED PORK PLATE!
IT'S JUST REALLY FRESH          
      AND JUICY.                

96
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,897
                  PULLED PORK   
              WITH FRENCH FRIES.
SOME OF THE BEST                
 I'VE EVER HAD.                 

97
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,033
         VERY GOOD SMOKE FLAVOR,
          ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. 

98
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:58,102
  BRUNSWICK STEW                
AND COLLARD GREENS.             
               I LOVE EVERYTHING
                THEY HAVE HERE. 

99
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:00,706
I'VE GOT WINGS DOWN.

              I KNOW IT'S GOOD. 

100
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,841
             I KNOW HARRISON'S  
           WORKING HIS TAIL OFF.
PUTTING THE RIBS ON!            

101
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,976
WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT          
  SMOKERS OUT THERE,            

102
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,512
      ARE YOU RUNNING THEM      
 AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE DAY? 

103
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,514
              I HAVE A BUTT ONE 
              WITH THE BRISKET, 

104
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,516
         THEN I HAVE ANOTHER ONE
           THAT RUNS FOR RIBS.  

105
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,585
SLAB OF RIBS!                   
                     THE RIBS   
                   ARE THE BEST.

106
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:16,455
                   JUST TENDER, 
                  CAN'T BE BEAT.
  SO WE PULL                    
THE SILVER SKIN

108
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,792
 WHICH IS A SPARERIB THAT'S BEEN
     CUT DOWN TO BE UNIFORM.    

109
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,328
 WE'VE GOT OUR RUB THAT WE USED 
     WHEN WE DID THE BUTTS.     

110
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:25,797
NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING?           
            NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD 
          MORE SUGAR TO THE RUB.

111
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,666
REASON BEING?                   
               I LIKE IT TO GET 
             A GOOD CRUST ON IT,

112
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:31,336
           AND THAT--THAT HELPS.
OKAY.                           

113
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,471
     NOW I'M GONNA SPRINKLE 'EM.
           I WON'T RUB 'EM.     
YOU'RE JUST GONNA               
  SPRINKLE 'EM.                 

114
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,607
          A LOT'S JUST TOO MUCH.
THAT'S PROFOUND.                

115
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,810
             ONCE AGAIN--       
      ONCE AGAIN, IT'S OUTDOOR--
REALLY, SOCRATES?               

116
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,812
   "A LOT IS                    
JUST TOO MUCH."                 
                  JUST TOO MUCH.

117
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,481
SO WE'RE GONNA SET 'EM UP       
     FOR 20 MINUTES             

118
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,016
AND GO TO THE SMOKER.           
                     HERE WE GO.

119
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,752
        (Guy) WHAT INTERNAL TEMP
          ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?  
    (Harrison)                  
BETWEEN 165 AND 175             

120
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,754
           THESE ARE GONNA GO ON
            FOUR TO FIVE HOURS? 
EXACTLY.                        

121
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,490
                THESE ARE GONNA 
                BE MONEY, DUDE. 

122

AND GO ONTO THE FAT OF THIS ONE,
   AND THEN I'LL FLIP 'EM ALL.  

124
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,896
EVERYTHING'S BETTER WHEN IT'S   
   COOKED IN ITS OWN FAT.       

125
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,832
      WE'RE JUST KIND OF LETTING
         THAT FAT RENDER DOWN,  

126
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,835

THEN WE'LL COME BACK AND HIT 'EM
      WITH SUGAR AND HONEY.

STEAM THEIR RIBS TOO MUCH,

WE HAVE BAKED CHICKEN           
    ON THE MENU.                

203
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:03,748
MY DAD WANTED TO INCORPORATE    
  LEFTOVERS INTO AN ENTRéE,     

204
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,082
NOT TO WASTE THE FOOD,          

205
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,819
 SO HE STARTED DOING            
CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS.          
              CRAM EVERYBODY IN.

206
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,621
  PUT A LITTLE WATER IN THE PAN 
      TO KIND OF BRAISE IT.     

207
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,722
    I'M GONNA COAT IT           
WITH A LITTLE MARGARINE,

290
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,878
     BELIEVE IT OR NOT.         
NEXT THING WE'RE GONNA ADD--    

291
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,413
  A LITTLE BLACK PEPPER,        
A LITTLE RED PEPPER, SALT.      

292
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,615
AND THEN WASABI POWDER'S        
       NOT ENOUGH.              

293
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,484
   WE'RE GONNA ADD              
A LITTLE HORSERADISH            

294
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,754
TO ALSO GIVE IT ANOTHER BITE.   
WE'RE GONNA WHISK THIS ALL UP.  
               THEN WE'RE GONNA 
               PUT IN TUNA FISH.

295
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,222
                   WHAT THE HECK
                     IS THAT?   
THAT'S HAM BASE.

298
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,697
YES, SIR.                       
        YOU JUST DUMPED IN SOME 
      PREMIUM CHEEKS OF THE PIG.

299
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,700
                             OH.
JULIENNED ONION TO IT--         
WE ADD A LITTLE TURNIPS.        

300
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,836
LET THIS JUST WARM UP           
FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES,          

301
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,838
JUST KIND OF MELT               
EVERYTHING DOWN.                

302
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,640
OKAY, FIRST THING WE'RE GONNA   
 ADD IS THE COLLARD GREENS.     
                 THAT MIGHT LOOK
                   LIKE A LOT,  

303
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,575
        BUT AS SOON AS THAT HITS
          THAT SIMMERING WATER, 

304
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,578
               IT IS GONNA START
                TO SHRINK DOWN. 

305
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,313
              SO THIS WILL GO   
          FOR FIVE, TEN MINUTES,

306
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,916
            AND THEN WE'LL GO IN
              WITH THE TURNIP.  
YEP, TAKES 'EM A LOT LONGER     
   TO ABSORB THE FLAVOR.        

307
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,784
         SO WE STIR THOSE UP.   
       NOW HOW LONG ARE WE GONNA

308
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,720
           LET THESE SIMMER FOR?
HOUR AND A HALF TO TWO HOURS--  
    THE LONGER THEY COOK,       

309
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,722
THE MORE THEY'LL ABSORB         
      THE FLAVOR.               
          THE WASABI POWDER     
     AND HAM BASE--I CAN'T WAIT.

310
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,791

              THOSE LOOK GREAT.

00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,058
WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE           
THE LOBSTER'S LIVER.            

367
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,060
IT HAS THAT TRUE, DEEP,         
 RICH LOBSTER FLAVOR.           
          IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

368
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:24,729
           THEN WE DO THE CLAMS.
ABOUT FIVE MINUTES--            

369
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:27,464
WHEN THE CLAMS ARE OPEN,        
     THEY'RE DONE.              
            KEEP THE SAME BROTH.

370
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,933
 LET 'EM COOL DOWN,             
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA            

371
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,535
SHUCK THE MEAT                  
 OUT OF 'EM.                    
               NOW THE SCALLOPS.
                THEY GET COOKED.

372
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,671
       THEY'RE PULLED OUT, BROTH
      IS LEFT, AND THEN SHRIMP--
LAST, ADD THE SHRIMP.           

373
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,540
   ALL RIGHT, ALL THE SEAFOOD'S 
          BEEN BLANCHED.        

374
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,008
       NEXT WE'RE MAKING A BASE 
       FOR OUR SEAFOOD CHOWDER. 

375
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,544
      START WITH SALT PORK.     
 A TRADITIONAL CHOWDER IN MAINE 

376
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,679
IS--GENERALLY STARTS            
   WITH SALT PORK.              

377
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,615
                         GOT IT.
ONION. NOW WE'RE                
GONNA ADD BUTTER.               

378
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,216
         YOU'RE NOT CARAMELIZING
               THE ONIONS.      
NOT REALLY                      

379
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:48,419
         YOU'RE JUST TURNING 'EM
              TRANSLUCENT.      
JUST GONNA TURN 'EM--YEP.       
      FLOUR'S NEXT.             

380
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,020
                 MAKING A LITTLE
                   BLOND ROUX.  
 JUST A LITTLE BLOND ROUX.      
WE'RE GONNA ADD SOME PAPRIKA    

381
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:53,624
AND WHITE PEPPER.               
     THEN YOU DON'T HAVE BIG,   
  DARK GRANULES OF BLACK PEPPER.

382
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:55,893
                           OKAY.
EXACTLY. THIS IS                
A DICED SEA CLAM.               

383
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:57,895
          THE SMALLER THE BETTER
              SO IT'S TENDER?   
YEP.                            

384
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,298
                  TIGHTEN IT UP.
   AND LAST,                    
SOME CLAM JUICE.                

385
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,567
TAKES ABOUT FOUR MINUTES        
     TO TIGHTEN UP.             
                    TO KIND OF  
                   MAKE A PASTE?

386
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,502
YEP.                            
                NOW IT'S TIME   
             TO PUT IT TOGETHER.

387
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:05,904
 SO THE FIRST THING IS GONNA BE 
        COOKED SCALLOPS.        

388
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,305
 YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY WERE 
  CALLED "SCAWL-LOPS," DID YOU? 

389
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,775
 COOKED SHRIMP. THEN WE'RE      
GONNA ADD OUR CHOWDER BASE.     

390
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,510
SHUCKED CLAMS.                  
    AND WE'RE LEAVING 'EM WHOLE?

391
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,979
LEAVING 'EM WHOLE--             
  OH, ABSOLUTELY.               

392
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,914
THIS IS LOBSTER MEAT.           
         DID I JUST SEE TOMALLEY
               GOING IN IT?     

393
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,917
    ABSOLUTELY.                 
TOMALLEY'S CRITICAL.            
                THIS IS ONIONS  
              AND SALT PORK MIX.

394
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,653
 EXACTLY. TWO MORE INGREDIENTS--
          HALF-AND-HALF         

395
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,922
    AND THE LAST ITEM--         
THIS IS OUR STRAINED BROTH      

396
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,991
 THAT WE COOKED ALL THE SEAFOODS
   IN. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.  

397
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:28,926
                  AND THAT'S IT.
TAKES ABOUT 20 MINUTES,         
 AND IT'S READY TO GO.          

398
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,795
  HOLY CLAMS. WHY DON'T YOU GET 
 A LITTLE BROTH IN THE CHOWDER? 

399
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,865
         THAT'S RIDICULOUS.     
     LOOK AT THE SIZE OF LOBSTER

400
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:37,868
         AND THE SCALLOPS.      
   MMM, THAT IS REALLY DYNAMITE.

401
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,005
       IT IS RICH. IT IS CREAMY.
        THE SEAFOOD IS TENDER.  

402
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,875
         I AM BLOWN AWAY        
 BY HOW MUCH SEAFOOD IS IN HERE.

403
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:46,544
               THAT IS SO KILLER
                WITH NO FILLER. 

404
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,013
       MMM, I SEE WHY YOU WIN.  
    THEY ONLY WAY YOU COULD LOSE

405
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:51,883
IS IF THE OTHER GUY HAD $50 BILL
    CROUTONS FLOATING AROUND.   

406
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:54,885
                SEAFOOD CHOWDER.
      BIG SCALLOPS IN IT,       
      CHUNKS OF LOBSTER--       

407
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,554
     REALLY ONE OF THE BEST     
         I'VE EVER HAD.         
ONE LOBSTER ROLL.               

408
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,623
      I HEARD THE SCHOOL LUNCHES
               IN MAINE,        

409
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,692
             THE KIDS GET TO EAT
              LOBSTER NUGGETS.  

410
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,561
    I THINK YOU HEARD WRONG.    

411
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,896
   <i> BUT THEY MIGHT AS WELL.</i>     
LOBSTER MACARONI                
  AND CHEESE.                   

412
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,733
THIS IS THE EAST COAST OF MAINE.
    THIS IS LOBSTER COUNTRY.    

413
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,901
IT'S DEFINITELY FRESH.          
                   LOBSTER STEW.

414
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:12,937
   LOBSTER STEW IS              
MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE.           
   (Myles) THE LOBSTER CLUB.    

415
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,440
          ANYTHING ELSE YOU LIKE
               ON THE MENU?     
LOBSTER PIE.                    

416
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,375
LOBSTER PIE.                    
                IT'S MAINE      
          THE WAY I REMEMBER IT.

417
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:19,444
LOBSTER PIE IS UP.              

418
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,012
        THIS IS MY GRANDMOTHER'S
                 VERSION        

419
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,715
      OF A BAKED STUFFED LOBSTER
          WITHOUT THE SHELL.    
I LIKE THE WAY                  
 THAT SOUNDS.                   

420
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,785
   START OFF WITH MELTED BUTTER,
    FRESH SQUEEZED LEMON JUICE. 

421
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:30,054
  HERE'S THE KEY TO THE STUFFING
       OF THE LOBSTER PIE...    
GET OUT.                        

422
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,722
                   THE TOMALLEY.
   DO PEOPLE KNOW               
THEY'RE GETTING THAT?           

423
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:34,658
   THEY DO NOW. THEN WE'RE GONNA
    WHISK THIS UP A LITTLE BIT. 
WHISK THAT UP                   

424
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,594
WITH THAT HANDY-DANDY           
   WHISK-A-SPOON.               

425
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,463
       THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.
YOU'LL BE ABLE                  
 TO FIND THIS                   

426
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:41,599
COMING OUT OF BED, BATH & BEYOND
    SOON--THE WHISK-A-SPOON.    

427
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,867
           OKAY, CRACKER CRUMBS.
RITZ?                           

428
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,935
       CRUSHED RITZ. NEXT BUTTER
          THIS CASSEROLE DISH   

429
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,672
           ADD THE LOBSTER MEAT.
THE LOBSTER MEAT'S              
 ALREADY COOKED.                

430
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,608
                          BINGO.
HOLY LOBSTER, BATMAN.           

431
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,743
       NOW TOP IT WITH TOMALLEY,
         BUTTER, RITZ CRACKER.  

432
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,412
THAT'S IT?                      
             THAT'S READY TO GO.

433
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,813
SIMPLE, STRAIGHTFORWARD,        

434
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,482
 LET THE LOBSTER BE             
THE LEAD IN THE SHOW.           
           THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

435
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:01,018
AND WE'RE GONNA BAKE THIS       
FOR HOW LONG AT WHAT TEMP?      
                ABOUT 10 MINUTES
                    AT 450.     

436
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:04,555
      ONCE IT GETS GOLDEN BROWN,
           IT'S READY TO GO.    
 (whistles)                     
LOOK AT THAT.                   

437
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,957
THE BREADING REALLY HAS         
 A NICE TENDER CRUST,           

438
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,895
JUST FALLING APART. MMM.        
BOY, THAT IS RICH CITY.         

439
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,697
YOU GET A LOT OF FLAVOR         
 ALL THE WAY THROUGH.           

440
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,433
IT'S A CREAMY CRUNCHINESS,      
  TOMALLEY ADDS TO THAT.        

441
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,168
          TOMALLEY REALLY BRINGS
            THE DISH TOGETHER.  
I THINK IF YOU COME             
  TO THIS PLACE,                

442
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,904
AND YOU DON'T TRY THIS ONE,     
    YOU'RE MISSING OUT.         
                  YEAH, I WOULD 
                  TOTALLY AGREE.

443
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:23,774
                    LOBSTER PIE.
VERY TASTY, JUST LIKE EATING    
   A FRESH MAINE LOBSTER.       

444
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:26,710
   LIKE A LITTLE DESSERT PIE,   
BUT THEN YOU HAVE LOBSTER IN IT.

445

 CODFISH CAKES.                 

464
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,725
  WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND BOIL 
SOME POTATOES AND SOME SALT COD.

465
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:17,462
       SALT COD IS COATED       
 IN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SALT,

466
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,931
             ALMOST TO THE POINT
               OF FISH JERKY.   

467
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,599
                  I MEAN, IT IS 
                SUPER PRESERVED.

468
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,602
 THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO COOK LONG,
     ONLY ABOUT TEN MINUTES.    

469
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,003
          MORE TO PULL THE SALT 
        OUT OF IT THAN ANYTHING.
THAT'S ENOUGH--EXACTLY.         

470
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,539
  SO THE POTATOES AND THOSE ARE 
 COMING UP ABOUT THE SAME TIME? 

471
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,274
YEP.                            
            COOL THOSE AND START
             TO MAKE THE CAKES? 

472
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,009
ABSOLUTELY.                     
                         GOT IT.

473
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,811
PUT THE COD IN THE ROBOT COUPE  
        AND SHRED IT.           
                       GOT IT.  

474
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,879
    INTO THE MIXING BOWL WE'RE  
   GONNA PUT OUR BOILED POTATOES

475
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,347
                 AND THE BUTTER,
                   SOME SALT.   

476
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:38,883
WHITE PEPPER?                   
                   WHITE PEPPER.

477
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:42,620
AND WHOSE RECIPE?               
   THIS IS, UH, THIS IS ACTUALLY
   MY GRANDMOTHER'S RECIPE ALSO.

          HALF-AND-HALF IS NEXT,
           EGGS, POTATO PEARLS. 

479
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,959
POTATO PEARLS IS A FANCY WORD   
 FOR FREEZE-DRIED POTATOES.     

480
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:51,428
IT REALLY BINDS IT UP.          
         ADD SOME SAUTéED ONIONS

481
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,631
                   AND SALT COD.
REALLY SHREDDED                 
   THAT UP.                     

482
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,700
                            YEP.
SO WE'RE GONNA                  
 MIX THIS UP.                   

483
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,568
             FOR ABOUT A MINUTE.
      I CAN SMELL               
THE SALT COD FROM HERE.         

484
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,837
                        YOU CAN.
THAT'S ENOUGH?                  

485
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,973
    YEAH, SO NOW WE'RE MAKING   
THE ACTUAL CODFISH CAKE PATTIES.
THAT'S A HEALTHY PORTION.       

486
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,976
                   IT IS INDEED.
     YOU WANT ME                
TO SQUISHY THE PAPE-Y?          

487
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:09,714

          THE PAPER, PLEASE DO. 
SEE THE TEAMWORK?               

488
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,916
         BEAUTIFUL. GIVE IT JUST
          ONE SLIGHT PRESS DOWN.
POP IT IN THE FREEZER           

489
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,585
SO THEY REALLY                  
 TIGHTEN UP.                    
               YEP, UNTIL WE'RE 
              READY TO FRY THEM.

      ALL HAPPEN FROM HERE.     

494
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,664

  SUBMERGE IT IN THE EGG WASH.  

495
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,667
AND THEN WE GOT                 
THE FRY FLOUR.                  
          IT'S A CORNMEAL FLOUR.

496
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:30,867

       WITH THIS?               

497

THERE YOU GO.                   

498

                     ABSOLUTELY.

499
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,674
    GIVE IT A NICE LITTLE SHAKE.
        PUT IT IN THE BASKET.   

500
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,809
   AND GET THE SECOND COD CAKE--
    SAME PROCESS. SHAKE IT OUT. 

501
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,811
   AND YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND DROP
        THAT IF YOU'D LIKE.     

502
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,813
BYE-BYE.                        
                 WHEN THEY START
                    TO FLOAT,   

503
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,682
               AND THEY GET     
           A NICE GOLDEN BROWN--

504
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,484
         IT TAKES ABOUT FOUR,   
       FOUR AND A HALF MINUTES. 

505
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,219
     AND THEY'RE READY. KIND OF 
     DEGREASE THEM A LITTLE BIT.
