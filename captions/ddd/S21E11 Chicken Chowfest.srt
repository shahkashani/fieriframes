00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,067
           Hey, there.          

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,535
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:06,471
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:08,173
          This trip...          
              Mmm!              

5
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,342
   ...the bird is the word...   
         Got to love it.        

6
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,078
  ...'cause we're chowing down  
    on all kinds of chicken.    

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,681
    Put it together, 'cause I'm 
   gonna drown in my own saliva.

8
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:16,748
     In Des Moines, Iowa...     

9
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,417
 Shake the the left,            
 shake to the right.            

10
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:19,818
          ...down-home          
       Southern cooking...      

11
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,954
         You're gonna scrape me 
 off the ceiling with a spatula.

12
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:24,155
      ...just like Grandma      
          used to make.         

13
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,424
        Yes!                    
                 [ Laughs ]     

14
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:26,558
      In Eugene, Oregon...      

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,160
        We're ready to eat, Guy.
       Dig it.                  

16
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:29,761
          ...a smokin'          
        barbecue spot...        

17
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,497
   Gonna get busy               
on that right there.            

18
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:33,699
          ...serving up         
       some serious soul.       

19
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:36,101
Step one of this adventure      
     is awesome.                

20
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:37,502
  And in Baltimore, Maryland... 

21
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,038
            Let's see the magic.
  ...a decades-old dive bar...  

22
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,574
            Now comes something 
       that I'm very fearful of.

23
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,242
      ...dishing out wings      
           with zing.           

24
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:47,246
            Those right there --
                 rather hot.    

25
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:49,515
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

26
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,116
         on "Triple D."         

29
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,464
    I'm here on the east side   
      of Des Moines, Iowa,      

30
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,199
        in an area known        
     for great Mexican food.    

31
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:08,400
       And you're saying,       
         "Wait a second.        

32
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,202
      Des Moines, Iowa --       
      great Mexican food?"      

33
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:11,603
 Well, you know from "Triple D,"

34
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,539
     no matter where we go,     
       we find great food.      

35
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:14,873
    So it's no surprise to me   

36
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,075
  that we're here to check out  
       a...Southern joint.      

37
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,011
   This is Patton's Restaurant  
          and Catering.         

38
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,081
    Gumbo and collard greens.   

39
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,083
     Pam's soul food is like    
    my grandmother's cooking.   

40
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,885
        Fried-fish po'boy       
        and French fries.       

41
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:29,488
   GIRL: Whenever I come into   
 Patton's, it always feels like 

42
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,689
 I'm in the middle of Louisiana,
    even though I'm in Iowa.    

43
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:35,093
             FIERI:             
  That's because chef and owner 
 Pam Patton grew up in the South

44
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:39,430
         before opening         
  this Midwestern spot in 2011. 

45
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,366
            So, great food is...

46
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:42,834
   Southern food.               

47
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:46,438
 It's not too fancy,            
and it's not too casual.        

48
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,508
We've got fried chicken,        
 red beans and rice.            

49
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,775
                 What makes     
            great fried chicken?

50
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,177
        MAN:                    
Not too heavy, juicy.           

51
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,512
Batter shouldn't be             
the main part of it.            

52
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,980
It should be the chicken.       
         What are we gonna make?

53
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,849
 We're going to make            
Southern fried chicken.         

54
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,852
              What are we gonna 
              serve this with?  
 Red beans and rice.            

55
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:02,254
                   Got it.      
     So, we have                
our raw chicken here.           

56
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:05,924
We're going to brine it,        
first of all, in this container.

57
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,592
  I'm going to put              
 a little salt in...            

58
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,661
      Water...                  
   and buttermilk.              

59
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:10,929
                There we go.    
                    Okay.       

60
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,464
             So, now we get this
             all mixed together.

61
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,333
We put it in the refrigerator   
     overnight.                 

62
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:16,334
                   Got it.      
             Now what are doing?

63
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,270
This is the very beginning      
of the red beans and rice.      

64
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:19,605
                 Excellent.     

65
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:21,206
Can't have red beans and rice   
without andouille sausage...    

66
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,208
 so we're frying up             
   our andouille.               

67
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,210
While that's frying,            
I'm gonna shred the turkey.     

68
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:28,546
   So, we're doing smoked turkey
   wings just for the red beans.
     Absolutely.                

69
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:29,948
        I like the way you roll.

70
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,150
        Now, the beans are just 
      red beans soaked in water?

71
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,819
   We boiled them               
for about 90 minutes.           

72
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,486
              How am I looking  
              on the sausage?   

73
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,022
 I think we're ready            
     to go down.                

74
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,957
          Fantastic. Here we go.
              Oh, look at that. 

75
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,358
       All that flavor going in.

76
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,095
     All right.                 
Now I'm going to add my celery. 

77
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,831
                   Celery.      
 Bell pepper, onion.            

78
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,099
           A mirepoix. I dig it.

79
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,301
             Okay, veg is ready.
                It goes down?   

80
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,236
It's ready to go down.          
                 All right.     

81
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,505
           Now you want to start
              dropping turkey?  
     Absolutely.                

82
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,107
    There you go.               
All that great flavor.          

83
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:56,574
            Oh, I'm telling you.

84
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,710
Now we got to season our beans  
just a little bit, Guy.         
                    Okay.       

85
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:03,114
We're gonna put a little salt,  
and a lot of Slap Ya Mama.      

86
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,050
     Bay leaves,                
    some Tabasco.               

87
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,651
                 I like it.     
     Gumbo filé.                

88
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,120
                    Okay.       
               Little Cayenne.  

89
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,122
        Little Creole seasoning.
                   And...       

90
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,557
  Cajun seasoning.              
                   Got it.      

91
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,192
Just a little garlic.           

92
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,527
Mix it all together.            

93
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,329
             90 minutes covered.
       Right.                   

94
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:18,997
           That's a lot of work,
              and I'm starving. 

95
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:19,998
    I got you.                  
                 Thank you.     

96
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,867
                    Okay,       
          chicken's been brined.

97
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,536
I'm going to put the chicken    
in the seasoned flour.          

98
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,271
          And then you shake it?
     Absolutely.                

99
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,606
  You got to shake              
   to the left...               

100
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,041
                   Uh-huh.      
...shake to the right.          

101
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,676
 Shake to the left,             
 shake to the right.            

102
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,744
         Now we go to the fryer.

103
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:35,213
        375,                    
about 7 to 8 minutes.           

104
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,748
             Whoa, hot and fast.
       I know.                  

105
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,283
            Okay, chicken's out.

106
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,551
       Get a chance to cool down
                for a second.   

107
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,353
             Red beans and rice 
                are finished.   

108
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,622
    Put it together, 'cause I'm 
   gonna drown in my own saliva.

109
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,157
     All right,                 
   we ready to go?              

110
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,425
           Look at that, though.

111
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,369
    [ Laughing ]

00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,239
                    Yes!        

113
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,807
               That was okay.   
         Oh.                    

114
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,712
    Mmm! That's outrageous level
         of red beans and rice. 

115
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,046
     Okay, good.                
     Thank you.                 

116
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,882
          The smoked turkey leg 
       is really the key factor.

117
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,987
       I get smoky, I get meaty,
       I get super-tender beans.

118
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,990
         I get it all together, 
     and with the fried chicken.

119
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,392
                    Mmm.        

120
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,527
     The chicken is very simple.

121
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,396
               Nice breading.   
                 Not greasy.    

122
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:26,297
          Old school. Delicious.

123
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,266
     Thank you.                 
           You rocked the house.

124
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,534
         Fried chicken,         
       red beans and rice.      

125
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:30,736
             Enjoy.             
   MAN: Thank you.              

126
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,470
      The chicken is crispy     
         on the outside,        

127
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,639
   and it is very, very moist   
         on the inside.         

128
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,808
        Mmm. And it just kind of
           melts in your mouth. 

129
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,878
              MAN:              
 Smoked turkey is not something 
    that overpowers the beans   

130
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,547
    or the andouille sausage,   
    but is a nice complement.   

131
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,350
 It's just cooked to perfection,
 like everything that Pam does. 

132
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,686
    I have a gumbo coming up.   
              Now, were did you 
               learn to cook?   

133
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,821
I had a great grandmother,      
Gussie Hayes, who --            

134
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,089
                  Time out.     

135
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,224
        Okay.                   
                Gussie Hayes.   

136
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,492
               That's a name!   

137
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,561
She taught me how to cook       
when I was about 9 years old.   

138
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,630
I just fell in love with it.    

139
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,499
     FIERI: And these days,     
   she still loves cooking up   

140
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,702
 both the savory and sweet side 
          of Southern.          

141
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,370
       Red-velvet waffle,       
      cream-cheese topping.     

142
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,839
     The red-velvet waffles     
         are delicious.         

143
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:08,840
    They melt in your mouth.    

144
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,575
I don't know how else to        
   describe them.               

145
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:11,843
       I think                  
I called them heavenly.         

146
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:12,977
              Okay, what are we 
                making next?    

147
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,379
  We're gonna make              
our red-velvet waffles.         

148
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,782
You know, red velvet            
is a big Southern staple.       

149
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:19,117
       We have                  
apple cider vinegar.            
              All of that, huh? 

150
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,919
    All of that.                
Got some buttermilk.            

151
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,188
                    Okay.       
Some vanilla extract.           

152
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,190
    Got our eggs.               
Our red food coloring.          

153
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,459
                  Let's see     
              how red this is.  

154
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,594
We're gonna whisk this.         

155
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:30,862
              Okay. That's red. 

156
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,531
              Okay, so, now...  

157
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,999
 Cocoa, baking soda,            
    salt, sugar.                

158
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,135
                    Okay.       
      We've got                 
some cake flour here.           

159
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,403
                 Cake flour?    
    That's right.               

160
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:39,871
     All right.                 
     Let it go.                 

161
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,674
      All right, so, now the dry
      ingredients are together. 

162
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,577
And we're going to pour our wet 
ingredient in and mix that up.  

163
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:49,214
             The batter is done.
                   Now...       

164
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,750
Gonna make that waffle          
      for you.                  

165
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:53,418
   All right, Guy,              
 we're ready to go.             

166
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,754
Pulling the waffle off.         
              Whoa, that's red. 

167
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,955
Plate just like this.           
You put the butter on,          

168
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:01,025
and the cream-cheese topping    
 goes right on top.             

169
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,627
       That over a hot waffle...

170
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,963
         You're gonna scrape me 
 off the ceiling with a spatula.

171
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,698
   Pecans on top.               
                    Okay.       

172
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,300
                 Here we go.    

173
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:10,501
                    Mmm.        

174
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,437
         That's a waffle-lover's
                   waffle.      

175
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:15,240
 It's got a little bit of crunch
               to the outside.  

176
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,642
                 Very soft.     
              Not overly sweet. 

177
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:21,046
              The cream-cheese  
frosting/syrup/filling/nougat...

178
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,847
                  is great.     

179
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:26,251
  There is one person would walk
     over hot coals for that -- 

180
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,985
                my son Ryder.   

181
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,521
 Thank you so much.             
                  Nice job.     

182
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,122
 Red-velvet waffles.            

183
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,058
     These are so delicious     

184
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,393
     that you can have them     
         for breakfast,         

185
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,796
    for dinner, for anything.   
        MAN:                    
The cream-cheese syrup on top   

186
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,132
does just the right amount      
      of sweet.                 
           "Cream-cheese syrup."

187
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:41,599
 That's the best way            
     to put it.                 

188
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,068
      That says "gym membership"
                   to me.       

189
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,803
         Southern-fried         
        chicken piccata.        

190
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,738
             Here's what I love 
            about what you do --

191
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,207
     Everything is tied to you, 
   everything is tied to family,

192
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,943
              and it feels like 
   you're at some family's home.

193
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:52,944
   Thank you, Guy.              

194
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,212
                Awesome job.    
     Thank you.                 

195
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,347
                Gussie Hayes.   
    Thank you.                  

196
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,152
        FIERI: Coming up,       
    in Baltimore, Maryland...   

197
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:02,754
              Wow, look at you. 
        ...a neighborhood       
        watering hole...        

198
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:06,090
               Rub-a-dub-dub?   
         ...showing off         
  its righteous menu makeover.  

199
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,226
        Call it a wrap. Call it 
   whatever you want. It's good.

200
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,736
  I'm here in north Baltimore,  
            Maryland,           

201
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:18,870
   in an area known as Govans,  

202
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,005
      about two miles away      
     from Loyola University.    

203
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,340
  I'm here to check out a joint 

204
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,943
  that's got a lot of theories  
  on how they got their name.   

205
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,078
         Some folks say,        
 well, it was an swimming hole. 

206
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,880
           Others say           
 it was a spring that dried up. 

207
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,815
           Regardless           
   of how they got their name,  

208
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,884
 it's a name you'll never forget
         on "Triple D."         

209
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,587
 This is Swallow at the Hollow. 

210
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,558
        MAN: Sliders up.        

211
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,160
  Swallow at the Hollow is more 
    than just a burger place.   

212
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,628
           Two minutes          
         on those wings.        

213
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,963
         There's always         
      something different.      

214
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,230
      Blackened-tuna pita.      

215
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,099
 I've been coming to the Swallow
         since college.         

216
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,234
  I can remember when they had  
      greasy, grimy floors,     

217
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,702
     before it was purchased    
            by Aaron.           

218
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:54,205
 FIERI: That'd be chef and owner
         Aaron Reinhart,        

219
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,574
      who's been serving up     
      scratch-made pub grub

                    250.        
        We're ready to eat, Guy.

446
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,775
       Dig it.                  

447
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,912
                We serve this   
            with barbecue sauce.

448
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:26,317
                Get a little    
              baked beans here. 

449
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,288
                 And hit it     
    with a little collard green.

450
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:35,926
        Mmm.                    

451
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,728
    That chicken                
  is tender, juicy.             

452
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,663
 That brine gives it            
   a lot of love.               

453
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,466
        Mmm.                    
                   Mm-hmm.      

454
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:42,467
  Love dried beans.             

455
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,004
Little sweet, little salt.      

456
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,472
   Great texture.               

457
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,207
        Mmm.                    

458
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,010
The greens are outrageous.      
      I mean...                 

459
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,145
                You feel good   
       after eating them greens.
        Mmm.                    

460
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:55,680
I'm a green machine.            
     It's legit.                

461
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,749
And I can't say that            
about every barbecue place.     

462
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,817
  That's real-deal.             
               Right on, man.   
                 Thank you.     

463
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,819
             WOMAN:             
     Barbecue-chicken plate.    

464
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,489
     I would go swimming in     
the barbecue sauce...head-first.

465
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,424
       Barbecue's not something 
you really find a lot in Oregon.

466
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:07,759
      Mnh-mnh.                  
             How does this rate?

467
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:09,026
It's definitely the best.       

468
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,361
       Barbecue pork ribs,      
    mac and cheese. Order up.   

469
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,165
   There's nothing like this    
   that can beat Papa Soul's.   

470
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,367
   Barbecue-chicken sandwich.   

471
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,769
   Papa was bigger than life.   

472
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:20,104
So, he's a musician, and a great
one, from what I hear.          

473
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:21,572
             He was incredible. 

474
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,640
        He played the washboard.
            He played the bass. 

475
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:24,675
         He was a percussionist.

476
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:30,114
He is alive and well            
      in here.                  
                    Yep.        

477
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,449
  This is a party.              
                    Yeah.       

478
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,384
             FIERI:             
    And speaking of parties,    

479
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,686
            how about           
   this Southern celebration?   

480
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:36,921
              MAN:              
        One soul burger.        

481
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,757
       It's very soulful.       
       Tremendous flavor.       

482
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,993
FIERI: And we're gonna get after
     that when we come back.    

483
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:43,394
    Nothing stops               
Soul Kitchen barbecue.          

484
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:50,667
    FIERI: In Eugene, Oregon,   
 Papa's Soul Food Kitchen & BBQ 

485
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,271
       is doing something       
 pretty unique in these parts --

486
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:56,808
           dishing out          
  straight-up Southern staples. 

487
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,275
          Jambalaya and a gumbo.

488
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,811
  You feel like you're in the   
  South when you come in here.  

489
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,880
      We're also gonna need     
        a catfish plate.        

490
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:05,616
             FIERI:             
   And Chef Redbone's carrying  
 the torch passed on from Papa, 

491
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,085
         the late owner         
     who started the joint.     

492
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,285
What is great soul food?        

493
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,421
    You got to have some passion
              for the recipes.  

494
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,223
  You got to have family history
                for the food.   

495
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:14,425
               Catfish, yams,   
   red beans and rice. Order up.

496
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,627
  I only have to eat once a day 
       if I come in here.       

497
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,829
          Soul burger!          
            Order up!           

498
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,966
 I'm having the soul burger. It 
 is a really good, spicy burger 

499
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:24,569
with a little coleslaw and some,
  like, frizzled onions on it.  

500
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,703
         MAN: You've got        
     this nice hunk of meat     

501
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:30,508
       that is sandwiched       
    between some great bread.   

502
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,911
All right. So, the ground pork  
 from the pork butt?            
                    Yep.        

503
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,980
And this is gonna be            
the beginning of the soul patty.

504
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,249
                  Sho' is.      
      Sho' is!                  

505
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,318
            So, we're gonna take
              this ground pork. 

506
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,720
        We're gonna mix together
            the holy trinity -- 

507
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,255
           onions, bell peppers,
                 and celery.    

508
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,657
                Kosher salt.    
       Got it.                  

509
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,326
      Fresh-ground black pepper.
            Some garlic powder. 

510
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,862
                  Paprika.      

511
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:52,462
             Crystal Hot Sauce. 

512
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,665
      Some Worcestershire sauce.

513
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,534
             The barbecue sauce.

514
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,402
   That is killer               
   barbecue sauce.              

515
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:00,271
                 We're gonna    
              mix this all up.  

516
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:03,207
   And we're gonna              
portion out the patties?        

517
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,343
      We're going for 1/2 pound.
    [ Whistles ]                

518
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:07,478
  How are we gonna              
     cook this?                 
        We're gonna smoke these.

519
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,548
What happens when it rains?     
             Rain don't stop us 
                 in Oregon.     

520
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,749
    Nothing stops               
Soul Kitchen barbecue.          

521
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,285
        Okay,                   
let's go to the smoker.         

522
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,688
                 Probably at    
             about 225 degrees. 

523
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:22,359
We're gonna smoke them for about
 an hour to an hour and a half. 

524
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,962
             So, we've got some 
  freshly-shredded cabbage here,

525
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,497
        and the soul dressing --

526
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,367
mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar,
        celery seed, and sugar. 

527
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,038
   Soul slaw down?              
               Soul slaw down.  

528
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,040
               We're gonna add  
          our smoked pork patty.

529
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:38,175
            On the smoked patty,

530
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,110
 we'll get our Papa Soul Kitchen
               barbecue sauce.  

531
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,713
               We top it with   
      our Southern-fried onions.

532
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:47,351
        Hit it with some fries, 
   top it with our cornmeal bun.

533
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,053
             There you go, Guy. 

534
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,589
All right. Let's get after this.
    I'm going in.               

535
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,258
        Mmm.                    

536
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,460
The balance is fantastic.       
               Oh, thank you.   

537
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,531
   Not over-smoked              
   on the burger.               

538
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,199
The slaw has the crunch.        

539
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,669
 The barbecue sauce             
 is spicy and sweet.            

540
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,805
And then, those little, fried,  
crunchy onions on top of it     

541
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,874
just play it all together.      
        Mmm.                    

542
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,209
    I'd get busy                
on that right there.            

543
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,744
      Nice job.                 
                 Thank you.     

544
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,746
   Got your soul burger here.   

545
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,148
              MAN:              
  The flavors -- When you bite, 

546
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,950
    you have like five or six   
        different tastes.       

547
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:21,552
      It's making me full,      
but doesn't mean I'm gonna stop.

548
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:25,489
  Isn't just a restaurant. It's 
  more of, like, an atmosphere  

549
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,090
        and an experience       
       more than anything.      

550
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,026
      You know,                 
the way that Papa built this    

551
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,762
and the way that you're carrying
through the tradition...        

552
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,431
                   Mm-hmm?      
Very impressive, bro.           

553
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:34,765
Papa's very proud, man.
