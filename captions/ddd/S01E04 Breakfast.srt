1
00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:02,267
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,736
I'm Guy Fieri,
  and we're rolling out

3
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:07,039
looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,308
This trip...
     Egg, egg, baby.

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,678
We're going coast to coast
 for a full hour of breakfast.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,279
This is kind of, like,
  wine-tasting for me.

7
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:15,881
I'm gonna cleanse my palette
   between bacon.

8
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,483
We've got waffles in Phoenix...

9
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:19,551
That's a hot Frisbee of fun.

10
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:22,621
...old-school diner favorites
   from Buffalo...

11
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,189
You know, like,
 a side of ham with some ham.

12
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,091
...to Salt Lake City...

13
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:28,260
The biscuit-baking bad boy.

14
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:30,562
...and a joint
 in Long Beach, California,

15
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:33,866
throwing everything
 into one crazy concoction.

16
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:34,900
I see why they call it the mess.

17
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:37,770
Plus, a Cajun classic
  in Louisiana...

18
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:39,671
That sauce
 is gonna be out of bounds.

19
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:42,574
...a killer combination
  in Los Angeles...

20
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,476
Bacon donut.
  ...and in Jersey...

21
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:47,446
Coffee.
 ...the best looking pancake
   I've ever seen.

22
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:50,282
That is crazy.

23
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,584
So wake up
  and smell the huevos...

24
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,286
"Huevos" meaning the eggs.

25
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:57,056
...for this
 top-of-the-morning mash-up.

26
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,359
You could convert
    non-breakfasters.

27
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:02,361
That's why we're here.
    Non-breakfasters?

28
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:04,396
That's all right here,
   right now,

29
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,332
on "Diners, Drive-Ins
   and Dives."

32
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,510
When you're
 in downtown Phoenix, Arizona,

33
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,612
you just got to check out
  this little joint

34
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,781
called Matt's Big Breakfast.

35
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,983
Now this dude digs breakfast
   so much,

36
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:27,219
he devoted
 an entire restaurant to it.

37
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:29,154
I just got to meet this cat,
    Matt.

38
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,489
Who's having
 the breakfast special today?

39
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:31,857
It's so good.
    Eggs and pork chop.

40
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,092
It was very good.

41
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:35,260
The atmosphere is
tiny and squished and compact.

42
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,862
That's what's great
     about it.
  Chris, party of one.

43
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,831
It's the best breakfast in town,
   hands-down.

44
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,666
It feels more like
you're eating breakfast at home.

45
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:43,469
Is my mom here?
   I would say
 the specialty is quality.

46
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:46,071
It's breakfast basics
  done the right way...

47
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:48,173
It's squeezed
    a lot of oranges.
 ...totally from scratch...

48
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,542
Breakfast isn't really
  complicated. Keep it fresh.

49
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,544
...made
 with the best ingredients.

50
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,880
We don't even own a freezer.
We don't own a microwave.

51
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:58,183
There's no microwave
 and no freezer in this joint?
No microwave, no freezer. No.

52
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,718
Waffle?
 Thank you.

53
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,153
Waffle's perfect.

54
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:02,654
They're really light,
   very delicate.

55
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,323
'Cause making them
   Matt Pool's way

56
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:07,226
means making fresh batter
  three times a day.

57
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:08,660
You want to help me crack,
or should I just do it all?

58
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,629
Well, I've never cracked
    in tandem before.

59
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,797
And jazz hands.

60
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,700
We've got two cups
 of sugar here.

61
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:16,435
We're gonna put some butter
in there -- put it in melted.

62
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:18,871
Now, you're not worried about
 kind of poaching those eggs

63
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:20,539
a little bit
   with that hot butter?

64
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,708
We'd worry
if I didn't start whisking.
       Okay.

65
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,877
The flour
 and the whole milk,

66
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,812
I'm gonna add them
in alternate doses here.

67
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:30,549
Careful.

68
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,417
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

69
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:33,752
We do have a mixer here,
     right?

70
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,754
No, no,
we don't have any mixer.

71
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,823
There's no room
 for a mixer.

72
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:41,026
Then we add the baking powder
with just a teaspoon of salt.

73
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:42,261
Looks like cake batter.

74
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:43,328
That's it right there.

75
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,531
Put that down,
 give it a flip.

76
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,399
And it only takes about a minute
so you flip it back over.

77
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:50,235
It's like a hiking boot
  just walked on a pancake.

78
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:52,104
Look at that thing.

79
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:53,505
That's a hot Frisbee
     of fun.

80
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,340
Syrup.
   Wait, wait, wait, wait.

81
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:59,344
Granny's kettle on the flat-top
 all day is actually hot syrup?

82
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,746
It's hot syrup ready to go.

83
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:02,414
You don't want to put cold syrup
 on a hot waffle.

84
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,916
That'd kind of ruin it.

85
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:05,984
It's got a really nice crust
     to it.

86
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,152
Look at it inside there.

87
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:10,255
You see how nice and light
     and airy?

88
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,591
Really good. I'd eat that waffle
   again in a heartbeat.

89
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:13,926
I got to tell you, man.

90
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:17,262
You could convert
    non-breakfasters.

91
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:19,831
That's why we're here.
    Non-breakfasters?

92
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,099
Actually...
     Home fries,
     hash browns.

93
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,768
...he already has.

94
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,436
Now, what will the wait
     turn into,

95
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,104
like, on an average weekday
    or a weekend?

96
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:27,272
- Hour and a half.
- To get in?

97
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:28,907
Oh, yeah, and it's worth
 the wait, for sure.

98
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:31,410
I'm gonna take Gregory,
  party of two, please.

99
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:32,911
What do you like
    about it here?

100
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,681
Hmm, my daddy owns it.

101
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,849
I still remember, you know,
going to a little coffee shop.

102
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,351
My dad loved coffee shops.

103
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:40,919
He always sat
 at the counter.

104
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,821
I just figured there were people
here that would appreciate

105
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,656
just kind of old-fashioned
mom-and-pop-run restaurant.

106
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,992
So three years ago,
 he and his wife, Arenia...

107
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:48,160
Hi, how are you?

108
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:49,328
...got a counter
   of their own.

109
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,629
I'm here almost every other day.

110
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,064
It filled up quick.

111
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,532
Welcome to Phoenix.
How are you, Mayor?

112
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,367
Enjoy the same thing
each time you come in?
        No.

113
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,636
I like the waffles
    or the omelettes --

114
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,404
The waffles
  with the real maple syrup.

115
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,906
And it's that real thing

116
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,841
that's keeping this joint
    packed.

117
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,544
Every piece of my breakfast
   is so good.

118
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,512
We get all of our pork from
a little local butcher shop.

119
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,181
They don't deliver,
 and I pay retail.

120
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:10,515
It's the craziest thing
 in the world.

121
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,850
And once you have
   the bacon here,

122
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,086
you'll never eat bacon
 anywhere else your whole life.

123
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,754
This is kind of like
   wine-tasting for me.

124
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,522
I'm gonna cleanse my palette
    between bacon.

125
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:19,291
It's as thick
    as a ham steak.

126
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:20,259
Great texture to it.

127
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,960
Whole grain bread.

128
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,762
You know that they
make this stuff sliced?

129
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,430
I don't like
  the uniformity of bread.

130
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,833
The man has an issue
with uniformity of bread.

131
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,101
And then we serve it

132
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,069
with a little bit
 of a homemade local preserve.

133
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,371
Mm.

134
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,840
Oh.
     It's like
  an open-faced jelly donut.

135
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:37,009
Most of it's
   all the way out here.

136
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:39,011
There you go.

137
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:41,346
And Matt's putting fresh
 rosemary in his home fries...

138
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,282
Kind of melt
    in your mouth.

139
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,884
...cooked in tons of butter,
 just like the hash browns.

140
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,886
Butter the grill.
We lay out the hash browns.

141
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,188
We butter it on top, and then
we just keep flipping them.

142
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,456
Oh, those are killer.

143
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,958
He's even making fresh pesto

144
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,626
for his breakfast pork chops.

145
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,128
We make
    a pesto marinade.

146
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,196
We put the garlic
 in there first.

147
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:01,600
It's about 1 1/2 ounces
of fresh basil, pine nuts.

148
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,602
Made a red bell pepper pesto
   with macadamia nuts.

149
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,103
For a pasta or for...

150
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,405
Oh, no,
    just put it facial.

151
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:08,106
And I'll wear it
   as a mud mask at night.

152
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,775
That's good.
   That's a secret. Great.

153
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:12,411
Some salt, pepper,
and then extra virgin olive oil.

154
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,246
And you just
kind of do this by sight.

155
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:16,548
Look at the color
     in that.
I've got some chops here.

156
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,650
Toss them around.
  Can I lick the bowl, Mom?

157
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,752
It's all yours.

158
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,154
Money.

159
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,255
How long
    does it marinate?

160
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:24,423
At least three hours or so.

161
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:27,259
It's gonna get
 a nice, little crust on it.

162
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:28,660
Looks like
    it's time to flip.

163
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,695
Those bad boys
 got to be done.

164
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:30,762
You want to give them
     a shot?

165
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,698
You can just see the juice
coming out of it.

166
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,668
Oh, fantastic.

167
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,936
You know,
  you get the little pesto,

168
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,171
get some of the bite
    of the garlic.

169
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,006
I love that you do
   fresh cracked pepper.

170
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,074
That's my biggest thing.

171
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:44,209
The food
 has a lot of love in it.

172
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,712
And you can always taste it
 when people cook with love.

173
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,413
The special is, today,

174
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:52,451
corned beef hash
 with poached eggs.

175
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:54,353
Thank you.
 Welcome.

176
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:56,488
I want it to be like
 a Midwestern-style diner.

177
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,556
Window, please.

178
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,491
Thankfully, people recognize it.

179
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:01,059
Well, the food's always great.

180
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,028
You can tell that whoever
 made this food is an artist.

181
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,329
They're the sweetest people.

182
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,764
Just make you feel like
 you're part of the family.

183
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,032
Well, I appreciate it.
  Thanks for coming in.

184
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,600
So, on our next stop

185
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:10,202
for "Diners, Drive-Ins
     and Dives,"

186
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,204
where do you want to go?
Help!

187
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,973
Well, how about
  Buffalo, New York...
       Dig it.

188
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:18,410
...to a classic diner dishing
 out a true labor of love?

189
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:21,046
And this is all
for a breakfast item.
      One item.

190
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,347
One item.

191
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,015
And in Dania Beach, Florida...

192
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,484
The party's getting started,
    man.

193
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:28,720
...scratch-made pancakes
  mixed to perfection.

194
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,155
Full steam ahead, Captain.
    Aye.

195
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,394
So, here I am --
  Buffalo, New York.

196
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,696
I'm about five miles
  northeast of Lake Erie

197
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,331
at a joint that was once a diner

198
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,633
and then changed
 into a Chinese restaurant,

199
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,568
well, then transplanted
  from Pennsylvania

200
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,237
and then turned back
   into a diner.

201
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,339
And guess what? That's not even
  the amazing part.

202
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:49,207
These guys are --
 they're curing their own ham,

203
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,409
They're corning their own beef,

204
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:51,910
and they're smoking
  their own bacon.

205
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,645
This is Lake Effect Diner.

206
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,313
Pulled pork.
   The real deal.

207
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,615
Barbecue meatloaf.

208
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,417
An upscale version
  of the old classic.

209
00:06:58,419 --> 00:06:59,751
Blueberry pancakes.

210
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,386
You can really taste
   the difference.

211
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:02,921
Are there
  a lot of diners in Buffalo?

212
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,589
Not too many.
   Not like this.

213
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,392
- A '50's legacy...
- Two sunshines in a glass.

214
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:09,461
...that Tucker Curtin...
Italian sausage.

215
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:12,130
...and his wife, Erin,
  brought back to life.
      Table 24.

216
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,065
We went looking
 for the diner car.

217
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,234
And we were able
 to resurrect it

218
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,803
and put it back
 into service again.

219
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:20,005
Now, this joint is smoking --
   for real.

220
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,506
Ready to rock and roll.

221
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,675
Everything
  from turkey to bacon...
    Oh, it's so good.

222
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,777
...to ham.
So a boneless pork leg.

223
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:26,845
And you're gonna make
  your own --

224
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,046
We're gonna make
    our own ham.

225
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,581
We'll start with our brine,
     okay?

226
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,016
About a gallon of water,

227
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,918
some dried cloves here,
    black peppercorns.

228
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,719
Dried mustard.
   Lots of dried mustard.

229
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,055
Light brown sugar made right
  here in Buffalo, New York.

230
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,690
Maple syrup.
Attaboy.

231
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,659
Sodium nitrate here.
Ah, for some nice color.

232
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:41,993
And then kosher salt.
Okay.

233
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,295
Bring that
 to a little simmer.

234
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,930
Yeah, so we're gonna get that
  into a rumbling boil.

235
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,598
And then,
  we'll cut our ham in half,

236
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,266
pour the cooled brine
     on top.

237
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:51,002
And that's
   a 12 to 14-day process.

238
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,204
And then
it'll go to the smoker.

239
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:53,572
For about three hours.

240
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:55,507
We'll also slow-smoke
  the bones that we'll use

241
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,342
in the stock
  for our red-eye gravy --

242
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,411
Smoke those
   over mesquite charcoal.

243
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:02,147
And we also burn
  apple and hickory woods.

244
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,849
Wow.

245
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,517
Sugars are starting
  to caramelize up on them.

246
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,518
Look at this.

247
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,653
Just take a little looky-loo
  at that.

248
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,324
Isn't that beautiful?

249
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,260
It's got
    that real maple --
Don't talk in the middle of it.

250
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:18,597
And this is all
for a breakfast item on a menu.

251
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,265
Correct.
<i> A</i> breakfast item.

252
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:22,033
One item.
 One item.

253
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,236
So now we take them,
pop them in the oven,

254
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:25,770
bringing them up
 to about 145.

255
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:28,306
Finish the cooking process,
 take them out.

256
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,308
We got our bones.
They're all smoked off.

257
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,210
It got the fat
 nicely out of them.

258
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,312
Now I'm gonna dump
the pan juices in there.

259
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,981
Little mirepoix.
Carrot, celery, and onion.

260
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,482
Dig it.
Black peppercorn.

261
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,351
We are going to be
    straining this?
Yes, we are.

262
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,385
Some kosher salt.

263
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:41,920
Frank's hot sauce.
       Wow.

264
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,655
This is the secret
 to good wings.

265
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,557
It's also the secret
to good red-eye gravy.

266
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,692
Brindle of fresh thyme.
Add some coffee to it.

267
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,294
Now, how long will this
   sit there and simmer?

268
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:52,264
For about three hours.
 Strain it and it'll be ready
  to serve with the ham.

269
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:55,066
Correct.
Got our ham right here.
     Slice him up.

270
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:58,270
Get that going on the flat-top
with eggs and home fries.

271
00:08:58,272 --> 00:08:59,871
Egg, egg, baby.

272
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,573
A little bit
of our red-eye gravy here.

273
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:03,975
Let me get these eggs,
some of our home fries.

274
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:05,443
Get our ham
    on there too.

275
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:06,678
A little more
 red-eye gravy.

276
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,113
I kind of hoped
  you were gonna say that.

277
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,516
Mmm.
this is very flavorful.

278
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,184
Tender ham, for sure.

279
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,887
You know, like, a side of ham
 with some ham.

280
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,455
Being raised
eating red-eye gravy,

281
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,224
I've seen a lot
of different variations.

282
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,826
I do think I would like to have
a cup of red-eye gravy to chug.

283
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:24,963
Mmm. Awesome, bud.
  Nice job.
      Order up.

284
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,898
Ham, red-eye gravy.

285
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,433
Very good, very moist.

286
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,635
Everything is really fresh,
  really homemade.

287
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,604
95% of the things
 you guys serve,

288
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:34,606
you make from scratch.
     Absolutely.

289
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:36,641
Order up.
     Our customers
    deserve the best.

290
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,710
If we have the ability
to provide that quality food,

291
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,679
it's our job to do it.
  Classic diner feel,

292
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,480
but it tastes more like
  a home-cooked meal.

293
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:43,815
Congratulations.
Thank you.

294
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,116
And you're still doing it
 with smiles on your faces.

295
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,785
And you're still married.
We are.

296
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,954
On "Triple D,"
  when we visit a place,

297
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,855
it's got to have
  three things going --

298
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,425
the people and their story,
 the food, and the location.

299
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,093
Today, we're at Grampa's,

300
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,928
where it started out
   as a bakery.

301
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,365
Their comfort food is righteous,
 and, hey, it's in Florida.

302
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,601
Fresh rugelach --
 chocolate and raspberry.

303
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,803
Just like home cooking.
      Happy food.

304
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,738
Way to a man's heart
 is through his stomach, right?

305
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,772
Pancakes
in the middle of the day?

306
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,441
Pancakes any time
     of the day.

307
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,842
If it's comfort food...

308
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,143
Pork loin, mashed potatoes.

309
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,144
...they're doing it here.

310
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,312
I remember
 when it was just

311
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:15,914
a small little bakery place
 in the early '70s.

312
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,416
Started by Grampa himself.

313
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,852
Ronnie Grampa.
Now, Grampa's your last name?
      Yes, sir.

314
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,421
Your dad's dad,
Did you call him Grandpa Grampa?

315
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:25,757
That's a good one.

316
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,226
26 years ago,
 Ronnie brought general manager

317
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,562
Tommy Grimes aboard.
     They're fresh
     shadow cakes.

318
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:33,398
Together, they expanded
 the place near Fort Lauderdale,

319
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,600
into a full-fledged restaurant.

320
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,102
We tried to follow
 the pattern of the bakery

321
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,637
into the restaurant

322
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,639
to give people
  the same kind of stuff.

323
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,374
- The same feeling, yeah.
- Order up.

324
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,275
Do you need anything else
    at this time?
No, this is great.

325
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,077
It's always good.
  It's always fresh.

326
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,312
I don't have to do it at home.

327
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,948
And who's doing
scratch pancakes at home anyway?

328
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,116
These are what
  my mom would make.

329
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,917
They're delicious.
And whose recipe
was this?

330
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,786
Me.
    Pastry flour.

331
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,454
Lot of elasticity.
      Exactly.

332
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,989
- Okay.
- 24 ounces of sugar.

333
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,525
Full steam ahead,
    Captain. Aye.

334
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,360
I learned that
     on the ship.
We're gonna add buttermilk.

335
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,662
We don't want
to add all the liquid

336
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:04,929
until we get the lumps out.
       Clear.

337
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,498
Halfway around.
    Fire in the hole.

338
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,499
Oh, stop.

339
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,900
This is one
of the most important

340
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,268
tools of the trade --
 the scraper.

341
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,603
Let's go third speed.

342
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:12,704
Fire in the hole.

343
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,105
Go around
 one more time, sir.

344
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,907
On two or three?
Three this time.

345
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,542
Oops, four.
 Nope.

346
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,444
No.
 48 eggs.

347
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,613
One quart of fresh milk.

348
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:23,682
You meet people that are excited
 about things they're doing.

349
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,150
Tell me about
  3 pounds of melted butter.

350
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:26,685
This is 3 pounds
 of melted butter.

351
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,219
The party's getting
    started, man.

352
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,754
Baking powder, baking soda.

353
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,489
Two ounces of salt.

354
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:32,857
That's a pretty elaborate
 pancake mix.

355
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,859
Better be good.
     It's gonna be.
     Don't worry.

356
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,394
I'm not.
You're the pancake master.

357
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,430
And nothing down
 on there, huh?
     Nothing down.

358
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:39,464
It's got butter in it.

359
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:40,665
You never pat them
    and you never --

360
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:41,733
No, you don't mess
  with them.

361
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:44,769
Oh, I'm sorry,
 Mary Lou Retton.

362
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,638
Some people like a chunk
of butter, you know what I mean?

363
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,006
A chunk of butter.
A chunk of butter.

364
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:51,409
Look at that --
  nice layers and the holes.

365
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,911
It's really light
    but texturey.

366
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,079
Good pancake, man.

367
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:56,915
Grampa's makes the best pancakes
  in South Florida.

368
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,249
Fluffy and perfect.

369
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,851
That was
    a lot of work, too.

370
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,519
Got to give them something good
or else they won't come back.

371
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,288
Oh, they're coming back.

372
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,556
I'm here
 morning, noon, and night.

373
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,491
It's really good.
This is the place to go.

374
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,526
And thanks for coming in.

375
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:09,828
Coming up...
 I like it.

376
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,696
...in Minneapolis, Minnesota...

377
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:14,299
We're sort of a dump
   aspiring to be a dive.

378
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,534
...a serious
  morning wake-up call.

379
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,036
I need
   another hollandaise.

380
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:21,139
And in Mandeville, Louisiana...
      I'm a
    grit-eating fool.

381
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:24,075
...A New Orleans favorite
 I just can't get enough of.

382
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,310
Don't hold back on me.

383
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,178
Matter of fact,
    just fill that up.

384
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,516
One of the best things

385
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,818
about classic American diners,
  drive-ins and dives

386
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,954
is you really can't judge a book
   by its cover,

387
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,956
like this breakfast joint
   in Minneapolis.

388
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,391
Would you believe
 a James Beard Award winner?

389
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,961
This is a dive.
Everybody else,
move all the way down.

390
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:44,496
I got a waffle up.

391
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:46,164
- There's a waffle up.
- It's not split.

392
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,665
Don't send it down
 until it's split.

393
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:50,368
Don't send it back.
    Let them split it
     themselves.

394
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,237
You really consider
    this place a dive?

395
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,305
Of course.
Look at it, for crying out loud.

396
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,841
And owner Doug Grina's doing
 all he can to keep it that way.

397
00:12:56,843 --> 00:13:00,044
I need
   another hollandaise.
No, you don't.

398
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,814
But then there's the food.
Best breakfast in town.

399
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,883
Everything's made fresh
   and to order.

400
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,718
We make our own
    corned beef hash.

401
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,986
I love corned beef hash.

402
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09,788
You want that?
That's a good-looking hash.

403
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,458
Wow.

404
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,126
That hash is money,
  man.

405
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,728
Thank you.
What's in it?

406
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,331
Onions, garlic,
   green pepper, parsley,

407
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:24,502
just a tiny hint
    of horseradish.

408
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,504
This might be a dive,
but you really make --

409
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,273
I love food.
   I go home from here.

410
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,674
I stop
   at the grocery store,

411
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,476
see what looks good,
    and plan a dinner.

412
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,977
And as for
  that dive thing...

413
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,381
We're sort of a dump
   aspiring to be a dive.

414
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:40,218
...maybe, but in 2004,
 this place actually received

415
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,554
a James Beard Award
  as an American classic.

416
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:45,123
I haven't worn this since
 I tried to go through security.

417
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,792
You know, the James Beard Award,
   that does help the --

418
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,761
From the dump to the dive,
    that's a help.

419
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:51,462
And this is
your business partner?

420
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,331
Yes, that's my partner,
    James Brandes.

421
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,633
Look at you guys.
You guys look like
a couple Hollywood producers.

422
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,268
And it all started
    with the commitment

423
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,404
to make everything ourselves,
   which started with Al.

424
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,873
And we continued.
 So, who was Al?

425
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:05,977
Al's a terrific gentleman
 who started this place in 1950.

426
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,979
He retired in '74.

427
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,981
Doug's been here since '79.

428
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,784
And the setup hasn't changed
 in years -- grill up-front...

429
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:15,854
Got half an eggs benny
   and a whosy and a what.

430
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,356
...omelettes and scrambles
 in back by the water heater.

431
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,993
I need a three-egg huevos
     on an oval.
You need what?

432
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:25,363
Three-egg huevos
     on an oval.

433
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,831
I'm gonna get you
  at Radioshack --

434
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,366
$20, intercom system.

435
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,835
Money.
     What do I need
      that for?

436
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:33,538
And somehow, they really do
 turn out some great food.

437
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,907
Tell me about the José.

438
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:39,811
The José was named after a guy
  who used to eat in here.

439
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:41,646
His name was George?
    His name was José.

440
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,348
Get out.
  No, I'm not kidding you.

441
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,682
What's in a José?

442
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:47,785
Two poached eggs, salsa,
   and cheddar cheese.

443
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,954
Put down two hash browns.

444
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,823
Pour some oil
     on them.

445
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:52,924
On the potatoes.

446
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,592
Yeah, nothing like
a little cholesterol.

447
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,527
That's not cholesterol.
   That's soybean oil.

448
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,962
There you go.
 I blew that.

449
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,364
No, no,
    this is a beauty.

450
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,366
This is where
 the magic happens.

451
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:03,234
This is the magic,
     see?

452
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,736
They don't know
     this part.

453
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,038
Yeah, not that the guys
are right behind us.

454
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,073
But that doesn't matter.
      I know.
  But that doesn't matter.

455
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,208
Okay,
  then the cheddar cheese.

456
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,876
Look at that!
 You know how much this costs?

457
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,878
It's $12 each.

458
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,214
No,
 get out of here.

459
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:17,482
Come on, dude.

460
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,150
I mean, $5.25?

461
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:21,486
Yeah.
 Get $7, $8 out of these two.

462
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,922
Price just went up.
    They're students.

463
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,190
Doug says he doesn't like
  to raise prices.

464
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,326
Of course, he doesn't like
 to paint the place, either.

465
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,661
Or throw anything out.

466
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,596
Or change much of anything.

467
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:32,797
No credit cards here.

468
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,766
Instead,
 they've got payment books.

469
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,768
Books back
    from the '60s.

470
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,002
Here's how it works --

471
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,671
You put some cash
  on your account.

472
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:40,905
Hey, Doug.
  You take checks?

473
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:42,473
Yeah, even bad ones.

474
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:45,310
Says here you started
with 41. 33 from your old book.

475
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:48,179
And they keep track
 as you eat backwards to zero.

476
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,014
You eat the same thing
every time, don't you?

477
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:53,284
'Cause it's $4.81, $4.81.

478
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,087
Oh, here's Maggie
with some friends -- 19.50.

479
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,122
That's okay?
    That's okay, yeah.

480
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,224
Cool if I put my breakfast
  on here?
      Oh, yeah.

481
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,726
Where else
do you eat breakfast?

482
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,728
This is the only place.
How about you?

483
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,196
Actually, yeah,
    the only place.

484
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:06,764
I make it at home,
    or I come here.

485
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:09,300
To a dive...
     Everybody else
   move all the way down.

486
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,736
Covered over a former alley
 between two other buildings...

487
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,037
Some
   of the short blues...

488
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,472
...where the crowd backs up
  waiting for a seat...

489
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,075
I got a stack
    and sausage up.

490
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,644
and a self-trained cook
 keeps the tradition alive,

491
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,379
at least until closing time.

492
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:22,847
What time are you guys
 gonna close today?

493
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,615
1:00 P.M.
 1:00 P.M.

494
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,851
Somebody pick up
    these pancakes.

495
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,253
So here I am
  at beautiful Mandeville

496
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:31,923
on the north shore
  of Lake Pontchartrain,

497
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:35,727
Just a quick 25-mile jog across
 the causeway from New Orleans,

498
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:38,062
to check out
 a joint that's got a name

499
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,565
that's as unique
 as the chef who owns it.

500
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,101
This is
 Louie and The Redhead Lady.

501
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:45,136
I can dance.
  And this is Louie.

502
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,105
Here we go.
 Voodoo Benedict.

503
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,306
Charles, how you doing?

504
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:50,375
And this is the redhead lady...

505
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,510
So he has his
  own special pancakes.

506
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,811
Love Ginger and Louie.

507
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,580
...New Orleans natives
  Chef Louie Finnan...

508
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:56,681
Coming around.

509
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,083
...and his wife Ginger.
   Okay. I will.

510
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,085
You know he's back there
 slaving in the kitchen.

511
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,120
The owners really make it,

512
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:03,688
as well as the food
  and the flavors.

513
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,256
Red beans and rice.

514
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,325
But this is
   real-deal Louisiana.
Yes, this is good as it gets.

515
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,659
I've been
in the restaurant business

516
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,928
for almost 40 years.

517
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,130
And he starts serving

518
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,831
Louisiana favorites
  bright and early.

519
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,333
This is our breakfast place,

520
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:16,768
and Louie fixes us
 whatever we want.

521
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,403
Banana foster pancakes.

522
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:19,804
Come here on Sundays.

523
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,372
It's the best breakfast.

524
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,274
I've got a Grillades and Grits.

525
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,843
Grits and Grillades, it's
actually a real patty and grits.

526
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:28,212
It's a typical
  Louisiana breakfast.

527
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,248
It's comfort food,
  and it's wonderful.

528
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,783
I'm a grit-eating fool.

529
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:34,786
We're starting with grits.
A little water,
butter, salt.

530
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,155
Do you bring the water to
a simmer and then add the grits?
Yes.

531
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,389
So we let these work.

532
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,024
And now, we're gonna start
   working on the veal.

533
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,894
So just a nice little
    tenderizing.

534
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,562
Then what he said...

535
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,901
All day long,
   if you want some more.

536
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:53,738
Okay, let's do a little flour,
a little black pepper.

537
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,640
Precise measurement.
Exactly.

538
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,775
Italian dressing mix,
  salt.

539
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,044
You know, in New Orleans,
you never leave anything alone.

540
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,746
That's right.
We've got to season
 everything.

541
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,814
So, there's
    our little dredge.

542
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:04,749
Little butter-flavored oil.

543
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,884
To the black iron skillet,
put a little seasoning.

544
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,052
Steak seasoning?
 Yes.

545
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,121
Now, we're gonna start
  our sauce.

546
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:11,889
A little
buttery-flavored oil.

547
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,024
some julienne onions.

548
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:14,892
Okay, thin-sliced,
    white onion.
Yes, sir.

549
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,527
Now, we're gonna add
 a little bit of --

550
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,995
Beef stock
   that you make in house.

551
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,997
Let that sit there
 and cook down with those onions

552
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,299
so it reduces
     real nice.

553
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:23,434
Garlic.
See, I ain't afraid
of the garlic.

554
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,602
Don't be.

555
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,504
Pickled pepper salt.
 Oh, I love pickled pepper --

556
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,339
kind of
   a vinegary steak sauce.

557
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:29,407
A little Sherry.

558
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,209
So, a real nice,
    traditional,

559
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,877
old steak sauce
    we're making here.
 Absolutely.

560
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,979
Now, make a little roux
 to thicken it --

561
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:37,548
some flour
and some melted butter.

562
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,883
Whisk that.

563
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,451
Sticks right on there.

564
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,620
That sauce is gonna be
    out of bounds.

565
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,022
Putting the veal
into the grillade gravy.

566
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,758
Now, we're gonna start to absorb
  some of that great au-jus

567
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,861
into the crust
    of the veal cutlet.

568
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:50,895
Right.
    Nice, tight grits.

569
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,330
Yes, sir.

570
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:53,431
Don't hold back.

571
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,266
Oh, you want some more?
  Don't hold back on me.

572
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,602
Matter of fact,
    just fill that up.

573
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,103
What?

574
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:09,013
We're talking huge flavor --
    huge flavor.

575
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:11,549
This is a breakfast
  that eats like a dinner.

576
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,851
Oh, I don't even
   want to talk about it.

577
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:16,020
Grits and grillades.
One of my favorite dishes.

578
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,722
The veal is nice and tender.

579
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:18,723
Wonderful sauce.

580
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,158
It hits the spot every time.

581
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,829
Brother, I got
   to tell you something.

582
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,330
This is an experience
    and then some.

583
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,665
You got to come meet
     this guy.

584
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,834
It is off...
 The hook.

585
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,035
Hey!

586
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:33,070
Up next on this
 full hour of breakfast...

587
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:35,439
Mmm.
 ...in Salt Lake City, Utah...

588
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,408
You've only made close
  to 3 million biscuits.

589
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,810
...I'm throwing down
  a culinary challenge.

590
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,480
I could blindfold you,
and you could make this.

591
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,415
Yes.
We got to do this.

592
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,951
And in
 Barnegat Light, New Jersey...

593
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,620
No spill. No spill.
  Fantastic dismount.

594
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,322
The crowd goes wild.

595
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:54,458
...a chef cooking to the beat
  of his own drum.
   That's money.

596
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:58,829
You know, we find a lot of
 great places here on "Triple D"

597
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,799
'cause one person e-mailed us
 and told us to check it out --

598
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,267
or maybe two or three people.

599
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,236
And then,
 you get a place like this --

600
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,804
right outside of Salt Lake City,

601
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:09,140
a 79-year-old diner
   called Ruth's.

602
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,142
Now this is
  such a local legend,

603
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:13,411
it seems like we heard
   from everybody.

604
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:16,981
Who sent me the e-mail
  about coming to Ruth's?

605
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:20,184
All of you hit send
  that the same time?

606
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,853
Who was first?

607
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,423
Why'd you send me
     the e-mail?
Because it's a fabulous place.

608
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:27,358
Where are you gonna find
this kind of history?

609
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,393
With all kinds
  of diner classics.

610
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,862
I have meatloaf,
  chicken-fried steak.

611
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,598
I moved out here
to go to college in '95.

612
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,433
Biscuits were good then.
They're just as good today.

613
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:39,036
Just like the place itself,
 a local favorite since 1930.

614
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,906
Ready to plate it.
   And owners
  Erik and Tracy Nelson

615
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,575
are making sure that when
  folks come to Ruth's...
Can I get your name?

616
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,977
...they get
  what they expect.

617
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:48,613
Biscuit gravy.
    Biscuits and gravy.
    Hey, sign me up.

618
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:50,915
Tastes better
 than my mom used to make.

619
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:51,916
They make them every day.

620
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,884
Actually, just one guy --

621
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:57,188
baker Inez Monreal,
 cranking out thousands a week.

622
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,191
How many years
 you worked here?
      About 16.

623
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:03,160
You've only made close
to 3 million biscuits.

624
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,896
The biscuit-baking
  bad boy.

625
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:07,298
What do you think
 of that name?

626
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,733
All right,
so how do we make a biscuit?

627
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,101
We'll start
   with margarine first.

628
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,869
You've got some flour
     from here.

629
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,938
Wrong day to wear black.
     Baking powder.

630
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,039
About that much.

631
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,575
About that much,
and about that much?

632
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,110
Just 'cause you made
 3 million --

633
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,479
3 million biscuits,
I can measure by hand.

634
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:24,181
Add some salt,
    and sugar, eggs.

635
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:26,417
That's a lot of eggs.
     And buttermilk.

636
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:27,451
Water.

637
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,587
On slow,
 And you stop it.

638
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,455
That's it?
 Now, we can add
 more water.

639
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,658
Okay, you just got to do it
     by feel.

640
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,959
So let me ask you this --

641
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,728
Do you think
I could blindfold you

642
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,297
and you could make this?
       Yes.

643
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,498
We got to do this.

644
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,333
There you go.
      Ready.

645
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:43,467
Okay, get started.

646
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,404
He's got the margarine.

647
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:48,472
He knows
 where his bins are.

648
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,640
It's not bad.

649
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,108
He found the salt.

650
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,210
Now we're gonna
  get sugar.

651
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:55,446
He's picking up speed
     as he goes.

652
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:57,281
Now we'll put the eggs...
     There we go.

653
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:59,016
...with the buttermilk.

654
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:00,084
Water.

655
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:01,252
This is amazing.

656
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:03,554
And we'll just let it mix.

657
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:04,555
I made it.

658
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:06,057
You are the blindfolded,

659
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,492
biscuit-baking bad boy,
  right here.

660
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:09,493
Yeah.

661
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,228
A little bit more flour
     on top.

662
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,697
So you can work with it.

663
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:14,131
You get
   your biscuit cutter.

664
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,599
Oh, we're doing it now.

665
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:18,636
It's okay.
    Don't be afraid.

666
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:20,037
You do each one of them
  like this?

667
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,939
Just like that.
He's like a machine.

668
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,844
There's got to be
 a secret button.

669
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,713
So these go
 in the oven now?

670
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:31,215
300 degrees, 35, 40 minutes

671
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,783
till they get a nice brown
  on top.

672
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,485
We gonna make
 some of our gravy.

673
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:35,820
We start with the oil,

674
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:38,889
diced onions, garlic,
 pork sausage.

675
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,825
So we got it
    cooked down --

676
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:42,126
Like that's not gonna be
    great gravy.

677
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:43,260
We add the black pepper,

678
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:44,962
salt, dry basil.

679
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:47,231
And then we just sautéed them
    a little bit.

680
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,133
And then a little flour
 to make the roux.

681
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:50,534
Heavy cream and milk.

682
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,303
Let it sit there and simmer
 for a little bit.

683
00:22:52,305 --> 00:22:54,905
A little hot sauce --
That's what I'm talking about.

684
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,508
There's your
 biscuits and gravy.
       Wow.

685
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,909
It's like
    mound o' biscuit.

686
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:01,011
Mmm.
    That's great.

687
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:03,180
The biscuits
  are really nice and light.

688
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:05,082
The gravy's got
  a little bit of spice to it

689
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:06,650
from the pepper
    and the hot sauce.

690
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:09,320
Mmm. Nice job, man.
     Excellent.

691
00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:11,355
The gravy is awesome.

692
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:12,757
The biscuits are to-die-for.

693
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,024
These are the best, by far.

694
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,060
The biscuits and gravy
 is what I fell in love with.

695
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,229
My aunt had been coming here
  for 30-something years,

696
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,030
and I'm keeping
   the tradition going.

697
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:21,966
- One biscuit at a time.
- Exactly.

698
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:23,567
You hear that a lot
   around here.

699
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,102
Generations of my family
  have been coming here.

700
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:26,904
It's definitely a landmark
  in Salt Lake City.

701
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,707
It's a throwback to the '30s.

702
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,809
Order up.
 And to old-time cooking.

703
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:33,177
Mmm.

704
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,412
It doesn't matter what you get
  here. It's great.

705
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,613
Expect to be wowed.

706
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:37,715
You got to dig it, man.
 Great history to this place.

707
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:39,717
I love it.
  She sent the e-mail?

708
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:40,684
It's a great place.

709
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:41,952
This is the place to be.
 Yeah.

710
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:44,488
I knew your car would look great
  in front of this place.

711
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,323
So now you're gaming
for a ride right now.

712
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:48,692
There you go.
I like the way she rolls.

713
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:50,027
Our next breakfast stop

714
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,997
is at the South Jersey Shore
  on Long Beach Island.

715
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:54,498
Now the locals around here know

716
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,034
that when the rain starts
 coming in from the Atlantic,

717
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:59,437
well, they start coming
 into Mustache Bill's diner

718
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,872
for hot coffee
 and some homemade breakfast.

719
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:03,541
Would you like
 some more coffee?
     Might as well.

720
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:05,376
Coffee?
 Yeah.

721
00:24:05,378 --> 00:24:08,012
Just like you to call me "Flo,"
 if you don't mind.

722
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:09,246
Want some more coffee,
  ma'am?

723
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:10,981
Classic diner.
 Classic New Jersey diner.

724
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:13,517
There's always somebody in here
 that you know, you can talk to.

725
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,954
It's like going to your
 family dining room table.

726
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,390
For homestyle
  breakfast favorites...

727
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:21,091
It's great diner food.
  I'm a diner freak.

728
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:22,760
It's every basic,

729
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:26,297
but it's every basic done
  the best it can be done.

730
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,767
By Mustache Bill himself,
   Bill Smith...
      Order up.

731
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:30,968
Who's been doing it all his way,

732
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,404
including
 the paper towel headbands...

733
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:36,574
It's hot back here.
 ...for the last 35 years.

734
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:38,442
I worked here as a kid
    when I was 14.

735
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:39,877
In this one?
     In this diner.

736
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,679
After going off to college,

737
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:44,181
he came back
 and bought the place in 1972.

738
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,350
Is it half job, half hobby?

739
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:48,586
Half job, half love.

740
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:51,856
And totally what a Jersey diner
  is supposed to be.

741
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:55,025
Really great, basic
 American breakfast food.

742
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,227
Chipped Beef.

743
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:58,429
Like chipped beef
  made fresh every day.

744
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:00,798
It's a classic.
    I've been eating it
    since I was a kid.

745
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,633
It's not a jerky.

746
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:04,668
It's not quite as dry as the
beef you use to make jerky.

747
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,803
It's like wet jerky.
 Right.

748
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:08,806
Put it right on top,
and I press it flat.

749
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:11,208
We're getting real close
to incorporating this flour.

750
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,443
So we're gonna make
     a roux.

751
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:14,979
There we go.
And into the hot milk.

752
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:16,280
No spill. No spill.

753
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:17,815
Fantastic dismount.

754
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:19,016
The crowd goes wild.

755
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,684
Three pats of butter.

756
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,253
White pepper.
White pepper.

757
00:25:22,255 --> 00:25:24,154
That's it?
    So, rye toast.

758
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:25,456
And there it is.

759
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,294
That's money.

760
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:33,230
The rye bread
is completely important.

761
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:35,165
Right.
 Nice job, man.

762
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,935
Now at a classic diner,
 you're gonna get pancakes.

763
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:39,436
I'm a pancake maniac.

764
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:42,273
Blueberry, strawberry,
  banana walnut...

765
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:44,508
Chocolate chip pancakes.
      And a soda.

766
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,510
Yes.
  That's the only way to go.

767
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,746
...you can even
  get them done freehand.

768
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:50,915
Look at that.

769
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,616
What is that?

770
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:57,821
That's a little
something different.

771
00:25:57,823 --> 00:25:59,990
If you were looking
   from inside my head,

772
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:04,161
you'd see that looks like
  a mind from my perspective.

773
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:05,429
There we go.

774
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,035
That is crazy.

775
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:13,370
Look at that.

776
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,840
Scary, very scary.

777
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:20,477
And Bill's pancake weirdness
 doesn't stop with my face.

778
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:22,246
Check out the Cyclops.

779
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,948
It is a little bit
 of a strange combination

780
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,083
to have the egg
 in the middle of the pancake,

781
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,718
but somehow,
  Bill makes it works.

782
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,321
Okay.

783
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:32,056
It's time
for the blueberries now.

784
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:34,291
Are we ready?
       Yeah.

785
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:35,993
Oh, you didn't break
     the yolk?

786
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:38,596
No, we don't serve them
 with broken yolks.
       Oh.

787
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:40,097
Look at that.

788
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,535
That's up there in some
of the best pancake I've had.

789
00:26:44,537 --> 00:26:45,970
That's what I want
     to hear.

790
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:47,638
It's a great place.
Everything's delicious.

791
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,672
Probably the best diner

792
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,274
that I've ever been to
   in my life.

793
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:54,178
Coming up
 in Long Beach, California...

794
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,479
Energizer waffle bunny.

795
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:58,816
...the seaside spot
 making the crowds go wild.

796
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:01,218
This is bananas,
  and bananas is good.

797
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,754
Then we're cruising up
  to Los Angeles...

798
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:05,255
I am blown away.

799
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:07,191
...for a savory spin
   on donuts.

800
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:08,826
That could be dangerous.

801
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:10,928
You should limit people
  to how many of those
   they can have.

802
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,633
I'm cruising in --

803
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,234
well, actually,
  let me correct myself.

804
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:19,236
I'm boating into a place called
  Schooner or Later.

805
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:21,905
Now a schooner can be
  a sailing vessel,

806
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,907
or it can be a large,
  ice-cold chalice

807
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:25,476
of fermented hops.

808
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,511
But in my world,
  Schooner or Later

809
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:30,047
is an off-the-hook eatery
 in Long Beach, California.

810
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:31,982
Thank you.

811
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,851
Beautiful scenery,
   great food.

812
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:36,920
Getting crazy everywhere.
   Order of onion rings?

813
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:38,555
It's a big experience...

814
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:40,924
I wondered where
 I had parked my four boats.

815
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,160
It's wonderful --
 sit outside, sit by the boats.

816
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,461
...with big food...

817
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:46,664
You have like six or seven
  friends that are coming?

818
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:47,965
I'll down that
 in two minutes.

819
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:48,966
No.
  Yeah.

820
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:50,334
There you go.

821
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:51,969
...a big weekend hangout...
    It's Sunday Funday.

822
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:53,303
We get to hang out
   with all our friends.

823
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,639
...with a big line of fans

824
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:58,575
who insist
  it's worth the wait.

825
00:27:58,577 --> 00:27:59,843
We're gonna wait
    for an hour.
Two hours.

826
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:02,813
Oh, it's so worth it.
Mmm.

827
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:03,881
Fabulous.

828
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:06,050
An avocado,
  some hollandaise sauce.

829
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:07,518
Awesome.

830
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,553
- And an awesome tradition.
- Everything okay?

831
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:11,522
I was coming in here
 and eating with my father.

832
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:13,057
Denny Lund
  and his sister, Denise,

833
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:14,425
grew up coming here

834
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:16,593
then bought the place
 from the original owner,

835
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,128
a guy named Schultzie,

836
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,164
whose signature item
  is still on the menu.

837
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,166
And that is
  the Schultzie's Mess.

838
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:24,234
We inherited it from him.

839
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:26,603
I ordered the Mess.

840
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:28,605
Everything you want
   in breakfast,

841
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:30,874
thrown on a plate,
  just ready to roll.

842
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,409
Head chef Tony Galope

843
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,611
has been making the Mess
   for 20 years.

844
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:36,880
So how many, do you think, is
the most you served in one day?

845
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,649
50, 60 sometimes.

846
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:41,452
In one day?
     In one day.

847
00:28:41,454 --> 00:28:42,753
Start with potatoes.

848
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:47,558
This is the mix of bell pepper,
    ham, and onion.

849
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,326
And then we put two eggs.

850
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:51,028
Mix those together.

851
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,296
Put a little bit
 of crust on it.

852
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:55,065
Then I put cheddar cheese
     on the top.

853
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,233
Cover it.

854
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,102
That steams it a little bit
and melts the cheese.

855
00:28:58,104 --> 00:28:59,603
Yeah,
   it melted the cheese.
Got it.

856
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,004
Beautiful.

857
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:02,606
Couple pieces of toast.
Couple of toast.

858
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:03,907
And then it's all done.
     And that's it.

859
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:06,777
Mmm.

860
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,479
Oh, that is good stuff.

861
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:10,748
See, I like this part.
Oh, crunchy part.

862
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,317
The onions and the pepper
    still have crunch.

863
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,185
They're cooked and they're hot,
    and they're warm,

864
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:16,987
but they've still got
  a little crunch in them.

865
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:19,490
That's as good
    as they come.

866
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:21,759
I see why
   they call it the Mess.

867
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:23,227
I could eat hers
  and mine together.

868
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:25,195
It's a mess, but it's good.

869
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:27,131
And they're making
  more than a mess here.

870
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:29,032
Eggs Benedict -- the best ever.

871
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:30,968
Their
crab omelette's fabulous.

872
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,136
The crab omelette.

873
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:33,270
The Italian omelette

874
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:36,406
with marinara sauce
  and the sausage --

875
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:38,275
really good.
They love a show.

876
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,377
You see them put an omelette
 on the plate over there.

877
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,780
It folds over,
  and it's steamy.

878
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,615
And it's filled with all sorts
 of different good things.

879
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:48,051
And it's all
  worth traveling for.

880
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,020
You should know we drove
all the way from Kansas

881
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:51,355
to come to Schooner's.

882
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:53,357
All the way from Kansas.

883
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,793
And I come from Oregon,
 and when I come down here,

884
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,594
I always come
  to Schooner or Later.

885
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:59,029
I'm from
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

886
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:01,165
From Boynton Beach,
   Florida.
   Lake Worth, Florida.

887
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,399
And you're from...
     I'm the local.

888
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,301
The Italian omelette.
The crab omelette.

889
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,803
And the Mess.

890
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,471
Between the visitors
  and the regulars,

891
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:10,808
they can serve 1,000 people
  on an average Sunday.

892
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:14,411
And a whole lot of them
  are going for this.

893
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:16,313
I ordered a Belgian waffle

894
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,582
with bananas, strawberries,
  and blueberries.

895
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:19,817
It's very good.

896
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,152
We just keep going
   and going and going.

897
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,654
Sometimes we got five --

898
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,255
You're like
the energizer waffle bunny.

899
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,257
When the timer
    screams "bring,"

900
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,259
and then it's done.
What does the timer do?

901
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:31,261
"Bring!"
How? I don't understand.

902
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:33,630
Does it go "bring"?

903
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:34,832
A watched waffle --

904
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:36,433
There you go.
    Just one ding.

905
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:37,634
Oh, look at that.

906
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:40,370
It's got a banana and strawberry
    and blueberries.

907
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:41,805
Whipped cream
     on the top.

908
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,442
Mmm.
That's a great waffle.

909
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:49,046
How nice the fresh blueberry
    and everything.

910
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:50,647
What did you think
    of the waffle?

911
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:52,049
It was very good,
  very good.

912
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:53,851
Very good, big?
     Big waffle?
 Yeah.

913
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,419
It's all big.

914
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:58,555
And more than that,
 it's real, fresh-cooked,

915
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:00,057
what you want,
  the way you want it.

916
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:02,426
Spinach and something.
Egg whites.

917
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:03,794
Even as busy
  as Schooner or Later is,

918
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:05,229
they seem like
   they do the egg whites,

919
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:06,663
do the egg white
     omelettes.
 Always.

920
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:08,332
Whatever you ask.
And they have
great spinach.

921
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:09,867
Every Sunday.
   Don't miss it.

922
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:12,169
Come down to the shore,
  have a little Mess.

923
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:13,370
It kind of cures everything.

924
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,538
I love this little place.

925
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,739
If I won the lottery tomorrow,

926
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:17,341
I wouldn't change
  a thing about this.

927
00:31:17,343 --> 00:31:18,742
Everything all right?

928
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:21,511
It's a piece of us,
  and we truly enjoy it.

929
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:23,981
It's not just pretending.

930
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:25,782
It's all about
 atmosphere here -- very fun.

931
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,718
But I think we've just kind of,

932
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,720
over time,
  become an institution.

933
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:31,622
They just come here
    for the day.

934
00:31:31,624 --> 00:31:32,956
They don't make
    any other plans.

935
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:34,358
They say,
  "What are we doing today?

936
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,893
We're going to Schooner."
    And that's it.

937
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:38,395
This is bananas,
  and bananas is good.

938
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,297
Hey, banana.

939
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:42,833
I'm here in the historic core
   of Los Angeles

940
00:31:42,835 --> 00:31:44,301
by Fifth and Main,

941
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:46,136
an area they used to call
   "The Nickel."

942
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:47,604
Now, I'm gonna visit a place

943
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:49,439
that's doing
  some diner favorites

944
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:51,475
but with, you know,
  California flair.

945
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:54,011
It's a kind of place
 you can really find yourself.

946
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:56,079
Time to check out Nickel Diner.

947
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,315
Tofu Scramble.
This is one-of-a-kind.

948
00:31:58,317 --> 00:32:01,285
Hangover Helper.
   This is one-of-a-kind
   no matter where you go.

949
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:03,620
You think?
  Meringue on mannequins?

950
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,656
Upside down floor lamps.
        No.

951
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:07,557
Donuts smothered in bacon?

952
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,859
A lovely surprise.

953
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:10,594
Donut with bacon?

954
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:11,795
Everybody's looking
 for a surprise.

955
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:13,397
And everybody wants
 a little journey.

956
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:15,666
Especially with Monica May's
  doing the driving.

957
00:32:15,668 --> 00:32:16,733
Catfish is up.

958
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:18,835
After 17 years in the food biz,

959
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:20,504
she decided
  to open her own joint

960
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:22,005
with her pal
  Kristen Trattner.

961
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:23,273
The dessert's
    all made here.

962
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,741
We found this place.

963
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,476
It was
 an abandoned restaurant.

964
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:29,546
It looks like it's
    from circa 1940.
    It is.

965
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:31,415
And now, they're making
   diner food...

966
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:32,916
This is tofu.
   ...their way.

967
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:34,184
S'mac and cheese?

968
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,786
Mac and cheese
with a little bit of spice.

969
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,421
Pulled pork hash
   with the main.

970
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:39,623
Their desserts are great.
     All made here,
     all made fresh.

971
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,458
And all made
 by real-deal pastry chef,

972
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,993
Sharlena Fong.

973
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:44,861
You make your own
 handmade Pop-tart.

974
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:46,930
You make
a Ding-Dong-like dessert.

975
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:48,899
And get a load of this one.

976
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:51,468
Bacon donuts!
  Bacon always makes
  everything better.

977
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,370
Isn't it weird when
you bite into donut texture

978
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:54,671
and then you get
crunchy bacon texture?

979
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:56,173
I guess
    we'll have to see.

980
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:58,942
First, we start off
    with some AP flour.
All-purpose flour.

981
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,310
Dry yeast.
       Yes.

982
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,778
Add our eggs.

983
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,380
The Rocky Balboa Gatorade.

984
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:06,249
Some whole milk,
   and give that a stir.

985
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:08,051
This is also
    all-purpose flour.

986
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:11,088
This allows yeast
    to activate.

987
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,422
Cracks will form
    in the flour.

988
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:13,957
And this way,
  I know it's ready to go.

989
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,192
That's from the yeast?
       Yes.

990
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:17,427
Oh, okay, see,
this is why I don't bake.

991
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:18,762
Now, what happens?

992
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:20,964
We add flour, salt,
    and sugar mixture.

993
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,299
And now...
       Eggs.

994
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:23,633
Now we have our hook.
Captain.

995
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,836
Turn this on
    for 15 minutes.

996
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:27,771
Okay, are we ready
 to make donuts?

997
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:29,973
Well, now we have to add
  room-temperature butter.

998
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:31,742
Six more minutes.

999
00:33:31,744 --> 00:33:33,844
We're gonna let it rise
    for two hours,

1000
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:35,746
and then
  we let it sit over night.

1001
00:33:35,748 --> 00:33:38,115
I know. It's long.
 For a donut?

1002
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:40,784
So this has rested
  overnight.

1003
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:42,786
We add a little more flour.
    Give me that.

1004
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:44,921
I'll show you.

1005
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:47,090
A little bit more, yeah.

1006
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:51,261
And now, we're get
   to roll this thing out.

1007
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,296
Smells good.
     Now we're gonna
     cut out donuts.

1008
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:55,098
We can cut out
    the hole after,

1009
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,666
and then that's what
   the small cutter's for.

1010
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,135
Oh.

1011
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:00,070
So we continue
 to punch these out,

1012
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:01,238
take the holes
 out of them,

1013
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,639
let them rise,
and then we're gonna fry them?

1014
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:03,640
Right.
How hot's the oil?

1015
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:05,142
380.
  380. Dig it.

1016
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:06,610
The bad boys are fried up.

1017
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:08,645
Our glaze is
with the confectioner's sugar

1018
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:10,080
and the maple syrup.

1019
00:34:10,082 --> 00:34:11,481
The bacon --
just regular, old bacon

1020
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:13,316
that we cooked down
 and chopped up.

1021
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:14,785
Still a little warm.

1022
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:16,787
All right, we may be able
 to work with that.

1023
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:19,122
So we're just gonna take
   the donut, dip, dip,

1024
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:20,724
and then glaze
   the whole side of it.

1025
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:21,958
And then
   we dip it in the bacon.

1026
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,126
And that's it.

1027
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:26,997
Mmm.

1028
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:28,365
Wow.
 That's great.

1029
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:30,300
That could be dangerous.

1030
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:32,569
You should limit people to
how many of those they can have.

1031
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,970
It's as good
  as you would expect.

1032
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:35,739
People are happy,
 and that's the best part.

1033
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,407
Brilliance.
    It's comfort food.

1034
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,409
Bacon burger.
    I got to tell you.

1035
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,178
I am blown away.

1036
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,412
Thank you.
 Thank you.

1037
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,781
Up next,
 in Santa Rosa, California...

1038
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:48,351
Nothing wrong with that.
...an amazing program serving up
  the bomb breakfast...

1039
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:49,619
Let's go make
   some huevos rancheros.

1040
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:52,389
...while helping the community
  at the same time.

1041
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:54,057
Watch out for this guy, huh?
 15 years old.

1042
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:58,695
So here I am

1043
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:01,331
in Santa Rosa, California --
   my home town.

1044
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,500
Now my first restaurant,
  Johnny Garlic's,

1045
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:05,402
is just about a half mile
   that way.

1046
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:07,637
Today is a very special
  "Triple D" for me,

1047
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,539
'cause I'm getting
  to visit a place

1048
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,708
where the chef was once
  the chef educator

1049
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,610
at a juvenile detention center.

1050
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,979
She's now opened
 her own local restaurant,

1051
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:18,048
where she's giving
  underserved youth

1052
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,117
an opportunity
  to get the experience

1053
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,586
and education
  in the restaurant biz.

1054
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:25,055
It is my privilege
  to introduce you

1055
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:27,891
to WOW -- Worth Our Weight.

1056
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:29,059
Pick up, huevos rancheros.

1057
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:31,027
The kids' cooking is amazing.

1058
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:33,096
Scrambled eggs
 with cream cheese and lox.

1059
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:34,598
This is my mom, Penny,
  and my dad, Jim.

1060
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,000
They're the ones that turned me
  on to this joint.

1061
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:39,536
Guy, this is about the best
   brunch I've ever had.

1062
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:40,570
And the price?

1063
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:42,472
Polenta and chicken sausage.

1064
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,607
Well, that's up to you.

1065
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:46,543
People pay what they feel
  that it's worth.

1066
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:48,278
And everyone's a volunteer,

1067
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,779
from founder
  Evelyn Cheatham...

1068
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:50,780
I do it because I love it.

1069
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:51,915
...right down to some ambitious,

1070
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:54,784
food-loving
  culinary apprentices.

1071
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:57,053
Evelyn's the chef.
   You're the sous chef.
 Right.

1072
00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:59,990
You cooked my breakfast
   for me two years ago.

1073
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:01,691
Oh, still talk
     about that.

1074
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:04,327
And Nick Wilkinson's
 still wowing the brunch crowd.

1075
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,595
Order up.
  Huevos rancheros.

1076
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:07,697
Huevos rancheros, it doesn't get
much better than that.

1077
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:10,467
Huge, fresh pulled pork --
  delicious.

1078
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:12,269
Okay, pork butt,
    how we doing it?

1079
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:14,137
We're gonna give it a rub
with some salt and pepper.

1080
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:15,605
Gonna leave it fat up?
 Yup.

1081
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,908
So as the fat cooks off,
   it renders down across
    the sides.

1082
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,043
We're gonna roast it at 500,
 about 45 minutes.

1083
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:21,244
Okay, now what?

1084
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:23,013
We're gonna add
   some onions, carrots...

1085
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,214
Some sweetness
 from the carrots.

1086
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:25,415
...and some
    chipotle peppers.

1087
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:27,050
Dried jalapeños.
  Nice.

1088
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:28,919
And now some water
 almost to the top of the meat,

1089
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:30,153
but you want
   a little bit showing.

1090
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:31,755
Cook this uncovered?
       Yup.

1091
00:36:31,757 --> 00:36:34,324
200 --about eight hours.
Okay,
What are we onto know?

1092
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:35,859
We're making
 a pico de gallo.

1093
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,794
First, we're gonna chop up
  some onion.

1094
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:39,896
Good knife skills,
     my friend.
And now you go your tomato.

1095
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:43,233
So, now, the jalapeños,
 you gonna give those a mince?
Yup.

1096
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:45,035
Want to get those nice and fine
    so you don't have

1097
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,670
these big nuggets of fire
    sitting in there.

1098
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:47,904
And we put a little cilantro
  in there.

1099
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:49,306
Oh, this just
   gets better with time

1100
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:50,407
when you let this
     set up.

1101
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:51,875
A little salt and pepper.
       Okay.

1102
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,476
Some lime juice.
  Stir it up.

1103
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:54,778
So do you
    let this set up

1104
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,912
for a few hours
   before you serve it?

1105
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:58,215
Yeah, usually overnight
 or a couple hours.

1106
00:36:58,217 --> 00:36:59,950
Nothing wrong with that.

1107
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:02,252
Let's go make some
    huevos rancheros.
Let's do it.

1108
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:04,854
So the pork is done.

1109
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,890
The final step of that
was it got the tomatoes?

1110
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,124
Yeah, chopped tomatoes.

1111
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:09,659
Pico de gallo is made.
 Where we at?

1112
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:10,961
Three tortillas
    on the grill.

1113
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:12,696
The beans,
    we soak overnight.

1114
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:15,332
Add carrots, onion, a little bit
  of the pico de gallo juice

1115
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:17,334
and then let it simmer
    about an hour.

1116
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,835
We'll strain them off,
    a little salt,

1117
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:20,437
and then just let
   that sit there warming.

1118
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:21,972
Put a little cheddar
   on these tortillas.

1119
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:23,240
Some Monterey Jack
     on it.

1120
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:24,741
Big seller here,
the huevos rancheros?

1121
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,477
Yeah, the huevos are.
"Huevos" being the eggs.

1122
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:29,212
A little olive oil,
    a little butter,

1123
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:30,814
and now the egg.

1124
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:32,749
Add some cheddar cheese,
   a little bit of Jack.

1125
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:33,850
Give it a flip.
 Roll it.

1126
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,285
Let that cheese melt up
   and take that off.

1127
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:37,754
Tortilla's over here.
    Put the beans on.
 Nice.

1128
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,389
Is this one serving?
      Yes, sir.

1129
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:41,091
Now the egg,
  pulled pork on the side.

1130
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:42,492
Something nice like that.

1131
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:44,828
Put a little bit
   of our pico de gallo.
Pico de me-o.

1132
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,397
And just a little bit
 of cilantro leaf for garnish.

1133
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:49,432
I got to try this first.

1134
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,001
Mmm.
 Nicely seasoned.

1135
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:52,669
A little bit of heat
from that chipotle,

1136
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:54,070
some of that pico de gallo.

1137
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:56,640
Oh. Here's what I like --
You do the right steps.

1138
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:59,242
You take the time, two days
to make simple breakfast.

1139
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:00,844
You see that
 on a lot of menus

1140
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:02,812
but not handmade
like they do it here.

1141
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:04,481
Wow. Mmm.

1142
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:05,515
Great job, Nick.
      Thank you.

1143
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,350
Here's your
 huevos rancheros.

1144
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:09,352
You looking for something
that's really good? This is it.

1145
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:10,687
It's perfect.

1146
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:12,922
And the place itself,
it's just nourishing
in every way.

1147
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,090
Side of potatoes.

1148
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,558
You think this is
 a good opportunity?

1149
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,460
- It's a great opportunity.
- Huevos for the huevos.

1150
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,461
This is the place to learn.

1151
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,330
I feel like
  I can do more in life.

1152
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:21,898
Bread pudding!
    I love it here.

1153
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,234
It feels great to be here,
  besides the fact

1154
00:38:24,236 --> 00:38:26,670
that it makes your mouth
 and your stomach really happy.

1155
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,071
Here is
    your bagel and lox.

1156
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:29,272
The food is phenomenal.

1157
00:38:29,274 --> 00:38:31,174
The baked goods here
   are amazing.

1158
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:32,542
Your lemon bar.

1159
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:34,244
The scones are so good.

1160
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:36,913
Scratch baked
 by another young culinarian,

1161
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:38,948
15-year-old Jessie Hayes.

1162
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,750
He's a master.
    All right, Jess.

1163
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,118
It's you and me,
     buddy.

1164
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,020
Lead me into this.
These are
actually nectarines.

1165
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:45,722
Nectarine scones?
 Yes.

1166
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:48,525
We're going to start off by
putting the flour in the bowl.

1167
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:50,327
All-purpose flour -- AP?
Yes.

1168
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:52,162
We're going to add
 some baking powder.

1169
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,296
It's a leavening agent.

1170
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:54,431
Yeah,
and some salt for flavor,

1171
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:55,565
sugar, add the butter.

1172
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:57,233
We're just gonna mix this up
 a little bit.

1173
00:38:57,235 --> 00:39:00,870
About that size
is a good size for butter.

1174
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:02,305
We're going to add
 the cream next.

1175
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:03,707
Heavy cream.
   Not sweetened, though?

1176
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:05,942
No. And then finally,
we're gonna add the fruit.

1177
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:07,644
It's just gonna be
   a real light final mix.

1178
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:09,279
Yeah,
just to get the cream

1179
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:10,947
in there
with the dry ingredients.

1180
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:12,916
Looking good.
 That's it.

1181
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:14,551
Now we're ready
 to form our dough.

1182
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:16,286
Sprinkle some flour
 on the bench.

1183
00:39:16,288 --> 00:39:18,822
Just gonna try and not work
 with it too much.

1184
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:19,989
What happens if you do?

1185
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:22,492
The butter will melt,
and it won't bake very well.

1186
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:24,227
I'm going to cut it
  in half.

1187
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:25,695
And then you've got
    your other three

1188
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,397
that are ready to go?
Right.

1189
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:28,665
Lay it out
 on a sheet pan.

1190
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:30,300
Put them in the freezer
 for about an hour.

1191
00:39:30,302 --> 00:39:32,102
All right,
    what do we do next?

1192
00:39:32,104 --> 00:39:33,169
Butter the top,

1193
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:34,771
just kind of lightly sprinkle it
 with sugar.

1194
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:38,174
It's going to give it a nice
brown-golden texture to it.

1195
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:39,642
And then just put them
 in the oven.

1196
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:40,744
What are we
    gonna bake them at?

1197
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:44,147
425 for about
 20 to 25 minutes.

1198
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:45,882
Which one do you like?
I kind of like that one.

1199
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,784
All right,
 then I'm gonna try this one.

1200
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:49,152
Mmm.

1201
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:50,387
Those, I love.

1202
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:51,755
It's totally moist.

1203
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:52,989
Nice crunch to the outside.

1204
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,991
And the fresh fruit
   inside of it.

1205
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:57,160
Getting the nectarine in there,
  so sweet and juicy.

1206
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:00,263
It won't fit.

1207
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:01,464
That was a fantastic scone.

1208
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:02,732
And here's your scone.

1209
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,167
It's really buttery and flaky.

1210
00:40:04,169 --> 00:40:05,802
You can really taste
   the nectarine.

1211
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:07,804
It's excellent.
Watch out
for this guy, huh?

1212
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:09,372
15 years old.

1213
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:11,040
And doing it all
  on his own time.

1214
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:13,143
Bread pudding.
   They all are.

1215
00:40:13,145 --> 00:40:15,044
So I want to do something
   for them.

1216
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:16,112
Let's bring Evelyn

1217
00:40:16,114 --> 00:40:17,881
and the entire crew
  from WOW out here

1218
00:40:17,883 --> 00:40:21,418
so they can see the donation
from the Guy Fieri Foundation --

1219
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,386
the WOW cart.
 Yeah!

1220
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:27,223
So, Evelyn
and all the team here at WOW,

1221
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:28,825
I mean,
the name should be "WOW,"

1222
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:31,194
because I think everybody
walks out here going, "Wow."

1223
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:33,496
Worth Our Weight,
an incredible experience for me,

1224
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:35,698
I think for everybody
that comes here and eats,

1225
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,400
for everybody
that's been watching.

1226
00:40:37,402 --> 00:40:40,103
We wanted to give something
to make you say, "Wow."

1227
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,038
I got an opportunity
in the restaurant business

1228
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,940
starting out selling pretzels
 when I was a kid.

1229
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:47,610
Had a great community around me
that helped me build this cart

1230
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,079
and gave me the opportunity
to get into the business.

1231
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:51,314
Now, it's your turn.

1232
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:55,018
So this is a donation
from me and from my foundation

1233
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,821
for the WOW team
to share all the great things

1234
00:40:57,823 --> 00:41:00,457
that you do at WOW
and to make it portable,

1235
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:03,893
to let Northern California
try those fantastic scones

1236
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:05,562
and all the baked goods
 that you do.

1237
00:41:05,564 --> 00:41:07,363
It cooks.
  It cools.

1238
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:09,966
There's three bay sinks.
There's a handwash sink.

1239
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:15,472
This, ladies and gentlemen,
is a little mini WOW restaurant.

1240
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:18,641
Oh, my god.
    This is so great.

1241
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:21,144
That is so great.

1242
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,512
This is gonna be
a wonderful opportunity

1243
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:25,148
to not only sell food
and make money for WOW,

1244
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,150
but it's gonna be
a great opportunity for you

1245
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:29,352
to interact with your community
 and for them to see

1246
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:32,589
just how incredible
 you all really are.

1247
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:34,524
WOW is happening
because of all of you.

1248
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:35,925
When you come
 to Sonoma County,

1249
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:38,027
when you're in Santa Rosa,
you got to come see WOW.

1250
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,464
So that's it
 for this Flavortown roadtrip.

1251
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:42,732
But don't you worry,

1252
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:44,934
there's plenty more joints
  all over this country.

1253
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:46,503
I'll be looking
  for you next time

1254
00:41:46,505 --> 00:41:48,872
on "Diners, Drive-Ins
   and Dives."

1255
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:50,473
Oh, I just got to keep up
    with this guy.

1256
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:52,208
When I watch your show,
you're ahead of everybody.

1257
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,077
I'm usually the one rowing
   and steering the boat.

1258
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,912
Right now, I'm just holding
   onto the back rope.

1259
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:58,014
Don't fall in the water.
