00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,201
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,669
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:07,272
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:09,274
          This trip...          
                            Wow!

5
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:11,676
       ...we're headed to       
     the Flavortown pool...     

6
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,145
          Ooh, that sounds nice.

7
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:15,414
       ...and diving into       
     some all-day dining...     

8
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,015
     Flavor jets just turned on.

9
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,550
    ...in Wilson, Wyoming...    

10
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:19,551
                Look at that.   
                Get after it.   

11
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,352
     ...a down-home joint...    

12
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,155
     Ooh, you know the knuckles.
              I like this one.  

13
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:25,691
         ...stacking up         
    an early-morning classic.   

14
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,292
               That's gourmet   
               French toast.    

15
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:28,226
   In Monterey, California...   

16
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,627
             Hello.             

17
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,963
   ...a chef living the fresh   
        and local life...       

18
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,098
      Nice job.                 

19
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,567
  ...pulling off a triple play  
            of pork.            

20
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,369
    Well, here at               
the delicate Wild Plum,         

21
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,972
don't think you're not getting  
a chuck wagon portion.          

22
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:42,041
And in Long Beach, California...

23
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:43,374
        Hey!                    
                      Hey!      

24
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,911
         ...a gastro pub        
      mixing up the menu...     

25
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:47,446
               Oh, I'm sorry.   
              Back up the one.  

26
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:49,715
          ...with some          
     off-the-hook creations.    

27
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:50,649
            Shut the front door.

28
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:51,784
               Shut the front   
             and the back door. 

29
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:53,852
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

30
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,320
         on "Triple D."         

33
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,068
 So, I'm here in the great state
           of Wyoming,          

34
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,603
      right on Highway 22,      

35
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:14,540
     about 6 or 7 miles west    
        of Jackson Hole.        

36
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,808
     I mean, everybody knows    
   about Jackson Hole, right?   

37
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,344
  So I'm here to check out this 
  family-run neighborhood joint 

38
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:21,213
         where they are         
    scratch making everything   

39
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:22,814
      for breakfast, lunch,     
           and dinner.          

40
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,149
 This is Nora's Fish Creek Inn. 

41
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,154
    Prime rib, baked potato!    

42
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,290
   A unique little log cabin.   

43
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,291
There's a giant fish on the top.

44
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,894
     It's a normal Joe place    
   that you feel comfortable,   

45
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:38,430
     and there's great food.    

46
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,898
 Blue cheese mushrooms, please! 

47
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,304
      I've been coming here     
       for 30-plus years,       

48
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,107
   watching Kat grow up here.   

49
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,442
 FRIERI: Working for her mother,
           Nora Tygum,          

50
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,978
      who started the joint     
          back in '82,          

51
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,181
      now Kat's picking up      
     where mother left off.     

52
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,116
       I've modified a lot      
         of her recipes,        

53
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,986
    but a lot of them I keep    
  the same because it's Nora's. 

54
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,188
   The food here is excellent.  

55
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,123
     Any meal here, any day.    

56
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,259
 It's one of our favorite places
       to have breakfast.       

57
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,995
        Biscuit and gravy       
    and the huevos rancheros.   

58
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,796
 The pancakes, the French toast.

59
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,998
   Banana bread French toast!   
         It's fantastic.        

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,470
         Banana bread sourdough 
       whole-wheat French toast.

61
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,804
                    Wow!        
               Let's do this.   

62
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,675
Brown sugar, white sugar,       
and a pound of butter.          

63
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,277
     Cream this.                

64
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,745
                Look at that.   
                Get after it.   

65
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:30,449
Now I'm gonna add the eggs,     
a couple at a time, mix again.  

66
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,153
Now I'll add my sourdough.      

67
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,488
     Flavor jets just turned on.

68
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,890
    White flour,                
 whole-wheat flour,             

69
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:43,295
     salt, soda,                
  nutmeg, cinnamon.             

70
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:44,829
      Allspice.                 

71
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,831
                        Clove?  
A little clove.                 

72
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,698
         And some baking powder.

73
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,567
      Correct.                  

74
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,302
Now we're going to add          
 the dry ingredients            

75
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:52,070
to the wet ingredients,         
 and I'll mix this.             

76
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,911
Then I mash up the bananas,     

77
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,580
      and then                  
 I'll scoop them in.            

78
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:04,249
    And then you're going to put
           the mixer back to -- 

79
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,284
    Back to work.               

80
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,655
                  A little      
             labor of love here.

81
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:12,124
I like to let it sit            
for about 30 minutes.           

82
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:14,259
                   Hit it       
         with a little Aqua Net.

83
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,495
Then I'm gonna pour it          
     in the pan.                

84
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,164
              325 for an hour?  
Yep.                            

85
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:24,670
                 All right,     
    so, bread's cooled down now.

86
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,742
 It's three slices,             
50/50 margarine and butter,     

87
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:31,876
 dip it in my eggs.             

88
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,879
             Did we put any milk
                 in the egg?    

89
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:34,746
   Nope, just egg.              

90
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:35,948
Put it on the flat top.         

91
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:40,418
  Look at that omelette you have
        on the outside of that. 

92
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,853
   Plate this up.               

93
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,994
Powdered sugar, walnuts,        
and some blueberries.           

94
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,031
     Breakfast avalanche you got
            going on over here. 

95
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,307
               That's gourmet   
               French toast.    

96
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:05,243
              The whole wheat,  
                the bananas,    

97
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,246
 I mean, the whole spice cabinet
            jumped in this one. 

98
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,582
             I love the allspice
              getting in there. 

99
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,517
        There's enough sweetness
                  in there,     

100
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,853
      and the natural sweetness 
   of the blueberries coming in.

101
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:15,853
             That's lights out. 

102
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,122
                Nicely done.    
Awesome.                        

103
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,457
     Ooh, you know the knuckles.
   I do.                        

104
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,791
              I like this one.  

105
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:20,726
     [ Laughs ]                 

106
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,463
        The banana bread        
      is just unbelievable.     

107
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:28,466
  I love it so much that I just 
     want to keep eating it.    

108
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,801
    You look out your window,   

109
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,670
 and you see the Teton Mountains
         all around you.        

110
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:35,340
  You can't take it for granted 
 because it's just so beautiful.

111
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,542
    We come here a lot during   
    the week, during lunches.   

112
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,610
    Dinner, I have stroganoff   
          or prime rib.         

113
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,947
  FRIERI: Or why not have both  
        at the same time?       

114
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,350
      Pick up, stroganoff!      

115
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,485
   You make your beef stroganoff
               with prime rib?  

116
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,419
 Leftover prime rib.            

117
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,888
            So you'll serve this
                 for dinner.    

118
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,223
    You have your end trimmings,
       your leftover prime rib, 

119
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,892
          then you'll take that,
               slice that up,   

120
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,626
            and use that to make
               the stroganoff.  

121
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,528
   Correct.                     
                   Got it.      

122
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,564
                 All right,     
             let's get into it. 

123
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,233
We're making the homemade       
noodles for the beef stroganoff.

124
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:03,134
          So, all-purpose flour.

125
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:07,439
A little salt, milk,            
      my eggs.                  

126
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:10,041
And some clarified butter.      
                         Got it.

127
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,643
Mix it up with my hands,        

128
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,613
and I'm gonna knead it          
   to a nice ball.              

129
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,317
 And then I'm gonna             
  flour my surface              

130
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,054
    so they don't               
   stick together.              

131
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:27,059
Roll it out, cut it in half,    
   and roll it up.              

132
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,261
      Slice it.                 

133
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:30,862
            Big, hearty noodles.

134
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,466
     Unroll 'em,                
kind of break 'em apart,        

135
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,668
let 'em dry out a little bit    
on this cookie sheet.           

136
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,603
                    Okay,       
        so we bust all this out.

137
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:41,606
   Okay, so now we're gonna make
               the stroganoff.  

138
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:42,808
        Yes.                    

139
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,875
                 So, we got     
           the clarified butter.

 mushrooms, onions.             

141

  Let this sauté up             
    a little bit.               

142
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:55,086
 I'll add my flour,             
building a little roux.         

143
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,022
 Then I'm gonna add             
the leftover prime rib,         

144
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,691
half and half, tarragon,        

145
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:05,297
cracked black pepper,           
chicken stock, wine.

             I love the tarragon

00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,196
          You get a ton of meat.

with a little bit of water,     

233
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,317
  red wine vinegar,             
     some salt,                 

234
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:15,987
black peppercorns, bay leafs,   
    whole garlic.               

235
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,321
                And how long    
       are we gonna let this go?

236
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,857
For about four hours.           

237
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,058
                   Low and slow?
Low and slow.                   

238
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,793
      Bring it out, let it cool.

239
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:23,862
     Overnight,                 
 in its own liquid.             

240
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,063
           Okay, Chef, we ready?
Ready.                          

241
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:30,502
So now the belly's out,         
we're gonna press it.           

242
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,938
                There we go.    

243
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,407
And we're gonna take            
our other sheet tray,           

244
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,608
lay it right on top,            

245
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,143
and we add a little bit         
     of weight.                 

246
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,544
               And why are we   
               gonna weigh it?  

247
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,881
Try to get a nice, uniform      
texture so we slice it later.   

248
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,149
               You don't have   
               all these gaps.  

249
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,349
     Then we're                 
 gonna go overnight.            

250
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,885
                   Got it.      

251
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:47,952
                  What goes     
             on the top of this?

252
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,821
   A black currant              
    vinaigrette.                

253
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,156
          Ooh, that sounds nice.

254
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,491
  So, we have just              
some dried black currants,      

255
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,293
   diced shallots,              

256
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,894
season everything up            
with a nice pinch of salt,      

257
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,729
     then we add                
our red wine vinegar,           

258
00:09:58,731 --> 00:09:59,898
equal parts to burgundy.        

259
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,100
 Quite a few grounds            
  of black pepper.              

260
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,968
    About a full                
  two tablespoons.              

261
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,071
We're gonna let this go until   
all the currants are plump,     

262
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:10,708
so about four to five minutes   
on full, rapid boil.            

263
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,377
Then it's ready to roll.        
                      Excellent.

264
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:15,246
So we have our octopus.         
                Beautiful, okay.

265
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,849
   It's so tender,              
we can just pull it apart.      
                      I like it.

266
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,784
This is the pork belly          
we've been pressing overnight.  

267
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:23,054
Portion it into about           
the width we want first.        

268
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,656
And just slice it up.           

269
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:25,990
                 Beautiful.     

270
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,725
      Cold pan,                 
'cause we want to try           

271
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,794
to really get it as crispy      
    as possible.                

272
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,597
        Let it come up to temp, 
   let it start to slowly render

273
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,932
           by the time it starts
           to cook off the fat. 

274
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,134
GBD -- golden, brown,           
   and delicious.               

275
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,335
        Okay, so we let that go.

276
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,337
            What are we gonna do
              with the octopus? 

277
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,538
We're actually gonna crisp      
the octopus in a different way. 

278
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,806
 We're gonna fry it.            

279
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,409
Refrying it just gets the best  
 texture all around.            

280
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,411
             Nice little crunch 
               on the outside.  

281
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,413
        Warm through the middle?
Absolutely.                     

282
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,548
We're now gonna take            
   carrot caramel.              

283
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,616
              With brown sugar? 

284
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,217
    Just carrot.                

285
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,953
        Just a carrot reduction?

286
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:57,355
     That's it.                 
Lay this guy in a bowl.         

287
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,624
 It's got nice GBD?             

288
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,126
     Yes, it does have nice GBD.

289
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,563
    We then have                
our very crispy octopus.        

290
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:06,831
                 Yes, we do.    

291
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,099
We're gonna go real crazy       
      with it.                  

292
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,434
             Look at that, huh? 
That's half the fun.            

293
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:13,171
                 That is it.    
Red radishes, jicama.           

294
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,505
            A little bitterness,
              a little crunch.  

295
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,908
    A little bit                
 of the vinaigrette,            

296
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,576
some of those currants,         

297
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:23,581
dill, fennel, cilantro,         
chervil, nasturtium.            

298
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,516
              Wait, I'm sorry,  
              back up the one.  

299
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,851
 Nasturtium.                    
                 Nasturium?     

300
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,252
   As the flower.               

301
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,156
       You know, I just ran out 
    of nasturtium earlier today.

302
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:37,028
         All right, the belly is
         ridiculous, fall apart.

303
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,132
             It is so unctuous. 

304
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,867
  It's pretty rich.             
                            Oh! 

305
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,570
              I am a humongous  
                octopus fan.    

306
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:51,543
             And this is simple,

307
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:55,080
        but incredibly flavorful
                and refined.    

308
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:58,416
   You know what the real kicker
                  of it is?     

309
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:02,420
    Is the freshness of the veg,
                 the herbs,     

310
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,522
               the brightness   
              that those bring. 

311
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,560
            Shut the front door.

312
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,228
               Shut the front   
             and the back door. 

313
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,296
               It's that good.  

314
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,032
                    Dude,       
            you have mad skills.

315
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,833
     Thank you.                 
                    Outstanding.

316
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,837
  The tenderness of the octopus 
  combined with the pork belly  

317
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,106
   is just like nothing else.   

318
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:24,708
             WOMAN:             
  There's a lot of interesting  
     food items on the menu     

319
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,778
   that I've never had before.  

320
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,047
  It's not like any place else. 

321
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,515
       I just feel that there is
               something else   

322
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:31,783
                that you have   
           that I've got to try.

323
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:32,650
     Pig tails.                 

324
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,919
                     Oh!        
             Don't go anywhere. 

325
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,921
    "Triple D" is hanging out   
        at Belmont Shores       

326
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,189
   in Long Beach, California.   

327
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,391
 When we come back, the wild man
      brings the pig tails.     

328
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,126
        See you in a bit.       

329
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,434
                Welcome back.   
           We're at tavern on 2,

330
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,369
             the Belmont Shore, 
         Long Beach, California,

331
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,571
        my old stomping grounds,

332
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:56,908
       and we have had the belly
        and sucker, outrageous. 

333
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:01,045
    And now, after all of this, 
 you're gonna give me pig tails.

334
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,913
     Pig tails.                 

335
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,515
      It's like                 
 pork chicken wings.            

336
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,884
             Pork chicken wings.
                    Okay.       

337
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,520
They look kind of strange.      

338
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:09,921
                Yes, they do.   

339
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,589
         I was kind of expecting
              to be a little -- 

340
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,324
   Everyone does.               

341
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,193
  So we're not even gonna touch 
 those or mess around with them.

342
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:16,261
        We're just gonna put 'em
               right in there.  

343
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:16,994
Everybody in the pool.          

344
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,130
    Salt, sugar.                
                         Okay.  

345
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,733
Coriander, black pepper,        
     red onions.                

346
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:23,067
                   Dig it.      

347
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,401
   Cilantro stems,              
     just a few.                

348
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,204
              Got it, only need 
            two or six handfuls.

349
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:27,272
       Ginger.                  

350
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:27,939
                And Mary Ann.   

351
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,674
Little bit of water.            

352
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:30,808
 Rice wine vinegar.             

353
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,213
We're gonna let these simmer    
for about three hours,          

354
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:38,682
lay 'em onto a sheet tray,      
and let 'em cool overnight.     

355
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:41,686
       They congealed inside of 
  their own braising liquid now.

356
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,087
We're gonna take 'em off        
  and portion 'em.              

357
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,689
      And so --                 

358
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,891
 They're that soft, you can just
         pop right through 'em. 

359
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,359
   Now we're gonna              
    deep fry 'em.               

360
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,628
We're gonna let them go         
for about four minutes.         

361
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,696
                   Got it.      

362
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:52,763
     Until GBD.                 

363
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:53,764
             Until they're GBD. 

364
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,367
               While the tails  
               are bopping --   

365
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,036
We're gonna add the sauce.      
                         Got it.

366
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:01,772
Hoisin, oyster sauce,           
       sambo,                   

367
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,042
black bean sauce, o.j.,         
     lime juice,                

368
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,110
  water, sriracha,              
    brown sugar.                

369
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:07,311
                 Very nice.     

370
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,180
      A few of                  
 my favorite things.            
                        I enjoy.

371
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,650
 So we got our nice             
 crispy fried tails.            

372
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,985
 We're gonna get 'em            
     in a sauce.                

373
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,922
This is where it becomes        
  sticky pig tails.             

374
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:20,190
              Sticky pig tails. 

375
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,526
 Everything's better            
  when it's sticky.             

376
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,330
       Back on a vinyl car seat,
                not so much.    

377
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:29,234
Roasted sesame seeds,           
     scallions.                 

378
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,937
      So, nice,                 
  sticky pig tails.             

379
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:35,206
 Almost like Chinese            
   takeout style.               

380
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,874
                 I like it.     
              It's a big wing.  

381
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,542
It's exactly what it is.        

382
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,747
Some micro cilantro, a little   
more sesame raw, and scallions. 

383
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,757
           It's like a pork rib 
        that really had a chance

384
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,758
      to cook down a little bit.

385
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,427
          Great texture to it...

386
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,296
               nice meatiness.  

387
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:03,434
   And when you offer things as 
 eclectic as pig tails fried up,

388
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:07,571
             toss in an awesome 
            spicy Asian sauce...

389
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,240
       I don't know what to say.

390
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,441
               You rock, man.   

391
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,509
Thank you, sir.                 
                     Go get 'em.

392
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,778
       Pig tails, pick up!      

393
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,581
     MAN: The pig tails blow    
 chicken wings out of the water.

394
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,849
   The sweet and savory sauce   

395
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,718
         that's on there        
       is just incredible,      

396
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,120
  and the meat, it's so tender. 

397
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,320
     WOMAN: They're sticky,     

398
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,123
          and you need          
   a wet nap when you're done.  

399
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,256
       They're wonderful.       

400
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,258
             Have you ever had  
             a pig tail before? 

401
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,393
  Not before here.              

402
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:29,460
       I mean,                  
the flavor is banging.          

403
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:30,728
             WOMAN:             
       I love tavern on 2.      

404
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,864
          It's casual.          
   People are really friendly.  

405
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,665
    The food is sensational.    

406
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,200
            Food's off the hook.

407
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:37,602
            Dude's off the tail.

408
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:38,903
        Hey!                    
                          Hey!  

409
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,941
       FRIERI: Up next...       

410
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,009
 You make your rubs.            
You make your sauces.           

411
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:46,344
  ...in Monterey, California... 

412
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,545
You make your bread,            
you make your muffin.           

413
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:51,015
   ...the local joint running   
    a scratch-made marathon.    

414
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,216
  You make your --              
                     Everything.

415
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,251
 Except the ketchup             
    and mustard.                

416
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:03,394
  So, I'm here in the old town  
    of Monterey, California,    

417
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,396
      to check out a joint.     
         Now, get this.         

418
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,732
    They have people growing    
     their produce for 'em.     

419
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,801
         They're baking         
     just about everything.     

420
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,870
   They're into sustainability  
       and total organics,      

421
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:14,205
          and get this.         

422
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,673
  They scratch make everything  

423
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:17,942
 except the ketchup and mustard.

424
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:18,910
     This is the Wild Plum.     

425
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,817
      Some of the best food     
   on the Monterey peninsula.   

426
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,486
             WOMAN:             
    Basil burger, table six.    

427
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,821
    Best of a farmer's market   
           on a plate.          

428
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,958
      This is a salad bowl      
      of the whole country,     

429
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,427
      and Pamela is so good     
        about making sure       

430
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,962
        she incorporates        
     local fresh vegetables.    

431
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:42,033
FRIERI: A code Chef Pamela Burns
    has pretty much lived by    

432
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:44,568
   since she opened this place  
          back in '99.          

433
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,904
  She's like the hippie auntie  
        I always wanted.        

434
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:50,508
      I don't even want to      
        call it homemade        

435
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,243
   because I could never make   
   anything like this at home.  

436
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,580
             WOMAN:             
   Pickup, please, porchetta!   

437
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,715
  I mean, it's pork and bacon.  
     Where can you go wrong?    

438
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,317
     And the way the flavors    
      bounce in your mouth,     

439
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,084
      it's just phenomenal.     

440
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:05,856
Porchetta -- I don't see        
the big belly and the --        

441
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,058
      I'm not doing it that way.

442
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,927
             I'm doing a version
                of porchetta.   

443
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,062
     Oh, hello.                 

444
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:12,130
             Is that all right? 

445
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,397
      Oh, yeah,                 
this is your house, girl.       

446
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,999
You have the knife, also.       
                That's right.   

447
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:18,135
          I make a pork filling 
     with roasted pork shoulder.

448
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:22,607
   So we're gonna cut this down,
              keeping this up.  

449
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,712
    Season with salt and pepper,
        extra virgin olive oil. 

450
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,883
             And we're gonna go 
             with our bacon fat,

451
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:36,420
                brown sugar,    
               onions, fennel.  

452
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,689
                Whole garlic,   
              chopped oregano.  

453
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:39,891
Roast it for an hour.           

454
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,362
          And then we add apples
                   to it,       

455
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:47,432
              and then another  
     hour and a half, two hours.

456
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:50,501
     Now we work                
 with the pork loin.            

457
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:53,771
       I'm gonna butterfly this.

458
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,106
      So I'm gonna go like this.

459
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:56,773
Getting medieval on it,         
     aren't you?                

460
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,242
             I'm gonna stuff it 
             with some garlic.  

461
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,243
I'll slice, you put.            

462
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,979
             All right, perfect.

463
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,381
Okay, now we're in there.       

464
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:06,317
      Salt, pepper, olive oil --

465
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,186
               just a smidge.   

466
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:09,553
             Rub that in there. 

467
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,455
       A little blend of oregano
                 and thyme.     

468
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,991
   And then we do the same thing
             to the other side. 

469
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:16,661
        Now I'm gonna give this 
   a little shot of brown sugar.

470
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,863
               On both sides.   

471
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,131
                    Okay?       
        Now we're ready to roll.

472
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:21,199
                Pork filling,   

473
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:23,600
             and we're gonna do 
              a pinwheel roll.  

474
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,801
            Okay, so here we go.

475
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,871
             Give it a good roll
                 like that.     

476
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,739
      I tie this so that it will
               stay together,   

477
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:32,743
         and then I do the bacon
         just like this on top. 

478
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,478
You lay the bacon on top?       

479
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,612
         I lay the bacon on top.

480
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,614
   You tie it off,              
and then you tie it again?      

481
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:37,281
               I tie it again.  

482
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,484
        Now it's ready to roast.

483
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:42,753
           At approximately 350 
           for about 40 minutes.

484
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:45,356
                And I cook it   
              a little bit rare 

485
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:48,092
        'cause I'm gonna sear it
                on one side.    

486
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,893
       Because I just don't want
            the pork to be dry. 

487
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,162
   Nothing worse.               

488
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,897
     Let me just                
pick that off there.            

489

              Sure. [ Laughs ]  

490
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,500
                That came out   
               pretty perfect.  

491
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,367
    Gorgeous.                   
                       Yeah.    

492
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,504
      A little bit of olive oil.

493
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:03,240
                Let that sit    
            for like one minute.

494
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,142
                Now flip it.    

495
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,780
              Put in my apples  
                and my pears.   

496
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,182
           Just a pinch of salt,

497
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,517
        and I'm just gonna pour 
      a little bit of this juice

498
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,786
        that we've strained off 
       the roasted pork filling,

499
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:20,524
and then I finish it in the oven
 for like four or five minutes. 

500
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:21,526
      We ready?                 
                            Yep!

501
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:24,061
             Pan-fried potatoes.
A whole bunch of 'em.           

502
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:27,865
             And then I'm gonna 
              put in the pork.  

503
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,933
                A little bit    
             of the good stuff.

505

don't think you're not getting  
a chuck wagon portion.          

506
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:37,441
     All right.

   about porchetta              

508
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,148
is that you get all the         
different parts of the pig.     

509
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:49,153
 You get the salty,             
crunchy bacon side of it.       

510
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,489
Here, you've incorporated       
    the shoulder,               

511
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:52,623
which has tremendous flavor,    

512
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,291
and wrapping the bacon          
 around the outside.            

513
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,626
    The loin gets               
  all that flavor,              

514
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,160
more flavor in the loin         
    than it has.                

515
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:58,362
                   Right.       

516
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,830

   and the apple,               

517
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,632
it's just such an elevated      
   flavor profile,              

518
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,034
   and it gives it              
    such balance.               

519
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:05,102
