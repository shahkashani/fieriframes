     <i> IN THE FIRST PLACE.</i>       
                  BOWL OF PLAIN.

100
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,855
     MY GRANDMA WAS CARRIE.     

101
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,857
   SHE AND GRANDPA CAME DOWN    
         TO DIG CLAMS.          

102
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,592
        SHE MADE CHOWDER        
        AND CLAM CAKES.         

103
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,195
  AND THE DIFFERENT FISHERMEN   

104
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:25,196
    WOULD SMELL THE CHOWDER     
        AND CLAM CAKES,         

105
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,332
 AND THEY WERE ALWAYS COMING BY 
          AND SAYING,           

106
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,668
 “OH, WE'D LIKE SOME OF THAT.”  
 SO GRANDPA PICKED UP HIS EARS. 

107
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,004
    HE SAID, “MAYBE THERE'S     
     SOMETHING WE CAN DO.”      

108
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:34,739
       <i> BUT CLAMS WEREN'T</i>       
    <i> THE ONLY CROWD-PLEASER.</i>    

109
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,674
     <i> TURNS OUT AUNT CARRIE</i>     
 <i> WAS A BIT OF A BAKER, TOO...</i>  

110
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,944
                  (Elsie)       
             ONE PIECE OF APPLE.

111
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,946
   <i> SERVING UP THIS ORIGINAL</i>    
        <i> HOUSE FAVORITE.</i>        

112
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,682
          HERE'S YOUR           
     STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE.      
THE BISCUIT IS DELICIOUS.       

113
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:46,818
THE STRAWBERRIES ARE NICE       
  AND FRESH. I LOVE IT.         

114
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,620
  (Guy) NOW WHAT                
ARE WE GONNA MAKE?              

115
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:52,223
 WE'RE GONNA MAKE SOME SHORTCAKE
  BISCUITS FOR OUR STRAWBERRIES.
MMM.                            

116
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,493
           WE ONLY SELL 'EM     
     WHEN THEY'RE SEASONAL HERE.
IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT         
 FROM SCRATCH, I'M IN.          

117
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,562
SO THE ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR.       
                  LITTLE BIT    
               OF BAKING POWDER.

118
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,997
LITTLE BIT?                     
                 SALT.          
       AND WE'RE GONNA MIX THAT.

119
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,434
     (mechanical whirring)      
IT'S A CLOSE RELATIVE OF CHITTY 
  CHITTY BANG BANG ISN'T IT?    

120
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,503
              ABSOLUTELY.       
       AND THIS IS THE FUN PART.

121
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:07,105
  WE'RE GONNA ADD OUR SHORTENING
    IN LITTLE PIECES AT A TIME. 
VERY NICE.                      

122
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,441
   SO YOU CAN TURN THAT ON AGAIN
            IF YOU WANT.        

123
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,976
      NOW WE'RE GONNA SLOWLY ADD
            SOME COLD MILK.     
OKAY.                           

124
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,380
      AND YOU JUST KIND OF MIX  
     THAT UP. THAT'S ALL WE MIX.
         JUST TO WHERE          
IT'S STARTING TO HOLD TOGETHER. 

125
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:18,717
       AND THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.
         IT'S PRETTY GOOD NOW.  
OKAY.                           

126
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,652
      NOW WE'RE MAKING BISCUITS.

127
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,321
     REALLY? I THOUGHT IT ALWAYS
        WORKED FROM THIS PART?  
BLACK--BLACK PANTS.             

128
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,391
DON'T START. YOU ALREADY MADE ME
DO THE HEAVY LIFTING DOWNSTAIRS.
BLACK PANTS.                    
BLACK PANTS.                    

129
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:29,261
                   YEAH. UH-HUH?
LOOK AT THAT. SO WE'RE GONNA    
ROLL THIS OUT A LITTLE BIT,     

130
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,929
 A COUPLE OF INCHES HIGH.       
WE ALSO HAVE OUR PAN HERE.      

131
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:35,066
 WE'RE GOING TO PUT             
A LITTLE SPRAY ON IT.           

132
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,869
                           OKAY.
WE HAVE A BISCUIT CUTTER.       

133
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,805
       AND THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE.
       THAT'S IT.               
THEY'RE GONNA BE SO GOOD.       

134
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,941
IT'S REALLY HARD TO WAIT TO GET 
   THE STRAWBERRIES ON 'EM,     

135
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,009
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOOD            
    JUST ALONE.                 
               JUST BY THEMSELF.

136
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,412
                    ARE WE GONNA
                   EGG WASH 'EM?
WE USE MILK.                    

137
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,614
                JUST REGULAR,   
             LITTLE BIT OF MILK.
WHOLE MILK, YES.                

138
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,350
    AND HOW LONG WILL THEY GO IN
               AT 500?          
 ABOUT 22 MINUTES,              
RIGHT AROUND THERE.             

139
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,352
    (whistles) AND THEN WE BUILD
        STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE.   

140
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,555
          OKAY, WE'RE GONNA MAKE
           THE STRAWBERRY SAUCE.
NOW THE SAUCE.                  

141
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,224
           OR HOW DO YOU SAY IT?
                 “SW-ACE.”      
THE SAUCE WOULD BE--            
 NOT ME, NO. SAUCE.             

142
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,893
          YEAH, YOU SAID SW-ACE.
             YOU SAID SW-ACE.   
NO, I DID NOT.                  
 NO, NO, NO.                    

143
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,963
WOULD YOU LIKE                  
A STRAWBERRY?                   
          HOW ABOUT SOME SW-ACE?
              THAT SHUT ME UP.  

144
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,298
WARM WATER, SOME SUGAR--        
   MIX THAT TOGETHER.           
                           OKAY.

145
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,635
  I'M GONNA START ADDING        
SOME STRAWBERRIES IN HERE.      
                 SO I GOT       
           MY SIMPLE SYRUP HERE.

146
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,503
                  THE WARM WATER
                    IS HELPING  

147
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,505
       BREAK DOWN THE STRAWBERRY
             A LITTLE BIT.      

148
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,507
           YOU ARE MASHING THEM,
             SO IT IS BUILDING  

149
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,310
            A LITTLE BIT OF A...
               (mouthing word)  
THE BEST WOULD BE TO DO IT      
     THE DAY BEFORE.            

150
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,646
            YES, SO IT'D GIVE IT
           A LITTLE BIT OF TIME.

151
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:24,649
  NOW WE MAKE THE WHIPPED CREAM,
    AND THE WHIPPED CREAM IS... 
YES. HOMEMADE.                  

152
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:27,185
 ICE-COLD MIXING BOWL,          
MAKES IT MUCH FLUFFIER.         
           ICE-COLD MIXING BOWL,
            VERY CLEAN. DIG IT. 

153
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,854
        HEAVY CREAM, SUGAR,     
  LITTLE BIT OF VANILLA EXTRACT.
LITTLE BIT OF VANILLA.          

154
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,390
    YOU READY                   
FOR THE BISCUITS?               
                       BRING IT.

155
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,993
                      ALL RIGHT.
THERE WE GO.                    

156
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,862
        WOW, THAT'S DENSE. MMM. 
       IT'S LIKE A SCONE ALMOST.

157
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,865
    A LITTLE BIT                
OF THE STRAWBERRIES.            

158
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,734
I WONDERED WHY IT WAS IN A BOWL.
       HOLY STRAWBERRIES.       

159
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,403
HOW MUCH WHIPPED CREAM          
     DO YOU LIKE?               
                      SERIOUSLY.

160
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,206
  AND THEN,                     
THERE YOU GO.                   
              SERIOUSLY, THIS IS
               A NORMAL PORTION?

161
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,007
YES.                            

162
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,144
         MMM. THE BISCUIT ITSELF
              IS NOT SWEET,     

163
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,013
     AND THAT'S GOOD, BECAUSE   
  EVERYTHING ELSE IS SUPERSWEET.

164
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,283
    MMM. YOU SEE THIS RIGHT HERE
       WHERE I BREAK INTO IT,   

165
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,685
       AND THAT BISCUIT IS      
 WITHSTANDING ALL OF THE LIQUID?

166
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:04,289
    YOU GET THAT REAL STRAWBERRY
   FLAVOR AND THE WHIPPED CREAM.

167
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,158
     IT'S LIKE THE PERFECT STORM
       OF TEXTURES AND FLAVORS. 

168
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,894
               IT'S OUTSTANDING.

169
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:13,431
                 YOU COMPLETELY 
               ROCKED THE HOUSE.
OH, THANK YOU.

     STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE.      

171
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:17,168
            AND YOUR            
   STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE SOUP?   
IS WONDERFUL.                   

172
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,838
   I'VE NEVER SEEN STRAWBERRY   
   SHORTCAKE LOOK LIKE THAT.    
YOU NEVER HAVE?                 

173
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,974
                  NOT IN A BOWL.
IT'S--IT'S--OF COURSE.          
    IT'S SO GOOD.               

174
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,243
   HOW WE DOING OVER HERE?      
DO I NEED TO COUNT CLAM CAKES?  

175
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,712
    CARRIE'S IS LIKE AN ICON

YOU'RE DOWN BY THE WATER.       

179
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,989
IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A CLAM     
 CAKE, COOK 'EM WITH LARD.      
                 TELL MY SECRET.

180

OH, I AM DOWN WITH IT. I AM SO  
EXCITED. YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

          BUT IT'S GONNA BE HOT.

183
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,932
         <i> WE'RE HEADED</i>

                   FROM SCRATCH.

                    CHILAQUILES.

395
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,239
OH, I LOVE IT.                  
                   HAVE YOU     
              TRIED THEM BEFORE?

396
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,375
WHAT DO YOU THINK               
    THIS IS?                    
                        (laughs)

397
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,177
THIS IS A BODY                  
BY CHILAQUILES.                 

398
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,579
                   ALL RIGHT,   
               GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.
COME ON, MAN.                   

399
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,983
  WHAT ARE                      
WE GONNA MAKE?                  
            THE TOMATILLO SAUCE.

400
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:33,584
SO THE TOMATILLOS               
  USUALLY HAVE                  

401
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,120
  A NICE PAPER SKIN             
ON THE OUTSIDE OF 'EM.          
                        EXACTLY.

402
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:38,122
SOME JALAPEÑO.                  
                       JALAPEÑO.

403
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,925
WE'RE GONNA BOIL THE JALAPEÑOS  
     AND THE TOMATILLOS?        
              EXACTLY. TOGETHER.

404
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,127
GOT IT.                         
          WE TAKE THE TOMATILLOS
             AND THE JALAPEÑOS  

405
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,662
           OUT OF THE HOT WATER.
OKAY.                           

406
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,198
WOW.                            
                   THERE YOU GO.

407
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,399
                 SO NOW WE ADD  
               A LITTLE WATER...
OKAY.                           

408
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,401
                           SALT.
JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME,        

409
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,672
   DOES YOUR MOM KNOW           
YOU'RE USING THE BLENDER?       
                   SHE ALLOWS ME
                    TO DO THAT. 

410
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:58,008
SHH. DON'T DRAG ME              
    INTO THIS.                  
                         GARLIC.

411
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,978
       AND THEN WE'RE JUST READY
              TO BLEND IT.      

412
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,686
     SO NOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO 
    IS OBVIOUSLY COOK THE SAUCE.

413
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,955
          SO WE ADD A LITTLE BIT
               OF OLIVE OIL.    

414
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,957
    WE HAVE TO STRAIN THE SAUCE.

415
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,293
            AND YOU'VE GOT TO GO
                 LIKE THIS.     
OH, OH.                         

416
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,094
                    THIS IS     
               PART OF THE SHOW.

417
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,230
         I'VE NEVER SEEN        
THE BRUCE LEE COOKING TECHNIQUE.

418
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,833
                        EXACTLY.

419
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:24,234
                  WE ADD        
          A LITTLE BIT OF WATER.
  OKAY.                         

420
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,437
               AND THEN WE ADD  
             JUST A LITTLE SALT.
OKAY.                           

421
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,839
                  WE HAVE TO ADD
                   THE EPAZOTE. 
I KNOW EPAZOTE. YOU CAN'T       
  FIND THAT VERY OFTEN.         

422
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,042
YOU'RE JUST GONNA LET THAT      
    STEEP IN THERE...           
                        EXACTLY.

423
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:33,244
BUILD THE FLAVOR.               

424
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:35,379
NEXT STEP?                      
                 WE'RE GONNA FRY
                  THE TORTILLAS.

425
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,849
OKAY.                           
           AND THEN WE JUST PUT 
         A LITTLE SAUCE IN HERE,

426
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,783
                  A LITTLE BIT  
               OF CHICKEN STOCK.
OKAY.                           

427
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,853
WHICH YOU MAKE YOURSELF.        
   OF COURSE YOU DO.            
                EXACTLY.        
         EVERYTHING IS HOMEMADE.

428
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,122
       EVERYTHING IS HOMEMADE.  
    OTHERWISE ANGELA GETS UPSET.

429
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,726
 SO WE JUST LET IT SIT LIKE THAT
         FOR TWO MINUTES.       
OKAY.                           

430
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,928
               AND THEN WE PUT  
             THE TORTILLA CHIPS.
YEP.                            

431
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,197
   THEY'RE STILL GONNA HAVE     
A LITTLE BIT OF CRUNCH TO 'EM,  

432
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,266
JUST A LITTLE BIT               
   OF TEXTURE.                  

433
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,268
SOAK UP THAT SAUCE              
    RIGHT NOW.

 SO IN THE MEANTIME, WE'RE GONNA
     START COOKING THE EGGS.    
OH!                             

435
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,573
             DO YOU LIKE EGGS?  
           HOW DO YOU WANT THEM?
NO, BUT I'LL BE BACK.           

436
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:08,746

DO NOT LET THEM BE RUNNY.       
                     ALL RIGHTY.

437
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,148

   BUT STILL HAS SOME CRUNCH.   

454
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:59,330

  (woman) YOU REALLY CAN'T GET  
ANYTHING LIKE THIS AROUND HERE. 

461
