         What choices do I have?

106
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:56,634
     I recommend                
  the fatty parts.              

107
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,836
              The fatty parts?  

108
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,906
         Okay, I'll take fatty. 
           Not that I need it.  

109
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,843
              He's faster       
       than my vertical slicer. 

110
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,245
         So, this is the fatty? 

111
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,313
Yep.                            
                  Look at that. 

112
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:10,949
       Hit me with the mustard. 
          Whatever you think.   

113

115
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:28,466
   Tender, little bit of spice, 
   good amount of smoke, juicy. 

116

     to the smoke to the slice,

   we get it from other people

           to southern cooking, 

133

               to Jewish food.  

134
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,839
  And it's the first ingredient 

135
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:11,909
       in what I've dubbed      
     the King Kong of knish.    

136

 Smoked-meat knish.             

137
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,648
           The knish.           
 It's really good comfort food. 

138
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,116
       It's just like my Bubbeh 
             used to make.      

139
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,718

                    right now.  
     All right,                 
crank up the heat, kid.         

142
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:26,658
     First thing we're gonna put
     in here is the chicken fat.

143
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:31,062
  That is about the most pure,  
   golden, virgin chicken fat   

144
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:32,531
that I've ever seen.            
               Well, thank you. 

145
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,533
            Next thing we add   
         is sliced white onions.

146
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,335
              Just a little bit 
                  of salt.      

147
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,203
And the chicken skin.           

148
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,938
                        Yeah.   
Okay.                           

149
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,542
 We have to render it for about 
   half an hour to 45 minutes.

      Whoa.                     

151
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:50,148
  So, now we got our schmaltz.  
     Now we make the knish.

                ground up.

         And a bit of schmaltz.

       of your hand?

            Some rosemary       
     and some ground coriander.

           of the puff pastry.

   in this joint.

229
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:53,031
 After working here, pork bacon 
  doesn't even cut it anymore.  

230
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,966
Let's hit it.                   
            It's a 2 to 1 ratio 

231
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,968
               to curing salt

232
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,637
         And then one tablespoon
            of ascorbic acid.   

233
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:00,872
       And just give her a mix. 

234
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,708
                  Make sure     
              it's all covered. 

235
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,310
  So, we're using               
the belly of the beef.          
                  Yep. Exactly. 

236
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:09,180
 It gets cured for about a week 
      to a week and a half,     

237
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,716
        and then it gets smoked 
        for about 8 1/2 hours.  

238
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,790
 Out of the depths of the smoker
        comes beef bacon.

 this. I want to check this out.

242
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:37,075
        Not too smoky,          
        but rich, chewy, salty.

               the doughnuts.   

245
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:42,213
   All right, it's a little bit 
          of flour down.        

246
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,017

          in the deep fryer.

00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,538
                    No,         
           you boil it in this. 

338
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,542
             And in Singapore,  
           it's called ketupat. 

339
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,678
      It tastes like            
you cooked a bunch of rice,     

340
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:34,812
 little overcooked,             

341
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,480

342
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,916
        The reason I put this   
     in the crab cake is because

343
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,552
     it makes the crab stand up 
      nice and firm, you know?  

344
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,555
               Crumble that up  
                a little bit.
