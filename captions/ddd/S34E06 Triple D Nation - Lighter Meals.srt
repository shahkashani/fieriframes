1
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:02,868
   You know, people are asking  
   me all the time, hey, Guy,   

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,135
       that one joint you       
       checked out in that      

3
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:06,671
  one city when you were doing  
 Triple D-- how are they doing? 

4
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:07,472
          I don't know.         

5
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,609
     We should check it out.    

6
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:13,345
      Over the years, I've      
     seen and tasted it all.    

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,213
    This is ridiculous, dude.   

8
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:17,549
      But it turns out, it      
     was only the beginning.    

9
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,551
     Because Triple D joints    
      have been blowing up,     

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,821
      and we're go back to      
       see what's cooking.      

11
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,756
       Like on this trip--      

12
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,892
       we're taking a walk      
      on the lighter side.      

13
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:28,894
       It's really fresh,       
         healthy, light.        

14
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:31,497
     Like the Massachusetts     
    spot that started it all.   

15
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:34,233
         This guy is the        
      Triple D OG, OG, OG.      

16
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:36,701
      Now cutting calories      
     in familiar favorites.     

17
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:37,635
     The times have changed.    

18
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:38,971
       People are started       
         to ask for it.         

19
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,039
  And in Glendale, California.  

20
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:42,107
   Mouth is starting to water.  

21
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,308
    You feel it, right there.   

22
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,576
       It starts to water.      

23
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:47,980
    A Cuban cafe creating all   
   kinds of culinary classics.  

24
00:00:47,982 --> 00:00:49,647
    I just had a moho moment.   

25
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:52,784
     Plus, an apres ski spot    
       in Park City, Utah.      

26
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:54,053
   Well, boom, boom, mushroom.  

27
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:56,254
 Forking over jackfruit tacos-- 

28
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:57,322
     I can't say it's good--    

29
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,191
         after a day of         
      hitting the slopes--      

30
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,460
  I can say it's great, though. 

31
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:05,931
   Familiar faces, new places,  
 and more off the hook flavors. 

32
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,732
    This is Triple D Nation.    

33
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:15,674
          [rock music]          

34
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:18,610
    So here it is, ladies and   
   gentlemen, 13 years later.   

35
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,412
 This is where Triple D started.

36
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:22,548
    It's pretty amazing, but    
      all over the country,     

37
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,617
 places like this, like Kelly's 
 diner here in Somerville Mass, 

38
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:26,618
       are booming again.       

39
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,754
      50 to 60 years after      
       serving their very       

40
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,223
        first meals, the        
      All-American classics     

41
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:32,557
    are as popular as ever--    

42
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:33,758
        or even more so.        

43
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:35,827
     I can't wait to go back    
     and check things out--     

44
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:38,830
 see how my buddy Jay is doing, 
  see if he's still rocking it, 

45
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,299
        or even more so.        

46
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,202
      I was hoping you were     
        going to do that.       

47
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,241
    WOMAN: Kelly's does seem    
      like a classic diner,     

48
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,376
      so it does make sense     
    that Guy would come here.   

49
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,446
        It was 2006, so I       
     would have been eleven.    

50
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,647
        My family and I--       

51
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,850
     we've been coming here     
 forever, and it's just awesome.

52
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,117
     A lot of history here.     

53
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,720
       It's a rarity these      
   days-- this kind of place.   

54
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,189
          Dying breed.          

55
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:05,590
       GUY FIERI: But this      
       one is still alive       

56
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,393
     and kicking, thanks to     
   owner Jay Holmes' devotion   

57
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,929
     to classic diner food.     

58
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:11,997
   They call it comfort food.   

59
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:12,931
    It makes you comfortable.   

60
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:13,732
       Home made cooking.       

61
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,267
      Cooking from scratch.     

62
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:16,534
       Fresh ingredients.       

63
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,436
  Everything's got to be fresh. 

64
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,808
  You haven't aged, by the way. 

65
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:24,876
        I appreciate it.        

66
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,345
        So I've gone to a       
       lot of restaurants       

67
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:27,612
    that we call Triple D OG.   

68
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,082
 Those are the places that were 
   in the first couple years.   

69
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:33,084
       But this guy is the      
       Triple D OG OG OG.       

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,419
         This is the one        
      that started it all.      

71
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:36,288
JAY HOLMES: We were actually the
  first diner on the first show 

72
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:37,155
              ever.             

73
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:39,958
 Guy Fieri was new on the scene.

74
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,227
   GUY FIERI: That's all right  
   here, right now, on Diners,  

75
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,363
      Drive Ins, and Dives.     

76
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:45,430
      You were so gracious.     

77
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,432
       You didn't know us,      
       we didn't know you.      

78
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,234
     I hadn't been doing TV.    

79
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,969
        You remember the        
       things that we did.      

80
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,037
JAY HOLMES: We did the meatloaf.

81
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,106
      And I top it off with     
       a homemade Alfredo       

82
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:56,842
 sauce that has mushrooms in it.

83
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:57,843
    Where did this come from?   

84
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:58,844
          I made it up.         

85
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,378
       So not only are you      
      the owner of a diner,     

86
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:01,780
 now you're turning into a chef.

87
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,115
            Oh, yeah.           
            Big time.           

88
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:03,916
               OK.              

89
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:04,916
     So give me the rundown.    

90
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:05,717
      A little bit of oil.      

91
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:06,518
        Heat up the oil.        

92
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:07,652
           Mushrooms.           

93
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,521
         A little bit of        
     garlic, let that brown.    

94
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,190
      Add the heavy cream,      
       put a little basil.      

95
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:13,992
   GUY FIERI: And then when do  
   we add the Parmesan cheese?  

96
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,727
      JAY HOLMES: After it      
   starts to reduce a little.   

97
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:16,995
     Give it a little whisk.    

98
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,797
    GUY FIERI: This is, like,   
  some gourmet meatloaf, dude.  

99
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,598
      JAY HOLMES: Oh, yeah.     

100
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:23,001
 Now I'm just going to put this 
  over the top of the meatloaf. 

101
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,136
   I imagine that's not going   
    to taste just incredible.   

102
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:26,071
           It's good.           

103
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:26,872
          Look at that.         

104
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:30,675
        And you just cook       
       it right in there?       

105
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,545
   Cover it up, bake it in the  
   oven for 45 minutes or so.   

106
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,080
           So anything          
      changed on the menu?      

107
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:37,215
      JAY HOLMES: We added      
      an egg white omelet--     

108
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,416
           Because the          
       times have changed.      

109
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:39,417
       People are starting      
         to ask for it.         

110
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:40,618
              Yeah.             

111
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:41,687
      How many eggs are we      
   going to go through today?   

112
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,222
     JAY HOLMES: 150 dozen.     

113
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:46,425
   GUY FIERI: 150 dozen eggs.   

114
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,626
  JAY HOLMES: Some people like  
    to have a little bit more   

115
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:49,894
     of a healthier option.     

116
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:52,297
   One that we have is called   
    the spinoccoli omelette.    

117
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:55,566
     You saute up tomatoes,     
       broccoli, spinach.       

118
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,235
     You add the egg whites     
     and any type of cheese     

119
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:58,570
that you want to add at the end.

120
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,504
       It's pretty simple.      

121
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,839
         It's delicious.        

122
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:04,909
  We offer fresh fruit instead  
  of home fries for an option.  

123
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,978
      WAITRESS: Spinoccoli      
       egg white omelette.      

124
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:08,580
      I feel like normally      
    when you get an omelette,   

125
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:12,851
  it's kind of boring, but this 
   tastes a lot more filling.   

126
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,988
   I really like the broccoli   
       and spinach combo.       

127
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:19,391
     It's really fresh, it's    
   healthy, light, not greasy.  

128
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,994
  You're doing great breakfast  
    items, great lunch items.   

129
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,996
MAN: You'd be surprised how many
 people come in here, especially

130
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,297
           on Fridays.          

131
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,598
   Their seafood is excellent.  

132
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,201
    The lobster roll-- yeah.    

133
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,535
         It's excellent.        

134
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,537
     My fish guy, Joe, he'll    
    call me up and give me--    

135
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:33,538
       - My fish guy, Joe.      
             - Yeah.            

136
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,539
          Fish guy Joe.         

137
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:37,542
    GUY FIERI: Not everybody    
       has a fish guy Joe.      

138
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,277
    JAY HOLMES: He'll call me   
  up and he'll give me a deal.  

139
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:40,946
      He'll say, I've got a     
      great deal on culls,      

140
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,146
  which are one claw lobsters.  

141
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:43,081
  GUY FIERI: One claw lobsters. 

142
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:44,282
              Yeah.             

143
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:45,817
       And that's because       
  they're grown with one claw,  

144
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:46,751
          or because--          

145
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,019
         I think it's--         

146
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:51,156
  legend has it, they got into  
    a fight and lost a claw.    

147
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:54,226
        The legend of the       
       one clawed lobster.      

148
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:57,629
   Mix it up with mayonnaise,   
      celery salt, celery.      

149
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,897
       Now, where did this      
        recipe come from?       

150
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:00,965
         Right up here.         

151
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,167
        It's all up here.       

152
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,302
      Chop up all the meat.     

153
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:05,103
           Big chunks.          

154
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,304
           Big chunks.          

155
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,372
          There we go.          

156
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,442
      A little celery salt.     
    Right there, behind you.    

157
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:11,309
          Little shake.         

158
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,978
              Yeah.             

159
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:14,379
        - Is that enough?       
        - That's enough.        

160
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,113
               OK.              

161
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,448
 How much mayonnaise do we use? 

162
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,116
    JAY HOLMES: As little as    
     you can, just to cover     

163
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,250
    the lobster a little bit.   

164
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:20,451
      You don't want to put     
      too much mayonnaise.      

165
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,653
    GUY FIERI: And that's it?   
     JAY HOLMES: That's it.     

166
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:22,454
GUY FIERI: That's all we mix in?
     JAY HOLMES: That's it.     

167
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,388
     It bet you that's good.    

168
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:24,522
        I should try it,        
        don't you think?        

169
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,124
              Yeah.             
            Try some.           

170
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,594
      I'm dying to try it.      

171
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,329
     I like how you put just    
   a little bit of mayonnaise   

172
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,997
            in there.           
 It doesn't mask all the flavor.

173
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,132
         All the lobster        
        really comes out.       

174
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:34,933
              Yeah.             

175
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:35,934
     That's good stuff, man.    

176
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,002
 JAY HOLMES: It's a huge seller.

177
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,337
       The customer right       
       there just got it.       

178
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,939
         Smart customer.        

179
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:41,807
     GUY FIERI: Coming up--     

180
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,274
      between the plates--      
         the corned beef        

181
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,809
 hash this dude makes is legit--

182
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,144
      and the personality--     

183
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,880
      I got nothing else to     
   do but let him do my work.   

184
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,416
    GUY FIERI: The walk down    
     memory lane continues.     

185
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,485
          Look at this.         

186
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:54,319
      That's mind blowing.      

187
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,591
    So I'm back where it all    
     started, Kelly's diner.    

188
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:04,829
  The actual OG Triple D diner  
     I visited back in 2006.    

189
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,632
   It really put the diner on   
   the map from that point on,  

190
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,300
      and it was fun to do.     

191
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,902
         I can tell when        
         I walk in here,        

192
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:15,039
 you have not changed one thing.

193
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:17,709
       JAY HOLMES: This is      
      a 1953 classic diner,     

194
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,978
        so I like to keep       
        it all original.        

195
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,913
    I did the booths a little   
    bit of a different color.   

196
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,247
         GUY FIERI: OK.         
     JAY HOLMES: That's it.     

197
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:24,382
         GUY FIERI: Wow.        

198
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:25,650
      You're really living      
     on the edge, right now.    

199
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:26,985
     And is this a computer?    

200
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,119
              Yeah.             
              Yeah.             

201
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:29,388
        I think the last        
         time I remember        

202
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:32,723
 Joni doing bad chicken scratch 
   and doing the math herself.  

203
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,192
        JONI: I feel like       
         your secretary.        

204
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,927
     GUY FIERI: You have to     
   have, like, track shoes on.  

205
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,329
         Joni was here.         

206
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:38,930
JONI: I have to get Sweet'N Low.

207
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,065
         You just bring         
        it over in hand.        

208
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,932
           JONI: Yeah.          

209
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:41,733
    We don't put them in a--    

210
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:42,600
    JONI: Nothing fancy here.   

211
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:43,401
         JAY HOLMES: No.        

212
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:44,202
          She's passed.         

213
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,470
        Marion was here.        

214
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,472
     GUY FIERI: Just running    
   the counter, talking smack.  

215
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,273
        JAY HOLMES: Yeah.       

216
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:49,341
  Unfortunately, she's passed.  

217
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,408
        MARION: Give her        
        some more coffee,       

218
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:51,877
   you've got it in your hand.  

219
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,079
    I've got nothing else to    
   do but let him do my work.   

220
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,215
    I appreciate you letting    
  me train under your tutelage. 

221
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,418
  Oh, honey, if I trained you.  

222
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:03,021
      They're just classic      
        diner waitresses.       

223
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,090
        You can say most        
    anything to the customers   

224
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,825
      because they come in      
      here expecting that.      

225
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:09,494
         Oh, you've got         
       decisions already.       

226
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:10,428
  JAY HOLMES: They were great.  

227
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:11,696
    GUY FIERI: That's so sad.   

228
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,699
   This was honestly my first   
   real experience about being  

229
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:15,833
    in a diner-- a big diner.   

230
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,101
        I got to see how        
      people were working,      

231
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:19,171
      I got to see how busy     
      you were in the back.     

232
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:20,972
      I really don't think      
     to show would have got     

233
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,508
  picked up had we not had the  
    opportunity to come here.   

234
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:26,845
        And I think that        
     would put me on first--    

235
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:27,846
   helping you guys out a lot.  

236
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:28,647
              So--              

237
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,450
     I'm glad he knows that.    

238
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,052
     Looks like everybody's     
   still doing the same thing.  

239
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,253
       You're still doing       
      the corned beef hash?     

240
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,454
      JAY HOLMES: Oh, yeah.     

241
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:37,789
      The corned beef hash      
    this dude makes is legit.   

242
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,390
         It's the bomb.         

243
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,458
        I just had some.        

244
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:42,394
    Same recipe to this day.    

245
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,396
      It's my grandfather's     
        recipe, actually.       

246
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,031
      He had a great recipe     
      for corned beef hash,     

247
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,934
   showed us how to do it this  
 way, and we never turned back. 

248
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,268
       Everybody loved it.      

249
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,605
  We use a red corned beef and  
  we boil it for three or four  

250
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,740
  hours until it's very tender. 

251
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,076
    You cut it up into pieces   
     so it's easy to grind,     

252
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:01,145
   then you add in the onions,  
 potatoes, and grind that down. 

253
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:02,614
      What are you going to     
     do, buy it in the can?     

254
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,215
        That's the worst.       

255
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:05,350
       Mix it up, and you       
       put it in the oven       

256
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,552
  to bake for about 45 minutes. 

257
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:10,655
    After the corned beef is    
 baked, it goes on the flat top.

258
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,891
   You put a weight on it and   
  it comes off nice and crispy. 

259
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,893
        That's how 90% of       
       the people like it.      

260
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,895
      We serve it with two      
     eggs anyway you like it    

261
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,496
    and your choice of toast.   

262
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,265
     It's called the number     
        eight on the menu       

263
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,100
     and it's a huge seller.    

264
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:26,437
        Actually, it's a        
       good hangover meal.      

265
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:27,705
   WAITRESS: Corned beef hash.  

266
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,642
   It's crispy on the top and   
    kind of smooth and creamy   

267
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:31,510
         on the bottom.         

268
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:32,777
        It's really rich.       

269
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,046
         Nice and salty,        
         very flavorful.        

270
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,581
        It's your classic       
        corned beef hash,       

271
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,149
        but it's taken to       
         the next level.        

272
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:43,654
               Oh.              

273
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,791
      Nothing got more real     
    when I just look at this.   

274
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,661
 We shot here in August of '06. 

275
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:53,532
      This is may of 2019.      

276
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:54,666
      That's mind blowing.      

277
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:55,700
  You've got to know something. 

278
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,335
        You're a legend.        

279
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:58,069
     I wouldn't go that far.    

280
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,070
          No, trust me.         

281
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,138
            You are.            

282
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,339
  You're the real deal, buddy.  
          - Thank you.          

283
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:02,140
              Yeah.             

284
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,208
          Thanks, man.          

285
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:03,975
         That's awesome.        

286
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:06,344
    This makes my whole week.   

287
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,212
         JAY HOLMES: You        
       guys are the best.       

288
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,615
   GUY FIERI: And coming up in  
   California-- take a whiff--  

289
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,285
    the nose knows just where   
     to find the real deal.     

290
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,085
         Wait a second.         

291
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,353
       That's Cuban food.       

292
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,288
  And man, it's worth the hunt. 

293
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:19,624
       This is a culinary       
       shot glass of fun.       

294
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,731
   Los Angeles is a cornucopia  
      of cultural cuisine,      

295
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:30,067
    so it's no surprise that    
   back in 2009 I literally--   

296
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,469
     and I mean literally--     
           sniffed out          

297
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,270
  this family run Cuban joint.  

298
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:35,673
     A few months ago, I was    
  sitting in that intersection  

299
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,276
     right there when these     
  flavors from this restaurant  

300
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,545
  started to flow into the car, 
   and I said, wait a second.   

301
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,079
       That's Cuban food.       

302
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,015
        And they're still       
    whipping up fresh recipes   

303
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,549
   done the old fashioned way.  

304
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:46,885
         This is Mambos.        

305
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,089
          [cuban music]         

306
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,824
       [speaking spanish]       

307
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:55,760
 I discovered this place before 
 Triple D discovered this place.

308
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,963
   A classic Cuban restaurant.  

309
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,965
  The food is not pretentious,  
       but it's delicious.      

310
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,767
   GUY FIERI: What else would   
   you expect from owner Raul   

311
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:06,838
 Gonzalez, who opened this place
   in '88 with his wife, Mima,  

312
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,973
        and son, Raul Jr.       

313
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,643
        I pulled up and I       
      thought mom was boss.     

314
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:12,844
         She is, though.        

315
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:16,981
   My wife, Mima-- she is one   
     to show me how to cook.    

316
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,117
        She educates you,       
     you write the recipes,     

317
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,117
    and you two are doing it.   

318
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,386
       RAUL GONZALEZ JR.:       
      We had a lot of fun.      

319
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:24,322
   We got a taste of the real   
  Guy, and he's the real deal.  

320
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,724
       Think I can have a       
    job here on the weekend?    

321
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:26,724
  I'll park the car out front.  

322
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,059
People come by and check it out.

323
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,260
        What's going on?        

324
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,528
     Who's the spiky, blond     
  haired Cuban guy in the back? 

325
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:31,329
              Yeah.             

326
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,997
   We can make some reasoning.  

327
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,933
         He gave me the         
    opportunity to introduce    

328
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:38,736
  my food in the United States. 

329
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,071
  I appreciate that very much.  

330
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:40,872
               OK.              

331
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:41,873
       What are we making?      

332
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,609
       We're going to make      
     the tostones rellenos.     

333
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:45,677
  You're doing it with shrimp?  

334
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:46,477
    RAUL GONZALEZ SR.: Yeah.    

335
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,212
   We cut the shrimp, garlic--  

336
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,081
      I like the way you're     
   going with this right now.   

337
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,416
       RAUL GONZALEZ SR.:       
        Sitting in lemon.       

338
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:52,550
            In lemon.           

339
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,552
   RAUL GONZALEZ SR.: Onions,   
       tomatoes, cilantro.      

340
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,220
        You've got to mix       
         those together.        

341
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,354
           More lemon.          

342
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,289
     GUY FIERI: So how long     
       does that marinate?      

343
00:10:58,425 --> 00:10:59,356
           Two hours.           

344
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:00,425
       GUY FIERI: Then we       
       make the tostones?       

345
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,159
          You're right.         
GUY FIERI: This is the plantain.

346
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,161
     We're going to fry it.     

347
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,095
       RAUL GONZALEZ SR.:       
       Take a few minutes.      

348
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,096
        And I'm going to        
        smash it, right?        

349
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,163
          You're right.         

350
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,498
        He says he's got        
       something special.       

351
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:08,500
               Oh.              

352
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,501
         GUY FIERI: What        
       are we going to do?      

353
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:10,234
       Are we going to put      
      a hole in this thing?     

354
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:10,968
    RAUL GONZALEZ SR.: Yeah.    

355
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,437
     Sit in here and press.     

356
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:13,571
         GUY FIERI: You         
       make tostone cups?       

357
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,372
    RAUL GONZALEZ SR.: Yeah.    

358
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:16,240
   I want a tostone cup maker.  

359
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:17,242
 RAUL GONZALEZ SR.: I need that.

360
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:18,043
             You do.            

361
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,376
            So do I.            

362
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:25,116
    We wound up giving him as   
    a gift the tostone maker.   

363
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:26,251
   I just was holding onto it.  

364
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,052
       I didn't want it to      
    fall off of the counter.    

365
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:29,187
         Are they ready?        
    RAUL GONZALEZ SR.: Yeah.    

366
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:30,855
   GUY FIERI: Let's pull them.  
          Look at that.         

367
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,189
          And now we're         
       going to fill them.      

368
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:34,325
     My mouth is starting--     
     you know, right there,     

369
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,659
       it starts to water.      

370
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,729
       This is a culinary       
       shot glass of fun.       

371
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:41,733
          It's awesome.         

372
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:42,934
       Really nice texture      
         of the shrimp.         

373
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:43,668
           Look at it.          

374
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,203
  It's still holding the juice. 

375
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:51,275
     I make three times more    
   than what we usually make.   

376
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,812
  RAUL GONZALEZ JR.: Now my dad 
  introduced a stuffed avocado  

377
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:54,879
         with mahi mahi.        

378
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,948
        I just took it to       
       a whole new level.       

379
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,284
       RAUL GONZALEZ SR.:       
        We are now making       

380
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:02,553
 the mahi mahi and Maria sauce. 

381
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:07,592
   Cut the mahi mahi in small   
 pieces and put it on the grill.

382
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:13,431
       Take the fish, put       
      it over the avocado.      

383
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,299
      Then the Maria sauce.     

384
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:18,636
       Flour, garlic, bell      
        peppers, onions,        

385
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:22,841
       jalapenos, chicken       
   powder, cilantro, saffron,   

386
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,275
    black pepper, some water.   

387
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:30,448
   RAUL GONZALEZ JR.: Avocado   
      mahi mahi, order up.      

388
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,983
  Melt in your mouth delicious. 

389
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,719
        The mahi mahi is        
        just like butter,       

390
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:38,789
   and the combination of the   
 avocado and the salsa on top-- 

391
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:39,657
           very good.           

392
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,125
 MAN: The way they prepare it-- 

393
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,460
      absolutely delicious.     

394
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,396
    And I know it's giving me   
 good health, eating this food. 

395
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,264
   The food's very wholesome.   

396
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,265
          Very natural.         

397
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,466
  What you see is what you get. 

398
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,935
   Garlic and lemon juice and   
   salt and pepper, and we're   

399
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,872
    going to blend it up and    
    we're going to make mojo.   

400
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,540
        RAUL GONZALEZ SR:       
      First, garlic, salt,      

401
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:59,610
  a little pepper, lemon, wine. 

402
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:00,945
          And we blend.         

403
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:01,946
    GUY FIERI: And that's it.   

404
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:02,880
              Yep.              

405
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,816
        In 2009, Guy was        
        in the red light.       

406
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,418
     I was sitting out there    
      at the traffic light.     

407
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,353
  And he had the sunroof open.  

408
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,154
     That's what I smelled.     

409
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,355
    And he smelled the mojo.    

410
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:12,156
           The garlic.          

411
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,224
          Take a whiff.         

412
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,492
           He came in.          

413
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:17,895
  It was totally spontaneous--  
      you know, unexpected.     

414
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,831
       You like the mojo?       

415
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,232
        I love the mojo.        

416
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,300
    You've got to love that.    

417
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:23,968
    I just had a mojo moment.   

418
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,236
       RAUL GONZALEZ JR.:       
         Now the mojo is        

419
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,438
 on the tostones steak sandwich.

420
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:30,341
        We make the steak       
         with some mojo.        

421
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:37,715
       We cut in half and       
       fry the plantains.       

422
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,783
  RAUL GONZALEZ JR.: Instead of 
  using a baguette for a steak  

423
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,386
      sandwich, let's pound     
      it, let's re-fry it,      

424
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,722
     let's throw some steak     
    on it-- some red onions,    

425
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:48,059
  some pico de gallo, cilantro, 
     avocado, and it's good     

426
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,395
         and it's light.        

427
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:52,664
       Table two, tostones      
         steak sandwich.        

428
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,331
        It has the crunch       
        of the tostones,        

429
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,601
         the soft of the        
        avocado, and then       

430
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,203
   the juiciness of the steak.  

431
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,604
 MAN: It's the type of plantain 
     that's not super sweet.    

432
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,074
       It was all amazing.      

433
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,743
       Simple ingredients       
      with a lot of flavor.     

434
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,745
  I think you guys are kind of  
  leading the way in California 

435
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:08,946
       about taking Cuban       
         food out there.        

436
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,682
   Thank goodness mom's boss.   

437
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,550
              Yeah.             

438
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:16,220
    Now, mom may be the boss,   
  but those fresh Cuban feasts  

439
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,890
   really rule this Cali spot.  

440
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,694
 And coming up, at a ski resort,
  a place in Park City, Utah--  

441
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,562
        This is basically       
         an umami bomb.         

442
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,497
     GUY FIERI: With comfort    
     plates to warm you up.     

443
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,367
     You've got a sweet and     
     heat a meat can't beat.    

444
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,302
      And vegan spins that      
      won't weigh you down.     

445
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:37,341
      Back in 2014, I found     
        a surprising spot       

446
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,211
      at the base of a ski      
    lift in Park City, Utah.    

447
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,947
   It was dishing out anything  
     but your average slope     

448
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,282
         side standards.        

449
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:48,419
And nowadays, you can still find
 good grub plus fresh new spins 

450
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:51,689
    at the Silver Star cafe.    

451
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:52,824
   WAITRESS: Pork osso bucco.   

452
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,825
      You think about these     
   dishes when you're not here  

453
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,028
      and you want to come      
    back and get them again.    

454
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,297
  After a day of skiing, you're 
   looking for something more   

455
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,032
   than a dog and a hamburger.  

456
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:03,968
    Here it is, Silver Star--   
  where you get fantastic food, 

457
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,903
    great people, great area.   

458
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,571
    GUY FIERI: That's exactly   
       what I thought when      

459
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:10,041
   I hit the place up in 2014.  

460
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:12,777
          Look at that.         

461
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,912
   I've been in the restaurant  
      business all my life.     

462
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,649
      The stress of working     
        in the restaurant       

463
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:21,786
      is completely turned      
     off when you have this.    

464
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,454
     And that's pretty much     
       what Jeff and Lisa       

465
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:27,659
   Ward were looking for when   
 they opened this place in 2010.

466
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,793
       I just want to know      
      whose idea this was.      

467
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,262
         I think it was         
        a combined idea.        

468
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,063
     You and your daughter?     

469
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:32,864
              Yeah.             

470
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:33,931
              Yeah.             

471
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,733
        How's the average       
       skier taking this?       

472
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,068
           The average          
       skier that comes in      

473
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:39,136
  loves it, because we're right 
 here at the bottom of the chair

474
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:39,938
    cooking it from scratch.    

475
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,005
   We're cooking it to order.   

476
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,139
  WAITER: Mushroom stroganoff.  

477
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,540
               OK.              

478
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,209
   So we're going to be making  
 the spaetzle for the vegetarian

479
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,010
      mushroom stroganoff.      

480
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,011
     Love me some spaetzle.     

481
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,546
         We'll start off        
         with the flour.        

482
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:49,613
            Sift it.            

483
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:50,815
     [makes swishing noise]     
    Oh sorry, sound effects.    

484
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:51,949
     [makes swishing noise]     
              - No.             

485
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,284
           I like it.           

486
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,686
 When Guy visited last time, we 
 had a chef who was helping us. 

487
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:59,023
  It was fun watching Guy work  
   with Dave when he was here.  

488
00:15:59,059 --> 00:15:59,823
           Good, chef.          

489
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:00,625
           We're done.          

490
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,559
               OK.              

491
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:02,960
  Create a little hole, there.  

492
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,162
        Toss in the eggs.       

493
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:06,764
      A little warmed milk,     
      a little water, salt.     

494
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,732
 Start working it with my hands.

495
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,566
        You want a really       
       nice, sticky dough.      

496
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,568
       I've got a spaetzle      
        maker over here.        

497
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,972
         (SINGING) Roll         
        out the spaetzle.       

498
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:15,373
            Yes, sir.           

499
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,508
   We're just going to take it  
 into this little scoopy thingy.

500
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,643
  So you just slide it into the 
 boiling water, back and forth. 

501
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:23,647
The sliding action will actually
 cut the dough once it goes in. 

502
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:26,717
         And we just put        
        it in an ice bath       

503
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:29,120
      and then we saute it      
     at the time of service.    

504
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,988
       So now we're going       
      to assemble the dish.     

505
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,256
  Get a little oil on the pan.  

506
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:35,059
       Red onion, a touch       
      of garlic, mushrooms.     

507
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:36,393
     Give it a little toss.     

508
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,329
   One of the keys to this is   
  the roasted vegetable stock.  

509
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,331
    Add a little bit of sour    
    cream right off the bat.    

510
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,534
  That's where you kind of get  
 that classic stroganoff flavor.

511
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:48,005
      Chive, salt, pepper.      

512
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,207
        We're going to be       
      plating the spaetzle.     

513
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,476
      This is the mushroom.     

514
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,213
  Just a touch more sour cream, 
 and then a little bit of chive.

515
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,347
          There you go.         

516
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,616
     That is the vegetarian     
      mushroom stroganoff.      

517
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,450
      Boom, boom, mushroom.     

518
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,090
    I wanted this to be good.   

519
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,025
   I just can't say it's good.  

520
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:11,529
  I can say it's great, though. 

521
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,501
    He just kept digging in.    

522
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:17,701
   We appreciate seeing that.   

523
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,170
        My friend, you've       
        done quite well.        

524
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:20,971
      Thank you very much.      

525
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,506
          The food they         
       made on Triple D--       

526
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,907
           Outrageous.          

527
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:24,709
   MAN: --everyone loves it--   

528
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,176
              Wow.              

529
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,045
 MAN: --but they keep freshening
  up the menu with new options, 

530
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:29,447
            as well.            

531
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,249
   So about a year and a half   
  ago, I took over as head chef 

532
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,116
         in the kitchen.        

533
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:33,383
  Yeah, those are looking good. 

534
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,921
      We wanted to focus on     
     a little lighter style.    

535
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,324
       We opted to come up      
      with a vegan recipe.      

536
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,059
       These are our vegan      
        jackfruit tacos.        

537
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:44,062
      So we heat a pan with     
      a little bit of oil.      

538
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,130
       We add diced onion.      

539
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,932
     We'll let that go until    
      it starts to soften.      

540
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,067
        Now I'm going to        
       add our jackfruit,       

541
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:53,471
    and we'll let this cook a   
   bit and get a little color.  

542
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,608
 We'll add just a touch of oil, 
   fresh garlic, chili powder,  

543
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,210
    paprika, salt and pepper.   

544
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,745
      We use quite a bit of     
     seasoning here to give     

545
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,213
  nice flavor to the jackfruit. 

546
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:03,680
       Warm our tortillas.      

547
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,415
 These are ready, nice and warm.

548
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:07,285
       A mixture of green       
        and red cabbage.        

549
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,485
       Jackfruit filling.       

550
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,621
     Now we're going to add     
      the red pepper crema.     

551
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:12,356
        It's got roasted        
        red bell peppers,       

552
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:15,693
        cashews, almonds,       
       nutritional yeast,       

553
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,896
  which adds a little bit of a  
   cheesy flavor to the crema.  

554
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,799
      Garlic powder, almond     
     milk, salt and pepper.     

555
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:25,102
     Run it for three or so     
   minutes until it thickens.   

556
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:28,372
  Now we'll add a dollop of our 
  cherry tomato pico de gallo.  

557
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:31,842
   Jackfruit tacos are ready.   

558
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:34,112
      WOMAN: Jackfruit has      
      the texture of meat.      

559
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,581
  It has a little bit of spice, 
 just the right amount of heat. 

560
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,983
         It's not heavy,        
      fill-your-belly food.     

561
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:40,118
       They're delicious.       

562
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,053
      These are incredible      
      things and it really      

563
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:46,457
 shows the creativity that Jeff 
 has brought to this restaurant 

564
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:48,859
 now that he's behind the line. 

565
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:51,461
      The guests seem to be     
  responding well to the food.  

566
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:53,531
  I love the Brussels sprouts.  

567
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,932
       JEFF WARD: We take       
     fresh Brussels sprouts,    

568
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,535
    fry them until they start   
    to crisp up, drain them,    

569
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:58,803
 and put them in the pizza oven.

570
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,204
         I want to crisp        
      them up a little bit      

571
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:02,940
and have some of that bitterness
    that comes from the char.   

572
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:06,009
      We serve that with a      
       fish sauce caramel,      

573
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,345
   which is water and sugar--   

574
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,013
        we let that cook        
       and start to color.      

575
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:11,348
    Take it off the heat, add   
     some brown sugar, fish     

576
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:14,851
   sauce, salt and lime juice.  

577
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:18,222
      Stir to mix all that.     

578
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,357
    Mix things up just a bit.   

579
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,559
        This is basically       
         an umami bomb--        

580
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:23,961
     really rich in flavor.     

581
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:27,497
 Garnish with some crispy garlic
  chips, freshly sliced Fresno  

582
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,567
   chili, and a slice of lime.  

583
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:32,236
    WAITRESS: Fried Brussels    
        sprouts for you.        

584
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,837
    MAN: They're really kind    
      of this great balance     

585
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:37,375
   of sweet, spicy, with that   
  garlic and that Asian fusion. 

586
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,310
        It's one of those       
        addicting plates.       

587
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:42,780
  It's sweet, it's salty, it's  
  a little bit hot in the end.  

588
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:44,849
       The fried garlic on      
     top gives it a crunch.     

589
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,785
      You just want to keep     
      having another bite.      

590
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,790
     You've got a sweet and     
     heat a meat can't beat.    

591
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,826
        At a ski resort.        

592
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,194
  Being featured on the show--  

593
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:58,796
       it's the gift that       
        keeps on giving.        

594
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,531
        People plan their       
    vacations around the fact   

595
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,133
        that they've seen       
         us on the show.        

596
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:04,402
       GUY FIERI: Have you      
        ever seen a place       

597
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:06,537
   at the bottom of a ski run   
    that has food like this?    

598
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:07,338
               No.              

599
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:08,472
            Yourself?           

600
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:12,009
   I rest my case, your honor.  

601
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,210
      I mean, the evidence.     

602
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,812
  The evidence is overwhelming. 

603
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,947
      These Triple D joints     
       are making the case      

604
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:21,151
   for fresh and healthy takes  
  alongside oldies but goodies. 

605
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,820
        From the original       
      Triple D OG, Kelly's      

606
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:27,557
    Diner in Somerville Mass,   
 where the decor may stay retro,

607
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:30,894
       but the menu keeps       
       up with the times.       

608
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,097
     And Mambos cafe, where     
   the aroma of classic Cuban   

609
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,834
         calls to you in        
      Glendale, California.     

610
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,502
       And the Silver Star      
       cafe in Park City,       

611
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:42,506
 Utah, with new, lighter dishes 
  to help you shred the slopes. 

612
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,508
     And we'll keep checking    
   in with all the old school   

613
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:48,779
      Triple D joints right     
    here on Triple D nation.    

614
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,047
          What is that?         

615
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,649
 This is great people watching. 

616
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:53,050
  Does this go on all the time? 

617
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:56,787
         CHEF: That does        
       happen quite a bit.      

618
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,356
        GUY FIERI: Crazy.
