118
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,459
       A little bit of the fat  
     that's still left on there.

119
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:21,660
                  Now we're     
              just gonna cut it 

120
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:25,196
              into the chunks   
           we all know and love.

121
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:26,765
    Look at that.               

122
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,800
 You don't get that             
   in California.               

123
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,602
      Look at that "nobule"     
            of meat.            

124
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,070
 Is that food talk?             

125
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,073
  This is a winner              
     right here.                

126
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,341
     Oh, daddy.                 

127
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,943
   That is money.               

128
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,544
         That is money.         

129
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,546
               Now, here comes  
               the hot sauce.   

130
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,548
     Oh, the double cayenne     
            delight.            

131
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,885
           The brisket          
   is just tender, pull-apart.  

132
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,353
               Mm.              
        Oh.                     

133
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:50,355
        Now, a lot of times,    
        people think about      

134
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,557
     Kansas City barbecue sauce 
     being super tomato-y.      

135
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:53,825
        This is my kind of mix. 

136
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,893
Good vinegar,                   
a little kick of that molasses. 

137
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,429
        The heat's not too      
        over the top,           

138
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:58,697
        but the key             
        is the tenderness.      

139
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:01,299
        Look at this smoke ring 
        right here.             

140
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,201
It just falls apart.            
    It's perfect.               

141
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:04,503
  Burnt end dinner.             

142
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,104
                 MAN:           
       This is a real burnt end.

143
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,772
As good as you'll find          
   in Kansas City.              
                 Absolutely.    

144
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,775
       They are delicious.      

145
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,042
      Now that I can't eat      
           anymore --           

146
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:12,844
         I know he can.         
   He's got to race on Sunday.  

147
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,579
   Matter of fact.              
     But when we come back,     

148
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:17,048
  we are gonna try              
  some more fantastic barbecue. 

149
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,583
           We're here           
     at B.B.'s Lawnside BBQ.    

150
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:19,618
      See you in a minute.      

151
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:28,460
          Welcome back,         
   "Triple D" hanging out here  

152
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,595
     at B.B.'s Lawnside BBQ.    

153
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:31,997
In Kansas City, Missouri.       

154
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,498
    And that's Clint Bowyer.    

155
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,665
    You know him from NASCAR.   

156
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,801
        Listen, Chef Mike       
   has been rocking the house   

157
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,136
    on some awesome barbecue.   

158
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,005
  I don't want to eat any more. 
     I don't want to eat --     

159
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,608
           but please,          
   what are you going to make?  
            We're going to make 
           our barbecue sundae. 

160
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:45,344
        [ Dramatically ]        
        Sundae, sundae, sundae. 

161
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,012
              [ Dramatically ]  
              Must be race day. 

162
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:47,946
            Race day.           

163
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,748
              We're gonna make  
               a Boston butt.   

164
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,416
           What are we          
      gonna season it with?     

165
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,818
     The 1,000-year-old pit     
 does all the seasoning for us. 

166
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:56,154
     And what we're gonna do is,
      when we pull it back out, 

167
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,288
         we re-season the pork. 

168
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:59,825
     No seasoning, no salt,     
       no pepper, no nada?      

169
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,426
                 No nothing.    
                 No nothing.    

170
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,361
     In the smoker 12 hours,    
          no seasoning.         

171
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:04,362
       This I got to see.       

172
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:05,797
                Let's do it.    
           Here we go.          

173
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,302
          What are we into now? 

174
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:12,838
         Well, we're gonna make 
           our pork seasoning.  

175
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,906
     <i> Now</i> we're gonna season    
            the pork?           
                    Yes.        

176
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,441
          We're gonna start out 
          with seasoning salt.  

177
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:20,479
 We are gonna add brown sugar,  
 white sugar, and black pepper. 

178
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,520
           All right.           
    12-something-plus hours.    

179
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:31,923
    See, when you can wiggle    
   that bone out like that...   

180
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,324
   That is on time              
 right there, baby.             

181
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,126
    I'll get you some bling.    
     Have that all done up.     

182
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,195
  Yeah, that'd make             
  a nice necklace.              

183
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,330
         Now what we're gonna do

184
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:39,731
     is we're just gonna simply 
           pull the pork.       

185
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,400
             See that nice bark 
               and smoke line   

186
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:43,735
              and good richness 
                  in there.     

187
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,338
  You know, it is unbelievable  
   the flavor that's in that.   

188
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,473
         Pork by itself         
        has great flavor,       

189
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,275
        with all that fat       
 and the bone being close to it.

190
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,811
        Let me just taste       
          a little bit.         

191
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,546
   I want to see what's gonna   
      happen with this rub.     

192
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,347
 So, you're just gonna take it  
 and give it a little sprinkle? 
                     Mm-hmm.    

193
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,283
  Can Clint do the sprinkling?  
                     Yeah.      

194
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,351
              Go ahead, Clint.  

195
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:00,685
     Thank you.                 

196
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:03,455
         Just one good handful, 
              don't be shy.     

197
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,956
              Now we're ready   
           to build the sundae. 

198
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,827
           We're gonna start out
            with our pit beans. 

199
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,996
           Next, we're gonna add
               our coleslaw.    

200
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,034
          You ever see          
       anything like this?      
     No. Never.                 

201
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,036
     Pulled pork,               

202
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:21,773
     and top that               
     with a dill pickle spear,  

203
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,976
     a little bit of sauce.     

204
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,178
     And that's                 
     our barbecue sundae, guys. 

205
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,046
     Bottoms up.                

206
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:33,050
        So, the beans --        

207
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,787
        Not super sweet.        

208
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,121
   Everything's kind of soft,   

209
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:39,390
   but the crunch of the slaw   
      really comes through.     

210
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,661
        And then you get        
     that smoky pork on top.    

211
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,196
                You're still    
             on the first layer.

212
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,531
         Man, he's lapping you.

214
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,466
That's good, brother.           

215
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:49,868
       Excellent job, man.      

216
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,036
                    Yeah.       
           Beautiful.

00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:53,472
             WOMAN:             
  You scoop it out of your jar, 

218
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,407
    and then you've got your    
  three-course meal right here. 

219
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,008
           It's a true          
      barbecue lover's meal     

220
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,343
   where you just kind of dump  
       everything together      

221
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,145
     and it's all mashed up.    

222
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:04,415
             WOMAN:             
There's so many good restaurants
  in Kansas City for barbecue,  

223
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:07,152
 but B.B.'s really pulls it all 
 together with the atmosphere.  

224
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,955
 FIERI: And with a cannot-resist
     fan favorite of Clint's    

225
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,756
 starting in the pole position. 

226
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:13,291
    Order of battered fries.    

227
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,960
  It's not really a French fry, 
  and it's not a baked potato.  

228
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,963
  It's just something different 
           and unique.          

229
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,365
           All right,           
   so what are we gonna make?   

230
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:21,966
                 We're doing    
               battered fries.

                Starts out,     
           we cut a raw potato. 

234
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,175
      What kind of potato?

           Right into our fryer 
             for five minutes.  

237
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:40,785
 Then we're gonna take 'em out, 
          let 'em cool,         

238
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,120
              and then start    
           the dredging process.

239
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,454
           All right.           

240
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:47,259
      We're gonna start out     
 with some flour, black pepper. 

241
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:48,360
               Seasoning salt.  

242
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,130
   What we're gonna do is just  
whisk that together really well.

243
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,200
              Okay.             
        And now for the batter. 

244
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,869
                We add milk.    

245
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:00,338
              Add the eggs.     
         Give 'em a quick whisk.

246
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,810
       Now we're gonna add      
seasoning salt and black pepper.

247
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:08,613
                 Give that      
           a quick little whisk.

248
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,214
         Now comes the fun part.

249
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,817
           Now we're gonna cover
           our cooked potatoes. 

250
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,621
 So you dredge 'em into the wet,
      back into the flour,      

251
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:19,157
    and now we're good to go,   
  and these are battered fries? 
                    Yes.

       straight into our fryer.

            How long?           

254

   of the texture of the lentil,

the sweet potato coming through.

00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:27,512
     Where are we on the waffle?

460
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,046
          ...is mixing          
      some homegrown flavor     

461
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:31,582
       into family dishes       
         from the South.        

462
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:34,585
            We do what I call   
         New Mexican soul food. 

463
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,587
             It's a combination 
             of Southern cooking

464
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,456
      with New Mexican cooking. 
     Very nice.                 

465
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,858
        Like green chili        
    in the mac and cheese...    

466
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,261
          homemade pico         
     on the chicken gumbo...    

467
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,996
    and a little extra kick     
    mixed in with this dish.    

468
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,799
         Chicken fried chicken, 
                 Rayna.         

469
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:51,102
  I didn't want to stop eating. 
          It's so good.         

470
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,539
           All right,           
  what are we gonna make first? 

471
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,607
Okay, we're gonna make the brine
        for the chicken.        

472
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,343
       Start off with our water.
       I'll just pour it on in. 

473
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:02,947
 Instead of using regular salt, 
 we decide to use seasoned salt 

474
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,648
   to add a little extra flavor.

475
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:05,883
                   Sugar.       

476
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:08,286
  Equal parts of sugar and salt 
       basically, got it.       

477
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:09,420
               Chopped garlic.  

478
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,688
              And then finally, 

479
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,890
 we have our two chopped onions 
           right here.          

480
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,693
Okay, so the brine's made,      
     chicken goes in.           

481
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,294
How long is the chicken         
  gonna be in there?            

482
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,296
         We're gonna be in there
              for 24 hours.     

483
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,566
           Next, we're gonna do 
                the egg wash.   
     All righty.                

484
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:25,036
         It starts off          
         with our eggs,         

485
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,837
                 then we use    
             Frank's hot sauce. 
    I like that.                

486
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:28,706
  A little on the spicier side, 
         that takes it.         

487
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,508
         A little bit of water. 

488
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,843
                Stir that up.   

489
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:34,845
      Okay.                     

490
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:37,381
         So then we take        
 our brine chicken in the flour.

491
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,515
 And into the flour.            

492
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,118
Do you season that flour        
         at all?                

493
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:41,785
              Just a little bit 
             of salt and pepper.

494
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,321
  Do you make these             
   ahead of time?               

495
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,057
How does the process            
    normally go?                

496
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:47,792
              Typically,        
       we just do 'em to order. 

497
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:48,993
  Right like this?              
                   Right.       

498
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:49,994
 To the fryer, then.            

499
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:53,264
               And that's it.   

500
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,665
    Fry 'em off?                
                  Correct.      

501
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,799
            About 10 minutes... 

502
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,869
  Be good to go?                
       ...and we're ready. Yeah 

503
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,003
First thing's first.            
               Collard greens.  

504
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:00,805
     What go in                 
your collard greens?            

505
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,273
       Onions, we do some bacon,

506
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,408
               then we put in   
             some red chili pods

507
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:05,910
   to add a little bit of spice 
             to that.           

508
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,815
             Mashed potatoes on.

509
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:12,817
               Then our gravy.  

510
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,819
     And what's                 
 in the gravy, boss?            

511
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,821
              Shallots, cream,  
                black pepper.   

512
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:20,825
              Typical things    
           for a Southern gravy.

513
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,499
             I mean,            
  that is some crispy chicken.  

514
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,967
There's a ton of crunch,        
     but it's not --            

515
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:30,968
   The breading's               
   not too heavy.               

516
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,036
And even though you had         

517
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,571
  all that hot sauce in there,  
         it's not spicy.        

518
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,039
It's just really flavorful.     

519
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:40,244
 Nice mashed potatoes,          
good, crunchy chicken,          

520
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,979
  a lot of flavor.              

521
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,515
         And my favorite        
out of all of 'em is the greens,

522
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:45,583
which I can't believe           

523
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,151
I'm finding collard greens      
      in New Mexico.            

524
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,522
  That's mandatory              
    right there.                

525
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,057
Mandatory delicious.            

526
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:56,193
What do you think of it?        

527
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:57,928
       It's really crispy       
           and tasty.           

528
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:00,063
      Moist on the inside,      
crunchy on the outside. Perfect.

529
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:04,068
   Trying to watch my weight,   
    but I can't help myself.    

530
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,070
  It's funny that they call it  
            the Nexus           

531
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,472
     because it's the point     
          where you get         

532
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:10,140
           the joining          
  of the food of this quality,  

533
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,943
    and you are getting beer    
       the likes of which       

534
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:15,212
  you are not going to be able  
     to find anywhere else.     

535
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,214
     FIERI: And while that's    
        a great analogy,        

536
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,683
         it's not quite         
  how the joint got its title.  

537
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,019
  Where'd you come up           
with the name "Nexus"?

     Seriously?                 

539
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,556
     I used to love "Star Trek"

 Scratch-made beer,
