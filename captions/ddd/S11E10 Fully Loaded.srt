00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,357
                 AND THIS ONE   
               IS CALLED PROVEL.

97
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,692
           IT IS VERY POPULAR   
         IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI.

98
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,562
                  IT MELTS      
             ALMOST LIKE A BRIE.
     NICE TANG TO IT--          
THAT'S THE ONLY DIFFERENCE.     

99
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:54,232
   TONS OF FRESH SPINACH, SOME  
 REALLY NICE CHOPPED RED ONIONS,

100
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,168
                AND THEN WE COME
                WITH OUR COCHON.

101
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,835
      AND YOU WANT TO SPREAD IT,
             BREAK IT UP.       

102
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:00,772
LAST BUT NOT LEAST, PUT A LITTLE
   ROASTED GARLIC ON TOP HERE.  

103
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,041
           THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE.
  WHAT TEMPERATURE              
YOU RUNNIN' THIS AT?            

104
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,843
              ALMOST 400...     
         (speaking indistinctly)

105
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,644
         AND THEN THREE QUARTERS
           OF THE WAY THROUGH,  

106
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,446
             AND I TAKE IT OFF, 
            THROW IT ON THE ROCK

107
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,249
            AND LET IT COOK     
       FOR A COUPLE MORE MINUTES

108
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,251
   UNTIL IT GETS NICE AND CRISPY
          ON THE BOTTOM.        
READY?                          

109
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,519
              SHE'S READY, BABY.
GOOD-LOOKIN' PIE.               

110
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:15,854
                 ONE LAST THING 
                 WE HAVE TO DO--

111
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,656
   YOU GOTTA PUT THE JIFFY-JANTY
          GARLIC BUTTER.        

112
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:20,391
    AND THEN WE'RE GONNA CUT IT.
            THERE YOU GO.       
IMPRESSIVE.                     

113
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,327
THE PORK IS RED, THOUGH.        

114
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,129
   IT SHOULD BE,                
NOT TOO MUCH SMOKE.             

115
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,598
THE GARLIC BUTTER'S NICE,       
  UNDERNEATH THE CHEESE         

116
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,199
AND THE SPINACH,                
 COMIN' THROUGH.                

117
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,335
I MEAN, YOU TALK ABOUT CRACKER  
    CRUST. IT'S FANTASTIC.      

118
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:33,871
 AND I CAN TASTE THAT--WHAT'S   
THE NAME OF THAT CHEESE AGAIN?  
                         PROVEL.

119
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,941
YOU ROCKED THAT OUT.            
      NICE JOB.                 
                 ALL RIGHT, MAN.

120
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,743
           AND HERE IS          
         YOUR BOUDREAUX.        
                     THE PORK   
                   IS EXCELLENT.

121
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,546
(man) THIS IS GREAT STUFF       
       RIGHT HERE.              
      SOME CRAZY IMPORTED CHEESE

122
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,482
              ALL THE WAY       
       FROM ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI.

123
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,750
          OUTSTANDING.          
        IT'S PHENOMENAL.        
BOUDREAUX UP.                   

124
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,819
    THEY DIDN'T USED TO HAVE    
    PIZZAS BEFORE THE STORM.    

125
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:51,423
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,       
         2005...                
                           BOOM.

126
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,492
         7 FEET OF WATER,       
   AND EVERYTHING WAS WIPED OUT.

127
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:57,095
              I LOST EVERYTHING.

    AFTER THE STORM,            
WE DROVE BY ALL THE TIME        

130
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:04,035

       INCLUDING THE FOOD.      

136
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,650
       IT'S A COMBINATION       
     OF OLD AND NEW ORLEANS.    

137
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:22,721

    IT'S FRENCH BREAD FILLED    

139
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,192
         WITH WONDERFUL         
       LOUISIANA SEAFOOD.       

140

        <i> BY THE BOATLOAD.</i>       
            VERY LARGE SANDWICH.

141
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,264
       AS BIG AS A BARGE.       

142
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,866
WHAT DO YOU GOT?                
                   TABASCO MAYO,

143
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:37,001
       WHICH GOES ON OUR BARGE--
             THE SANDWICH.      

144
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,404
         AND WE START WITH MAYO,
           CALLED BLUE PLATE.   

145
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,473
               HABANERO TABASCO.
HE'S JUST DOUSIN' IT            
      ON THERE.                 

146
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,542
        THEN WE GO WITH A LITTLE
          GARLIC TABASCO SAUCE. 

147
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,479
       LAST ONE--SWEET AND SPICY
            TABASCO SAUCE.      

148
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,548
           THEN YOU WHISK IT UP 
          TO A NICE, PINK COLOR.

149
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,682
AND THAT'S ALL GOOD TO GO       
     FOR THE BARGE.             

150
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,684
 NOT NEARLY AS INTIMIDATING AS--
     WHOO, THERE'S THE HEAT.    

151
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:56,387
                           YEAH?
(whistles) YOU GET THAT SWEET   
   RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING,      

152
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,690
    AND THEN...                 
(makes funny noise)             
                   READY TO FRY 
                   SOME SEAFOOD?

153
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,225
ALL OF THIS IS GOING            
  ON ONE SANDWICH?              

154
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,561
WHAT HUMAN EATS THAT?           
           THREE OR FOUR OF 'EM.

155
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,231
                    WE START    
                WITH THE SHRIMP.
SEASONED FLOUR                  
 OR JUST A.P.?                  

156
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,100
        THIS IS JUST A.P. FLOUR.
          WE DUST IT WITH THAT. 

157
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,169
             AND THEN WE ROLL IT
             IN THE BUTTERMILK. 
WHAT DO YOU GOT?                

158
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,737
           IT'S CREOLE SEASONING
              AND BUTTERMILK    

159
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,372
            AND EGG, OF COURSE--
              IT'S AN EGG WASH. 

160
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,841
             NOW THE CORN FLOUR.
    AND WHERE DOES              
THE SEAFOOD COME FROM?          

161
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,712
         RIGHT OFF OF OUR COAST.
          THERE'S YOUR SHRIMP.  
OKAY, SO THE OYSTERS            
     ARE FRESH.                 

162
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,180
                  THE OYSTERS   
              ARE FRESH SHUCKED.

163
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,049
AND WHAT KIND OF FISH?          
                THAT IS CATFISH.

164
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,852
FARM-RAISED?                    
                  HERE OUTSIDE  
                 OF NEW ORLEANS.

165
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:29,220
ALL RIGHT, LET'S FRY IT UP      
  AND MAKE THE SANDWICH.        
                           OKAY.

166
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,189
   NOW WE GOTTA COOK            
ALL THIS SEPARATELY...          
                     (speaking  
                   indistinctly)

167

168
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,726
          SO YOU HAVE TO COOK IT
                SEPARATELY,     

169
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,729
      'CAUSE THEY DON'T ALL COOK
             THE SAME WAY.      
WHERE DO YOU WANT               
ALL OF IT, BOSS?

  RIGHT UP TOP?                 
A LOT OF SEAFOOD.

   THE VERY SPECIAL FRENCH BREAD
     THAT MAKES THIS SANDWICH.  

172
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:45,270
   IT'S FROM JOHN GENDUSA BAKERY
       HERE IN NEW ORLEANS.     

173
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:48,005
IT'S BEEN AROUND SINCE THE '20s.
 IT IS MY FAVORITE FRENCH BREAD.

174
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,742
    I'M GONNA COME WITH A LITTLE
     TABASCO MAYO ON BOTH SIDES.

175
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:54,413
'CAUSE YOU LIVE                 
 ON THE EDGE.                   
 THAT'S RIGHT. I LIKE THE MIXED 
    GREENS ON THIS SANDWICH.    

176
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:57,415
  START WITH A LITTLE CATFISH,  
 COME BACK WITH A LITTLE OYSTER,

177
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,885
                 COME BACK WITH 
                A LITTLE SHRIMP.
     ME EAT                     
A LITTLE OYSTER.                

178
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,888
                  YOU NOTICE,   
               I MIX 'EM ALL UP.
OYSTERS DOWN HERE IN LOUISIANA  
         ARE THE BOMB.          

179
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,224
ALL RIGHT, THEN WE'RE GONNA COME
 ACROSS WITH OUR ROMA TOMATOES. 

180
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,626
    AND THEN WE USE OUR PICKLES.

181
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:11,162
           A PO'BOY ALWAYS HAS  
        LETTUCE, TOMATO, PICKLE.

182
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:13,231
     AND THAT'S IT. THERE'S OUR 
    BARGE. WANT TO CLOSE HIM UP?

183
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:16,033
              I'VE GOT TO PUT IT
                 ON THE BOARD.  
LOOK AT THE SIZE                
 OF THIS THING.                 

184
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,036
       LET'S CUT IT. SO GO AHEAD
           AND TAKE A CHUNK.    

185
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:22,173
                I GAVE YOU ONE  
              OUT OF THE MIDDLE.
MMM, A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT       
   FROM THAT TABASCO.           

186
