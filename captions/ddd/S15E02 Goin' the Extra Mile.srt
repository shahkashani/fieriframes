415
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,933
WE SPACE THE MEAT.              

416
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,003
  WE GIVE EACH PIECE            
A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE.          

417
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:29,540
           SO IT HAS A CHANCE   
        TO GET WRAPPED BY SMOKE.
YES, EXACTLY.

WE BRAISE IT IN BEER AND WATER. 

420
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:40,051
                             ♪♪

       FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS.   

422
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,891
 NOW WE DILUTE THE BEER         
IN A LITTLE BIT OF WATER,       

423
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,361
AND THEN I'M GONNA ADD IT       
       TO THE PAN.              

424
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,765

                   AND FOIL,

              HE TOOK THE TOWELS
                   AND RAN.     

428
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,114
  THEN WE HAVE                  
TO PULL THE PORK.               

429
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,516

433
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:23,060
THERE'S NEVER ANYTHING WRONG    
WHEN YOU HAVE PORK AND BEER.    

434
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,463
   WHAT'S THE REST OF THE CIRCUS
            WE GOT HERE?

441
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,685
 THE CORNBREAD'S NICE AND SWEET,
  EVERYTHING GOES ALONG WITH IT.

442
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:51,622

                  ON THE ISLAND.

              FOR JOANNE.       

453
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,514
       IT MAKES YOU WANT        
         TO COME BACK.          

454
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,784

455
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:20,917
          OTHER THAN THE TYPICAL
               PLATE LUNCH,     

456
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,321

     IT'S JUST ONO-LICIOUS.     

458
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,592
    MAN, IF ANYBODY             
WOULD EVER HAVE TOLD ME         

459
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,995
I WAS GONNA EAT A TOFU BURGER   
        AND DIG IT...           
               I WOULD HAVE BEEN
                 SHOCKED. YES.  

460
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:33,797
     I TELL YOU, MY SISTER

                  WHAT WAS THAT?

469
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,417
