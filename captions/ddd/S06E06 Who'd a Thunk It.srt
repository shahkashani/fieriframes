  <i> THE JAMAICAN NATIONAL DISH.</i>  

206
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:06,851
         CURRIED GOAT IS        
         MY FAVORITE.           

207
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,054
            GOAT IS WHAT WE USE 
            AT EVERY FUNCTION.  

208
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,256
     WEDDINGS,                  
     EVERY KIND OF CELEBRATION.

SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA            
GET BUSY ON IT,                 
OKAY, HEY-HO.                   

210
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:18,930
IT'S NOT SCARY,                 
IT'S JUST THE NOISE.            

211
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,865
OKAY, SO NOW THAT               
WE'VE GOT OUR GOAT              
CHOPPED UP,                     

212
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:23,401
WHAT'S THE GIDDY UP HERE?       
             PEPPER, HABONEROS, 

213
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,071
    THYME, SOME ONIONS, GARLIC, 

214
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:29,074
       JAMAICAN SEASONING,      
       A COMBINATION OF GARLIC, 
       BLACK PEPPER, SALT,      

215
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,943
         A LITTLE BIT OF CUMIN. 

216
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,679
AND THEN A COUPLE OF            
YOUR SECRET SPICES.             
                 A COUPLE OF MY 
                 SECRET SPICES. 

217
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,214
YOU'LL TELL ME OFF              
CAMERA RIGHT?                   

218
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,549
I'M NOT GONNA LET               
EVERYBODY KNOW.                 

219
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,286
      AND THEN CURRY POWDER,    
      I MIGHT NEED A LITTLE BIT 
      OF WATER IN THERE.        

220
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:45,090
OKAY, IS THAT GOOD?             

221
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,692
SOMETIMES I DO A LITTLE TASTE,  
MAN, YOU'VE BEEN IN THE KITCHEN.

222
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:51,228
I DON'T TASTE RAW GOAT,         
MMM-MM, NIBBLE ON THAT.         

223
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:54,198
SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?            
               WE MARINATE THIS 
                     OVERNIGHT. 

224
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,368
            SO LET'S MARINATE IT
            AND COOK IT.        

225
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,503
         A LITTLE BIT OF WATER  
         AND PUT IT IN THE POT. 

226
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:01,139
WHAT DO YOU CALL GOAT           
IN JAMAICAN.                    
                           GOAT.

227
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:05,043
OKAY, LITTLE MORE WATER         
AND THEN WE'RE GOING            
TO LET IT SIMMER.               

228
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,046
          FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES. 
REALLY?                         

229
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,381
           IT DEPENDS ON        
           HOW OLD THE GOAT IS. 

230
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,850
       THIS IS PRETTY YOUNG,    
       THE MEAT IS VERY TENDER. 

231
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,585
             THE GOAT IS READY. 
LOOK AT THE COLOR               
ON THAT.                        

232
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:17,222
WITH WHITE RICE                 
AND UNCOOKED CABBAGE            
AND CARROTS.                    

233
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,526
OH MY GOSH, THERE'S             
A LITTLE HEAT IN THE BACK.      

234
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:25,263
A LITTLE BIT OF                 
HABANERO COMING THROUGH,        
AND TENDER.                     

235
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,465
THAT'S THE BITE RIGHT THERE.    

236
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:30,535
A LITTLE SWEETNESS OF THE CURRY,
A LITTLE BIT OF THE HABANERO,   

237
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,937
THE TEXTURE OF THE RICE         
AND THE BITTERNESS              
OF THE CABBAGE.                 

238
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,607
CAN'T SAY I EAT                 
A LOT OF GOAT,                  

239
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,475
BUT THAT'S GO-TO GOAT,          
DELICIOUS.                      

240
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,543
         IT'S VERY GOOD.        

241
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,347
      RIGHT COMBINATION         
      OF SPICES AND SEASON,     
      CLASSIC CURRY GOAT.       

242
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:43,882
CLASSIC.                        
                       CLASSIC. 

243
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,816
              THE FOOD IS ALWAYS
              DELICIOUS.        

244
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,118
   IT'S JUST LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER
   COOKING IN HER KITCHEN.      

245

              SAUTEED VEGETABLES
              AND CABBAGE.      

247
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,358
              IF WE HAD A COUPLE
              OF PALM TREES.    

248
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:57,095
           THE SAME PRESENTATION
           YOU GET AT HOME.     

249
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,697
        WITH ALL THE SAME SIDES.

      RICE AND PEAS.            

252
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,904
ARE THEY RICE AND PEAS,         
OR RICE-N-PEAS?                 

253
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,973
               RICE COOKED WITH 
               RED BEANS.

YOU STOPPED THE CONFUSION.      

255
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,844
   JAMAICAN FOOD IS SOMETHING   
   THAT YOU'RE NOT USED         
   TO SEEING.                   

256
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,448

   REALLY ARE AUTHENTIC.

    CARROTS, SOME DUMPLINGS.    

261
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:29,193
WHAT'S THE NOODLE RIGHT THERE?  

262
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,529
OH, THAT'S NOT A NOODLE.        
           THAT'S NOT A NOODLE. 

263
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:34,999
           OKAY.                

264

VERY GOATY,                     
WHAT'S THAT PART?               
         IT'S CALLED THE TRIPE. 

265

IT IS TENDER.                   

266
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:43,274
ONCE YOU GET OVER               
THE IDEA,                       
IT'S VERY FLAVORFUL.            

267
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:46,144
            I HAVEN'T HAD GREAT 
            GOAT SOUP SINCE

            LITTLE SLICE IN IT.

WE'RE GONNA FRY HIM.            

279
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,975
BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT, WE'RE    
GONNA MAKE OUR BROWN SAUCE?

AND BRING IT OVER?              
                            YES.

        DROP IT IN THE HOT OIL.

        MIGHT TAKE ABOUT        
        TWO TO THREE MINUTES.

NICE FLAVOR.                    

300
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,825
                 NOT TOO SPICY? 
NOT AT ALL.                     

301
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,095
THAT'S GREAT,                   
DO I GET TO KEEP THE HEAD?      
                           YEAH.

302
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,231
AND EAT IT?                     
           I LOVE MY FISH HEAD, 
          EVERY LAST BIT OF IT. 

303
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,500
          THEN YOU AND I ARE    
          THE PERFECT DATE.     

304
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,635
                         GOOD.  

305
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:20,171
      THAT HAS BIG FLAVOR,      
      EXCELLENT FLAVOR.         

306
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,040
         NICE, LIGHT,           
         ALWAYS PERFECT.        

307
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,510
  THE FOOD IS JUST EXCEPTIONAL. 

308
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,312
         GOOD AFTERNOON.        

309
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,113
        THE CURRIED GOAT.       

310
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,049
   I CAN COME TO A RESTAURANT   
   AND JUST FEEL AT HOME.       

311
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,717

  FOR JAMAICAN FOOD.            

314

EVERYBODY THAT COMES IN         
LOOKS REALLY HAPPY.

    CHECK OUT BACKROAD PIZZA.   

326
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,028
        WONDERFUL PIZZA.

          IT'S AWESOME.

   IT'S UNIQUE, IT'S SPECIAL,   
   NO COMPARISON.               

329
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:23,902
    THE PIZZA'S ALWAYS GOOD.    

330
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,169
      ONE SLICE CHEESE IN.

<i>NEW MEXICO STYLE.</i>

IT'S ALL ABOUT.                 

335
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,312
   I'VE GOTTA HAVE MORE PIZZA   
   WITH GREEN CHILES ON IT.     

336
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,147
           THAT ROCKS.          

337
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:38,649
    BEST FLAVORS YOU'LL EVER    
    EXPERIENCE IN A PIZZA.      

338
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:42,720
  <i> CRANKED OUT BY SELF-TAUGHT</i>   
  <i> PIZZA FANATIC, ROBIN HARDIE</i>

    THEY HAVE THE BEST PIZZA    
    AROUND.                     

341
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,129
    <i> AND THE KEY TO THEIR PIE</i>   
    <i> IS THE CORNMEAL CRUST.</i>     

342
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:54,265
   I THINK THE CRUST MAKES IT   
   CRISPY, BUT NOT CRUNCHY.     

343
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,535
WE ROLL IT REALLY, REALLY THIN, 
AND WE ROLL IT IN CORNMEAL.     

344
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,737
CORNMEAL GIVES IT               
A REALLY SWEET CRUNCHY FLAVOR   

345
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:01,873
THAT I THINK IS BETTER          
THAN FLOUR.                     

346
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,341
     HANDS DOWN, I'M A CORNMEAL 
     CRUNCH KIND OF GUY.        

347
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,278
          LET'S GET IT ON,      
          START WITH THE WATER. 

348
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,347
 SO NOT COLD, THE WATER'S GOTTA 
 BE WARM ENOUGH                 
 SO WE CAN ACTIVATE THE YEAST.  

349
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:13,217
RIGHT, DRY YEAST, AND THEN,     
GIVE IT A MINUTE                
TO START DOING IT'S MAGIC.      

350
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,620
        ALL RIGHT, EXTRA VIRGIN 
        OLIVE OIL.              

351
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,823
             NOW, ON THE FLOUR, 
                   HIGH GLUTEN? 
HIGH GLUTEN.                    

352
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:21,359
SO YOU GET A NICE               
STRETCH TO IT,                  
A NICE ELASTICITY.              

353
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:22,893
SALT AND A LITTLE BIT           
OF SUGAR.                       

354
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,430
THE SALT AND OLIVE OIL          
IS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO PICK UP
THAT FLAVOR FROM.               

355
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:29,233
       NOW THIS IS GOING TO RUN 
       FOR 15 TO 20 MINUTES.    

356
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,970
    THEN YOU CRANK UP THE SPEED 
    AFTER IT GETS A LITTLE      
    GENERAL MIX TO IT.          

357
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,172
YES, SO FLOUR DOESN'T FLY       
EVERYWHERE.                     

358
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,707
 THIS LOOKS LIKE A PILLOW FIGHT 
 WITH ONE ALUMINUM BAT.         

359
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:40,311
THERE IT IS, COVER IT UP        
FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES.           

360
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:43,714
WOW, LOOK AT HOW                
THAT PROOFED UP.                

361
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,585
GET A PICTURE                   
NEXT TO THAT.                   
      ABOUT 13 OUNCES OF DOUGH. 

362
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,788
    LOOK AT THIS LITTLE         
    TECHNIQUE THAT YOU HAVE     
    WHERE IT'S SPINNING FOR YOU.

363
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:53,190
      HOW ARE YOU, ARE YOU      
      APPLYING MORE PRESSURE    
      ON THE RIGHT SIDE?        

364
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,727
             A LITTLE BIT MORE, 
             GOES AROUND.       

365
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:58,996
       FRESH CORNMEAL,          
       THIS GOES RIGHT ON HERE. 

366
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,799
                     OLIVE OIL. 
JUST TO BROWN IT UP             
NICELY.                         

367

ON EVERY PIZZA?                 

368
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,337
I DON'T THINK                   
I'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE.          
                     THE SAUCE, 
             MOZZARELLA CHEESE. 

369
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,007
LET'S MAKE THE TEXAN.           

370
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,142
YOU MAKE YOUR OWN               
ITALIAN SAUSAGE I TAKE IT.      
                            YES.

00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,077

        GIVES IT A LITTLE KICK. 

372
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,879
MMM, IT'S DELICIOUS.            

373
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,482
GREEN CHILE MAKES IT.           
        MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE. 

374
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,219
             LOTS OF PEPPERONI, 
                CANADIAN BACON. 
IS THIS A MEAT LOVERS DELIGHT   
OR WHAT?                        

375
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,955
                TEXANS LOVE IT, 
                THERE YOU GO.   

376
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:25,356
                   THERE IT IS.

LOOK AT THAT.                   

379
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:36,100

I COULD READ THROUGH THAT,      
THAT'S NICE.
