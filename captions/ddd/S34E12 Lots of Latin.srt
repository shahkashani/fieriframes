 Once the beans get

00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,512
          this close to         
      the Canadian border.      

467
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,180
               Tinga brisket.   
               Beans and rice.  

468
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,382
I'm from California, and this is
   the first place in Vermont   

469
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,651
    that I felt encapsulated    
      what a true taco is.      

470
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,921
      Real deal                 
Southwestern, Mexican.          

471
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,191
 I didn't know how much I needed
              Charlie's tacos.  

472
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,660
  FIERI: That craving took hold 
      when Charlie Sizemore     

473
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,663
        first rolled out        
     his taco cart in 2014.     

474
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,398
         Then blew it up        
      to a brick and mortar     

475
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,468
  bringing a West coast flavor  
   all the way to New England.  

476
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,936
        Where do you get license
                  to taco?      

477
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,472
 I had family living            
in California and Arizona,      

478
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:42,807
  so have a really              
 close relationship.            

479
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:43,874
           We've had tacos there
                   before.      

480
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,543
        Yes.                    

481
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,478
  Two al pastor tacos for you.  

482
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,746
           I love the al pastor.

483
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:51,082
           The way they roast it
     on the spit, the pineapple.

484
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,283
    You can't get a better taco.

485
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:56,153
         It's just like         
     a religious experience.    

486
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,155
Today we're going to do         
   the al pastor.               

487
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,824
We're making our house          
       adobo.                   

488
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,226
We start with our dried spices  
    and chilies.                

489
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,494
 We toast these off.            

490
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,029
    The guajillas, the pasillas,
             and the chipotles? 

491
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,164
        Yes.                    

492
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,231
                 I like it.     
         What else are we doing?

493
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,300
Peppercorns, cloves, cumin.     

494
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,635
          Got it. Some cinnamon.
    This, I'm impressed with it.

495
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,037
              The annatto seed. 
    Yes.                        

496
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,505
                Dude, where'd   
             you learn to cook? 

497
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:15,974
  A misspent youth.             

498
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,175
         He was in a band called
               Misspent Youth.  

499
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,711
             The beautiful thing
        about that annatto seed,

500
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:23,047
     really gives that beautiful
          red hue in Latin food.

501
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,181
These go on to soak.            

502
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,184
      Let me set some background
               steeping music.  

503
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,451
   [ Spice grinder whirring ]   

504
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,387
      -You're good at that.     
   -Well, it's misspent youth.  

505
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:30,588
            We're playing a show
                  later on.     

506

Apple cider vinegar,            
raw blackened garlic.

           A little more liquid.

511
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,269
             We're going to use 
             boneless pork butt?

512
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,338
Yes. We get it cold,            
   slice it thin.               

513
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,806
              How long will you 
         let this pork marinate?

514
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,208
   At least a day.              
                       Got it.  

515
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,410

              Pineapple on top?

  Pineapple on top.

522
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,020

ground cumin, oregano, sugar,   
salt, apple cider vinegar.      

525
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:07,892
                   Great.       

526
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:13,030
     Little bit                 
 of steeping liquid.            

527
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,765
    Delicious. Love the toasting
               of the garlic.   

528
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,101
       Little kiss of the sugar.
                 Well done.     

529
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,704
Little bit of lard, tortillas.  
While these are cooking,        

530
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:23,841
I'm going to slice you          
a little bit of this al pastor. 

531
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,576
      Love the pineapple on top.

532

This is our salsa roja here.

535
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,585
           This is also probably
    one of the closest I've been

536

   to having authentic al pastor

          The tortilla is great.

539
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,595

       It's got a ton of flavor.

540
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,531
         There was a good amount

Smoky, rich, a lot of sweetness.

548
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,883
Every time I look at it,        
  my mouth waters.

    are a little hotter than    
  the other places around here. 

552
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,024
        The only problem you got
   is you played your hit single

553
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,027
             right off the bat.

00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,094
Well, you haven't had           
     the beans.                 

555
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,296
 You shouldn't sleep            
    on the beans.               

556
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:19,363
       And what does don't sleep
             on the beans mean? 

557
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:20,565
Everybody looks past            
     the beans,                 

558
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,433
   they're looking              
  at the al pastor.             

559
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:26,037
I always get the grandma's beans
    tacos, not boring beans.    

560
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,104
           I would eat          
      this this every day.      

561
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,639
                And where was   
              this recipe from? 

562
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,108
It's an old family recipe.      

563
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,242
          Oh, this I got to try.

564
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:34,779
Oil in the pan, onion,          
  carrot, serranos,             

565
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,180
garlic, little bit of cumin.    

566
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,848
             That's a lot of bit
                  of cumin.     

567
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,518
Next in are the dried           
pinto beans soaked overnight.   

568
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,919
                   Got it.      

569
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,188
Cover that with water and cook  
those until they burst.         

570
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,656
We finish it with cumin         
      and salt.                 

571
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,324
The oranges also go in          
     at the end.                

572
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,126
      Finishes                  
for about 30 minutes.           

573
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,596
Our favorite is to eat them with
the carrot habanero hot sauce.  

574
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:52,530
          Oh, this I got to see.

575
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:54,298
It's a Belizian preparation.    

576
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,535
Oil hot in a pan, onions,       
  carrots, garlic.              

577
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:58,802
          Caramelize them a bit.

578
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,671
And then we're adding           
some water just to cover.       

579
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:03,808
Now we're just blending         
these fresh habaneros.          

580
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,209
