      been here in awhile.      

444
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,534
      Back when "Triple D"      
         first started,         

445
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,803
     we went to place called    
      "Joe's Gizzard City".     

446
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,205
    And speaking of gizzards,   

447
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,273
  I'm here to check out a joint 
     that's frying gizzards,    

448
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,942
         chicken wings,         
   and anything else you want.  

449
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:13,544
      You see, their motto      
      is "You buy, we fry."     

450
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:17,148
    This is Eastside market.    

451
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,416
      Three pig skins, up!      

452
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,218
        It's like nothing       
     you've ever had before.    

453
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,419
              MAN:              
I didn't know how to explain it.

454
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,754
      It's just good food.      
       -Wings going down!       

455
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,257
 FIERI: Good food that was born 
    out of some tough times.    

456
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,227
Well, I got out of prison       
about five years ago.           

457
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:31,095
                You come out    
               and there's not  

458
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,563
               a lot of people  
    that want to give you a job.

459
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:33,665
There's not a lot of people that
want to give you an opportunity.

460
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:34,832
Nobody would give me a job.     

461
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:37,168
        But Henry Meyer's       
      parents stood by him,     

462
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,370
        helping him start       
   a fish market from scratch   

463
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,772
        that's grown into       
   a full-fledged restaurant.   

464
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,041
-So, who taught you how to cook?
   -I learned a lot in prison.  

465
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,376
  -Did you work in the kitchen? 
             -Yeah.             

466
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:46,644
       Six wing dinner up!      

467
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,246
         Everybody asks         
         for the wings.         

468
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,447
      The seasoning really      
       sets it right off.       

469
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,250
       They are excellent.      

470
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:53,384
                 What are we    
            making first, buddy?

471
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,652
Making our house seasoning.     

472
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:57,321
 Lemon pepper blend,            
    a lemon peel,               

473
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,857
    black pepper,               
   garlic powder.               

474
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:01,993
            -Got it.            
     -And then we hand mix.     

475
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,995
             Because if you put 
           your foot in there...

476
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,396
      No feet.                  

477
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,331
Okay, so, this is our dry batter
           that we're gonna use.

478
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,934
Next up, we're gonna make       
marinade for our wings.         

479
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:12,469
 Some of this house             
seasoning, seasoned salt...     

480
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,670
            -Got it.            
          -...Old Bay.          

481
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,273
     -Old Bay on the wings?     
     -Old Bay on the wings.     

482
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:17,541
        Yep.                    
We're gonna shake it up,        

483
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,210
and then we're gonna bring      
our whole case of wings...      

484
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:20,544
             And you're leaving 
             them all connected?

485
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,280
That's what everybody           
likes -- are whole wings.       

486
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,148
            And how long is this
             gonna sit on here? 

487
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,417
 At least 24 hours,             
   but usually 48.              

488
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:27,752
              And you're going  
              through how many? 

489
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:30,621
    -About 2,500 wings a day.   
  -The chicken king over here.  

490
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,157
  I got get you like the chicken
   emporium helmet or something.

491
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,425
           -Next step?          
        -We're gonna make       

492
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,960
our house chicken flour.        

493
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,495
       High-gluten flour.       
             -Okay.             

494
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,430
 Then we'll go with             
our special chicken fry.        

495
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,099
            -Got it.            
         -Seasoned salt.        

496
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:42,633
       -The Old Bay again.      
         -Old Bay. Yep.         

497
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:43,768
House seasoning here.           

498
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,369
 Granulated garlic.             
  And black pepper.             

499
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,438
 -So, you're not shy on flavor. 
              -No.              

500
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,575
           All right, so, now we
        take the seasoned wings.

501
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:52,843
       -Those go in here.       
      -Dredge them around.      

502
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,844

00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,179
              -Yep.             
       -What kind of oil?       

504
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,181
    Soy bean oil.               

505
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,984
            Come on!            
              -Awe!             

506
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,186
Now we're gonna put some of     
our house seasoning on there.   

507
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,655
        That is a mess of wings.

just soft, crunchy...           

531
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,375
   It's a really good flavor.   
   It's not heavily battered.   

532
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:58,643
              Do you know what

533
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,844
  Yeah. It's about              
the second part of the throat,  

534
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:01,879
if I'm not mistaken.

for about three hours.          

541
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:16,060
     Not long enough! The people
          love gizzards, though.

542
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,728
    We sell them                
    by the pound.

dump some water on them.

00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,611
    Yep. And then               
we're gonna put some...
