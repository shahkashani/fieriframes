A LITTLE BIT, IT THICKENED UP.  

118
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,908
WE'RE GOING TO LOAD IT UP       
    IN THIS GUY.                

119
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,644
 THIN THIS NOW WITH             
A LITTLE BIT OF WHOLE MILK.     

120
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,979
          THAT'S JUST SO 'CAUSE 
      IT WOULD BE WAY TOO COATY.

121
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,381
 RIGHT. STIR IT UP.             
NOW IT'S THIN ENOUGH.           

122
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,183
TIME TO BATTER THESE WINGS.     

123
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:13,785
                             GO.
LET'S GET THIS UP IN HERE.      

124

125
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,656
  WE'RE GONNA TAKE              
THIS BUTTERMILK BATTER          

126
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:20,259
AND WE'RE GONNA SOFTEN          
     THEM HERE.                 

127
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,660
THEY'RE GONNA RAGE IN THERE     
     FOR A SEC.                 

128
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:22,794
THROW THEM IN THE DREDGE.       

129
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,263
WE'RE GONNA PLACE IT            
     RIGHT HERE.                

130
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:25,330
GOT ALL SIX OF THESE GUYS.      

131
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,197
NOW WE'RE GONNA DROP IT.        

132
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,866
WE'RE GONNA DROP A BUTT.        

133
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:28,867
                     A WHAT?    
    A BUTT.                     

134
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:29,934
SHORT FOR BUTTERMILK.           

135
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,269
                  DROP THE BUTT!
DROPPING THE BUTT.              

136
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,403
               THAT'S SO THIN.  

137
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,272
   IT'S ALL RIGHT.              
WE CAN MAKE A LITTLE MESS.      

138
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,474
    LOOK AT THAT.               
    THERE WE GO.                

139
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:36,608
AND WE'RE GONNA SPIN IT.        

140
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,809
THERE'S ANOTHER MOVE            
  THAT WE DO HERE.              

141
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,077
SO, WE DROP IT LIKE THIS.       

142
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,680
THAT WAY, WHEN IT WANTS         
TO EXPAND, IT'S LOCKED IN.      

143
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,415
 YOU'RE GONNA START             
HEARING SOME FUNNY SOUNDS.      

144
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:44,883
           (squealing)          

145
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,551
              WHAT IS GOING ON  
                 RIGHT NOW?     

146
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:47,619
       'CAUSE                   
 IT'S STILL URGLING.            

147
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,154
            URGLING IS THE TERM?
                IT'S URGLING?   

148
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,423
I CLEARLY SHOULD JUST           
WRITE, A NEW DICTIONARY         
FOR THIS RESTAURANT.            

149
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,891
               YOU SHOULD HAVE  
         THE FUNK 'N DICTIONARY.

150
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,292
     ALL RIGHT.                 
WE CAN MAKE THE SAUCE.

157
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:03,568
   GONNA GIVE THIS              
   A LITTLE WHISK.

KIND OF INCORPORATE IT.

00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,505
  THAT'S OUR SAUCE.             

160
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:08,373
THESE WINGS ARE READY.          

161
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,575
      WOW, LOOK                 
HOW NICE THAT LOOKS.            

162
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,316
       HERE IS                  
THE CHICKEN AND WAFFLES.        

163
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,385
             I WANT TO JUST TRY 
             THE WING BY ITSELF.

164
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:22,187
                    MMM.        

165
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,922
                FRIED CHICKEN   
             IS RIGHTEOUS, MAN. 

166
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,325
 SO, IS THERE AN APPROPRIATE WAY
               THAT YOU SEE --  

167
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:29,394
      I MEAN, I'D FEEL SACRILEGE
       TO EAT THIS WITH A FORK. 

168
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,596
         I'M GONNA GO WITH THIS.

169
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:32,597
                   KIND OF      
             DOUBLE-FISTING IT. 

170
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,066
        YES.                    

171
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,268
          THE WAFFLE'S DYNAMITE.
               NICE AND CRISP.  

172
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,538
GET THE BUTTERMILK, YOU GET THE 
LITTLE SOUR COMING THROUGH THAT.

173
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,074
              THE FRIED CHICKEN 
        IS SWEET, CRISPY, SPICY.

174
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,609
                   I MEAN,      
  JUST ALL THE COMPONENTS OF IT.

175
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:45,677
             AND THEN THE SYRUP.

176
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,278
            I MEAN, THAT'S JUST 
    WHAT PUSHES IT OVER THE TOP.

177
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,881
                           MMM. 
I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

179
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,018
      IT'S REALLY CRUNCHY,      
    AND THAT'S WHY I LIKE IT.   

180
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,221
        I LOVE HOT SAUCE        
        AND MAPLE SYRUP.        

181
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,090
            IT'S ONE            
     OF MY FAVORITE THINGS.     

182
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:01,159
  <i> AND FOR THE ULTIMATE COMFORT</i> 
  <i> FOOD, THE BIRD IS THE WORD.</i>  

183
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,828
     (waitress) JIVE TURKEY.    

184
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,096
      A THANKSGIVING DINNER     
       ON TOP OF A WAFFLE.      

185
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,232
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA MAKE     
  THE JIVE TURKEY,              

186
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,234
 AND THAT STARTS OUT            
WITH OUR STUFFING BATTER.

             CARAMELIZED ONION. 

189

   I GOT OUR EGGS               
   AND ROSEMARY.

SPIN THIS THING AROUND.         

193
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,780
            SO, THIS IS GONNA GO
             IN A WAFFLE MAKER? 
THAT'S RIGHT.

                   LOAD THAT UP.

195
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,250
    I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE.
ALL RIGHT.                      

196
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:29,454
                THAT IS JUST,   
         IN SO MANY WAYS, WEIRD.

197
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,521
 WEIRD CAN BE COOL.             

198
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:31,590
AND NOW THAT THE WAFFLE'S DOWN, 

199
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,191
WE'RE GONNA START PREPARING     
  EVERYTHING ELSE.

WEIRDEST WAFFLES I'VE EVER SEEN,

202
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,599

FUNKIEST THINGS I'VE EVER TRIED.

213
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,820
  (chuckling) YEAH.             

214

219
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:15,433
               THE STUFFING --  
   IT'S THE CRUNCH, THE TEXTURE.

220
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,834
      MASHED POTATOES ARE LEGIT.

     THAT IS FUNK 'N RIDICULOUS.

00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,117

00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,736
      THE TOUCH                 
 OF THE TRUFFLE OIL.            

466
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:47,271

507
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,853
ICE IS IN THE BOTTOM            
SO IT KEEPS IT COLD             

508
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,122
  AND IT ALSO WORKS             
AS THE STEAMING LIQUID

525
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,622

530
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,361

533
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,367
                 AND THIS IS    
              HOW IT GOES HOME. 

534
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,735

                           OKAY.

         FOR THE ICE TO MELT,   

537
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:02,773

538
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,308
              IT TAKES ROUGHLY  
             ABOUT A HALF HOUR, 

539
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,976
       AND THE SHRIMP WILL GO IN
          ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH 

540
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,845
           SO, AGAIN, THE SHRIMP
            ARE NOT OVERCOOKED. 
GOT IT.                         

541
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:08,913
      AND SO, WE'RE READY TO GO.

542
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:11,649
        GET YOURSELF A BIG TRAY.

543
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,784
         AND JUST LET EVERYTHING
               POUR RIGHT OUT.  

544
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,386
OH, LOOK AT THE BROTH.          

545
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,853
     OH, THE BROTH IS FANTASTIC.

546
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,390
            THE SHELLFISH BROTH,
              THE SHRIMP BROTH, 

547
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,791
    YOU'VE GOT ALL THAT SAUSAGE.

548
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,960
        THE SAUSAGE JUST FLAVORS
          THE POTATOES SO WELL. 

549
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:26,330
        OKAY.                   

550
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:30,401
SO, THE IDEA IS THROW IT DOWN   
ON THE TABLE, CRACK IT.         

551
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,737

GET OUT OF YOUR CAR TO GET IT?
