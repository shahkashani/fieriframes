1
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:02,868
       Hey, I'm Guy Fieri,
    and you know what I need?

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,103
   I need you riding shotgun.

3
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:05,604
  I'm on my way to Flavortown.

4
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:09,241
        This is "Diners,
     Drive-Ins, and Dives."

5
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:11,543
          This trip...
 Yes, yes, yes.

6
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,612
      ...we're transporting
       your taste buds...

7
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,047
This is what "Triple D's"
     all about.

8
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:16,982
          ...on an epic
        culinary journey.

9
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:18,984
              I don't even need
                 a passport.

10
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:20,853
     We've got island fever
           in Kona...

11
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:24,089
              It's a Filipino-
       Hawaiian-American concept

12
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,724
             with his own twist.

13
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,993
    ...incredible Indonesian
           in Oregon.

14
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:29,695
             I've never had that
                   before.

15
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:30,829
        And in Chicago...

16
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,031
Come on now, up top.

17
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,466
       ...a taste of Spain
      that reigns supreme.

18
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,535
Sister, this is Flavortown,
  without question.

19
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,736
     Delicious.

20
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,438
     That's all right here,
           right now,

21
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,874
on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.

22
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:57,423
 So, I'm here in Chicago in the
  Lake View East neighborhood,

23
00:00:57,425 --> 00:00:59,725
     right across the street
 from Lincoln Park neighborhood,

24
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:00,859
   to check out a joint that,

25
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,728
        I gotta tell you,
        is in a basement.

26
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,962
      What's going on here?

27
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:05,631
    Well, a husband-and-wife
      team are knocking out

28
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:07,933
       some Spanish tapas
     that you won't forget.

29
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:11,503
     Slow down, look around,
     it's right here at mfk.

30
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:15,574
Boquerones and bread.

31
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,942
          I think that
      Chicago has the most

32
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:18,877
        interesting food
      scene in the country.

33
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,879
     This place is a shining
        example of that.

34
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,748
     30 seconds on tortilla.

35
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,051
  mfk. is this gem that serves
    coastal Spanish cuisine.

36
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:27,486
Croquettes and a ceviche.

37
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:30,789
    They really focus on the
   seafood. It's spectacular.

38
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,057
Not what you'd expect

39
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,826
         from the shores
        of Lake Michigan.

40
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:36,195
    But no surprise when you
      meet chefs and owners

41
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:40,232
   Scott and Sari Worsham, who
  are packing a culinary punch.

42
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,900
              I worked for Chef
   Charlie Trotter for 13 years.

43
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,303
Oh! One of the greatest
 in the world.

44
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:45,537
   You were in the
  business forever.

45
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,772
           Since 1988.

46
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,307
          I started in
      Santa Rosa, actually.

47
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,942
    -Santa Rosa, California?
             -Yeah.

48
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:51,877
This Is Your Life"?

49
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,145
      I understand you know
       the area somewhat.

50
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:54,346
       A bit.

51
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:56,315
     I came back
to Santa Rosa and opened

52
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:57,816
 my first restaurant
       in '96.

53
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,585
And when this
   couple opened

54
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:02,121
     their joint in Chicago,
  they modeled it after places

55
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:04,056
         they loved when
       they visited Spain.

56
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:06,325
We wanted to do something
  that had real simple,

57
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:09,161
   non-fussy food that tastes
delicious and make people happy.

58
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:11,730
 We got our seafood
 fideos here for ya.

59
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,398
Today, I'm enjoying
  the seafood fideo.

60
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,666
     Absolutely delectable.

61
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,135
    Shrimp cooked perfectly.

62
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:19,271
Noodles with really creamy sauce
  that brings it all together.

63
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,506
      -What are we making?
      -Our seafood fideos.

64
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:21,707
  You go to Spain,

65
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,475
   everybody's got
their own little style of it.

66
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,776
    How's yours?

67
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,311
           Like paella, but with
          pasta instead of rice.

68
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,814
          We take the angel hair
     pasta, roast it in the oven

69
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,582
                for about 20,
             30 minutes at 400,

70
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,317
             and cook the pasta
             till it's al dente.

71
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,252
    We're on to?

72
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:34,686
              We're gonna make
                the piperade.

73
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,155
              Put a little oil
                 in the pan.

74
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:37,656
            And then we cook our
            peppers a bit first.

75
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,658
       Add a little salt to help
    the peppers sweat the water.

76
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,293
     Gonna start
that caramelization faster

77
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:42,628
    and building
  layers of flavor.

78
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,429
               Yellow onions,
               sliced garlic.

79
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,398
   And why sliced
   versus minced?

80
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,100
          We're cooking this for
          a good amount of time,

81
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:50,135
            and the minced seems
          to get a little burnt.

82
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,538
The longer the cooking
process, the larger the garlic.

83
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,206
          -You got it.
      -Come on now, up top.

84
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,474
                 All right.

85
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:57,342
            Piquillo peppers and
           the roasted poblanos.

86
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,610
               Sherry vinegar.

87
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,279
 Most underutilized
  vinegar there is.

88
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,780
              Red chili flake,
                  paprika.

89
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,115
            -Smoked?
             -It is.

90
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:04,750
         A little bit more salt,
                   pepper,

91
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:06,285
            and then we just let
             this cook together

92
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:07,819
       for another minute or two
          to wake up the spices.

93
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,455
 Okay, and the final
step of this will be?

94
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,057
      You get the fideos rocking
                 in the oil.

95
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:13,792
 I thought the song
was "Rock Me Amadeus."

96
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:16,061
          "Rock Me --"
     It's "Rock Me Fideos."

97
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,462
  Never knew that.

98
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:20,332
              So, we sauté some
        shallots, minced garlic,

99
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:23,569
    pinch of salt, our piperade,
       the head-on prawns cooked

100
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:24,836
      for about a minute...
            Love it.

101
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,705
              ...on each side.
               Add the pasta.

102
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:27,873
Lot going on right now.

103
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,308
           We've got our saffron
              vegetable stock,

104
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,576
            and you can probably
                  smell it.

105
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:31,543
        It's just delish.
       -Oh, it's gorgeous.

106
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,378
                   Cream,
          we'll add our mussels.

107
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,580
   Let those open.

108
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:36,014
             Little bit of lemon
               juice, parsley,

109
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,182
            and then she's ready
               for prime time.

110
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,884
               We're gonna go
             into our fancy pot,

111
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,254
  and then we'll add our prawns,
         and then a little herb.

112
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:43,322
    There we go.

113
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,895
        Mmm.

114
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:50,996
    It's awesome,
    really great.

115
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:52,531
       I mean,
it's a delicious dish.

116
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:58,937
 The cooking of the
mussels in the dish,

117
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,406
little bloom of the saffron,
little touch of the herb,

118
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,410
and the citrus at the end,
all the little steps.

119
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,347
I'm having this total
flashback of being in Spain.

120
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:10,882
Sister, this is Flavortown,
  without question.

121
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:11,883
     Delicious.

122
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,118
Seafood fideos.

123
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,586
      Toasting the noodles
        is something that

124
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,688
  you don't get often, and that
   really makes a difference.

125
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,423
      There's also a lot of
     different spices in it,

126
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,891
       different notes and
        different tones.

127
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,393
                 Forget all
            the madness outside.

128
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,028
               Have some fideo
             and have a porron.

129
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,930
Now that's what
  I'm talking about.

130
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,899
      The porron is Spanish
      tradition all the way

131
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,368
 when it comes to drinking wine.

132
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,736
         Let me see, here we go.

133
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,371
                 Let me see.

134
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,072
                Nicely done.

135
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,808
              -Oh!
              -Oh!

136
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,176
            Huh, did I catch it?

137
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,611
         The minute that
        you step in here,

138
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,179
  it's a vacation and a party.

139
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,415
      It reminds me of the Costa
       Brava, the Spanish coast.

140
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:44,716
You kind of immediately get that

141
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,251
      with all of the food
         that they have.

142
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,586
Crunchy prawns up.

143
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:49,021
I'm sure a lot of people
  are kind of freaked out

144
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,156
    by just a prawn head, but
     the crunchy prawn heads

145
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,592
      with the xató sauce,
        it's tremendous.

146
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,961
 In the appreciation
     for Amaebi,

147
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,529
 which is one of my
favorite sushi restaurants,

148
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,097
  the sweet shrimp
    is served raw

149
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,565
  and then the head
   is tempura-ed.

150
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:01,867
Similar to that idea?

151
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,135
                  Correct.

152
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,569
 And this is a sauce
we're making for it?

153
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:05,837
       Yes, this is a xató sauce
             that's really great

154
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,572
           to dip the prawn head
          in and then pop it in.

155
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,842
        We start with some dried
    bread, Fresno chili peppers,

156
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,078
              piquillo peppers,
               lots of garlic,

157
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,514
       grape or cherry tomatoes,
              sliced shallots,

158
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,449
             chopped chives and
          parsley, some almonds.

159
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,517
    Love almonds.

160
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,685
             Now it's not gonna
                  be right.

161
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,253
It's probably wrecked
   the whole dish.

162
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:23,555
          Sherry vinegar, we got
          a little honey, water,

163
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,924
           kosher salt, and then
            a couple tablespoons

164
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,727
           of neutral oil, boom,
              and crank her up.

165
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:29,728
  Drop the hammer.

166
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,033
  Wow, that's good.

167
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,668
 Little acid, little
sweet, little texture

168
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,904
 from the bread and
  from the almonds.

169
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:40,305
  I don't care what
  you put that on.

170
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,007
            Steak, French fries,
              chicken, I'm in.

171
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,942
Okay, that's the new name
 of the restaurant.

172
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,510
Steak, French fries,
  chicken, I'm in.

173
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,611
       Hello.

174
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:47,813
        Okay.

175
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,081
            Now we're gonna make
         our dry tempura batter.

176
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,282
              We start off with
             some baking powder,

177
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:52,551
         cornstarch, cake flour,
              makes it lighter,

178
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,786
                kosher salt,
             all-purpose flour.

179
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,021
               Prawn heads go
                in the sieve.

180
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,289
               Shake her down.

181
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,391
Where were you last night?
  Where's my money?

182
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:00,459
      She's ready for the fryer.

183
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:01,793
Make it happen, captain.

184
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,895
      -Crunchy prawn head.
         -Yes, yes, yes.

185
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,230
                 So, we got
               our xató sauce.

186
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,898
                   Put our
             shrimp heads down.

187
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,201
     Little torn basil, and then
         we take our lemon wedge

188
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,103
             and dip it in some
               smoky paprika.

189
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:12,637
     Fantastico.

190
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,839
I'll pick some basil
      with it.

191
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,709
This right here is meaty.

192
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,445
 The head on this is
  just enough shell

193
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,948
 that it can fry and
 it can get crispy.

194
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,551
It's like intensified
    shrimp flavor

195
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,388
all brought together
with this fantastic sauce.

196
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,859
And just one more in
the name of science.

197
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,428
  That's fantastic.

198
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,130
 I have your crunchy
prawn heads for you.

199
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:39,197
     They're just luscious.

200
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,767
          The sauce is
     absolutely phenomenal.

201
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,268
Ceviche crudo.

202
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,269
mfk.
  is one of the spots,

203
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,370
   if you're visiting Chicago,

204
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:46,505
       that you absolutely
        have to come to.

205
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,173
     You have to try it out.

206
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:50,475
 You guys are taking
    your 6 tables

207
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,277
  and 29 seats to a
 whole nother level.

208
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,478
This is what "Triple D's"
     all about,

209
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,347
    finding these
 funky little spots

210
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:57,582
by people that have this
love affair with food.

211
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,950
   And that's what
   you get at mfk.

212
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,819
     Outstanding, well done.
           -Thank you.

213
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:06,591
Up next, a wave of flavor
 in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii...

214
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,593
         You ain't wearing board
      shorts after you eat this.

215
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,295
 ...at a spot making its name...

216
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,797
             That's how you get
            it done right there.

217
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:14,199
  ...on leaving you speechless.
             Melt in your mouth.

218
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:17,602
You ever play bye-bye,
     cellphone?

219
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,104
              No, what's that?

220
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,238
You drop your cellphone in
and you say, "Bye-bye.

221
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,840
"Bye-bye, cellphone."

222
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:30,582
   I love bringing "Triple D"
         to the islands.

223
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:31,783
     Man, I've been to Oahu,

224
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,852
       I've been to Maui,
      I've been to Molokai.

225
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,887
      Finally, I make it to
    the Big Island of Hawaii.

226
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,122
        So, what do I do
        when I come here?

227
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,557
         I'm looking for
       some local's food.

228
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,225
       That is, if you're
   looking for some Filipino,

229
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,594
    Hawaiian, American twist,
      oh, I got your joint.

230
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,763
       It's right here in
     Broke Da Mouth Grindz.

231
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:48,400
  Three minutes on the burgers.

232
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:50,435
         Food is always
     delicious and on point.

233
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:53,572
  Loco moco, ready.

234
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:55,307
    Broke Da Mouth Grindz is
     a favorite here in Kona

235
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,442
      because they provide
    a lot of local favorites.

236
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:58,944
        Pork adobo plate
        coming right up.

237
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,812
    Every time you come here,
   you're gonna get good food.

238
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,848
      The service is great,
     and I love the owners.

239
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,282
That would be husband and wife

240
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:07,118
  Robin Ganir and Jean Nguyen,
       who are mashing up

241
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,155
       down-home food with
      some faraway flavors.

242
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,891
We make Filipino,
Hawaiian, American food

243
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,326
with a twist of my style.

244
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,794
              Where'd you learn
                  to cook?

245
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,129
My family, they come
from a cooking background.

246
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,731
      But it's
the backyard boogie.

247
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,466
                   Right,
             with a dance move.

248
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,602
   I went to Oahu,
 got some schooling.

249
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:24,836
                  Came back
           and did your own gig.

250
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,071
        Yeah.

251
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:28,573
       It's a new style of
     cooking Hawaiian food.

252
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:29,841
    Garlic furikake chicken.

253
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,210
 Furikake chicken is so awesome.

254
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:33,378
It is like taking

255
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,347
   the best piece of Southern
          fried chicken

256
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,682
    and upping it up a notch.

257
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,419
  The sauce is, like, a sweet,
         garlicky sauce

258
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,389
     that is, like, amazing.

259
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,358
    First we're gonna start with
   the marinade for the chicken?

260
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,560
      Yes, sir.
     Soy sauce.

261
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:49,995
                A little bit
               of brown sugar.

262
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,931
              Just 2 teaspoons
                or 4 pounds.

263
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,032
4 pounds.

264
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,134
    White sugar,
    black pepper.

265
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,269
              A mess of garlic.

266
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:58,737
  A mess of garlic.

267
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,205
      Furikake.

268
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,206
    So you got the dried seaweed
           and the sesame seeds.

269
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,440
  Yeah, that's it.

270
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,109
You bring it to a boil
 for three minutes.

271
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,610
        Now we're gonna marinade
            the chicken in this?

272
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:07,045
   No, we're gonna
 deep-fry it first.

273
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,179
            We're gonna deep-fry
                 the chicken

274
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:09,147
        and then put this on it?

275
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,248
             -Yeah.
              -Oh.

276
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,217
           Boneless, but skin-on
               chicken thighs

277
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,819
     dusted in the flour, little
       bit of granulated garlic.

278
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,988
Yeah, now our chicken
  is ready to fry,

279
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,123
  12 to 15 minutes.

280
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,925
 -What temperature is the fryer?
              -350.

281
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,193
    In Hawaii, we say "tree."
      -Tree hundred and 50.

282
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,328
                  Next up?

283
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,496
      -Chili pepper watah.
          -Chili watah.

284
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,531
 Hawaiian rock salt,
   minced garlic,

285
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,300
    the sriracha,
 sweet chili sauce,

286
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:29,734
and Hawaiian chili peppers.

287
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,237
                Hit that with
           an immersion blender.

288
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,538
                 And where's
            this sauce gonna go?

289
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,773
It goes on everything.

290
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:35,941
             It's gonna gave you
          the tang, the sweet...

291
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:37,175
      -The tang, the sweet.
        -...and the heat.

292
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,110
It'll make you dance.

293
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,813
     You don't want to see that.

294
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,882
              Chicken fry's up.
              Boom, it's done.

295
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,917
And we're just gonna
dip it into the sauce.

296
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,020
 You just cut it up,
      like so.

297
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,156
                Three thighs.
              Load it up, chef.

298
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:56,328
Just give it a extra
drizzle on top, furikake.

299
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,534
             That's how you get
            it done right there.

300
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,736
           Is this more Filipino
              or more Hawaiian?

301
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:07,172
     That's more
of a Hawaiian local.

302
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,206
              That's my kind of
              food right there.

303
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,507
     All right.

304
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,476
      The crunch of the chicken,
                outstanding,

305
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:12,777
             like, over the top.

306
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,448
           The sweet that you're
         getting from the dip...

307
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,518
      with the soy, brown sugar,
     and the garlic, it's great.

308
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,721
           But it's the contrast
                that you get

309
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:26,825
           from the chili water,
               makes it sing.

310
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,326
        Ooh!

311
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,895
  You ain't wearing board shorts
             after you eat this.

312
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,764
You're in a muumuu.

313
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,766
  The garlic furikake chicken.

314
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,568
         The chicken is
     absolutely incredible.

315
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,437
The sauce has this syrupy flavor
              to it

316
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,439
   with a real sweet back end.

317
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:44,943
It's super tender on the inside.
      It's really crunchy.

318
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:47,445
       -Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-It's like a luau in your mouth.

319
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,880
         Dancers and everything.

320
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,749
    The animal cheeseburger.

321
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,950
        This is the place
       I always recommend.

322
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,852
       If you like to eat
      where the locals eat,

323
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,453
        you gotta come to
     Broke Da Mouth Grindz.

324
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:56,955
            So, explain the name
                   to me.

325
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,189
This is from Hawaii.

326
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,258
Broke da mouth, that
means ono-licious food.

327
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,426
Ono means very good.

328
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:02,827
    It's so good,
 it's so delicious.

329
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,296
     You never stop eating,
        just keep going.

330
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,265
      Chomp, chomp, chomp,
          chomp, chomp.

331
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,533
        Just eat it all.

332
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,168
          What are the other big
         hits here at the house?

333
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,237
We've got the braised
short ribs and shrimp.

334
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,672
Short ribs and shrimp.

335
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,974
        The braised ribs
       is always so moist.

336
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,209
 The taste is out of this world.

337
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,045
And that's when we come back.

338
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,179
              See you in a bit.

339
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,389
           I'm on the Big Island
             at Broke Da Mouth.

340
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:35,827
       I just had some fantastic
      garlic chicken furikake...

341
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,796
Cooked up
  by chef Robin Ganir,

342
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:40,432
     who's putting his mark
      on this island menu.

343
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,033
         Braised oxtail,
        coming right up.

344
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,436
He puts a lot of
  flavor into his food,

345
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,638
  which makes it his own style.

346
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,573
   I asked Chef, I said, "What's
        the next dish gonna be?"

347
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:52,177
        He says it's a Filipino-
       Hawaiian-American concept

348
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,645
             with his own twist.

349
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,280
           Well, what's the dish
                   called?

350
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:56,748
 Braised short ribs
 and garlic shrimp.

351
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,583
       The short ribs are
        absolutely great.

352
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,552
        It's got kind of
     a caramelization to it.

353
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,388
   It's really a sweet flavor.

354
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,557
 All-time favorite,
   garlic shrimp.

355
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,494
I don't know how they
keep the center so moist.

356
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,896
And the outside has this
little, crispy shell.

357
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,599
           Let me see it happen,
         buddy, what do you got?

358
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,701
Beef short ribs,
 we're gonna cut it.

359
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,269
     In Hawaii,
we leave the fat on.

360
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,771
             Okay, so from here,
               where do we go?

361
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:23,475
We go straight on the
flat top and sear it off.

362
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:24,743
                 Next step?

363
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,311
      -The braising liquid.
            -Got it.

364
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,379
Gonna heat the pan up,
  soy sauce in it,

365
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,281
brown sugar, some water.

366
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,483
                   Garlic.

367
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,518
  Chopped-up white
onion, black pepper.

368
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,787
                Black pepper.
             You whisk this up.

369
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:38,189
Put the short ribs right inside
and simmer for two hours.

370
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:39,991
            So that's just gonna
         absorb all that flavor.

371
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,092
 Melt in your mouth.

372
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,794
             Melt in your mouth.

373
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:45,029
         Short ribs are working.
               What's up next?

374
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,198
   Homemade garlic
aioli for the shrimp.

375
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,433
   So, whole eggs.

376
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,702
                 Egg yolks.
             I'll lick the bowl.

377
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:51,803
Okay.

378
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,371
Garlic, sweet chili.

379
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,140
             I see a theme here.

380
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:58,610
 Lemon juice, garlic
 salt, black pepper.

381
00:12:58,612 --> 00:12:59,711
  We're gonna blend
  it all together.

382
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:02,180
    -And hit it with the oil?
             -Yeah.

383
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,114
       Tell me about the shrimp.

384
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,349
We just butterfly it,

385
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,918
put it in some flour,
and then we deep-fry it.

386
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,120
         So, a light, quick fry.

387
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,388
 There's our melted
   garlic butter.

388
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,890
             Great, a little bit
            of the green onions,

389
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:14,025
         the butter, the garlic.

390
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,860
       We got
our braised short ribs.

391
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,695
          You like fat?
         -Do I like fat?

392
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:20,064
        What are you looking at?

393
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,099
         Yeah, I don't like that
                   at all.

394
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,367
     All right.

395
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:23,635
            Oh, those things are
            right falling apart.

396
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,637
  We hit it up with
some teriyaki glaze,

397
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,174
    green onions,
homemade garlic aioli.

398
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:30,675
                  Gorgeous.

399
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:38,016
               This is a cross
           between your favorite

400
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:40,952
         teriyaki beef jerky and
       your grandma's pot roast.

401
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,256
         If you like short ribs,
   that's your game right there.

402
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,159
       And that soy sauce sugar,

403
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,662
             garlic goes all the
              way through that.

404
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:51,696
               Now, what's up
             with the potatoes?

405
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,765
Molokai sweet potato.

406
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,733
      -Purple sweet potato?
           -Yes, sir.

407
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,235
              Where have I been
                on that one?

408
00:13:57,237 --> 00:14:01,673
         That's a big shrimp for
      a little funky food joint.

409
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,142
People ask
 for extra aioli.

410
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,877
             Of course they do.

411
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,246
         You got so much flavor.

412
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:09,681
              Cooked the shrimp
                 perfectly.

413
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,350
        You make your own aioli,
            make your marinades.

414
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,152
            You really take time
             to do things right.

415
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:15,620
    I'm impressed. Well done.
        -Thank you, Guy.

416
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:16,821
        Ribs and shrimp.

417
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:20,358
    The short ribs are sweet.
      They just fall apart.

418
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,194
       The flavor is just
    exploding in your mouth.

419
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,529
   Teriyaki barbecue chicken.

420
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,030
Well, if you're
  on the Big Island

421
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,499
  and you want to have a great
    meal, this is the place.

422
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:31,703
      You cannot leave Kona
      without coming here.

423
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,471
                 Great food
           treated with respect,

424
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:36,307
              Hawaiian culture,
             Filipino influence,

425
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,309
         good old American twist
             to it, but all you.

426
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:39,544
        Yeah.

427
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:40,778
         -Well done, my brother.
                 -Thank you.

428
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,414
                 Well done.

429
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,083
Coming up, in Ashland, Oregon...

430
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,351
               Oh, it's going.

431
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,286
     ...a funky little piece
         of the Pacific.

432
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:49,787
              I should be able
              to close my eyes

433
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,022
                and teleport
                to Indonesia.

434
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:54,225
     ...vouched for by none
      other than my mother.

435
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,693
      It's the bomb, right?
           I told you.

436
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:56,794
               It's the bomb.

437
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,004
    So, I'm here in beautiful
        Ashland, Oregon.

438
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,273
      And, like usual, I've
    got everybody telling me

439
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,408
    places I gotta check out,
        except this time,

440
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,911
  it's the red-headed wonder --
         my mom, Penny.

441
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,079
    Now, she says, "Guy, you
   gotta check this place out.

442
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,348
        Oh, my gosh, Guy,
    the food is so fantastic.

443
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,550
      Guy, our friends love
      going to this place."

444
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,819
     Are you guys ready for
    my mom's recommendation?

445
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,454
       This is Blue Toba.

446
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:26,991
      Mie goreng is coming.

447
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:28,793
I've lived all over the world,

448
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,095
   and I've never had anything
     that tastes like this.

449
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,098
Two rendang, one satay,
    one mie tahu.

450
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,267
We're really lucky
  to be this little town

451
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,536
          and have this
      unique type of food.

452
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:41,673
And the folks of Ashland
 have this couple to thank,

453
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:43,975
        Leslie Caplan and
       Birong Hutabarat...

454
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,944
   Babe, how long
   for ayam bakar?

455
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,412
 ...who are bringing the flavors

456
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:50,281
  of Birong's native Indonesia
     to the heart of Oregon.

457
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,650
  I came here to go
     to college.

458
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,687
     I had already lived in
   Indonesia for eight years,

459
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,288
   and then people were like,
   "You've gotta meet Birong.

460
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,323
        He's Indonesian."

461
00:15:58,325 --> 00:15:59,958
                  Just like
        "Days of our Indonesia."

462
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,426
             I know.

463
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,860
          How would you describe
       an Indonesian restaurant?

464
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:06,664
Using the local spices you
can't find in the other region.

465
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,933
               So it really is
              the spice island.

466
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,034
       It is.

467
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:11,369
And those spices are definitely

468
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:14,505
     packing a punch in this
     beefed-up flavor bomb.

469
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,174
 Rendang for Jamie.

470
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,109
This is coconut curry,
   and it's cooked

471
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,211
    for so long, it literally
      melts in your mouth.

472
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,379
                  Rendang.

473
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,014
Probably the most famous
 dish in Indonesia.

474
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,749
        Well, let's start going.

475
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,751
Coconut milk, galangal.

476
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,186
         It's like ginger light.

477
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:30,788
    Ginger light,
but it has kind of --

478
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,057
     -A little more citrus?
       -Yeah, more citrus.

479
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:36,627
This is a mix of cardamom,
coriander, and cumin.

480
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:39,230
          -The three C.
       -Cloves, turmeric.

481
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:40,865
             Beautiful color and
              flavor from that.

482
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:44,502
 Shallot, raw sugar,
  bay leaf, ginger.

483
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,004
        Whole bunch of allspice.

484
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,839
Salt, garlic, cinnamon,

485
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:51,275
     lemongrass,
our Indonesian chili.

486
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,243
               Oh, it's going.

487
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,579
   Go all the way
  to coconut milk.

488
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,447
         All the spices.
     -Everybody in the bowl.

489
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,782
              But what type of
             meat are we using?

490
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:59,784
         -We use chuck.
     -A lot of great flavor.

491
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,019
            Not the most tender.

492
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,954
        So, how long's the chuck
               gonna cook down

493
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:05,390
        in this super fortified,
    extra-flavored coconut milk?

494
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:06,824
      Three to
three and a half hours.

495
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,493
                 I like it.
                  Ren-dang.

496
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,161
           -Ren-dahng.
            -Rendang.

497
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,329
         Get your rendang right.

498
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:12,830
              Now, what are we
          gonna serve this with?

499
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:15,967
Coconut turmeric rice with
a garnish of a cucumber.

500
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,902
           If people were to say
             that the hamburger

501
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,904
               was the dish of
             the United States,

502
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:21,472
                this would be
          the dish of Indonesia.

503
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:22,473
     Very true.

504
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:23,708
              I should be able
              to close my eyes

505
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,742
                and teleport
                to Indonesia.

506
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,144
              -Yes.
             -Okay.

507
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,112
I don't even need
     a passport.

508
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:33,985
               I've never had
                that before.

509
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:36,154
            One minute, I'm over
         here in the lemongrass.

510
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,889
            The next minute, I'm
         over here in the spice.

511
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,457
             Then I'm over here
             with coconut milk.

512
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,392
        If you love Indian food,
               it's not that.

513
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,528
          If you love Thai food,
               it's not that.

514
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,163
      But if you put Indian food
       and Thai food together...

515
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,031
      -Thai food together.
    -...that's what you get.

516
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,199
                It's tender.

517
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:51,302
            It's tons of flavor.

518
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,671
      It's a little bit of heat,
     it's a little bit of sweet,

519
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,373
            the touch of ginger.
               It's delicious.

520
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,141
        -Thank you, sir.
      -Here's your rendang.

521
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:58,576
It's got this rich flavor.

522
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,345
        It just fills all
        the good spaces.

523
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:03,614
          That meat is
      the most tender beef

524
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,716
you will ever eat, just awesome.

525
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:08,653
  Funny enough, we
have Ferndale people

526
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,922
 that I grew up with
now living in Ashland.

527
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,857
       He comes here every week.

528
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,092
    It's a funky
    little place.

529
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,660
        I have a question
          for you, Guy.

530
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,895
   When you were a little kid,
  you might not remember this,

531
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:20,131
         your mother put
      a sign on your back.

532
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,166
 Yeah, thanks, Jack.
It's been really nice

533
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:23,968
 having the Allmans
  here on the show.

534
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,236
     Mie goreng for Thomas.

535
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:26,704
               Were you a cook
             back in Indonesia?

536
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,841
No, I went home for two years
and just find families...

537
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:34,011
He goes back every year

538
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,114
       and buys new spices
      and brings them back.

539
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,949
       And he'll come back
          with recipes.

540
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,016
Opor.

541
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,384
I'm having an opor.

542
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,253
        I love the creamy
        curry sauce that

543
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,122
       has just that hint
         of spice in it.

544
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:48,025
      The chicken is soft,
     moist, rich in flavor.

545
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,794
We're gonna make opor.

546
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,697
 This is mild curry
   with candlenut.

547
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:54,432
Candlenut.
    Is it a macadamian?

548
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:55,700
              -No.
        -Can you eat it?

549
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:56,934
You have to cook 'em
 before you eat 'em.

550
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,437
        Ah, so what is the dish?
          It's called what, o--?

551
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,205
             -Opor.
             -Opor?

552
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,274
 Yes, we put cumin,
     coriander,

553
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:06,911
shallot, salt, sugar,
   garlic, ginger.

554
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:08,312
                  Galangal.

555
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,414
    White pepper,
 toasted candlenut,

556
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,683
turmeric, a little bit
of water, and then...

557
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,186
 Little bit of oil.

558
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:16,487
               And we're gonna
            cook this paste out.

559
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,423
Yes, we sauté it for
 three, four minute.

560
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,492
  And then we will
put all the spices...

561
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,694
         -There you go.
   -...into the coconut milk.

562
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:24,996
     Lemongrass.

563
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,297
           Indonesian lime leaf.

564
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:27,832
             Very similar to the
            Sri Lanka lime leaf.

565
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,634
         -And bay leaf.
             -Okay.

566
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:30,868
                   Then in
        with the chicken thighs?

567
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,136
        Yes.

568
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,604
We're gonna serve 'em
with organic veggies.

569
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:36,641
Hang on, I'm sorry,
     hang on.

570
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:38,709
                   My mom.
               Hello, Mother.

571
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41,145
            -Hi, Guy.
  -Listen, I took your advice.

572
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:43,214
             I don't always take
               all the advice

573
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:44,615
        you give me as I should,

574
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:47,185
            but I will tell you,
             pretty ridiculous.

575
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,120
      It's the bomb, right?
           I told you.

576
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:50,221
               It's the bomb.

577
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,456
    So, I wish I were there.
       Have a great time.

578
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,591
         -Love you, Mom.
              -Bye.

579
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:54,692
        Interrupted by my mother

580
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,760
              when I'm getting
                ready to eat.

581
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,998
              You know how some
                 people say

582
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,667
       they don't like dark meat
                 on chicken?

583
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:05,503
            This right here will
             melt in your mouth.

584
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,538
          It's capital-T tender.

585
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,774
          There's a lot of depth
                  in this.

586
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:13,444
    And the fresh, local veggies
         with bite, with crunch.

587
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:14,745
      It's pretty amazing.
           -Thank you.

588
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:20,618
                It's so good.

589
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:24,222
      The chicken is juicy,
           it's moist.

590
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,957
     I have never had a dish
        like this before.

591
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,325
     It's absolutely unique.

592
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:29,627
I tell my friends,
"You guys should go to Blue Toba

593
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:31,128
    because it's like nothing
        you've ever had."

594
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,930
            Schwarzenegger stole
              the line from me,

595
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,398
        but I'll be back.
          -We be here.

596
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,234
               "I'll be back."
                "We be here."

597
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:41,005
      So, was this a great
       road trip or what?

598
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,573
      But don't you worry.

599
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,076
   I got plenty more joints to
   find all over this country.

600
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,611
         I'll be looking
        for you next time

601
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:49,981
          on "Drivers,
     Drive-Ins, and Dives."

602
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,887
             Sorry.
           -I love it.

603
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,456
There are gonna be so many
shrimps without heads.
