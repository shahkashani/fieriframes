We're gonna brine this.         

244
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,569
   Take some salt.              
Gives the meat the flavor.

                stay in salt?   

248

 Absolutely.                    

251
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:37,649

Bread it with flour, milk,      

252
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,517
    and a special               
 bread crumb we use.            

253
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,453

255
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,458
              for a while, or...
Yeah, this has gotta sit for    
between four and six hours.     

256
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,661
         Once those juices kinda
    work into those bread crumbs

257
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,463
         and it kinda all sticks

a bunch of seasonings.          

337
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,282
 Dry mustard, salt,             
    white pepper.               

338
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,418
     Paprika for a little color.
Paprika.                        

339
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,619
         Now what kind of cheese
              are we gonna add? 

340
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,421
 We use three kinds.            
I'm gonna use parmesan,         

341
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,823
I'm gonna use asiago,           
and I'm gonna use sharp cheddar.

342
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:33,958
              Do you add it all 
                in one time,    

343
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,226
     or you go little by little?

344
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,761
I pretty much add 'em           
   one at at time.              

345
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:39,297
Get this melted in there and    
we'll add the other two cheeses.

346
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,432
If you want to dump that        
asiago in, that'd be great.     

347
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,900
  Parmesan.                     
                I like that,    
         so you get a little bit

348
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,236
          of the sweet and sharp
    from the asiago and the parm

349
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,338
             and the creaminess 
              from the cheddar. 

350
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,440
     Okay, cheese sauce is done.
 We'll take that with the pasta,

351
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,442
             put it in the dish 
                and bake it.    

352
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,977
        Shouldn't we taste that?

353
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,313
              Mmm. Well, that's 
              creamy goodness.  

354
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,715
                  It's like     
       the Colorado Cheese River

355
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:57,982
                running right   
             through Flavortown.

356
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,184
      Macaroni.                 

357
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,584
                So every time   
           somebody orders this,

358
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,588
    you cook the pasta to order?
     Yes, sir.                  

359
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,323
 That's what you do             
in Italian restaurants.         

360
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,191
You cook your pasta fresh.      
           No, I'm down with it.

361
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,727
  Cool.                         
      I'm picking up what you're
           laying down, brother.

362
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,329
     Yeah, and then some more on
               would be good.   

363
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,531
A little bit more cheese.       
In the oven she goes.           

364
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,133
             About 10 minutes of
        knick-knack paddy-whack?

365
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:17,735
It's about 20, actually.        
I like to give it -- yeah.      
                      Really?   

366
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,337
          Oh, so you really like
        to let it caramelize up.

367
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,739
I like nice and brown           
     on the top.                

368
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,007
                Look at that.   

369
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,943
         There's not many places
            you can find anymore

370
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:28,612
       where you get custom-made
               mac and cheese.  

371
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,815
             Mm, that's creamy. 
    Good.                       

372
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,350
           That's mac and cheese
                right there.    

373
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:35,019
           That sharp cheddar --
           really nice, velvety.

374
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,355
          Mmm. Doing this right.
   Thank you.                   

375

376
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,826
   That cheese was excellent,   
           just right.          

377
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,094
       It's comfort food.       

378
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,362
     Good eating experience     
       all the way around.      

379
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:45,630
     The food is delicious.     

380
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,365
  This is satisfying my hunger. 

381
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,000
That's what I like to hear.     

382
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:52,870
          My son Hunter or Ryder
      would go bananas for this.

383
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,106
      You know what bananas are?
Kinda like oranges?             

384
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,576
              Bananas are good.

   -...for some Texas hash...   

387
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,116
You gotta try this.             
         ...and a burger        

388
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,718
   that eats like an inferno.   

389
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,353
    My mouth is, like, literally
          on fire at this point.

391
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,724
     I'm here in the Midtown    
          neighborhood          

392
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,793
      of Houston, Texas --      
    now it's also been known    

393
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,996
           as Montrose          
    or the old Fourth Ward --   

394
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,530
  to visit a funky little joint 

395
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,999
 that opened as a grocery store 
          back in '39.          

396
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,335
   Now in the early '70s, they  
   started serving sandwiches,  

397
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,604
         and in '77 they        
     introduced the burger.     

398
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,006
      The rest is history.      

399
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,540
    This is Lankford Grocery.   

400
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,277
   The best hamburger you will  
  ever eat in your entire life. 

401
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,746
              Whew!             
It's made the old-fashioned way.

402
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:36,214
  Tell me what you need, boys.

FIERI: By owner and local legend
      Eydie Lankford Prior.     

404
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,885
         Lotta burgers.         
    FIERI: She grew up here.    

405
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,419
 The front part was             
  a grocery store,              

406
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,289
this was our kitchen,           
and we lived upstairs.          

407
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,890
                      Hi, guys. 
  FIERI: And it was Eydie's dad 

408
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,493
       who started serving      
    the burgers back in '77.    

409
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,694
          The burgers took over,

410
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,162
        and then it just started
      getting bigger and bigger.

411
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,164
       -Okay, y'all enjoy.      
    -It's all made to order.    

412
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,700
   -FIERI: 10 different ways.   
        -Okay, you guys.        

413
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,168
            From the            
  South of the Border Burger... 

414
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,971
 Avocados, the pico de gallo -- 
    it's always spectacular.    

415
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,506
  FIERI: ...to the double bacon 
        cheddar burger...       

416
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,174
It's a giant burger, it's great.

417
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,843
 FIERI: ...to the house special.
        Our house burger.       

418
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,377
It will set your mouth on fire. 

419
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,446
 FIERI: Because it's loaded with
    a three-pepper hot sauce.   

420
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,180
             Looks like mustard,
                but it's not.   

421
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,983
I'm actually nervous            
   at this point.               

422
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,185
     Okay, we're gonna make some
        firehouse sauce for you.

423
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,521
     Vinegar, add serranos,     
      jalapeños, habaneros.     

424
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,657
        Okay. Did I see habanero
             plants in the back?

425
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,792
You saw habaneros in the back.  
   We grow our own              

426
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,594
because we wanna make sure      
they're good and hot.           

427
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,929
      Go back there and pick out
               the prime ones.  

428
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:26,130
Pick out the ones we want       

429
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,332
   and throw it in              
that little old pot.            

430
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:28,599
   They just cook               
 till they're soft.             

431
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,934
        -These are done.        
              -Mmm.             

432
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,936
                Mm-hmm.         
No gloves or anything           
  with that, Eydie.             

433
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,537
               Absolutely not.  

434
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,272
             We're just kind of 
       blending these things up.

435
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,740
   There is no way              

436
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,610
that that is not gonna          
be a million degrees.           

437
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:43,214
            Along with that goes
       garlic, onions, radishes.

438
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,481
      You're just gonna love it.

439
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,884
That is going to kill my mouth. 

440
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,352
                There we go.    

441
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:51,155
             Then we're going to
             pour this in here, 

442
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,691
              add some mustard. 
Mustard.                        

443
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,026
Whose recipe is this?           

444
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,828
            We really don't know
           where this came from.

445
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,562
    Someone said,               
"I want something spicy."       
             I want something --

446
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,299
Eydie came back here            
and went "Ha ha ha."            
                     Mm-hmm-hmm.

447

1108
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:37,914
                 my father.     
       No!                      

1109
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,849
                And take these. 
  FIERI: And it all began with  

1110
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,385
      owner Andy Farantos'      
      great-uncle Gregory,      

1111
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:44,387
        who partnered up        
      with his cousin Alex      

1112
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:45,989
    and started a tradition.    

1113
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:48,058
 He had it from 1927            
      to 1966,                  

1114
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:52,194
and my father took it over      
in '66 to '88 with my uncle.    

1115
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:54,263
     FIERI: And then it was     
          Andy's turn.          
                 Pick it up.    

1116
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,266
We kept all the old recipes.    
We kept everything the same.    

1117
00:38:56,268 --> 00:38:57,667
   FIERI: And kept the crowds   
           packing in.          

1118
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,269
      Best hot dog in town.     

1119
00:38:59,271 --> 00:39:01,003
    When I was a little kid,    
     we used to come up here    

1120
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,206
 and get hot dogs and watch them
     turning in the window.     

1121
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:04,341
            FARANTOS:           
  You're gonna enjoy this one.  

1122
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:06,075
       FIERI: Loaded with       
    the original Coney sauce.   

1123
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,410
         Mmm! Delicious.        

1124
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:11,014
   Andy has still not told me   
what the secret ingredients are.

1125
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:14,150
   FIERI: On the dogs and the   
    burgers, even an omelet.    

1126
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:15,685
-It's the Coney sauce, isn't it?
           -Yes, yeah.          

1127
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,820
      -That's what does it.     
          -Absolutely.          

1128
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,090
           Now it's time to make
         the Coney Island sauce.

1129
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:21,958
Yes. Every day we get           
fresh ground beef delivered.    

1130
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,893
         Do a lot of ground beef
                around here.    
Yeah, we sure do.               

1131
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,695
A little bit of water.          
  Oh, you're gonna get in there.

1132
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,163
Yeah, you got to get in.        
 You got to get in.             

1133
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:28,431
You got to break down           
  the ground beef.              

1134
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:29,899
            How many days a week
                do you work?    

1135
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:32,035
Six days a week.                
           How many hours a day?

1136
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:34,637
 16 hours a day.                
               16 hours a day,  
              six days a week?  

1137
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,239
        Yeah.                   

1138
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:37,640
                 All right,     
            a little more water.

1139
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:39,309
   And then, Guy,               
 I need the paprika.            

1140
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:42,445
There we go. The celery salt    
and the chili powder.           

1141
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:45,181
I'm gonna attach the milk crates
                to your boots   

1142
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:46,916
      and make, like, milk crate
             snowshoes for you. 

1143
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:48,785
   Thank you, Guy,              
  that'd be great.              
     And then you can have this.

1144
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:50,519
          Then you can go around
                 being 6'6".    

1145
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,788
Coming up on Christmas.         
                   I like that. 

1146
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,323
         So this is our mixture.

1147
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,392
           So it looks like, uh,
                 beef soup.     

1148
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,461
Then we bring it to a hard boil 
and then we simmer it...        
                      Mmm.      

1149
00:39:58,463 --> 00:39:59,929
    ...for about                
two and a half hours.           
      I like the flavor already.

1150
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:01,798
           -All right.          
    -Chili cheese and onions.   

1151
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,134
   The chili goes on perfect.   
       Great combination.       

1152
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:06,869
 WOMAN: Combination             
 and two up on one.             

1153
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,072
     That has everything --     
   wanted the onions, ketchup.  

1154
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:10,140
          -And mustard.         
             -Chili.            

1155
00:40:10,142 --> 00:40:11,207
      And the chili sauce,      

1156
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,742
    and that's what makes it    
         taste the best.        

1157
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,011
  I'm usually about             
   a three biter.               

1158
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:16,545
                 That's one.    
     Mmm!                       

1159
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,882
    That's great.               
 Nice and juicy dog.            

1160
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:20,950
Crazy meat concoction on top.   

1161
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:23,686
White onions perfect.           
Bun's nice and steamed.         

1162
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:24,821
Wish I could live here.         

1163
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:27,023
     You taste the hot dog.     
      You taste the onions.     

1164
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:29,725
      You taste the chili.      
           Delicious.           

1165
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,761
      It's the best hot dog     
         I've ever had.         

1166
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,496
  FIERI: And you get it quick.  

1167
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:35,798
I need two up on one...         
     'Cause they got a code     
          all the room.         

1168
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,567
  Three up on one,              
  hold the mustard.             

1169
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:39,369
   Three hot dogs               
   for two people,              

1170
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:41,103
they say "three up on two."     

1171
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,972
So I'm gonna call them          
  out to you, okay?             

1172
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,774
   Seven up three.              

1173
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,108
             Seven up on three. 

1174
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,643
 Two onion mustard.             

1175
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,579
         No. Two hold the chili.
   Huh?                         

1176
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:50,847
               You have to say  
              "hold the chili." 

1177
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:52,449
Maybe I just need to get --     
I need to get some training.    

1178
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:53,716
              If you want onion 
             and mustard on it, 

1179
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:54,917
  then you say "hold the chili."

1180
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,052
               That way I know  
         it's onion and mustard.

1181
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:57,253
So I don't have to say          
  "hold the chili"?             

1182
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:58,721
         No. So if you just want
             mustard and onion, 

1183
00:40:58,723 --> 00:40:59,923
                then you say    
              "hold the chili." 

1184
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:02,391
            It's a lot easier...
Oh! Because it has mustard --   

1185
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:04,326
Ah! Okay, forget it then.       

1186
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,796
       He wastes no time.       
 Two up on one or one up on two,

1187
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,464
     they have it out to you    
        in no time flat.        

1188
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,733
 Andy, he would have            
eight or nine hot dogs          

1189
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:12,535
lined up on his wrist           
      and arm,                  

1190
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:14,837
  nine of them done             
 in like 30 seconds.            

1191
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,206
I want 10.                      
      I can't. The elbow joint's
                right there.    

1192
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,876
   Seven.                       
             I can't do 10, Guy.
               I can do eight.  

1193
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:21,144
 You can do 12 now!             

1194
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,912
        Up to my shoulder blade.
 You graduated.                 

1195
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,613
I haven't even taken it         
  to the collarbone             

1196
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,282
or the ear lobe yet.            

1197
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:27,750
             There you go, John.

1198
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:29,218
    This is what Baltimore's    
           all about.           

1199
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,286
This place is a landmark.       

1200
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:31,821
              It is a landmark. 
               It's a legend.   

1201
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,756
        My mom came here.       
        My dad came here.       

1202
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,958
        I'm here. One day       
   I'll bring my children up.   

1203
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,760
   We are comfortable doing it  
           old school.          

1204
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:40,763
     That's the kind of joint --
   I want to eat where he cooks.

1205
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:43,900
  Was that a road trip or what? 
        But don't worry.        

1206
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:46,703
   There's plenty more joints   
  all over this great country.  

1207
00:41:46,705 --> 00:41:49,038
     I'll be looking for you    
    next time on "Triple D."
