1
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:03,402
Hey. I'm Guy Fieri,
  and we're rolling out

2
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:05,804
looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.

3
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,039
This trip...
     Aah!

4
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,208
...we're smoking up
  some serious meat...

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,476
Don't get
   no better than that.

6
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:12,611
...and diving
 into some savory seafood.

7
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,313
All day.

8
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:15,481
In Baltimore...

9
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:16,515
Ohh!

10
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,550
...a swine-slinging
   food truck...

11
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:19,685
Pork Emporium.

12
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,587
You're Pork Palace.
   Enclosed Pork Patio.

13
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:23,889
...where the 'cue
  just doesn't quit.

14
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:25,224
And there's more!

15
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:27,793
In Islamorada, Florida...
     What?

16
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,194
...a funky, little shack...

17
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,729
You guys are too cool.

18
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,831
...where they cook
  straight off the hook.

19
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,500
- Real deal, girl. Real deal.
   -Thank you.

20
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:35,934
Plus, in Key Largo...

21
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:37,736
--I got it. Let's -- Come on.

22
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,872
...a full-fish experience...

23
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:40,973
Dude, that's huge.

24
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:42,708
...going crazy
   with the catch.

25
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,377
That's a dusty road to
 Flavortown right there, buddy.

26
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,413
That's all right here,
   right now,

27
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:49,348
on "Diners, Drive-Ins,
   and Dives".

28
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:06,231
So, I'm in Key Largo, Florida,
 and of course it's raining,

29
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,200
but I'm right here on US 1.

30
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:10,669
Now, I've heard about this place
 from just about everybody.

31
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:12,004
They say the food is outrageous.

32
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:13,939
They've got a fish market
  in the restaurant,

33
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,008
but I don't know
 how they came up with the name.

34
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,943
This is The Fish House.

35
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:21,246
Fried cracked conch.

36
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,848
You take your first bite,
   you're hooked.

37
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,150
- Pan sautéed grouper.
  -So phenomenally fresh.

38
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,318
Shrimp bundles.

39
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,220
This is my good buddy
     DJ Ivory.

40
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:30,222
I've heard about it.
I had no idea it was this legit.

41
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:32,091
If you're coming
 to the Keys, you don't stop

42
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:33,559
at The Fish House,
  why'd you bother?

43
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:35,060
But that wasn't the case

44
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:39,231
when Doug Prew and C.J. Berwick
 bought this place back in '87.

45
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,433
You know, it didn't do a lot.
 Six lunches was a big day.

46
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,503
So along with their son, Phil,
 they spent their days working

47
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,472
and their nights
  in a trailer out back.

48
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,006
How did he
 talk you into this?

49
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,642
- I think it was mutual, really.
   -Really?

50
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,878
Over the years,
 they've built a big following

51
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,446
with a revamped seafood menu.

52
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,448
One shrimp and octopus salad.
   Conch chowder.

53
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,250
And this Fish House original...

54
00:01:58,252 --> 00:01:59,718
One yellowtail Matecumbe.

55
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,920
...served up
  by Chef Joey Flowers.

56
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,422
It's fresh. It's healthy.

57
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:06,058
It's a fantastic dish.

58
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,259
Matecumbe.

59
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,528
We have a upper Matecumbe
and lower Matecumbe.

60
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,696
They're keys down here.

61
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:12,531
All right. Get after it.
   Tell me how it works.

62
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:17,136
Fresh chopped tomatoes, chopped
onion, capers, fresh basil.

63
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:19,238
And is the salsa
  that's going on top of it?

64
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,239
- Yes.
    -Okay.

65
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:21,340
Olive oil.

66
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:23,642
We'll do some fresh lemon.
 Salt and pepper.

67
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,777
Mix this up, let this marinate,
    come together.

68
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:28,046
In the fridge overnight.

69
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:30,415
And how are we gonna
    prepare the fish?

70
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,450
Yellowtail.

71
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:33,252
Yellowtail's one of the best
     down here?

72
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:35,854
Oh, yeah. Local fish.
You can catch them anytime.

73
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,157
And we're just gonna top them
with the Matecumbe sauce.

74
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,459
Just in the convection oven
  about 475.

75
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:43,162
Oh, my gosh.
    Screaming hot.

76
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,796
Six to eight minutes.

77
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,065
- Matecumbe.
   -Nicely done.

78
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,734
That's it.
    Simple approach.

79
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:49,968
That's it.

80
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,106
Mmm.

81
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,608
Delicate, tender.

82
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,912
Taste the fish, little brininess
    of that caper.

83
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:02,748
Little kick of the onion
    and the shallot.

84
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,585
Nice, little
    tomato-basil combo.

85
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:07,953
Mmm.

86
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:11,056
That's the exact Florida Keys
 experience I wanted to have.

87
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,925
Really dynamite.

88
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:15,127
A Picasso dish, if you will.

89
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,095
Presentation
  is always beautiful.

90
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,597
This stuff
  comes out of the water

91
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,667
about 300 yards over there.

92
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,436
They have their own fishermen
  that fish for them.

93
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,638
And while you can
  reel in a fresh catch

94
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,240
at their in-house fish market...

95
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:31,310
We've taken the shrimp home.
We've taken the Yellowtail home.

96
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:34,012
...most of these beauties
 head straight for the kitchen.

97
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,681
Oh, dude, that's huge.

98
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,816
- What is it?
  -That's an amberjack.

99
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:38,817
Aah!

100
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:42,754
And that beast
  is one of three fish

101
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:46,592
they're mixing into an app that
the locals say is the real deal.

102
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:47,759
One smoked fish dip.

103
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:50,662
- Amazing.
 -It's an addictive substance.

104
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:53,198
So give me the breakdown.
  What are we having here?

105
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,634
You got some cobias, amberjack,
 and mahi-mahi.

106
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,236
All right,
  so what are we making now?

107
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,371
This is the brine
for the smoked fish.

108
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,139
We're gonna add some water.

109
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,674
- Brown sugar?
   -Brown sugar.

110
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,810
Table salt,
some seasoning salt,

111
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:07,312
you got some garlic salt,
 and black pepper.

112
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,815
All that together.

113
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:12,050
We're gonna let this brine
overnight in the cooler.

114
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,151
Okay.

115
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,387
And then smoke it on our smoker
  out back.

116
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,557
What is it, who made it,
 and can I have it?

117
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,859
This is our one-of-a-kind
     smoke box.

118
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,894
It's been here
  about 20-something years.

119
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,563
And what kind of wood
 we smoking with?

120
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:25,998
Buttonwood. Very green.

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,500
So it gives that nice smoky
 flavor that we're looking for.

122
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,435
That is awesome.

123
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,039
How long's
it gonna be on here?

124
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:37,376
About six to eight hours.

125
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:40,312
Man, you really put
 some bark on that.

126
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:43,148
- All right, let's go make dip.
   -All right.

127
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,451
So we have our ingredients
for the smoked fish dip here.

128
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,819
- Sour cream?
   -Sour cream.

129
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,655
Cream cheese.
 Pop this in.

130
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:52,591
--I got it. Let's -- come on.

131
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,693
Okay, a little hot sauce,
   little Worcestershire.

132
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,428
Right.
We'll add our smoked fish

133
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,464
that's been through
 the processor.

134
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,799
Wow. That's good.

135
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,102
That's a dusty road to
 Flavortown right there, buddy.

136
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:07,973
And we'll add celery,
and then we got chopped onions.

137
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,208
- And jalapeño, seeds and all.
    -Okay.

138
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,610
Now we're gonna add
  our mixture

139
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:14,880
of sour cream and cream cheese
  in there.

140
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:16,948
And how long are you gonna
   let this all set up?

141
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,718
Overnight in the walk-in.
 Let it chill out.

142
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,887
- That's how it comes out?
   -Exactly.

143
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,192
Mmm.

144
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,927
A little jalapeño,

145
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,396
a little crunch of the onion
    and the celery --

146
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:32,631
all that coming together.

147
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,166
Just give it a little kiss.

148
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,701
All day, baby.

149
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:38,236
All day.

150
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:39,905
Mmm. Mmm!

151
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:42,207
It's nice and smoky.
  It's fresh and creamy.

152
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,842
I can't stop eating it, man.

153
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,244
If you love fish, you're gonna
  love The Fish House.

154
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:48,980
When I came down to the Keys,

155
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:51,183
this is the seafood restaurant
I wanted to come to.

156
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,452
You can't hear the seagulls,
you don't see any boats,

157
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:55,287
and you got a freeway
 in your front yard.

158
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:57,356
- Right.
  -Yet this is probably

159
00:05:57,358 --> 00:06:00,659
one of the greatest seafood
experiences I've had down here.

160
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,928
Thank you.

161
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,596
Coming up in Baltimore...

162
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,665
Oh, boy.

163
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,333
...a four-wheeling smoker...

164
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:11,203
It's a traveling
    barbecue circus?

165
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,371
- Emporium?
   -Emporium.

166
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:13,705
...piling up the pork...

167
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,006
Let me give you
 a little room.

168
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,542
...and going brontosaurus-style
   with the ribs.

169
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,511
Holy moly!

170
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,720
So, I'm here
  in Baltimore, Maryland,

171
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,289
in a random parking lot
 to check out a food truck

172
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,924
that's serving up --
   Wait a second.

173
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,359
Don't get ahead of me.
   No, no, no.

174
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,128
I don't want to hear,
  "Oh, you're gonna try

175
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,963
some crab cakes.
 Oh, you're probably gonna try

176
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:39,798
some steamed crab
 or something with Old Bay."

177
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,168
No. It's not what you'd expect.

178
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,237
I'm here to check out
 a funky, little food truck

179
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,506
that's serving up
 some real-deal barbecue.

180
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:49,975
This is The Smoking Swine.

181
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:52,978
The Smoking Swine
 is a fantastic food truck.

182
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,148
I wouldn't go anywhere else
 for barbecue in Baltimore.

183
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,949
Lone Star Brisket for Harley!

184
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,584
Slow-cooked for hours.

185
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,120
Smoke fills the whole truck,
 and it smells delicious.

186
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,488
There's nothing like it.

187
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,957
And there's no one
 quite like owner Drew Pumphrey,

188
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,660
who found his passion
   in a present.

189
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:11,263
My parents actually got me
a smoker as a Christmas gift.

190
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,999
And everything that I put in it
just worked really well,

191
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,535
and I just kind of
took to it naturally.

192
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,603
Then, when his catering
  and barbecue parties

193
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:23,308
started blowing up, he moved
to a full-on food truck in 2012.

194
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,377
So this is
    your Pork Emporium.

195
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,712
Your Pork Palace.
   Enclosed Pork Patio.

196
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,749
- "The House That Pork Built".
    -Th--

197
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:34,986
The license plate on this thing
    says, "PORKBOX".

198
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,688
East Carolina for John?

199
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,658
East Carolina pulled pork
  sandwich is fantastic.

200
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,828
It's tender. The coleslaw
 complements it very well.

201
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,096
I always put a little bit
 of the sweet sauce on it.

202
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,032
It's perfect.

203
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:48,467
All right.
    Dry rub it, baby.

204
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:51,803
Cool. We use a little
 dark brown sugar,

205
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:55,540
chili powder, paprika,
 kosher salt,

206
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:58,143
and some butcher-grind
 black pepper.

207
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,611
Mix It up by hand.

208
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:02,180
On to the pork butts, and what
  kind of butts are we using?

209
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,616
I like to use a boneless
shoulder, or a boneless butt.

210
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,251
- Boneless? Really?
   -I go boneless.

211
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,520
Why pay for something
you're not using?

212
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:11,623
He's bigger than me,
 so of course I agree with him.

213
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,091
Okay, so, dry rub.

214
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,526
And it goes
right into the smoker.

215
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:15,594
What do we smoke them with?

216
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:16,995
For these,
we're using peachwood.

217
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,396
Peachwood.

218
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:21,066
It gives it a flavor profile,
I think, that nobody else,

219
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,734
at least around here,
really can compare with.

220
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,269
But I just wanted to be
 a little different.

221
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,537
I think
  you're a little different

222
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,938
regardless of you using peach
     or not.

223
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,106
That's what
 my doctor told me.

224
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,141
Yeah. How long we gonna go
    at what temp?

225
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,710
225 for 12 hours.

226
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:32,744
Next up?

227
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,312
Our Eastern Carolina
 style sauce.

228
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,014
- We actually mix it in the jug.
    -Okay.

229
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,682
Distilled white.

230
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,417
Do a little kosher salt.

231
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,386
Like sand
   through the hourglass.

232
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:42,821
Yeah.
A little black pepper.

233
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,856
It's a table grind,
so it's nice and fine.

234
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,825
Some white sugar.
 Red pepper flake.

235
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,195
Top it off --

236
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,597
- Hot sauce.
    -Yep.

237
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:55,000
Oh, this looks good.
   Right to the top now.

238
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:59,504
Yes, boss. Genuine, bona fide
Eastern Carolina sauce.

239
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,740
We just give it a shake
and let it sit for 24 hours.

240
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,910
Ohh! It don't get
   no better than that.

241
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,311
So, we're gonna make
 our coleslaw,

242
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:08,013
what I like to call
Maryland-style coleslaw.

243
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:10,715
- There's Old Bay in it?
 -There is<i> no</i> Old Bay in it.

244
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,817
Then you cannot call it
    Maryland coleslaw.

245
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,086
There's also no crab.

246
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,656
So we're using some heavy mayo,
 white vinegar,

247
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:20,292
some white sugar,
 celery seed.

248
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:21,960
- Pretty straightforward here.
    -Yes.

249
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,396
Then I just like to add a little
bit of chipotle powder in there.

250
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,631
Gives it a little bit of bite
  on the end.

251
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:29,434
And a little bagged slaw mix,
 because you don't have slicers?

252
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,503
I am in a food truck.

253
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:36,408
Yeah, I let it sit
about an hour or two.

254
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,642
All right, man.

255
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,778
Gonna make our Eastern Carolina
pulled pork sandwich.

256
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,279
We're gonna grab
 our pork shoulder.

257
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,148
This has been smoking
 for 12 hours.

258
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,684
I throw a little bit of
the Carolina sauce into the bun.

259
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,519
A little bit
of saturation in there.

260
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:48,653
Then give it a good pull,

261
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,956
try to get all
the different muscle groups.

262
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,492
Holy bark, Batman.

263
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:56,561
Give it a little shake.

264
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:59,598
Throw a little slaw on top.

265
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,533
Add our locally
 sourced pickles.

266
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,602
So, yeah, there's our
Eastern Carolina sandwich.

267
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:06,705
- This is how you do it?
   -Yeah, man.

268
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,040
Let me give you
 a little room.

269
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,913
Mmm.

270
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,048
Barbecue sauce
    has tons of spice.

271
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,651
Nice roll, great slaw,

272
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:24,456
a lot of acid...

273
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,924
and really good smoke.

274
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,859
I just want to get in that.

275
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:28,893
Yeah.

276
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:31,563
I'm gonna do --

277
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:33,064
Do that, and then that,

278
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,532
and I want to do it
    one more time.

279
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:36,368
Now you own it.
 Now it's yours.

280
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,436
--Tasty, buddy. Really good.

281
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,905
Appreciate it, man.

282
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,874
Got a East Carolina pulled pork
  for Amanda?

283
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,743
Get a little bit
 of burnt end on the edges.

284
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:47,646
You get some smoke ring.
 The flavor goes through it.

285
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:50,115
The sauce is tangy,
 just enough to give it a kick.

286
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,417
He's got his own touch to it,
  and it's delicious.

287
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,752
Hi!

288
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:56,187
He updates his Facebook
  and his Twitter daily

289
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,656
so we always know where he is.

290
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,191
Anytime I'm in the mood
 for some delicious barbecue,

291
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,360
just take a look at social media
  and go get some.

292
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,162
So you got anything else
    up your sleeve?

293
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,864
- For today? Well --
   -Unh. Unh.

294
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,767
So here's the deal. I'm gonna
 finish this, take a small nap,

295
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,635
and when we come back,
    we're gonna make --

296
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,303
Dah-unh!
     You'll see.

297
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,214
Welcome back. I'm hanging out
   at The Smoking Swine.

298
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:26,051
It's a traveling barbecue...
     circus?

299
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,452
- Emporium?
   -Emporium.

300
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,154
Barbecue Emporium.

301
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:31,823
Drew has a great reputation as
 the best barbecue in Baltimore.

302
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,158
- Thanks.
  -You got it, baby.

303
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,693
Drew smokes here in the truck,

304
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,761
and you can smell it
   a mile away.

305
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,430
Beef short rib for Katie!

306
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:39,998
- Thank you.
  -Thank you, dear.

307
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,100
With barbecue,
  it's always tricky

308
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,302
to balance sweet and smoky,

309
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:47,405
and this short rib
 really balances it perfectly.

310
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:48,707
Everybody devours it.

311
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,710
That's one of the things
 he sells out of all the time.

312
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,545
- What do you got?
  -Our beef rib rub.

313
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:54,846
Beef rib rub it is.

314
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,081
Use a little paprika.

315
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,649
Butcher grind black pepper?

316
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:59,317
Yeah, man.
 Kosher salt,

317
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,753
chili powder,
 dark brown sugar.

318
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:02,887
We do some curry.

319
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,355
Curry. Okay.

320
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,491
Garlic powder and some cumin.

321
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,993
- And we just hand-mix it.
    -Okay.

322
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,729
So, here's half a dozen ribs.

323
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,797
Holy moly.

324
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,133
I wanted to offer something
that was kind of me-sized.

325
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,768
That's about as big
 as one of my ribs.

326
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,304
So we just rub it down.

327
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,538
In the smoker how long?

328
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,741
11 hours at 225.

329
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,843
We actually use
 Texas post oak.

330
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,344
These are actual
 old fence posts.

331
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,613
That's the story I get from
the guy that sells it to me.

332
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,148
- That sells it to you?

333
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,383
Whoa! Been spending a little
  time close to the smoker,

334
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,252
- have you now, son?
 -It's all right with me.

335
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,588
All right. This is our barbecue
  sauce for the beef ribs?

336
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,323
Yes. Kansas City style --

337
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,024
you know, a little sweet,
 a little smoky.

338
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,127
We start out with some pureed
 onion and garlic.

339
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,928
Okay, some steak sauce.

340
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,432
Yellow mustard, ketchup,

341
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,001
lemon juice,
 dark chili powder.

342
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,803
And the kitchen sink.
   Oh, no. Brown sugar.

343
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,571
Some brown sugar.

344
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:57,275
Molasses, white vinegar,

345
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,477
- Wash-your-sister sauce.
 -Worce-your-sister sauce.

346
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,379
And then some honey.

347
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,413
Okay.

348
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,282
Hot sauce.

349
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,218
Kosher salt,
and a little fine-grind pepper.

350
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,419
And there's more!

351
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,755
Some sour mash whiskey.

352
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,090
Mix it up,
throw it on the stove

353
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,458
for about 40 minutes
 at a simmer.

354
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,593
- And that goes on the ribs.
    -Yep.

355
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:18,363
Wow. The little smoker
    that could, man.

356
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,998
Yeah, she's a champ.

357
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,535
And that's...

358
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,236
That's a rib, buddy.
    We slather them on,

359
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,971
or we slather them on,
    put them back in?

360
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,207
On the side. Some people like
sauce. Some people don't.

361
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:31,409
I'd rather kiss your wife
than tell you whether or not

362
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:35,380
to use sauce on your barbecue,
  so...

363
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:37,649
Oh, boy.

364
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:41,019
You're weird.

365
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,320
Look at that.

366
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,889
Everything you love
 about a short rib, but smoked.

367
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:50,195
That sauce fits it
    incredibly well.

368
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:51,262
Thank you.

369
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,398
Tender as can be.
    I mean<i> tender.</i>

370
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,600
This is a great beef rib.

371
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,371
Mmm.

372
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:04,342
You're talking about
    deep, rich flavor,

373
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:09,180
cooked on the bone,
  nice bark right up on top.

374
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,583
Man, it's got it all covered.

375
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:12,617
Mmm.

376
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,252
Beef short rib for Mike!

377
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:15,553
They're fall-off-the-bone.

378
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:18,489
And they're huge. Dinosaur
Flintstone-size, you know.

379
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,659
The sauce is real tangy
 and sweet. It suits everything.

380
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,528
Super crusty.
  It's wicked smoky.

381
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,964
Super crusty. Wicked smoky.

382
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,199
I've been to a lot
 of food trucks in Baltimore,

383
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,500
and this is my favorite one.

384
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,436
It's just good every time.

385
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:34,539
You're doing something here that
 really deserves some respect.

386
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,474
- Pretty righteous.
  -I'm glad you enjoy it.

387
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,445
Up next,
 in Islamorada, Florida...

388
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:41,579
Let's get into this.

389
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:44,148
...a family-run spot
  big on shrimp...

390
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,550
- Well done!
   -Thank you.

391
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,552
...and cooking up
   what you catch.

392
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,920
How do you want it?

393
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:59,530
So, I'm about a half-hour south
   of Key Largo

394
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:00,865
in an area known as Islamorada.

395
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,533
Now, the place
  has got a great story.

396
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,535
The dad wants his daughter
  to move back home,

397
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:05,904
so he buys her a restaurant.

398
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,872
No, Hunter.
 That's not happening for you.

399
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:10,742
I'm here because they tell me if
 you catch it, they'll cook it.

400
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:14,012
This is the Islamorada
   Shrimp Shack.

401
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,346
Shrimp and grits
   in the window!

402
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,382
When you're traveling
 through the Florida Keys,

403
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:18,983
you have to stop
  at the Shrimp Shack.

404
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:19,984
Shrimp po' boy.

405
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,720
You will get fresh,
  amazing seafood.

406
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:25,757
Blackened shrimp tacos
and a conch poor boy with fries.

407
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,225
We can't get enough
   of the place.

408
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,294
Jill just does
  such an excellent job.

409
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,162
That's Keys native Jill Jahn,

410
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,564
whose dad knew
the way to his daughter's heart.

411
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:37,902
I was working as a waitress
in Orlando for like nine months.

412
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,971
The only time I've ever lived
 out of the Keys.

413
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:42,607
And he was like, "What's it
gonna take to get you home?"

414
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,109
And I was like, "Well, I really
want to open a restaurant.

415
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,412
I love to cook."
And he's like, "Let's do it."

416
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:51,382
So she ran the joint
  with her parents

417
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,584
as Squid Row for 12 years,

418
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,853
then left
 to focus on raising her kids,

419
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,555
and her folks sold the place.

420
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,023
We need a Senator style.

421
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,792
But the business
  was in her blood,

422
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:04,028
so in 2011,
 she got the same spot back

423
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,763
and opened up the Shrimp Shack.

424
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,398
'Cause I really wanted
  to do this.

425
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,567
- You still wanted to do it.
 -Had to do it for myself.

426
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,235
And it's still a family affair,

427
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,972
because now her daughter Morgan
  helps run the place.

428
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,907
You'll feel the love.
  These girls are great.

429
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,642
You feel like a local
  when you're here,

430
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,810
whether you are or not.

431
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,445
- An order of shrimp fritters.
   -Thank you.

432
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:22,013
The shrimp fritters
   are fantastic.

433
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,615
Very little breading, it's just
 enough to hold it all together.

434
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:27,452
The sauce is amazing homemade
 remoulade that she makes here.

435
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:28,653
It's an awesome dish.

436
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,688
We got remoulade
 set up right here.

437
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,856
Let's get into this.

438
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,925
All right, so, we're gonna add
 our mayonnaise.

439
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:36,961
What? Feel like
 I'm on the aircraft carrier.

440
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,930
We're gonna add some
 horseradish,

441
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:42,166
Cajun seasoning,
 paprika, mustard,

442
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,401
- fresh garlic.
    -Okay.

443
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,803
We're gonna add a few dashes
of Shrimp Shack hot sauce.

444
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,139
- You have your own hot sauce.
 -Have our own hot sauce.

445
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,207
You guys are too cool.

446
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,908
Now we whisk it,
and it's ready to go.

447
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,677
- Next up, we make the fritter?
    -Yep.

448
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:57,115
We're gonna add our vegetables,
so we're gonna do celery,

449
00:16:57,117 --> 00:17:00,251
green pepper,
red pepper, one onion.

450
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:01,519
I'm gonna add my shrimp.

451
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,988
- De-veined, shelled, chopped up.
   -Shelled, yep.

452
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,356
Chopped not super fine,

453
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,026
'cause I like a nice chunk
of shrimp in each bite.

454
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,628
For leavening, we're gonna add
baking powder to the flour.

455
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,864
I'm gonna do a little salt,
 pepper, garlic.

456
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,365
Get it seasoned up.

457
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,967
Okay.
  You want this incorporated?

458
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:18,836
Yeah, please. I'm gonna add
the egg while you're doing that.

459
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,338
- As the binder, got it.
   -All right.

460
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,407
Then we're gonna add
 the flour mixture.

461
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,909
I like that you got a lot of
product here and a little flour.

462
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,644
And we got a little bit
 of hot sauce.

463
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,846
Okay, so now we start
    to ball it up?

464
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,782
Yep. Put them in the fryer --

465
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:33,384
350 degrees
for four to five minutes.

466
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,319
And that gets served
    with the remoulade.

467
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,687
- Yep.
    -Okay.

468
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:43,628
That is
  just the right amount --

469
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,129
just the right amount
     of flour.

470
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,964
You definitely got
    the shrimp flavor.

471
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,466
All those crunchy veggies.

472
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,168
The perfect size.

473
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,637
Tender in the middle,
   crunchy on the outside,

474
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,807
a little bit of spice
    in the remoulade.

475
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:57,708
If I come to a place
  called the Shrimp Shack,

476
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,545
they make a shrimp fritter,
  it better taste like that.

477
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,547
Awesome.

478
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,082
- Well done!
   -Thank you.

479
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,483
Got two orders
  of shrimp fritters!

480
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:06,717
They're loaded with shrimp.

481
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,753
Even though they're fried,
  they're not greasy.

482
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:09,854
The sauce is excellent.

483
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:11,122
Fish continental.

484
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:12,990
Even though
 it's called the Shrimp Shack,

485
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:16,427
it's known for just putting
 fresh seafood on your plate.

486
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,129
Or what you're catching.

487
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,264
Well, hook and cook is awesome,
  'cause you can go out,

488
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,033
catch some fish,
 bring it to the restaurant.

489
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,301
Be able to have them cook it.

490
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,203
There's many different ways
  that you can get it.

491
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:28,506
It's always good to eat the fish
 that you know you caught.

492
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:30,641
Straight from the hook
to the table. It's hard to beat.

493
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,211
They can just come in here
 and say, "I want it blackened.

494
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,279
I want it grilled.
   I want it pan sautéed.

495
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,414
I want it deep fried."

496
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,849
- Whatever they want.
  -Every day, all day.

497
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:40,118
Regardless to which way
 you get it, you can't go wrong.

498
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,686
What did you bring me today?

499
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:44,122
A little mangrove snapper.

500
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,323
Nice.

501
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,091
- Do you know Captain Tony?
  -Tony's awesome.

502
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,426
He filleted it.
    He cleaned it.

503
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,928
How do you want it?

504
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,296
- Cooked.
  -How about Senator?

505
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,599
- Hook and cook Senator.
   -Thank you.

506
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,734
Fish Senator has sliced almonds,

507
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,003
and then they put mushroom sauce
   over the top.

508
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,771
It's so good.

509
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,107
All right. Senator style.
    Run me through it.

510
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,876
- We're gonna dredge it in flour.
    -Okay.

511
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:07,545
Egg wash,
and then encrust it in almonds.

512
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:09,680
I'm gonna heat
some clarified butter.

513
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:10,882
So the fish cooks up.

514
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:12,984
While that's going,
    we start the --

515
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,186
Mushroom garlic butter sauce.

516
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:16,454
Hit it.

517
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,723
I'm gonna add a little butter,
 a little garlic...

518
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:21,492
- Okay.
 -...mushrooms, scallions,

519
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:25,062
then add a little bit of salt,
a little parsley, lemon juice.

520
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,831
And a little white pepper?

521
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,066
And this will all
   be plated up on what?

522
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,936
A bed of rice, I like it. We
make a different rice every day,

523
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,271
- so...
   -Really?

524
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:36,374
Today is the rice pilaf with,
like, a little bit of saffron.

525
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,075
- Look at that.
 -And then we're gonna top it

526
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:40,545
with our beautiful
mushroom garlic butter.

527
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:42,580
Well, you don't go
    for small here.

528
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,615
You don't leave
the Shrimp Shack hungry.

529
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,188
Mmm. Yeah, I like the little
 almond on the outside of it.

530
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,823
This really lets the fish flavor
    shine through.

531
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:57,695
A little pilaf.

532
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,931
I caught a fish.
 To know that there was a place

533
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:03,234
that would do this for me
  and give me some variety...

534
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:04,335
Nice job, girl.

535
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,804
Only recommendation --

536
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,639
need a bigger plate.

537
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,908
You brought it.
 I cooked it.

538
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,543
Senator style --
  cook your catch.

539
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,579
They do a great
 preparation, but the fish,

540
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,480
at the end of the day,
  he's still the star.

541
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,382
I mean, cook your catch
  is really the best.

542
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,484
Cook your catch.
 I mean, does it get any better?

543
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,186
It's the fishing capital
 of the world.

544
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,088
I've got a Morgan salad
  with coconut shrimp

545
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,389
and a half-dozen oysters.

546
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,591
They do everything good.

547
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:29,026
I'll be here
  as often as I can be.

548
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,395
You embrace where you are.
   Couldn't ask for more.

549
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,430
- Awesome.
   -Nice job.

550
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,365
- Thank you.
  -Real deal, girl.

551
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:40,004
So that's it for this edition of
 "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives."

552
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:42,907
If you want to find the recipes
 to some of the joints we visit,

553
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,942
well, go to foodnetwork.com.

554
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,477
I'll be looking for you
   next time

555
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,313
on "Diners, Drive-Ins,
   and Dives."

556
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:50,982
You always have to --

557
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:53,050
- Hey, come here.
    -Hey.

558
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:59,857
How'd that get weird so fast?
