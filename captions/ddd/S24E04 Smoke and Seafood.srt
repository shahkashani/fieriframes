     kind of butts are we using?

215
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,849

shoulder, or a boneless butt.

220
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,659

right into the smoker.          

221
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,727
     What do we smoke them with?

222
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,194
     For these,                 
we're using peachwood.          

223
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,530
                 Peachwood.     

224
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:21,266
It gives it a flavor profile,   
I think, that nobody else,
