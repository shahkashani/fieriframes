00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:16,134
           AND THEN FINALLY SOME
              CINNAMON STICKS.  

212
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:18,336
OKAY. THAT IS A VERY UNIQUE     
        CONCOCTION.             

213
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,739
           YES. THEN WE ADD THIS
               WINE VINEGAR.    

214
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,807
                THEN WE ADD THIS
                 BURGUNDY WINE, 

215
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,343
               OR USUALLY I TAKE
                WHATEVER'S LEFT 

216
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:26,945
              IN SOME BOTTLES,  
           YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

217
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,546

         IT ALL TASTES THE SAME,
             YOU KNOW, SO...    

218
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,682
AND HOW LONG AS WE GONNA        
   LET THIS MARINATE?           

219
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,884
              BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
               FIVE TO SIX DAYS.

220
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,886
WHAT?!                          
                         YEP.

00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:36,388
SERIOUSLY?!                     
                      SERIOUSLY.

222
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,294
          THIS HAS NOW BEEN     
    IN A MARINADE FOR FIVE DAYS.

223
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,961
THAT IS CRAZY.                  

224
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,563
         WATCH OUT FOR A MINUTE.

225
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,431
         I'M GONNA JUST PUT THAT
                IN THERE.       

226
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,367
SO BROWN ALL THE SIDES?         
                  ALL SIDES,<i> JA.</i>

227
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:52,236
THAT'S A FIRE. AND THEN HOW ARE 
  WE GONNA FINISH THE COOKING?  

228
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:55,106
I ALREADY MADE THE STOCK        
      FROM BONES,               

229
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,976
CHICKEN, EVERYTHING             
  THAT CAME OUT.                

230
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,111
      I AM THEN NOW GONNA ADD...

231
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,180
CARAMELIZED SUGAR.              
          CARAMELIZED SUGAR,<i> JA.</i>

232
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,782
THE SEARED MEAT.                
     A FEW MORE CINNAMON STICKS.

233
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,052
             CLOVES. BAY LEAVES.

234
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:08,653
SO HOW LONG DID THAT COOK?      

235
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,656
               THAT COOKED ABOUT
              THREE HOURS, SLOW.

236
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,126
               AND NOW WE GOT   
           THE FINISHED PRODUCT.

237
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,795
       MAKE A NICE STRAIGHT CUT.

238
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:19,330
  YOU CAN SEE HOW IT'S MARINATED
     AND HOW IT'S COOKED, TOO.  

239
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,533
         IN THE MEANTIME, I HAVE
           MY GRAVY ALL READY,  

240
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,802

                PUT THIS IN.    

241
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,203
THIS IS GONNA BE BANANAS.       

242
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,138
                THEN I'M TAKING 
               THESE TWO PIECES.

243
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,606
AND THEN WE FINISH              
   COOKING IT.                  

244
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,208
       IN ANOTHER MINUTE OR SO, 
     WE'RE GOING TO BE ALL DONE.

245
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,611

                   WE ARE READY.

246
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,480
                NOW YOU HAVE    
           BOTH PIECES ON THERE.

247
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,549
LOOK AT THAT.                   

248
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,150
      PUT SOME SPAETZLE ON HERE.

249
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,485
AND WE STRAIN IT?               

250
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:44,021
          WELL, IT JUST MAKES IT
              NICE AND SHINY.   

251
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,824

255
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,033

257

           CORNSTARCH.          

440
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,723
USUALLY WHEN YOU SAY "SLURRY,"  
     I THINK CORNSTARCH.        
                           YEAH.

  I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GET      
CAUGHT HANGING OUT WITH YOU.    

443
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,663
WE'RE IN THE SOUTH, DUDE.       
YOU'RE NOT MAKING A ROUX.       

444
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,932
YOU'RE MAKING A SLURRY          
TO PUT INTO THIS GRAVY?         

445
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,268

          (both laugh)          

450
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:19,143
          YOU GET THE GRAININESS
             FROM THE BISCUIT   

451
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,344
        AND YOU GET A LITTLE BIT
           OF THAT GRAININESS

                FROM THE--FROM  
             ROUX-BASED GRAVIES.

            SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
OKAY.

00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,249
                  YEAH, ANYWAYS,
                 INTO THE GRAVY,

455
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,418
    WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND PUT

                 OF CELERY SEED.

458

        NOW THE THING IS WE GOT 
      THIS OTHER POT GETTING HOT

459

    GONNA GET THAT IN THERE IN  
  A LITTLE BIT OF A ROCKET HEAT.

461
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,231
              EVER-POPULAR SAGE.
                GROUND PEPPER.  

462
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,900
   YOU CAN LET THAT RENDER DOWN.

463
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,769
         SLURRY TIME IT IS, SIR.

464
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:47,038
            YOU'RE SURE NOBODY'S
           COMING FOR US, RIGHT?

465
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,974

00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,778
SO WE'RE GONNA BRING            
 ALL THE FLAVOR OFF             

468
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,580

                     ABSOLUTELY.

469
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,514
THAT'LL START TO TIGHTEN UP.    
   CHICKEN'S ALMOST DONE,       

470
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,184
THEN WE'LL PLATE IT UP.         
            AND WE'RE GONNA GET 
           OUR BISCUIT SLICE ON.

471
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,586

      LITTLE BIT OF BUTTER.     

472
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:03,988
           WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD 
          AND JUST TOAST IT ALL.

473
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,789

          CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN.

474
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,592

              THE PROVOLONE ON. 

475
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,193
     JUST A TOUCH OF THE SAUSAGE
         GRAVY ON TOP OF IT.    

476
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,928
     AND YOU DO IT              
WITH AN ICE CREAM SCOOP.        

477
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,731
       YEAH. YEAH. JUST A TOUCH.

478
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,467
              TOP IT OFF. VOILÀ.

479
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,735
           WE CALL IT A BISCUIT.

480
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,003
         I'VE YET TO SEE ANYBODY
               PICK IT UP.      

481
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,072
                        (laughs)

WELL...                         

484
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:30,081
   HMM. IT'S NICE. IT'S RICH.   
IT'S MORE THAN A BREAKFAST ITEM.

485
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,684
   I LIKE THE CHICKEN IN IT.    
LOOK AT THAT. WITH CHEESE ON IT?

486
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,753
THAT HAS TO BE A STRONG         
  BISCUIT TO BE ABLE            

487
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:36,954
TO WITHSTAND ALL THIS.          

488
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,289
ALTHOUGH THE GRAVY HAS...       

489
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,090
    (whispers)                  
CORNSTARCH IN IT...

YOU CAN'T TELL.                 

491
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:43,428
IT'S JUST A LIGHTER, THINNER,   
         BUT STILL--            

492
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,896
STILL RICH CONSISTENCY.         
YOU PULLED IT OFF, MAN.         

493
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,965
                      ALL RIGHT.

MM-HMM!                         

497
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,311
