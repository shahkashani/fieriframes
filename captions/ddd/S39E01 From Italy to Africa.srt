81
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:01,713
     [Guy] So you're taking

00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:02,914
       -over to Ethiopia?

        -[Guy] All right.       

84
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,719
  [Eskender] And then, we take  
  also the chicken tenderloin.  

85
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,588
         That's gonna be        
       cooked separately.       

86
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,791
  We're gonna make a marinade,  
  salt and pepper, fresh thyme, 

87
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,592
   fresh oregano, pomegranate,  

88
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,461
 and a little bit of olive oil. 

89
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,729
    I got to be honest, Chef,   

90
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,666
   I didn't see you move this   
  fast in Guy's Grocery Games.  

91
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:24,469
  No, I was paying attention to 
  what other chefs were making. 

92
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,339
     So we have this on top     
      of the chicken thighs     

93
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,673
       and the tenderloin.      

94
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,942
 And then we marinate overnight 
    or for a couple of hours.   

95
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,877
 [Guy] So how are we gonna cook 
       the chicken thighs?      

96
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,547
   [Eskender] Grill it lightly

00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,061
      You're welcome, Troy.     

118
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,596
    Give me a little rundown    
      what's been happening     

119
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,265
      <i> -in the restaurant.</i>      
    -We're trying new dishes,   

120
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,666
      <i> how can we improve,</i>      

121
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,201
      what do people like.      

122
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,336
      Smoked Trout Bacala.      

123
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,538
   -[Eskender]<i> Beluga lentils.</i>  
       -So what do we got?      

124
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,341
     This is Ethiopian style    
       Grilled Flank Steak      

125
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,609
         with Chermoula.        

126
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,678
   -Please explain this to me.  
  -[Eskender]<i> We got a nice cut</i> 

127
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,012
      <i> of lean flank steak.</i>     

128
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:44,416
   We're gonna make a marinade  
  with freshly crushed garlic,  

129
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,551
    lemon juice, a little bit   
       of chopped parsley,      

130
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,686
    pepper, salt, olive oil,    

131
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,755
      and chopped shallots.     

132
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,758
       Make sure it touch       
         every surface.         

133
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:57,129
      Cook our flank steak      
        to a medium rare.       

134
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,500
   And this Chermoula sauce...  

135
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,634
   Is this our Chermoula here   
          that we make?         

136
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:03,835
      -[Eskender] Exactly.      
          -[Guy] Okay.          

137
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,370
        -Chermoula sauce.       
         -That's right.         

138
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,571
     We have chopped parsley    
           over here,           

139
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,508
    cilantro, garlic, cumin,    
         and coriander.         

140
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,644
     The cayenne is gonna be    
 just a little pinch over here. 

141
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,313
      So we have olive oil,     
          lemon juice,          

142
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,381
   of course salt and pepper.   

143
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,648
       And we'll put this       
          in a blender.         

144
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,253
       -[blender whirring]      
  -Good idea, take the lid off. 

145
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,455
      Your ears all right?      

146
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,059
             -What?             
            -[laughs]           

147
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,663
  I wanna get a slip and slide  
         in flavor town         

148
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,265
  and run Charmoula through it. 

149
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,033
            [laughs]            

150
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:38,670
           Flank steak          
      is cooked perfectly.      

151
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,804
    The oil works as a medium   

152
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,740
     so it kind of allows it    
             to coat            

153
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,409
      and really get silky      
       over the top of it.      

154
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,879
       Your base is salty,      
       little bit of heat,      

155
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,748
   little bit of warmth spice,  
      good amount of acid.      

156
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:54,052
     I don't know if you can    
      put that in a bottle.     

157
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:56,221
         We actually do.        

158
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,624
      Grilled Flank Steak.      

159
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,626
    The meat is really fresh,   
        cooked perfectly.       

160
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,696
 <i> The herbs you can really feel</i> 
        <i> and smell on top</i>       

161
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,865
       and everything goes      
      really well together.     

162
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,034
            You know,           
      when you see a movie,     

163
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,436
      I don't wanna go see      
      the sequel because...     

164
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,238
     Well, the sequel is not    
        gonna be as good        

165
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,172
     as the original movie.     

166
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,408
        Well, that's kind       
   of where I'm at right now.

      <i> doesn't disappoint.</i>      

168

 It's an influence of Ethiopia, 
      Spain, and Portugal.      

169
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,782
       That's outstanding.      

170

        -Saffron prawns.

171
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,420

        Triple D legend.        

174
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:38,530
   This is my buddy, Eskender.

        And we are at

     You wanna make another?    

180

  You can't keep this guy down. 

183
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,748
          He literally          
     walked out of Ethiopia.    

184
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,485
       -A little run, too.      
    -A little running as well

   -What else are we gonna do?  

190
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,898
   This is the Saffron Prawns   
        with cauliflower,       

191
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,167
       smoked trout bacala      
         and vegetables.        

192
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:20,572
 It's an influence of Ethiopia, 
      Spain, and Portugal.

00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,373
 Ethiopia, Spain, and Portugal.

   -Exactly. We're neighbors.

198

    -Deveined, that's right.    

202
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,727
      Now, we're gonna make     
       a marinate saffron.      

203
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,529
     A little chili flakes,     

204
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,531
        tiny bit of salt,       
         ground pepper,         

205
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,733

  a squeeze of lemon, mix this. 

208
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,940
        [Guy] Let that go       
       for a couple hours.      

209
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,675
         You wanna just         
        like barely cook.       

210
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,277
       [Guy] Nothing worse      
        than overcooked.        

211
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,479
            Exactly.            

212
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,614
     We drizzle a little bit    
            of Zhug.            

213
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,782

    But I'm not kidding you,    

222
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,635
  this little move that you did

      and played by itself.     

225
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,375
  We cook blanched cauliflower  

226
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,643
          and we flavor         
     with the smoked trout.     

227
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,513

230

  chili flakes goes everywhere, 

231
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:45,523
        green olive oil,        
      and mash it together.     

232
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,458
    [Guy] It's a cauliflower

352
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:50,768

353

     until it's really well     
         and corporate.         

354
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,438
        Put a little bit        
        of the sugo betti       

355
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,507
          right on top          
      of the ricotta here.      

356
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,442
      Spread it as even may     
           as you can.

360
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,649

     layer looks like here.     

361

362
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,653
    and then, the last layer    
    is just sauce and cheese.   

363
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:12,590
  We'll go in a 350 degree oven

       another 20 minutes.      

365
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:17,662
   We cut this up and we take   
     some of that sugo betti    

366
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,330

393
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,122
      We put fennel fronds      
    in the bottom of the pan,   

394
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,391

396

   by wrapping up the shoulder  

397
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,864
          so that belly

      with some white wine,     

399
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:31,603
        and then, put it        
      in a 220 degree oven      

400
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,470
     for at least 12 hours.     

401
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,672
   Now we're ready to assemble  

402
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,541
      our calabrian pepper      
       focaccia sandwich.       

403
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:39,476
       We got a nice toast      
      on the ciabatta bun,      

404
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:40,745
     calabrian pepper aioli,    

405
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,413
            and then,           
     calabrian chili paste,     

406
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:45,149

409
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,289
 and then, we top with it slaw, 

410

       gonna slice in half      

411

413

00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,440

    "I'm really telling you,

423
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:21,719
         I didn't think         
   he define flip out enough.

466
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,676
   Start it with a simple Rub,  

467
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,612
          black pepper,         
      celery seed, salt...      

468
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,681
       -Granulated garlic.      
       -Granulated garlic.      

469
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:57,481
  Just gonna stir that around.  

470
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,615
       That now is ready.       

471
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,817
     Let's put some MiraPLY     
         in the bottom.         

472
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,686
       -[Guy] For the pan.      
     -[Tom] Carrots, onions,    

473
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,488
           and celery.          
    Now, we'll add the Bison,   

474
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,623
  we're gonna pierce the roast, 

475
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,825
   a little psycho into this.   

476
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,560
         Now, we'll add         
       some minced garlic,      

477
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,696
    we're gonna get this rub    
         evenly spread.         

478
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,231
      Do you want the rest      
          of your plaw?         

479
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,799
           [Tom] Yup.           
    This gonna cover the top.   

480
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,633
 We let this marinate for about 

481
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,702
    five hours to overnight,    
       we're gonna add...       

482
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,438
       Put a half a gallon      
         of water here.         

483
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,706
   Just it covers a little bit  
          on the sides.         

484
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,441
   Then we'll wrap it in foil,  

485
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,709
      and it's ready to go      
          in the oven.          

486
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,644
 300, 325 for about five hours? 

487
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,512
     Yup. It should be done.    

488
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:29,847
      We'll take the roast      
         out of the pan         

489
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,582
      and strain the liquid     
         for the gravy.         

490
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,719
  The bison is just rested long 
  enough now for us to cut it.  

491
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:38,055
   Got a crispy outside crust,  
       nice tender inside.      

492
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:39,524
  -[Guy] Dude, that fall apart. 
     -[Tom] It falls apart.     

493
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:40,792
       That goes like that      
      with the vegetables,      

494
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,327
        the super gravy,        
      label it right over.      

495
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,063
 Hmm. That is comfort food 101. 

496
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,398
      Really nice texture.      
     Not only really tender     

497
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:49,934
   but has a real beef flavor.  

498
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,402
      You sure have a knack     
       for pulling it off       

499
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,402
    and making it tasty man.    

500
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,338
       We had a lot of fun
