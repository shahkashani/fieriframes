       WHEN THESE FLAVORS       
      FROM THIS RESTAURANT      

196
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,891
  STARTED TO FLOW INTO THE CAR, 
           AND I SAID,

         "WAIT A SECOND,

198
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,962

 GRAB A LITTLE BIT OF THE PORK.

          LITTLE BIT OF CRUST.

                I LOVE THE MOJO.

264
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:13,244
IT REALLY BRINGS OUT THE FLAVOR,
  AND IT COMPLEMENTS THE PORK.  

265
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:16,047
   A LITTLE BIT OF A SHARP BITE 
   FROM THE WINE AND THE GARLIC.

266
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,649
                   I JUST HAD   
                 A MOJO MOMENT.

        IT'S EXCELLENT.         
     IT'S REALLY DELICIOUS.     

271
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,661

   YOU THROW YOUR OWN

                 IS ALWAYS GOOD.

432
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:49,273

LAMB--VERY, VERY POPULAR.       

471
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,902
JUST WANT TO PUSH               
THIS LEG FORWARD,               

472
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,838

                          RIGHT.

                    A LITTLE BIT

485
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:57,034
          TO KEEP THE JUICES IN.
 WE GOT ENOUGH                  
CRUST ON THERE.                 

486
00:18:57,036 --> 00:19:00,137
OH, THIS SHOULD BE NICE.        
         WATER.                 
                      WATCH OUT.

487
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,139
SOME TOMATO SAUCE.              
           ADD SOME TOMATO SAUCE
                   TO IT.       

488
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,141
AND SOME AJVAR...               
                         MM-HMM.

489
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,143
LIKE A RED BELL PEPPER PASTE    

490
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:08,212
MADE WITH A LITTLE BIT          
     OF EGGPLANT.               

491
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,214
 SO YOU LET THIS GO FOR         
ANOTHER HOUR AND A HALF?        
                        CORRECT.

492
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,217
                       POTATOES.
SO OVERALL, THIS IS GONNA GET   
FOUR TO FIVE HOURS OF COOKING.  

493
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,285
         ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY.
              A LOT OF LOVE.    
(whistles)                      

494
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,888
   ALL OF OUR DISHES TAKE TIME, 

495
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,289
                TO GET THE BEST 
               FLAVOR OUT OF IT.
I LIKE IT.                      

496
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,693
 WOW, LOOK AT THAT. THAT BAD BOY
    IS SIMMERIN' AND BOILIN'.   

497
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:25,295
OKAY, SO...                     
        JUST GONNA BRING OUR    
    CLAY POT, PUT SOME WATER IN.

498
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,297
IS THIS JUST TO DO IT           
 THE AUTHENTIC WAY?             

499
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,034
     WELL, OF COURSE, TRADITION,
       BUT AS WELL THE FLAVOR.  

500
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:32,036
                GONNA THROW IN  
              SOME VEGETABLES...
EXCELLENT.

00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:33,837
          ZUCCHINI AND EGGPLANT,
            ONIONS AND PEPPERS. 

502
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:36,774
SO WE DON'T WANT TO PUT THE LAMB
 SHANKS DIRECTLY ON THE BOTTOM. 

503
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,843
         WE PUT SOME VEGETABLES.
THAT'S WHY YOU PUT THE VEGGIES  
  THERE, SO IT DOESN'T BURN.    

504
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,845

           ADD THE JUICE TO IT, 

505
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,381
             FINISH OFF THE REST
             OF THE VEGETABLES. 

506
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,784
JUST ON A LOW SIMMER.           
            YEAH, VERY LOW HEAT,
             LET IT SIT THERE...

507
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,253

      LET IT DO ITS MAGIC--YEAH.

                 ON THE MENU?   

511

             WE GOT HERE.       

514

   LAMB FLAVOR THAN I EXPECTED. 

517
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,411

             ACCOMPANIMENT.
