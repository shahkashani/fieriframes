                 and then       
           a little bit of salt.

00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,394
The lick is the flame           
coming over the top.            

234
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,197
           So we got these nice,
         toasted chile de árbol.

235
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,865
Take a big hit of that.         
         Whoa.                  

236
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:57,001
 We're going to pulse this with 
some of the Calabrian chili oil.

237
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,870
       Oh, I'm so               
taking some of his home.        

238
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,137
               Chile de árbol.  

239
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,940
     And we're going to put them
           into the blended oil.

240
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,675
      All right, Calabrian chili
            goes in there.      

241
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,944
 Oh, those Calabrian            
 chilis are so good.            
                      Love them.

242
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:08,947
Let me pour the oil in it too.  
                 You're the man.

243
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,815
                 In goes        
        the Calabrian chili oil.

244
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,017
          Cover it up and put it
          to bed for seven days.

245
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,487
Then strain it through          
     cheese cloth.              
                            Yep.

246
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,155
         Calabrian chili's going
     into the brussel sprouts --

247
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,490
             it's going to set  
           for about four hours.
  Got it.                       

248
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,492
      So now we're going to make
           the Belgio Dolce.    

249
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:24,162
   -Boy, that is just tender.   
             -Yeah.             

250
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,431
      Start with a white base --
            cream, butter,      

251
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,432
      our house-made mozzarella,
           a little oregano.    

252
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,167
           -Sicilian?           
           -Sicilian.           

253
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:33,104
               Soppressata      
        and Calabrian chili oil,

254
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,572
         shaved brussel sprouts.
   Ahh!                         

255
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:37,642
      Into our oven, 90 seconds.
Give it a little kiss up top.   

256
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,377
      -A little dome time.      
         -Let's see it.         

257
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,312
     Look at that! Come on.     

258
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,848
        We're going to finish it
 with a little bit of pistachio,

259
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,784
           local mesquite honey,
           Calabrian chili oil. 
Okay. [ Whistles ]              

260
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,920
      Cut it right on the plate.

261
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:53,458
 My friend, as always,          
you do not disappoint.          

262
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:55,593
So Calabrian chili oil          
   and the honey --             

263
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,597
that combo, the balance         
  between the sweet,            

264
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:00,365
that little saltiness           
 of the pistachio --            

265
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,734
 your mouth is just confused the
 entire time you're eating this.

266
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:05,936
The dough in this pizza is nice 
and light, the char on it       

267
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:08,239
   really sets it off.          
That is a dynamite pizza.       

268
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,842
Well, this is John's son Adam.  

269
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,077
          He gets his good looks
                 from me.       

270
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:13,411
And he's a wrestler.            

271
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,946
I think you could wrestle       
your son to the ground.         

272
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:17,148
     He's afraid, actually.     
                    [ Laughing ]

273
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,950
         He's so scared.        

274
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,752
   All right, Adam,             
tell me what you think.         

275
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:24,088
           Mm! Oh wow.          
        It tastes nutty.        

276
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,223
    It is nutty.                

277
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,625
       This is definitely       
        a home run, Dad.        

278
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,828
 I would give it about 12 stars.

        -I got 12 stars.

     Here's a Belgio Dolce.     

282
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:38,836
  The pizza's really flavorful, 
the crust is just how I like it.

283
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:40,705
   Brussel sprouts -- amazing.  

284
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,907
     A little bit of crunch     
    of the pistachios on top,   

285
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,709
     just makes it a really     
       well-rounded pizza.      

286
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,644
WOMAN: It's a really great place
        to come together        

287
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,315
      to enjoy great food,      
 but also a sense of community. 

288
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,852
GUY: Which is why John is so key
 to my "Triple D" alumni family,

289
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,386
  along with our mutual buddy,  

290
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:58,323
         the late, great        
      Mike "Hodad" Hardin.      

291
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,724
  I love you, man,              
  you're the bomb.

  Thanks, brother.              

293
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,795
   You ought to see the tribute 
   we did to him at Salsa Brava.

294
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:06,664
 I had previously been doing    
this tour with the military.    

295
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,299
These guys took it even         
    a step farther              

296
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:09,667
 and created a group            
called the Messlords.           

297
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,269
Hodad was a really big          
piece of it, and I mean,        

298
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,603
  I'll start crying             
 about it right now.            

299
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,406
  Your appreciation             
  of life, family,              

300
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,673
  the way you take              
  care of people --             

301
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,742
it really represents            
in the food that you make.      

302
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:18,877
         Everything here        
        is the real deal.       

303

    Pesto spaghetti working.    

304

Like too legit to...?

                I won't quit.   

306
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,216
It's too legit, I won't quit.   

307
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,886
             It's not like pizza
          you get anywhere else.

308
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,154
           Here comes the Kenai.

309
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:31,155
       If you love salmon,      
      have the Kenai pizza.     

310
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:32,890
     Mixed with some creamy     
           dill sauce.

    -Best pizza on the menu.    
    -What are we making next?

00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,695
         The house-smoked salmon
            for our Kenai pizza.

313
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,962
Now where's the salmon          
     coming from?               

314
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,898
         The Copper River Delta,
        a river called the Eyak.

315
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,166
What was the fish's name?

   piece of fish.               

319
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,104
             We're going to make
          a brine for it. Water.

320
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,374
             Sicilian sea-salt, 
               brown sugar --   

321
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:52,243
         let it do a flash brine
           for about four hours.

322
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:55,313
Got it.                         
 We're going to add the hickory 
      chips to the smoking pan. 

323
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,048
               The salmon into  
             the perforated pan.

324
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,582
              We season it with 
             our house seasoning

325
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:01,118
   and we're gonna put it on the
     stovetop for eight minutes.

326
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,987
So you're just going to         
perfume it with smoke?          

327
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,323
              -Yep.             
       -That's delicious.       

328
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,657
             Now we're going to 
               make the Kenai.  

329
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,993
       You got our white base --
           housemade mozzarella.

330
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,929
First time we ever made mozz    
was by Panini Pete's.           

331
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,463
               Yeah, he's got   
             a great restaurant.

332

Panini Pete's new place now.

            we all get to share.

334
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:19,537
           All right, now we add
  some ricotta, pecorino romano,

335
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,539
              and a little bit  
             of Italian oregano.

     a little bit of fresh dill,

338
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,545
            some red onion,     
      and house-made dill cream.

339
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,547
      Gorgeous.                 

340
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,082
This is redonkulous.            

341
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,551
I love that you didn't put the  
salmon on the pizza in the oven.

342
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,954
That would have killed it.      
The fresh dill, lights out.     

343
