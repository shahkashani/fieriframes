YOU A BIG HADDOCK FAN?

      EXACTLY THE WAY I LIKE IT.

115

              THE TOP OF IT HAS 
             LIKE A BRUSCHETTA. 

116
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,610
      SO WHAT                   
ARE WE MAKING NOW?              
           WE'RE GONNA MAKE     
      SOME BALSAMIC VINAIGRETTE,

117
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,612
           WHICH WE'RE GONNA ADD
            TO OUR BRUSCHETTA.  

118
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,548
               AND WE USE THAT  
            ON OUR ITALIAN FISH.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET STARTED.   
       WHAT DO WE GOT?          

119
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,217
      WE'RE GONNA TAKE SOME     
 FRESH THYME, PUT THAT IN THERE,

120
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,020
                ROSEMARY,       
         A LITTLE DIJON MUSTARD,

121
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:49,755
              BALSAMIC VINEGAR. 

122
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,224
  WE'RE GONNA DUMP THE REST OF  
 THAT BALSAMIC VINEGAR IN THERE.

123
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:54,292
               SLOWLY DRIZZLE IN
                OUR OLIVE OIL,  

124
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:56,294
                  VEGETABLE OIL.
BECAUSE YOU CAN CUT IT.         

125
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,696
   IT DOESN'T                   
HAVE TO BE ALL--                
               YEAH, YOU DON'T  
            WANT TOO MUCH OLIVE.

126
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:01,299
               IT'S TOO PUNGENT.
               A LITTLE PEPPER. 

127
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:04,903
           A LITTLE KOSHER SALT.
IT'S LIKE MAKING AN ITALIAN     
  MILKSHAKE FOR A SALAD.        

128
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,972
WOW, LOOK AT HOW MUCH           
 THAT TIGHTENED UP?             

129
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,841
 AND THAT WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT 
    OF MUSTARD THAT DID THAT.   

130
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,176
                   PRETTY TASTY.
I'LL TAKE THAT ANY DAY.         

131
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,178
                ALL RIGHT,      
          WE'LL SET THAT ASIDE..
OKAY.                           

132
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:17,248
      AND THEN WE'LL START DOING
     SOME BRUSCHETTA, ALL RIGHT?
DIG IT. (whistles)              

133
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,384
         WE'RE GONNA USE        
 THE TOMATO KING ON THE TOMATOES

134
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,519
              TO CORE THESE OUT.
WELL, YOU JUST DO THAT.         

135
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,988
I WANT TO STICK IT IN           
   AND MAKE IT GO.              
           YOU WANT TO STICK IT?
           HERE, PUT TWO OF 'EM.

136
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:26,190
           BUT GO SLOW WITH IT, 
             NICE AND STEADY.   

137
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,327
 YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST PUSH IT 
      THROUGH TOO QUICKLY,      

138
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,194
           'CAUSE YOU'LL END UP 
            WITH FRENCH FRIES.  

139
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,397
                 IT'S NICE, HUH?
LOOK AT WHAT I MADE.            

140

141
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,535
     YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND  
   SOME WORK--WORK FOR YOURSELF.
WELL, YOU KNOW.                 

142
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,670
   WE'LL TAKE SOME FRESH BASIL, 
    SOME ONION, CHOPPED GARLIC, 

143
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,273
 LITTLE BALSAMIC, A LITTLE SALT 
      AND PEPPER TO TASTE.      

144
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,141
HAVE ALL THEIR ALBUMS.          

145
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:46,477
SO THAT'S GONNA BE THE TOPPING

                            YES.

182
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,400
        WHEN I WAS A KID,       

183
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,869
 ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I'D ASK
      MY MOM IN THE MORNING     

184
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,404
     IS "WHAT'S FOR DINNER?"    

185
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:21,806
       I MEAN, I ASKED HER      
    WHAT'S FOR DINNER SO MUCH   

186
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,141
       IT DROVE HER NUTS,       

187
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,410
   DROVE HER NUTS TO THE POINT  
     WHERE SHE MADE A RULE.     

188
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,812
 I WASN'T ALLOWED TO ASK "WHAT'S
 FOR DINNER?" UNTIL AFTER LUNCH.

189
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,414
     NOW WHAT WAS I HOPING?     

190
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:31,883
 WELL, JUST LIKE ANY KID, I WAS 
 HOPING SHE WAS GONNA SAY PIZZA.

191
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,553
  NOW USUALLY IT WASN'T PIZZA,  
SO THAT'S WHY HERE ON TRIPLE "D"

192
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:37,422
    EVERY TIME I GET A CHANCE   
   TO TRY THE PIE I AM THERE.   

193
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,224
      I'M ON THE EAST SIDE

220
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:38,016
  I THINK THIS CAME OFF         
THE "U.S.S. ENTERPRISE."        

221
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:39,751
OKAY, A LITTLE SALT...          
                   PROBABLY DID.

222
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,086
LITTLE SUGAR.                   
                   LITTLE SUGAR.

223
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,554
   ONE CAKE OF YEAST DISSOLVED. 

224
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,156
ONE YEAST CAKE.                 
                           YEAH.

225
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,358
                   QUART OF OIL.
JUST REGULAR CANOLA?            

226
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,427
         LITTLE BIT OF OLIVE OIL
         BLENDED IN THERE, TOO. 

227
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:52,697
AND THEN SOME WARM WATER        
TO KEEP THE YEAST ALIVE.        
                   YOU'RE RIGHT.

228
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,166
          WE USUALLY MAKE THIS  
       TWO TO THREE TIMES A DAY.
WHAT?                           

229
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:58,570
              EACH BATCH MAKES  
              ABOUT 80 PIZZAS.  
THAT'S A LOT OF PIE.            

230
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,171
                   LET THIS MIX.
TEN MINUTES?                    

231
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,773
                           YEAH.
AND THEN START HACKING 'EM OFF, 
     WEIGHING 'EM AND GOING.    

232
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,910
                             GO.
THIS IS MASSIVE.                

233
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,378
                           YEAH.
(accent) IT'S A BRAIN.          

234
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,313
                WE'RE GONNA ROLL
                   SOME DOUGH.  

235
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,315
      WEIGH IT OUT TO 16 OUNCES.
(normal voice) OKAY.            

236
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,584
                   PERFECT.     
              TURN THE DOUGH IN.
ROLL 'EM IN.                    

237
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,986
     ROLL 'EM IN, TIGHTEN UP    
 THE BOTTOM. PUT IT ON THE TRAY.

238
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,055
SO THEY PROOF AGAIN             
AFTER WE ROLL THEM.             

239
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,457
THEN YOU POUND THEM DOWN        
JUST TO GET 'EM STARTED,        

240
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:21,660
  AND NOW WE GET                
TO THIS POINT HERE              

241
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,928
WHERE WE'RE GONNA MAKE          
     SOME PIZZAS.               
           WE'RE GONNA MAKE PIE.

242
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,797
      JUST GENTLY SPREAD IT OUT.
     YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
   SEE, EVERYBODY               
HAS THEIR OWN STYLE.            

243
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,199
I'M INTO... (whistles)          

244
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,535
  AND I LIKE MY SAUCE           
ALL THE WAY TO THE EDGE.        
                           YEAH.

245
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,471
         SEE HOW NICE AND CHUNKY
              THAT SAUCE IS?    
OKAY, SO LET'S RECAP            
    THIS SAUCE.                 

246
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,807
    YOU SWEAT THE ONIONS,       
LITTLE BIT OF SUGAR IN THIS.    

247
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:39,877
       AND SALT, OREGANO, BASIL,
          STANISLAUS TOMATOES.  
DIG IT.                         

248
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,347
      OKAY, NOW WE'RE GONNA TAKE
        SOME MOZZARELLA CHEESE, 

249
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,082
                  PART SKIM,    
               NICE AND CREAMY. 

250
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,283
            IT'S GREAT.         
   THIS IS MARGHERITA PEPPERONI.

251
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,886
MMM.                            
               THIS IS THE BEST.

252
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,287
THAT'S GOT GREAT SPICE TO IT.   
           WE CUT IT REAL THICK.

253
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:53,891
                THIS IS WHAT    
             OUR CUSTOMERS LOVE.
   PEPPERONI FAT THAT           
REALLY FLAVORS THE PIE.         

254
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,561
                          RIGHT.
THE TOPPING TO DOUGH RATIO      
        IS 50-50.               

255
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,097
                           YEAH.
SO WE'RE GONNA COOK 'EM         
ON THESE PANS, THOUGH?          

256
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,299
YEP. STICK 'EM INTO THE OVEN,   
            550.                

257
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,368
         COMING AROUND ME.      
   WHAT, ARE WE GONNA DANCE NOW?

258
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,904
OKAY, STOP THAT.                
GET IN THE OVEN.                
      HANSEL AND GRETEL OR WHAT?

259
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,239
JUMP IN.                        
     HOW LONG IS THIS GONNA TAKE
               TO COOK?         

260
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:09,974
SEVEN, EIGHT MINUTES.           
             LOOK AT THOSE PIES.

261
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,777
THESE ARE PERFECT.              
           THAT'S NOT FAT, BABY.
               THAT'S FLAVOR.   

262
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,912
YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF OIL    
       IN THAT PAN...           
                           YEAH.

263
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,847
SO IT DOESN'T STICK,            

264
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,317
BUT IT ALSO KIND OF CREATES THIS
 LITTLE BIT OF A FRIED TEXTURE. 
             YEAH.              

265
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,918
THIS THING SOUNDS LIKE          
     AN ICEBREAKER              

266
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:23,388
ON A SHIP IN ALASKA.            

267
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,590
                            HOT.
I LOVE TO FEEL THE BURN.        

268
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,925
MMM. THAT PEPPERONI             
  IS RIDICULOUS.                

269
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,126
        IT'S MY DAD'S FAVORITE. 

270
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,329
           COST IS NOT AN ISSUE 
               TO MY FATHER     

271
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:32,930
   WHEN IT COMES TO THAT PIZZA. 

272
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,066
                 THAT PEPPERONI,
                 IT'S LIKE GOLD.
IT'S AN INTERESTING             
    CRUST STYLE,                

273
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,469
 LITTLE BIT DOUGHY BUT A REAL   
NICE HEAVY CRUST ON THE BOTTOM. 

274
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,737
I THINK THE WAY I WOULD DESCRIBE
        THAT PIE THE BEST       

275
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,806
IS TO SAY IT'S REALLY FRESH.    
                      THANK YOU.

276
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,608
MMM.                            
                SMALL PEPPERONI,
                  EXTRA CHEESE. 

277
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,410
NO ONE ELSE HAS PEPPERONI       
       LIKE THIS.               

278
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:47,812
     IT'S DELICIOUS. IT'S ALWAYS
     WHERE WE ORDER PIZZA FROM. 

279
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,348
                   PESTO VEGGIE.
(woman) LOOK AT ALL THE TOPPINGS
         ON THE PIZZA.          

280
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,617
            WELL, THIS IS LIKE  
          THE HOUSE OF TOPPINGS.
          YEAH, IT IS.          

281
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,353
   NOW WHERE DID THE RECIPES

    HER MOTHER.

312
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,493
         SO IT DOES A LITTLE BIT
              OF STEAMING.      

313

         INCORPORATE EVERYTHING.

388
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:01,532

           THE BOTTOM CRUST.    

394
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,216
     TAKE THE FILLING, 3 POUNDS.
BRUSH THE EDGE.

       TAKE THE BACK OF A KNIFE,
        SLIDE IT RIGHT AROUND.  

399
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,427
            AND THEN WE'RE GONNA
              EGG-WASH THE TOP. 
EGG-WASH AGAIN.                 

400
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,829
