              a plumber first?

               Now you took it  
              to a restaurant.  

47
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,695
I wanted to bring back

 We're going to work            
on our Kanaka poke first.       

53
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:48,840
"Kanaka" means "local."

                 great poke?    

55
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,911
Great poke has to be fish       
that's fresh out of the water.  

56
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,579
So, today we're going to        
cut up a whole tuna.

  a 50 pound tuna.              

59

             put that in my car.

62
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,793

There you go.                   

63
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,328
  There's all these little bones
               inside of this.  

64
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,731
And for our poke, we only use   
the best part of the tuna.      

65
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,600
          That's mean and clean.
       Yep.

67
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,536
                   to have      
             a great fishmonger.

   My fish market in Santa Rosa,
              a big shout out.  

69

                They kill it.   

70
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:22,941
             So, now we're gonna
                 take this.     

71
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,076
We're going to cube it.         

72
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:25,810
          You're like a surgeon.
                    Ohh!        

73
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,879
Look at that.                   
     This is a lot of work, bro.

74
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,081
          So, next, we're making
 our Hawaiian chili pepper water

75
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,283
    Chili water.                
                    Chili water.

76
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:33,685
           So, we got the water,
             Hawaiian sea salt, 

77
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,088
           our blend of Hawaiian
               chili peppers,   

78
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,356
            garlic, and vinegar.

79
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,424
             We're going to just
             let that boil down.

80
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:40,959
           Put it in the fridge,
               let that cool,   

81
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,761
            and then we're going
           to add our limu kohu.

82
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,830
 Oh, I love when you            
 put the limu kohu.             

83
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:45,831
          "Limu" means "seaweed"
                in Hawaiian,    

84
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,899
                 almost like    
              a sea asparagus.  

85
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,235
I got somebody right now trying 
to write "limu kohu."           

86
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,837
So, the beautiful poke.         

87
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,105
                First we add    
             our Hawaiian salt. 

88
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:54,305
  Sweet onions.                 
                   Green onions.

89
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,574
        This is a different type
                 of seaweed.    

90
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:58,243
          It's called "ogo," and
we're gonna add our Aloha shoyu.

91
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:00,045
 Hawaiian soy sauce.            
                   Oyster sauce.

92
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,446
  And then a bunch              
   of chili water.

that delicious poke.            

100

You're the one that introduced  
us to real Hawaiian poke        

101
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,160
  back in the day.              

102
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,397
He's the understudy.

This guy is the real deal.      
    Be good, bro.

  The rice with the             
furikake, mac salad.            

106
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,608
          And boom -- That's our
          poke bowl right there.

107
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,608
That's how you roll.            

108
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,944
I'm not messing around.         

109
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,479
 Yo! It's delicious.            

110
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:37,949
 The fish is melting            
   in your mouth,               

111
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,351
and you get all these           
little textural pieces          

112
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:41,286
    from the ogo                
and from the green onion        

113
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:42,354
and from the cabbage.           

114
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:43,755
And then you get the            
sweetness of the rice.          

115
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,223
Then you get a big bite         
 of the yellow onion            

116
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,692
that really refreshes           
    your palate.                

117
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:51,897
  Oh, my gosh! I can't get this 
  in my face hole fast enough.  

118

and then maybe a cooler         
   and some beer.

         in your mouth.         

122
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,706
      It has just the right     
        amount of spice.        

123

        The heartbreaker,

133
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,393
      which is pork steamed     
       in taro luau leaf,       

134
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,328
  and they cover it with gravy. 

135
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,930
     Elevating it to a level    
       that's just divine.      

136
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,199
 Don't tell me we're            
  gonna cook food.              

137
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:28,600

           for our heartbreaker.

140
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,138
 Pork lau lau, okay.            

141
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,672
              Yeah, we just got 
      a boneless pork butt here,

142
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:35,740
             cut it into cubes. 

143
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,208
  And it's wrapped              
 in the taro leaves.            

144
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,810
      It's the Hawaiian spinach,
                 basically.     

145
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:42,214
      Grab foil here, take about
      three or four taro leaves.

146
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:43,748
                  We'll add     
           three pieces of pork,

147
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,418
           two of these pork fat
       to retain that juiciness.

148
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,353
          Take some of our salt,
           sprinkle it all over,

149
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:51,489
              and wrap our taro 
              leaves like that. 
Seriously?                      

150
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,358
        Throw 'em in the steamer
      for about five, six hours.

151
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,827
             You want that port 
               really tender.   
  Okay.                         

152
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,228
          So, now we're gonna do
               our fried rice.  

153
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,564
             Get some oil down, 
      we'll add our smoked pork.

154
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,233
            We actually make it.
       Really?                  

155
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:04,703
             Portuguese sausage,
       onions, carrots, cabbage.

156
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,237
             We use brown rice. 
I like it.                      

157
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,507
               Add some shoyu,  
         garlic salt and pepper,

158
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,509
 soy sauce, bit of oyster sauce,
            sesame oil, as well.

159
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,511
             Then we top it off 
         with some green onions.

160
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,048
         There's our fried rice.
   Beautiful.                   

161

    Nicely done.                

162
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,317
 So, we got to pull             
  the lau lau out.              

163
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,919
              We're gonna make  
             our tempura batter.

164
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,455
             We have our flour, 
   add some corn starch to that,

165
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:24,990
          some salt, cold water.

166
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,458
               We're gonna do   
               some whisking.   

167
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,593
              Take our lau lau, 
              toss it in flour. 

168
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,795
   You deep fry it              
with the leaves, too?           

169
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:30,729
                   You eat      
              the leaves, yeah. 

170
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,497

      Get in our tempura batter,
            put it in our panko.

172
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,267
           We're gonna take this
             right in the fryer.

173
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,802
   And what's the               
brown gravy made of?            

174
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,471
            Butter, flour, salt,
           and then a little bit

175
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,672
          of our Kobe drippings.

         with some green onions.

180
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,951
And normally you put a          
poached egg that you tempura.   

181
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,953

you were a little kid,          

260

and you had Play-Doh,           

261
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,119
   and it came out              
and you got excited?            

262
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,988
That's what I'm going           
 through right now.             

263
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,591
             Dip it in the rice

265
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,861
Look at this little routine     
you got going, though.          

266
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,930
             Oh, yeah. And then 
              it's going to go  

267
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,065
               into our smoker  
            for like 20 minutes.

268
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,466
   We're actually               
 smoking the pasta?

00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,734
             We smoke the pasta.

272
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,340

                 the smoke.

   Cacio e pepe --              
 cheese and pepper.             

277
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:15,353
It is one of the staples

278
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,488
              We're gonna drop

279
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,957

    Okay.                       

281
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,328
               And we'll start  
      with a little pasta water.

282
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,963
Which has got a little bit      
 of starch in that,             

283
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,765
     so that'll                 
   tighten it up.               

284
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,167
               Next is butter   
  and fresh-ground black pepper.

285
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,102
  This is super key

286
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,571

it'll come together.

at this with a scowl,

         Let's cook the gnocchi.

369

Okay chef, what kind of sauce   
 are we gonna make?             

370
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,074
              Fresh artichokes, 
              lemon, and mint.  

371
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,343
Let's make it happen.           

372
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:01,146
         Olive oil, a little bit
        of butter, fresh garlic.

373
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:02,614
You see how he pulls            
  it off the flame?             

374
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,949
It's one of the great things    
about cooking with gas,         

375
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,685
not that you have gas --        
  Well, but you --              

376
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,888
   Okay, you know               
what I meant, though.           

377
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,290
I don't like electric stoves.   
That's what I'm trying to say.  

378
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,358
 Now the artichoke.             

379
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
                This is salt    
              and pepper mixed. 

380
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:18,563
             And we're gonna put
    the fresh mint, pasta water.

381
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:19,664
   Let that reduce              
    a little bit.               

382
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,834
        And add the lemon juice,
              Parmesan cheese.  

383
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,903
              That will kind of 
           thicken up the sauce.

384
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,771
                    Okay,       
            the gnocchi's ready.

385
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:29,306

387
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,510
                It's gonna go   
               onto the plate.  

388
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,844
