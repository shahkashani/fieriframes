1
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:03,102
         I'm Guy Fieri,
      and we're rolling out

2
00:00:03,104 --> 00:00:06,505
 looking for America's greatest
  diners, drive-ins, and dives.

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,507
          This trip...
 Magic man.

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,043
       ...it's burgers...
  Hold on.
Get the grinder!

5
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:12,444
         ...barbecue...

6
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,380
I don't know that I'm supposed
to eat it or tackle it.

7
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:16,382
     ...and plenty of flavor
          in between...

8
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,716
                  So good.

9
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:20,786
     ...like at a real-deal
  smoke shack in San Antonio...

10
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:23,455
          We're old-school here.
       This is a barbecue joint.

11
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:26,058
     ...an Asian powerhouse
           in Napa...

12
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,826
              I can't shove it
        in my mouth fast enough.

13
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,561
    ...and in Little Rock...
One more bite.

14
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:32,164
      ...a farm-fresh joint
    that will blow your mind.

15
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,599
       Like...

16
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:35,734
That is outstanding.

17
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,036
     That's all right here,

18
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:39,204
      right now on "Diners,
       Drive-Ins & Dives."

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,820
  So, I'm here in San Antonio,
         Texas, and yes,

20
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:57,122
      ladies and gentlemen,
  it is always bigger in Texas.

21
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:58,357
 I'm here to check out a joint.

22
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,858
 This guy has got three of them.

23
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,794
     He's got a meat market
    over here, he's got a bar

24
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:03,162
  and a food truck over there,

25
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:04,863
        and he's also got
      this little joint --

26
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:08,300
        The Smoke Shack,
    BBQ and Southern Kitchen.

27
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:10,169
      Hey, Guy,
do we got valet here?

28
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:12,571
Just on the weekends.

29
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,542
           Turkey, chicken plate
               in the window.

30
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,444
 Of all the barbecue joints that
    there is in San Antonio,

31
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:20,946
    this is the place to be.
    -Brisket grilled cheese.

32
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,281
Chris grew up in Texas,

33
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:24,116
    so he has a lot of Texas
      barbecue influences,

34
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:26,251
   and then he went to college
        in the southeast.

35
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,387
Where Chris Conger
  took the barbecue rig

36
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:30,222
             he got
   for high school graduation.

37
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:33,258
I went to school in Mississippi,
        so we've got pork and --

38
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,961
You're going
to get us run out of Texas.

39
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:37,563
You can't do pork in Texas.

40
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:38,797
       We brought pork to Texas.

41
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,199
       Don't!
They're going to get mad.

42
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,667
           All right, all right,
                 all right.

43
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:44,002
  Not to worry, he's still got
       plenty of Lonestar

44
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,404
      shining on his menu.

45
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:46,805
          Two corn chip pies up.

46
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:49,541
   There's nothing more Texas
       than corn chip pie.

47
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,778
 Brisket mixed in with the beans
  and the chips and the cheese.

48
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,012
       It's a real treat.

49
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,948
         -Corn chip pie.
    -Make it happen, captain.

50
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,850
              So first, the rub
             for the brisket --

51
00:01:57,852 --> 00:01:59,418
           salt, and, of course,
                black pepper.

52
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,786
     Of course.

53
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,822
    Chili powder, garlic pepper,
          paprika, onion powder,

54
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:05,424
              and brown sugar.

55
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,593
Doing it with a little bit
of your Mississippi attitude

56
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:08,927
all the way down here
   in San Antonio.

57
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,829
                   That's right.
   And how long
is this going to sit?

58
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,064
             Four to six hours.

59
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,599
 This is going to go
 to the smoker now.

60
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:14,967
               12 to 14 hours.

61
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,935
   -What do we got to do next?
        -Barbecue sauce.

62
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,637
    So, ketchup,
apple cider vinegar...

63
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,772
          -Some water.
   -A whole mess of molasses.

64
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,875
                A whole mess.
              Some steak sauce.

65
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:24,776
              So, here we have
             our mustard sauce,

66
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:29,281
         which has this barbecue
           sauce in it, as well.

67
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,949
       I'm not going to tell you
              how we did that.

68
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,684
     Magic man.

69
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,186
You're standing too close
 to the smoker, son.

70
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:35,587
Wash-your-sister sauce.

71
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,556
           Worcestershire sauce,
    garlic pepper, barbecue rub,

72
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,091
          black pepper, honey...

73
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:42,294
            -Darling.
  -...and the kicker, cinnamon.

74
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:44,763
            -Doctor.
            -Scalpel.

75
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:48,033
The rest of the industry
uses an immersion blender.

76
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:50,569
     Hey, we're old-school here.
       This is a barbecue joint.

77
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:51,770
What do we got next?

78
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:55,874
       Beans, olive oil, onions,
                 jalapeños.

79
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,509
      We like it spicy in Texas.

80
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,078
               Garlic and some
              salt and pepper.

81
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,580
Caramelize this down
    a little bit.

82
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:02,915
       Add our crushed tomatoes,

83
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:05,150
             add our pinto beans
              to the hot water.

84
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:08,120
  We've already boiled these off
       once to get the bran off.

85
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:09,821
             Sauté it, spice it.

86
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,658
         -Garlic pepper.
     -Salt and chili powder.

87
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,327
     Let those cook down an hour
             and a half to two.

88
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:18,163
Don't fill up on chips now.

89
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,932
    Hey, you should see how much
meat we're going to put on this.

90
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:21,099
     All right.

91
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,467
             We're going to put
               the cheese on.

92
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,169
       After that goes the beans
             to melt the cheese.

93
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:25,470
Yeah, melt the cheese.

94
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,139
        Next, we're going to add
                our brisket.

95
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:28,807
This little paper boat doesn't
know what's happening to it.

96
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,143
                 Top it off
        with our barbecue sauce.

97
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,946
             The corn chip pie.

98
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:37,049
Corn chip pie is like pizza --
   when it's good,

99
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,785
it's really good, and when
it's bad, it's still good.

100
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:43,422
 This happens to be
on the very good side of things.

101
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:46,358
The beans have got great flavor,
   great texture.

102
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,594
The corn chips just add a nice,
   little crunch,

103
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:50,762
but it's the barbecue
 that really sings.

104
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,864
  I mean, you took
a pretty simple staple

105
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,600
 to a lot of people
who serve at a ball game

106
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:57,469
   and really put
the culinary touch to it.

107
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:58,503
           -Delicious.
          -Thanks, man.

108
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00,272
    Outstanding.

109
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:02,140
         -Corn chip pie.
           -Thank you.

110
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,442
   The brisket is phenomenal.

111
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,577
      A perfect compliment
       to the corn chips.

112
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,980
    The sauce he puts on top
   of the brisket, I love it.

113
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:09,815
     -Best food I ever had.
             -Ever?

114
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,116
             -Ever.
           -Yes, ever.

115
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,252
                    Wow.
   Two of my brothers over here,

116
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:14,886
               we've had quite
      a few adventures together.

117
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,188
           What else did you try
                on the menu?

118
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,758
These ribs -- the meat
just falls off the bone.

119
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,227
That's actually what got
 me introduced to this place.

120
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,330
We're on a family road trip
and we stop here in San Antonio

121
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,798
    to check out
the Buckhorn Saloon...

122
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,899
              Aah!

123
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,701
     ...and some
Grizzly Adams-looking cat

124
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,770
walks in with a bag of ribs.

125
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,338
      See, my buddy, Happy,
          and his wife,

126
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,873
    Elizabeth, own the saloon

127
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,476
         and go way back
       with Chris' family.

128
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,411
     We've known th  We just ned
         how talented they were.

129
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,213
        Neither did they.

130
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:44,016
And he's putting a ton of
 talent into this mouthful.

131
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,884
          Big dog in the window!

132
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,153
  The big dog -- there's three
     different meats on it.

133
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,822
  You better not eat breakfast
and don't plan on eating dinner.

134
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,324
The big dog -- brisket...

135
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:55,060
             Pulled pork and our
            house-made hot link.

136
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,228
Give me the rundown.

137
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,430
               This is a whole
             brisket ground up.

138
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,065
Whole thing.

139
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:03,769
         Curing salt, coriander,
         black pepper, allspice,

140
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:06,405
  cayenne -- there's the heat --
              fine sea salt...

141
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:08,340
             -Okay.
     -...red chili flakes...

142
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:11,143
        -Lots of garlic.
   -...and really cold water.

143
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,911
Drop it in, case it out.

144
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:15,914
                Smoke them 20
           to 30 minutes on 200.

145
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,082
 All right, next up?

146
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,084
              Mustard sauce for
              the pulled pork.

147
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,252
  Come on, gambler.

148
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:21,720
       -Creole mustard...
        -A lot of honey.

149
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:23,121
         ...apple cider vinegar,

150
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:26,758
             our barbecue sauce,
   Worcestershire, barbecue rub,

151
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,261
      and the secret ingredient.

152
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,797
          -What is it?
-It looks like blackberry jelly.

153
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:34,299
              Raspberry jelly.
                Almost, Guy.

154
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:37,235
    There you go.

155
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:39,404
I like the vinegar, I like
a little bit of the sweet.

156
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,273
           -Excellent.
    -We got the pork pulled.

157
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,241
             Here's our all-beef
                  hot link.

158
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,110
      A little on the other side
                with brisket.

159
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,945
     -That is good hot link.
        -Thank you, sir.

160
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:50,215
      Mustard sauce on the pork.
Brisket gets the barbecue sauce.

161
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:51,383
      Top it with a little slaw.

162
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,385
           Oh, yeah, feta cheese
                in this slaw.

163
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:54,686
           -You what?
              -Yep.

164
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,655
        There you go -- big dog.

165
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:59,558
I don't know that I'm supposed
to eat it or tackle it.

166
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,296
  It's one of those
excessive-type sandwiches

167
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:05,764
from the description
 and the appearance,

168
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:09,267
but I got to be honest
with you, these are fine.

169
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,103
 Slaw's got a nice,
little finishing touch to it,

170
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:13,438
that little brininess,
the acidity of that feta,

171
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,041
those barbecue sauces
really play well together.

172
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:19,077
The hot link is dynamite,
and it's the kind of thing

173
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,313
that I think you'd order,
    eat half of,

174
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:23,315
and then be thrilled to have
the rest for dinner.

175
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:25,317
             -Yeah.
           -Nice job.

176
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,085
     Big dog, side of fries.

177
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,187
         Being in Texas,
  it's everything that we like.

178
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,623
    It has a great mustard sauce
        to along with this pork.

179
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,792
Which isn't something you
typically find in San Antonio.

180
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,494
         -No, it's not.
      -It's the only place.

181
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,696
           All right, let's make
       these plates look pretty.

182
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:40,065
       The Smoke Shack --
     you just can't beat it.

183
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,700
You're not just another
    pretty face.

184
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:43,435
          Hey, there's something
                 under this.

185
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:44,803
Watch out for this guy.

186
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:48,006
 Free gym membership
for every time you visit.

187
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,976
Up next, a farm-to-table
  spot in Little Rock...

188
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,811
 I got to tell you,
 I love it already.

189
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,479
      ...getting meticulous
        with the meat...

190
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:57,015
You're really kind of taking
this to a ridiculous level,
   you understand?

191
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,184
 ...and spreading Southern charm
        on their burgers.

192
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,585
You better bring an appetite
    on that one.

193
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,756
   Aggggh! Errrrt!

194
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:09,694
       Psych!

195
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,830
              Wow.

196
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,665
   We're here in Little Rock,
            Arkansas,

197
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,568
    to check out a joint that
  started as an ice cream shop,

198
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,538
    and, man, has it morphed
     into a community-minded

199
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,407
       farm-to-table cafe
      that everybody loves.

200
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,142
        This is The Root.

201
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,580
Spicy fried chicken!
      Order up!

202
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:31,116
      It's kind of unique.
    It's got it's own charm.

203
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,919
  It's just a flavorful place,
         inside and out,

204
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:35,587
    the food and the people.

205
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,423
It's what you get when
 people play by their own rules,

206
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:41,226
   like husband-and-wife team
     Jack and Corri Sundell,

207
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:45,464
 who've been taking the food biz
  and DIY to a whole new level.

208
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,499
     You are two
 interesting people.

209
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:51,169
The stacker washer and dryer
on the kitchen line.

210
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,839
      -We wash our napkins.
  -We fold them and everything.

211
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,808
I've been to 1,200-plus
 "Triple-D" joints.

212
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,009
   That's a first.

213
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,778
Did I drive up and see
three storage containers?

214
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,246
      We needed to expand.

215
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:04,382
And the conventional method of
nails and a hammer and wood...

216
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,551
         -Not our style.
          -Not your's?

217
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,453
 I got to tell you,
 I love it already.

218
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:11,323
And their menu isn't just
  run-of-the-mill either.

219
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,959
It's all farm-to-table,
  locally-sourced.

220
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,094
If you're vegan, you can
 find something on the menu,

221
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,663
         and if you love
      a good cheeseburger,

222
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,699
       they got that also.
     -Pimento cheeseburger!

223
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:23,702
   Blended cheese and peppers,
         a little spice.

224
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,904
  Kind of a good Southern dish
       that I really like.

225
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:28,006
      This is the pimento cheese
   for our pimento cheeseburger.

226
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,808
 Great.
              We've got cheddar
              and Pepper Jack.

227
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,343
     -It's not local cheese.
             -Wha?!

228
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,611
          We're waiting for that

229
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,145
              cheddar producer
         to come along knocking.

230
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,481
We're looking for cheddar!

231
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:39,084
       Cream cheese, garlic mayo
              we make in house.

232
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:41,219
           -I like it.
   -Fire-roasted bell peppers,

233
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,655
                  sriracha,
    smoke-dried Marconi peppers,

234
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,590
 sambal, fresh-chopped parsley.
             -Okay.

235
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,359
         So, we're just going to
             get things started,

236
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,195
      watching to see that cream
  cheese get fully incorporated.

237
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,696
            That's looking good.

238
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,198
There's just that little kick
  of that sriracha,

239
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,799
    a little kick
   of that sambal,

240
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,068
a little of that smokiness
of that pepper coming through.

241
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,703
        Now we're going to grind
        the meat for the burger.

242
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,705
    We get a whole cow at a time
              from a farm at --

243
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,742
There is no way you can get
a whole cow through --

244
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,010
      -Oh, you cube it up.
             -Yeah.

245
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,411
     -That makes more sense.
        -It's a process.

246
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:07,979
 Okay, so you bring
   a whole cow in.

247
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,915
  It's impressive.
Never seen that before.

248
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,884
         Today we've got sirloin
   and some fattier trim pieces.

249
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,353
To make sure that you get the
fat and the flavor combination.

250
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,888
        Do course the first time
                  through.

251
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,990
     Now we're going to sprinkle
         smoked Marconi peppers,

252
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,992
      then we're going to put it
   through for the second grind.

253
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,460
      When we originally opened,
        we thought we were going

254
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,162
         to grind beef to order.

255
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:27,165
"Two burgers? Hold on.
  Get the grinder!

256
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,500
 Yeah, we got this!"

257
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:29,801
   Now we're going
   to patty it up?

258
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:32,070
            Make sure it's even,
               pull that ring,

259
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,371
             handle it as little
                as possible.

260
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,006
     It got it.
 Onto the flat top.

261
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,708
       We got our sweet potatoes
                  going in.

262
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,777
And the burger to flip?

263
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,079
               Pimento cheese,
             and it's game time.

264
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,914
             So, here we've got
          our savory butter bun.

265
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,149
 Savory butter bun.

266
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,350
          Our house garlic mayo.

267
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:46,651
  Everything comes
  with a big salad?

268
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,653
                That's right.
     You know, the yin and yang.

269
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,956
    This is a traditional 14-day
                sweet pickle

270
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,457
              that we make here
                  in house.

271
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,793
       Slide the burger on here.

272
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,561
 -House-made garlic vinaigrette.
             -Okay.

273
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,530
              We got our sweet
             potato fries ready.

274
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,065
                 That's it.

275
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,666
 The thing's heavy.

276
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,736
Definitely got to hunch
    on this one.

277
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:08,607
Mm. The ground beef has got
 fantastic texture.

278
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,508
   The grind size,
  the griddle temp,

279
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,777
 the caramelization,
  great bun choice.

280
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,647
    The pickle is
 definitely needed.

281
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,015
 That balances out.

282
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:19,484
Got a lot of richness
and delicious pimento cheese.

283
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,720
I didn't know it was going to be
a whole patty of pimento.

284
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,421
You better bring an appetite
    on that one.

285
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:24,589
Pimento cheeseburger.

286
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,157
            It's the best burger
                  in town.

287
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,160
 As soon as I ate it, taste buds
     went through the roof.

288
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,462
        It's like, "Wow!"

289
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,465
So much labor in everything
 you're doing. Why?

290
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,400
        Because we're so focused
               on local foods,

291
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,901
               we want to get
             scratch ingredients

292
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,737
 because that's what the farmers
             have to sell to us.

293
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,338
    I love this.
I mean, I applaud this.

294
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,240
    Every day you're in here,
  you're going to see a farmer.

295
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,708
  Coming in, making deliveries.

296
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,810
  -I'm a local organic farmer.
             -Okay.

297
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,312
       A restaurant that sources

298
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,581
           primarily local food,
               that was huge.

299
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,816
       That's part of why
     it's all so delicious.

300
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,151
All right, what are we
going to make next, brother?

301
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,352
            Old-world bratwurst.

302
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:55,887
      Hang on.
Don't tell me about it.

303
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,155
  We're hanging out
  at The Root Cafe

304
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,457
We're in Little Rock, Arkansas.
 When we come back,

305
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,459
we're making the bratwurst
 with the crazy guy.

306
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:02,761
         Old-world brat.

307
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,029
             It's the way a brat
               should be made.

308
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,764
"I'll take a brat
  with sauerkraut."

309
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:08,633
   "It's 8:30 in the morning."
   "Okay, I'll take two then."

310
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,106
    Welcome back.
     "Triple-D."

311
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,642
Hanging out in Little Rock,
Arkansas, at The Root Cafe,

312
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:21,913
a full-scratch menu focusing on
local farms and local producers

313
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,615
   that is crazy.

314
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:26,217
It's got a good spirit.
  It's got a good energy.

315
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,153
   When they put it together,
    they have an artist side.

316
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,188
And definitely
  a chef's taste buds.

317
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,990
  It's delicious comfort food,

318
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:33,858
      but it has a special,
          little twist.

319
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,126
            Old-world bratwurst.

320
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,528
       It's the way a brat
         should be made.

321
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,663
     I like the sauerkraut.
    That's my favorite part.

322
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,165
What are
 we going to make?

323
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,267
                We are casing
          fresh bratwurst today.

324
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,568
So, we have the ground
   pork shoulder.

325
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,603
 We're going to add kosher salt,
                white pepper,

326
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,806
          ground ginger, nutmeg,
                   mix it

327
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,607
             a little bit to get
        the spices incorporated,

328
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,476
                  whisk up
          these farm-fresh eggs,

329
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:54,245
   and we're going to stir those
           into our heavy cream.

330
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:55,714
    Interesting.
    Pull it out.

331
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,449
We're going to go to case.

332
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:59,684
We'll pick the sausages and then
    we'll twist them into links.

333
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,219
      Grill it to get that color
                on the sides,

334
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,587
         and then we're going to
            throw it in the oven

335
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,723
    and give it about 30 minutes
        to finish at a low temp.

336
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,257
  While that works,
   we make kraut.

337
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,426
        This is lacto-fermented,
            homemade sauerkraut.

338
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,728
              So, we'll add in
                our cabbage.

339
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,062
I mean, you're really kind of
     taking this

340
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,397
to a ridiculous level,
 you do understand?

341
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,765
         We got to set ourselves
               apart somehow.

342
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,667
The setting-yourself-apart
 factor has happened

343
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:16,968
  a long time ago.

344
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,803
      Kosher salt, caraway seed.

345
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,472
      Pound and stir, and that's
                going to help

346
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:21,906
     get a little of that liquid
                 to come out

347
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,208
              and make a brine
               with the salt.

348
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,743
  How long is this
all going to get working?

349
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:28,513
      Three to four weeks in the
   summer when it's warmer to...

350
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:30,548
      Hold on!
 I got places to go!

351
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,817
   Can I ask what
the goldfish water is for?

352
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:34,652
   -And where's the goldfish?
      -Where's my goldfish?

353
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,022
         Now we'll put our plate
                on top here,

354
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,424
         and we're going to drop
               the brine bag.

355
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,192
        That'll give us the seal
          around the edges here.

356
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,494
              Then we're going
                to cover it.

357
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:43,795
               Around 4 weeks,
               and we'll have

358
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,430
               your old-world
        bratwurst ready for you.

359
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,899
Let's go get the other one out
of the back and make this brat.

360
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,768
I don't got 4 weeks.
 I got stuff to do.

361
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,136
      Pot of boiling water here.

362
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,303
  It's heated up in
   the water now.

363
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,605
 We'll just give it
   a little sear.

364
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,240
             And now we're gong
              to dress the bun.

365
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:58,476
             House garlic mayo,
            Dijon on the bottom.

366
00:12:58,478 --> 00:12:59,778
 Throw that on here
    for a minute.

367
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,880
Can you see all the fat
  and all the juice

368
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,015
 and all the flavor
that's built inside of that?

369
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,484
The key to this is not to break
     this casing

370
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:07,919
     and let all
that flavor come out.

371
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,154
  That's beautiful.

372
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:11,422
              House-made kraut.
      We put that on there cold.

373
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,424
            That's our old-world
                 bratwurst.

374
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:18,496
     Delicious.
Can I just have a bowl of kraut.

375
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:25,503
Awesome. I am not kidding you,
 it's so fantastic.

376
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,305
The grind of the meat --
      spot on.

377
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,007
Casing -- nice, little snap.

378
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,576
Bun -- light, but sturdy
  enough to hold it

379
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,344
'cause there's a lot of juice
 coming out of that.

380
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,113
I mean, you're tasting the pork,
   you're getting

381
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:38,516
the real flavors of it.

382
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:39,918
  I'm not kidding.

383
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,586
The kraut -- that's what
puts it over the top.

384
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,922
That is outstanding.

385
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,657
       Like...

386
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:49,027
   One more bite.

387
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:50,328
               Old-world brat.
                  Order up.

388
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,030
       It's pretty juicy,
      so you bite into it,

389
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,865
       you get that juice
           coming out.

390
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,233
          It's snappy.

391
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,602
        The sauerkraut is
      the perfect crispness

392
00:13:57,604 --> 00:13:59,470
          and it's got
      the perfect sourness.

393
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,739
       -Got a Root Benny.
        -It's just cool.

394
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,641
   You come here and you feel
      like you're at home.

395
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,210
So many people talked about
    coming here,

396
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,911
said the food's really good,
   you care a lot

397
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:09,180
about what you're doing,
really love your community.

398
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,050
Now that I get here and I see
how funkalicious it is,

399
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,686
      I'm sold.

400
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,522
  Coming up, a tiny Asian joint
     in Napa, California...

401
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,123
It's a lot of little
    small kitchen

402
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,458
  for us all to be
   all over here.

403
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,960
 ...going huge with the ramen...

404
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,494
              I want to eat it
              till I pass out.

405
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,997
    ...and kicking fried rice
         into high gear.

406
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,599
        If this was a car movie,

407
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:29,834
                this would be
       "The Fast and Delicious."

408
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,409
   Welcome to another edition
     of "Neighborhood Eats."

409
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,178
       Today, we're at my
        Aunt Etna's house

410
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,547
    where she makes a fanta--
     Nah, I'm just kidding.

411
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,882
     No, this is "Triple D"

412
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,483
       and we're actually
      in Napa, California,

413
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,685
      to check out a funky
       little Asian joint

414
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,588
     that is small on size,
       but big on flavor.

415
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,358
      Remember it's E-I-G,
          not A-T-E --

416
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,226
             this is
       Eight Noodle Shop.

417
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,631
      Beef ramen coming up!

418
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:03,101
Eight Noodle is such a fabulous,
       interesting place.

419
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,803
         -Korean wings!
       -It's Asian fusion.

420
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,505
Served up by owner
   David Lu,

421
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:10,174
    who's bringing a lifetime
   of experience to the table.

422
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,943
     I was born
and raised in Taiwan.

423
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:13,811
          -Oh, really?
 -I moved here when I was nine.

424
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:16,781
My family owned Chinese
restaurants when we moved here.

425
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,116
And when he set up
   this shop,

426
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,285
      he mixed in even more
        Asian influence.

427
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,853
                 So it's not
              a strict Chinese.

428
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,187
             -Nope.
         -It's not Thai.

429
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,522
             -Nope.
       -It's not Japanese.

430
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:25,657
It's across the board.

431
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,325
Kimchi bacon fried rice,
   pick up!

432
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,027
The kimchi fried rice
     is amazing.

433
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,629
   You can tell it's fresh and
they took their time to make it.

434
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,431
  -All right, Chef, first step.
         -Beef cheeks...

435
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,066
     Seared off.
     Next step?

436
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:36,668
           -Mirepoix.
          -Sesame oil?

437
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,170
                Whole garlic,
              ginger, carrots,

438
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,940
              celery, parsley,
                thyme, onion.

439
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,875
And this is all just
for the brazing liquid?

440
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:45,043
               That's correct.

441
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,377
               Tomato, give it
             a little richness.

442
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:47,879
           A little brown sugar.

443
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,414
           -Soy sauce?
          -Veal stock.

444
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,182
    -That you make in house.
            -Correct.

445
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,384
Add the cheeks to it.
How long in the oven?

446
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,086
     -Hour, hour-and-a-half.
          -Okay. Next?

447
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:58,957
Kimchi -- onions, ginger,
garlic, Korean spice...

448
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,858
        -That's the key.
         -...fish sauce.

449
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,894
      -So this is the base.
      -Now we're over here.

450
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,629
It's a lot of little
small kitchen for us

451
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,231
to be all over here.
       Water.

452
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:10,034
 Rice flour -- gives it a little
        thickness on the kimchi.

453
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:12,403
          -Okay. Next?
        -Salted cabbage.

454
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,138
      -Salted napa cabbage.
            -Ginger.

455
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,541
      Now if you're not in Napa,
      can you use other cabbage?

456
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:19,277
                   Sorry.
                   Sorry.

457
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,612
Rice wine vinegar, garlic,
  red bell pepper.

458
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,581
        -A little sugar.
            -Daikon.

459
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,850
               A bunch of it.
       More of the Korean spice.

460
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,452
The rice flour mixture.

461
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,721
         Pour this on top of it,
                look at that.

462
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,322
We got the kimchi jar.

463
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,991
    And these are the weights
        to press it down.

464
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,692
Correct, for 10 days.

465
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:37,662
Luke, I am your kimchi.

466
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,163
                   Sorry.

467
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,065
              I heard the echo.
     Let's make some fried rice.

468
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,001
     All right.
Pan sauce, sesame oil.

469
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,169
                 Pre-cooked,
         cooled-down white rice.

470
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,337
      Correct.

471
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,673
  A little kimchi,
 pickled mushrooms.

472
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,541
              And then pickled
      daikon radish and carrots.

473
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,744
And carrots, a little garlic,
  a little ginger.

474
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,445
       Everybody back on.

475
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:00,685
              Whoa!
 That kimchi is so good though.

476
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,286
We're going to go with
 a little shredded cabbage,

477
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:04,455
      carrot, little bacon.
             -Okay.

478
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:07,291
                 Then we got
          the secret sauce next.

479
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,426
Sauce you make in house?

480
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:10,395
                  Correct.
               Bring that up.

481
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:13,431
     So fried rice, beef cheeks,
          a little green onions.

482
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:15,333
    There you go.

483
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,238
    I think that most fried rice
           is pretty pedestrian.

484
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,440
    If this was a millennial car
            movie, this would be

485
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,409
       "The Fast and Delicious."

486
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:30,915
           Textures are awesome,
     depth of flavor is amazing.

487
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:35,720
              Tang, acid, salt,
       a little bit of the heat,

488
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,655
       the crunch, the tender --

489
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,223
              I can't stuff it
        in my mouth fast enough.

490
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,692
           The beef cheeks sing,
        but the real kicker here

491
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:44,095
                is the kimchi
         and the pickled veggies

492
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,296
      and the pickled mushrooms.

493
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,764
         -Dynamite, bro.
           -Thank you.

494
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,332
             And I'm sorry I had
         to drop the chopsticks.

495
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,435
              I had to get busy
                with a fork.

496
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,004
--Mm!

497
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,439
       -Kimchi fried rice.
           -Thank you.

498
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:56,474
 That's beautiful, crisp, fresh.

499
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,342
       The spice is good.
           I love it.

500
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,645
              We got a chicken
            and egg shrimp rice.

501
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:03,948
   The fact that they can make
    a wide variety of flavors

502
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,284
   out of that little kitchen
      is pretty impressive.

503
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,952
             The whole building
           is 1,000 square feet?

504
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,587
Not counting the patio,
 the whole building

505
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,922
is 1,000 square feet.

506
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,356
But that's not holding
   them back

507
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,258
        when it comes to
   scratch-making the staples.

508
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,793
      Pork ramen, pick up!

509
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:17,595
    You're going to open a funky
         little joint like this,

510
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,930
                  you need
         to make your own ramen.

511
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,331
     Absolutely.

512
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,599
 Did you guys make ramen at home
            when you were a kid?

513
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,167
     -We made ramen by hand.
            -Really?

514
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:24,702
      Mom made
  hand-cut noodles.

515
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,003
           All right, so give me
                the rundown.

516
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:27,638
           -AP flour.
         -"All-purpose."

517
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,207
Water, liquid smoke.

518
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,876
        -In the noodles?
  -Gives it a little smokiness.

519
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,678
      Potassium
  carbonated water.

520
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,079
               Oh, that's what
              I thought it was.

521
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,814
  Gives it a little
    carbonation.

522
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,050
   Pinch of salt,
   add more water.

523
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:40,785
 -To get the right consistency.
            -Correct.

524
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,387
When it comes out, it goes
in the walk-in overnight.

525
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,490
           -All right.
-So we're making our pork broth.

526
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,658
       It's not every restaurant
         that you go to in Napa,

527
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,193
         you're going to just go
             walk down and say,

528
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,862
     "Hey, by the way you taking
                that pig hoof

529
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:52,363
              and cooking it up
                  yourself?

530
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:54,799
      -Into the hot water.
     -Roasted chicken bones.

531
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,668
            Low heat, overnight.
         Next day, we add kombu.

532
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,137
      Seaweed.

533
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:03,040
Rice wine vinegar, green onions,
 onions, celery, tomato, garlic.

534
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,076
      -Think that's enough?
        -Carrot. Ginger.

535
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:06,944
                   Tamari.
             Bonito fish flakes.

536
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:09,280
So this is going to cook down
  for how long now?

537
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:10,715
              Hour and a half.

538
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,583
And that's the foundation
 of the ramen broth.

539
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,519
            -Correct.
     -Okay, drop the noodle,

540
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,387
   then we'll put it together.
             -Okay.

541
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:20,024
Pork back fat puree,
our noodles, our broth.

542
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:23,094
Oh, you're my broth-er.
  Get it.

543
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,129
              He's my brother,
       but he was doing the br--

544
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,231
              he's my broth --
                     No?

545
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,699
                    Okay.
              All right, sorry.

546
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:32,603
Our pulled pork, our belly,
arugula, baby spinach...

547
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,438
 Not something you typically see
             when you get ramen.

548
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,241
...a little bit of bamboo,
toasted sesame seeds,

549
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,177
    finish it off
with a little scallion.

550
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,248
We also offer a house-made
    chili oil --

551
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,783
spice it up a little bit.

552
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,386
             Now we're talking.

553
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:50,354
                     Mm.

554
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,724
    -So I'm going to get in.
       -Don't do it, Guy.

555
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,760
             I love the arugula
              and the spinach.

556
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:58,963
 At my restaurant, Chicken Guy!,
    we say, "Sauce is the boss."

557
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:02,066
       But here at Eight Noodle,
          broth is the "bossth."

558
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,935
I like that.

559
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:06,437
                    Huh?
               It's delicious.

560
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:09,373
              I want to eat it
              until I pass out.

561
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,842
                  So good.

562
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,144
     Here's the pork ramen.

563
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:16,280
   The noodles are wonderful,
         very well-made.

564
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,049
The broth is just mouthwatering.

565
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,250
      Shrimp rice, pick up!

566
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,485
          Eight noodle
      is just perfect food.

567
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:23,020
    It's a place of its own.

568
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:27,158
      This place might be small,
          but the flavor's huge.

569
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,326
    -Nicely done, my friend.
           -Thank you.

570
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:30,528
                Nicely done.

571
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,097
So that's it for this edition of
  "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

572
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,099
      But don't you worry,
      there's funky joints

573
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,634
     all over this country.

574
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:38,703
   And I'll be looking for you
    next week on "Triple D."

575
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:41,706
Hey, Guy, what about trading
   650 horsepower

576
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,374
 for this bull-power
     right here?

577
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:45,676
       -Done deal, buddy.
         -Only in Texas.

578
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,111
             One born every day.

579
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,513
 Hey, where exactly
 is reverse on this?

580
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,849
             Well, I don't know.
I got my ride, you got that one.

581
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,851
--Whoo-hoo!
