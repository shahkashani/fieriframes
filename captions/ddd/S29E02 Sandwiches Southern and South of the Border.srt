00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,377
         Extra-virgin olive oil.

263
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,045
                  Oregano.
                   Cumin.

264
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,214
   So bloom that,
 kind of wake it up.

265
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,282
             Put it in the pot.

266
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,150
 Sugar, kosher salt.

267
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,385
              Stir it a smidge.

268
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,120
  That was a smidge, wasn't it?
            -Smidge.

269
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,189
                  Puree it
      with an immersion blender.

270
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,692
    Next, I'm going to add water
   with veggie base mixed in it.

271
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,861
        Red chili sauce.
        -Enchilada sauce.

272
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,630
              So this will cook
          about 10 more minutes,

273
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:54,332
             and then it's ready
              for the tamales.

274
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,934
  That's delicious.

275
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:56,935
      You know,
 you can take that,

276
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,870
just warm it up, make a soup.
                     We do.

277
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,206
            We actually put that
               in our pozole.

280
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,410

                 Portobello
      and winter squash filling.

282
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:08,914
    -And what type of squash?
           -Butternut.

283
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,282
           -Very nice.
           -Thank you.

284
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:13,451
             Olive oil, garlic,
           portobello mushrooms.

285
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,186
     Beautiful.
And then in with the squash?

286
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,088
              -Yes.
-Round it out, a little oregano.

287
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,523
              Salt and pepper.

288
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,859
Now this is gonna simmer
down, now, for how long?

289
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,527
        -15 minutes max.
      -Just so it's tender.

290
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,129
                Yeah, just so
           it's slightly tender.
Cooked and tender.

291
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:25,163
 Time for the masa.

           Vegetable shortening.

293
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,834
          While that's creaming,
              this is the masa.

294
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,736
             -Salt.
         -Baking powder.

295
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,371
She's doing something
 I really like here.

296
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,806
              This is water...
And vegetable stock.

             I mix this by hand.

300

I like how you're making
these little cylinders

   drop in there.
        Yeah, just blob them in.

Little flavor bombs.

                 roll it up,
      put two olives in the top.

307
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,993
   -And then we'll steam them.
   -About an hour and a half.

308
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,495
    All of this
just for a tamale?
                     Correct.

309
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,898
You have the patience
    of an angel.

310

  Don't be small-e

              -Yep.

313
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,439
That's a big tamale.

314
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,807
   You're looking

I'm just gonna end up

326

The meatiness of that portobello
 really carries it.

327
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,799
This red sauce is going
all the way through it,

    but you know
what the real kicker is?

329

Is whipping that fat,
getting it nice and light.

330

00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:03,321
You go right from there
 to a squirt bottle,

528
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:04,389
and we're good to go?
                        Yep.

529
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:05,656
       -I like it, buddy.
             -Okay.

530
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,025
       -Pull the brisket?
             -Yeah.

531
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,794
  And we let these briskets rest
         for about 2 to 3 hours.

532
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:12,096
        Nice,
little smoke ring there.

533
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:16,467
              We got a pub roll
            from a local bakery.

534
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,568
        Mmm.

535
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,903
I pick that allspice up
 right off the bat.

536
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:19,937
                    Yeah.

537
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,173
Pick up a little bit
    of that beer.

538
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,941
Not dry by any means.

539
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:27,111
                     ♪♪

540
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:28,646
That's pretty dynamite.

541
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,448
No offense to your bun here,
     I'm just...

542

              None taken, man.

543
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,520
         That is the lingonberry
               barbecue sauce.

544
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,655

That is definitely Norweigian.

545
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,223
                    Yep.

547

551
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:52,270
  Just so tender. It just melts
      right in your mouth.

552

              MAN:

555
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,010
              You got it, man.

556
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:02,013
      I've literally driven
   over 50 miles to find them.

557
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:04,682
     FIERI: Which is either
setting up shop all over Spokane

558
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:07,752
      or working right here
  in their hometown of Spangle.

559
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,987
     Was Spangle
 ever a bigger town?

560
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:13,424
                     No.
          It was smaller, but...

561
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,860
     WOMAN: Community pride
  for Nordic Smoke is amazing.

562
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,061
   We're pretty proud of them.

563
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,197
        Kacy's a veteran,
 and the community really likes

564
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,465
    that it's a veteran-owned
            business.

566
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:22,467
           Four years
      in the Marine Corps.

567
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:23,701
                  Thank you
              for your service.

568
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:24,735
     -Yeah, appreciate that.
     -Really appreciate it.

569
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:25,736
  MAN: Well, the two brothers,
            they take

570
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:26,737
         a lot of pride
        in what they do.

571
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,272
    They go above and beyond
        the call of duty

572
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,774
when it comes to their barbecue.

573
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,210
   Can I get ribs
and smoked beans, please?
              SERVER: All right.

574
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:33,811
    The best ribs
  I have ever had.

575
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,813
      MAN: The baked beans
       are fantastic, too.

576
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,482
  It's a homemade family recipe

577
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,283
     that they've carried on
        for generations.

578
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,385
  Okay, my brother,
  St. Louis rib --

579
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,654
   so a spare rib
      cut down.

580
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:44,856
             A little olive oil.

581
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,491
So, the same dry rub
    that we did.

582
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:48,226
       Ready for the smoke, man.

583
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:50,361
          About five hours, 225.

584
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,796
  And just a little
 apple cider spritz.

585
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:52,897
                    Yep.
             I hit it with that

586
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,232
              about every hour,

587
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,367
              and then there's
       a honey-maple beer glaze.

588
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,435
                    Yeah.

589
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:58,836
 Did you fall a lot
      as a kid?

590
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,705
                  Oh, yeah.

591
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:01,739
 Time for the beans.

592
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:02,874
              -Yep.
   -Now, whose recipe is this?

593
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:03,975
                 Grandma's.

594
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,244
      So canned
   pork and beans.
                         Yep.

595
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:09,847
       Black beans, red kidneys,
            butter beans, onion,

596
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,250
               raw jalapeños,
               brown sugar...
   Okay.

597
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,318
                 ...ketchup,
            apple cider vinegar.

598
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,820
     -Fried-up ground beef.
              -Yep.

599
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,289
                And then some
  hickory-smoked bacon crumbles.

600
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,191
         -With the fat?
         -With the fat.

601
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:22,360
What did she call this,
   "Kitchen Sink"?
                       Yeah.

602
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,228
             And just some salt
              and pepper, man.

603
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,063
So, you're gonna bring
all that smoke flavor in.

604
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:28,232
                    Yep.
             225, about 4 hours.

605
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:31,068
        Okay.
Let's make it happen, Captain.

               All right, man.

607

How many ribs you give
    in an order?
                      Three.

608
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,907
    I don't need
 any more than that.

609

    Great smoke.

611

 You get the dry rub

612

  and then the mop
that you're throwing on there,

613
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:47,852
and that combined with the fat
 of the rib -- wow.

614

That was a good rib.

615

    The ribs are my favorite
     that Nordic Smoke does.

  There's so much meat on them.
