00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,735
 Hey, everybody, I'm Guy Fieri, 
     and we're rolling out,     

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:05,870
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and drives. 

3
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,406
          This trip...          
It's the perfect sandwich.      

4
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:08,940
    ...signature sandwiches.    

5
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,609
               Prime rib isn't  
          good enough by itself.

6
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,411
               Let's smoke it   
        and put it on a po' boy.

7
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:13,479
        Mmm.                    

8
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:15,013
     In Denver, Colorado...     

9
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,215
The food is fantastic.          

10
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:17,282
     ...the former garage...    

11
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,283
             Regional favorites.

12
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,618
    ...doing it all fresh...    

13
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,553
   Spicy linguine,              
going up in the window.         

14
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,688
  ...even a Maine lobster roll. 

15
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,424
Wow! Pretty impressive.         

16
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:27,493
    In Slidell, Louisiana...    

17
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:28,827
       WOMAN:                   
 Cajun corn pudding.            

18
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,428
       ...the neighborhood      
           favorite...          

19
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,697
                  Very true     
             to Louisiana food. 

20
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:32,965
         ...knocking out        
      authentic po' boys...     

21
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:33,965
MAN: Shrimp po' boy dressed.    

22
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:34,900
        ...and then some.       

23
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:35,901
Side of corn pudding up.        

24
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:36,835
                    Mmm.        

25
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:38,036
             That's corn quiche.

26
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,505
     And in Indianapolis...     

27
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:40,505
             Corn cakes are on. 

28
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:41,907
      ...the local café...      

29
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,308
             Mmm, it is so good.

30
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,776
         ...cranking out        
         ham and cheese.        

31
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,111
                    Wow!        
      ...with attitude.         

32
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:47,312
       Look at the size of this.

33
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,380
   Mmm, this isn't              
your average pork sandwich.     

34
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,516
     Thank you.                 

35
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:51,916
      That's all coming up,     
           right here,          

36
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,919

38
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,798
     I just love the joints     
    we visit on "Triple-D" --   

39
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,333
   I mean, where they started,  

40
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:10,869
       where they end up,       
        how it all began.       

41
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:13,138
   Now, I'm in the uptown area  
      of Denver, Colorado,      

42
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,273
        to visit a joint        
      that's in a building      

43
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,209
       that was operating       
       as an auto garage,       

44
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,010
 until the day it was converted 
       into a restaurant.       

45
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:19,878
          And the name?         

46
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,879
       Well, they get that      

47
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,681
       from a family-owned      
       hot spot in Boston       

48
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:23,682
          50 years ago.         

49
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:24,950
          And the menu?         

50
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:27,018
   Well, it's from everywhere   
       across the country.      

51
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,154
             This is            
     Steuben's Food Service.    

52
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,422
          Memphis Ribs          
         to the window.         

53
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,623
The food is fantastic.          

54
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:32,624
             Regional favorites.

     Green chili cheese up.

00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,026
       They travel around       
          the country,          

57
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,962
       and bring the best       
   of those regions to Denver.  

58
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,229
Chicago dog going up.

  Whatever hometown you're from,
                they have it.

   FIERI: Because when owners,  
         Josh Wolkon...         
    Enjoy.                      

61
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,035
      ...and Matt Selby...      
                Enjoy, you guys.

62
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:44,436
   ...started putting together  
             a menu             

63
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,837
              with              
    Chef Brandon Biederman...   

64
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:46,972
Herb-roasted chicken up.        

65
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:48,307
       ...it was personal.      

66
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,574
         Inevitably, we'd end up
            talking about things

67
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:50,442
         that we grew up eating.

68
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,643
          Skirt steak.          

69
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,645
            And that was kind of
           how the menu evolved.

70
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,180
             It was right there 
  in front of us the whole time.

71
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,247
Fried chicken in the window.    

72
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,449
             You got            
      a great mix of food.      

73
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,384
        -From Southern...       
  I love the shrimp and grits.  

74
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:00,785
         -...to Italian.        
     -Spaghetti meatball up.    

75
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,054
               Classic recipe.  

76
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:03,721
        FIERI: Even this        
      New England standard.     

77
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:04,789
     Lobster roll and fries.    

78
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,857
  The lobster roll              
  is the real deal.             

79
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,392
          Lobster roll          
         in the window.         

80
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,060
            Get about 500 pounds
                 of lobsters    

81
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,061
              flown in a week.  

82
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,330
    Get your own                
little plane for that.          

83
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:12,598
      Alright,                  
so give me the lowdown.         

84
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,799
    Okay, some boiling water,   
           salt it up.          

85
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,669
      Then, into the pool,      
      about 10, 11 minutes.     

86
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:18,803
       Lobsters are ready.      

87
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,004
   Put these in the ice bath.   

88
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,273
   -Stop the cooking process?   
             -Yeah.             

89
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,741
 BIEDERMAN: And these will cool 
      for a minute or two.      

90
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,143
 Lobsters are done.             
This is going to be awesome.    

91
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,412
                Pull it out.    
             Pop off the claws. 

92
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,147
              Pop off the tail. 
        Breakdown the tail meat.

93
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,549
               You don't want   
              to get squirted.  

94
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,017
                 Like that.     
    Man...                      

95
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,019
  Mess up my duds.              

96
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,221
                    Ooh!        

97
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,156
Coming into battle, folks.      
     Looks good.                

98
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,490
          Dice up the tail meat,
                large chunk,    

99
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,825
              Split the claws.  

100
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,293
Well, you got a lot of texture  
coming out of the tail meat.    

101
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,162
And it's real nice and buttery  
  here in the claw.             

102
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,030
    Nice balance.               

103
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,298
        Now?                    
               Goes into a bowl.

104
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,566
              And then we make  
      the lobster roll dressing.

105
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,969
Holy bucket of mayonnaise,      
       Batman!                  

106
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:51,970
          Chopped onion. Celery.

107
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,238
 Nice dice on that.             
                        Yeah.   

108
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,373
           Lemon juice, paprika,
             some salt, pepper, 

109
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,641
         and, we just mix it up.

110
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:57,776
 Nice lobster roll.             

111
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,044
  Do you have these             
     shipped in?                

112
00:02:59,046 --> 00:02:59,911
   Or does someone              
   make them here?              
                     We do.     

113
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,313
                 East Coast.    
    Nice!                       

114
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:02,981
         Just doing a little bit
             of clarified butter

115
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:03,849
              on the flat top.  

116
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,050
             Let them toast up. 
    Alright.                    

117
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,252
             Good healthy dollop
                of dressing.    

118
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,987
            We mix them to order
                 each time.     

119
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,588
Seems like it should be         
    a two-bunner.               

120
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,123
              No, you want them 
                overflowing.    

121
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,592
          I don't want to get it
             on your hand, man. 

122
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:14,726
Oh, it looks awesome.           

123
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,195
         [ Both laugh ]         

124
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,397
  Do I want a fork?             

125
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,931
Do you guys think, at home,     
   I want a fork?               

126
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,267
   Absolutely not.              

127
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,802
  Is there anything             
     right here?                

128
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,136
Right there? Anything?          

129
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,605
                You're good.    
    No, I'm good?               

130
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:28,339
       You're pretty good, yeah.
  Just continue on              
   with the show?               

131
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,208
              Just keep going.  
   Awesome! Wow!                

132
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,343
  I want to be able             
to taste the lobster.           

133
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:32,544
I don't want to have            
too much going on there.        

134
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,745
  That's real good.             

135
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:34,946
And the fact that you guys      
are doing this fresh,           

136
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,415
pretty impressive, man,         
      nice job.                 

137
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:37,683
             WOMAN:             
    Lobster roll with fries.    

138
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,484
        Just like a lobster roll
                 from Maine.    

139
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,753
 This is everything             
with the salt air, you know.    

140
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,421
           Seriously,           
    all the food is so good.    

141
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,223
        It's a cool place to be.

142
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,290
       Full rack of ribs.       

143
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,225
                  It's got      
           a vintage feel to it.

144
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,693
             FIERI:             
  Because it's a vintage place. 

145
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,229
      It's a revitalized garage.

146
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,697
   My dad used to               
 bring his car here.            

147
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,365
          Dan's garage.         
Automotive repair.              

148
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,500
        Hydraulic lifts,        
      cars out on the side.     

149
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:56,701
   WOMAN: Macaroni and cheese.  

150
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:57,902
               They turned it   
             into a restaurant. 

151
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,971
 And it gave life to            
a wonderful old building.       

152
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,706
Absolutely wonderful            
for the neighborhood.           

153
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,175
             Etoufee            
      and hush puppies up.      

154
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:04,776
   Pretty casual,               
  very comfortable,             

155
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,312
but it seems to all really      
focus on doing great food.      

156
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,314
      Spicy linguine going      
        up in the window.       

157
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,648
And it's cooked with love.      

158
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,583
    Here's your fries, guys.    

159
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,051
                  The fries     
             are hand-cut here. 

160
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,519
              MAN:              
 Chopping fresh cut fries, chef.

161
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,455
   That's one of the things that
    they're known for, actually.

162
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,588
     Fries up in the window.    

163
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,723
I had the ribs today.           

164
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:19,992
They definitely spend their time

165
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:21,126
  making sure that              
they're falling off the bone.   

166
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:21,994
       What's your favorite item
                on the menu?    

167
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:23,328
              MAN:              
      Herb-roasted chicken.     

168
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,130
     You can tell these guys    
    slow-roast their chicken.   

169
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,064
        Do it real right.       

170
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,399
     What are we                
going to make, chef?            

171
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,000
          BIEDERMAN: Herb butter
   for the herb roasted chicken.

172
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,936
   A lot of butter              
for a lot of chicken.           

173
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,004
      We do everything big here.

174
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:34,272
             Alright, softened, 
              unsalted butter.  

175
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,273
              Start the mixer.  

176
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,142
                Some garlic,    
               some shallots.   

177
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,410
               Chopped chives.  
 Some chive.                    

178
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,011
      You know,                 
chive just keeps that color,    

179
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,680
keeps its little form.          

180
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:42,948
                Some parsley.   
Lemon juice?                    

181
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,416
              Lemon juice, yes. 
    Nice.                       

182
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,550
                Salt, pepper.   

183
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,485
             Turn it up to two. 
               And that's it.   

184
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,888
And that gets a chance to marry 
 in a day's time --             

185
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,490
                 Yeah. Okay.    
Take that, and off we go.       

186
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:52,891
                 That's it.     
    Alright.                    

187
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,426
         So we're going to truss
   and brine some whole chickens

188
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:55,427
           before we roast them.

189
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,028
  Truss and brine.              
     I like it.                 

190
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,430
               Wings go back,   
               cross the legs.  

191
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,299
  The more you keep             
 this all together,             

192
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,500
     the better                 
 it's going to cook,            

193
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,034
and the more you're going       
to hold in the juices.          

194
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,903
These things are just           
going to be full of flavor.     
                        Yeah.   

195
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,305
        We put them in bus tubs.

196
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:08,506
       Then let's make the brine
   for the herb roasted chicken.

197
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,441
        We get some brown sugar,
                    salt,       

198
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,177
             some whole cloves, 
        whole black peppercorns.

199
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,712
     Go for it!                 
 A little bay leaf.             

200
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,646
       And then a grip of water.

201
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,382
       A grip?                  
             About five gallons.

202
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,183
                 And whisk.     

203
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,317
         It goes over the birds.

204
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,119
Are we going to brine this      
  for about a day?              

205
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,054
                  24 hours.     

206
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:23,989
  So they're brined             
      24 hours.                 

207
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,123
Give them a little shake dry.   

208
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,191
Oh, this is awesome.            

209
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,993
                 Olive oil.     
              Rub it in there.  

210
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,127
                    Salt,       
         a little bit of pepper.

211
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:32,063
           And then in the oven,
              about 40 minutes. 

212
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,398
350 in a convection?            
                     Yeah.      

213
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,399
        Okay.                   
Let's rock and roll.            

214
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:35,666
                  Pop it on     
        the cutting board, here.

215
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,534
             Cut off the string.

216
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,869
        Take it down at the leg.

217
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,672
          Go down the tail bone,
              hit the wishbone, 

218
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,007
              hit that knuckle. 
   There you go.                

219
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:42,874
This is one portion?            

220
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,409
                  Yes, sir.     
 Can't beat that.               

221
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,011
You're saving the rest          
   of this carcass              

222
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:46,811
 for chicken stock?             

223
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,280
                  Yes, sir.     
   Oh-ho!                       

224
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:49,548
     We're just going to mark it
              on the grill now, 

225
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,883
  brush it with some herb butter
           that we made earlier.

226
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,485
  Copious amounts.              
                  Of course.    

227
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:54,752
        Nice.                   
                  Flip it over. 

228
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,221
             Brush it with some 
              more herb butter. 

229
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,555
             That's going to go 
            with mashed potatoes

230
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:58,957
         and sautéed vegetables.

231
00:05:58,959 --> 00:05:59,958
 Okay, looking good.            
    Feeling good?               

232
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,494
             Yeah, feeling good.
Oh, look at that!               

233
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:05,897
So you get the butter           
confection onto the bird.       

234
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,099
You also slathered it           
     on the veg.                

235
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,034
                    Yeah.       

236
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,502
        Mmm.                    
Cooked to perfection.           

237
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:11,636
        Mmm!                    

238
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:12,971
 I try to tell folks            
 this all the time.             

239
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,773
    It might say                
  roasted chicken,              

240
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:18,577
  but there's such              
 a wide spectrum...             

241
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,578
of what it really is,           
and what it really can be.      

242
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,047
  And right there,              
     my friend?                 

243
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:22,914
That's what it can be.          

244
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,182
  That's dynamite.              

245
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,250
   Out of bounds.               

246
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,585
      Marking herb roasted      
            chicken.            

247
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:29,921
Tasty -- chicken has a nice     
juicy, tender flavor to it.     

248
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,456
  The herbs really              
 stand out on there.            

249
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,591
                 The flavors    
              are always good.  

250
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:33,725
         Cuban sandwich.        

251
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,193
We always have something        
different when we come here,    

252
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,527
but we know it's always         
  going to be good.             

253
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,796
             They're passionate 
             about what they do,

254
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:38,930
               and that's why   
            we keep coming back.

     fun joint.

    I'll be back.               

258
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,069
            Right on.           
        Okay?                   
 Thank you, brother.            

259

Come here because we know we're

              that whole thing  

267
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:56,548
               is going to be

     Now, there are two ways    

270
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,657
 you can get to the North Shore 
      of Lake Pontchartrain     

271
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:06,992
    coming from New Orleans.    

272
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:09,194
  You could take the Causeway,  
      end up in Mandeville.     

273
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,263
       Or, you could take       
      the Twin Span Bridge,     

274
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,597
     and end up in Slidell.

    And if you're in Slidell,   

276
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,734

    check out a little joint

       the big water tower      

278
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,671
    that's knocking out good,   
   old Louisiana comfort food.  

279
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,139
        This is LA Pines.       

280
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,741
              Bowl of gumbo up. 

281
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,076
 We come here 'cause            
 we know we're gonna            
 get something good.            

282

        Beef brisket po' boy up.

                  Yeah, yeah.

             FIERI:             
   Like folks have been doing   

293
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,959
      for almost 20 years.      

294
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,093
    Here you go.                

295
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,095
       Chef Jim Vandenburg      
        opened the joint.       

296
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,898
   Now his stepson Mike Murray  
      is running the show.      

297
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,033

Coming with the gumbo.

              You just make it  
                 right here?    
   That's it.

              Scratch cooking.  
                  All day.      

300
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,436
   Cheese melted.

00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:52,904
 FIERI: All of Jim's recipes... 

302
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,171
Mama Jim's Debris up.           

303
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,773
         ...and a few of        
        Mike's now, too.        

304
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,042
    He does his own smoking.    

305
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,510
     FIERI: Everything from     
       brisket and ribs...      

306
00:07:58,512 --> 00:07:59,244
    On the grill.               

307
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,778
       ...even prime rub,       

308
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,980
   served up Louisiana-style.   

309
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,382
Prime rib po' boy up.           

310
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,984
               Prime rib isn't  
          good enough by itself.

311
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,053
         Let's smoke it and then
            put it on a po' boy.

312
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:08,986
         It's delicious.        

313
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,454
Smoked prime rib po' boy.       

314
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:11,723
    Big old rib.                
 Look at that thing.            

315
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:12,924
    We make a little rub for it.

316
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,058
                Brown sugar,    

317
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,793
   we got a little chili powder.
                  Paprika.      

318
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,528
I'm going to freak out          
  with the paprika.             

319
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,397
             Salt, white pepper,
              and black pepper. 

320
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,932
          Cut of meat like this,
        you don't need too much.

321
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,601
There's tons of flavor          
in that fat right there.        

322
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,201
       Pour Worcestershire sauce
                  over it.      

323
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,338
          It helps the rub stick
   and make sure it stays moist.

324
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,672
                Pour some of    
              the rub on there. 

325
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,741
This is going to cook down,     
 render off the fat,            

326
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,676
   then it's just               
going to be good to go?         
         Better than good to go.

327
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,078
                 Wrap it up     
       and let it sit overnight.

328
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,946
Marinade for a bit.             
              Then we throw it  
               on the smoker.   

329
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,814
Coming through. Coming through. 
 Stand back, folks.             

330
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,551
We put it on the smoker,        
   fat side down.               

331
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,085
        And this is the mesquite
            that you're running?

332
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,888
Throw a little bit on there,    
to get the smoke rolling.       

333
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,155
                  How long      
            do you let this run?

334
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:44,956
  4 1/2 to 5 hours.             

335
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,490
     About 200.                 
     That's it.                 

336
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:47,692
Now what are we making?         

337
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,027
We're making a horseradish sauce
              for the po' boy.  

338
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,762
            A little sour cream,
           a little horseradish,

339
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,098
           couple little chives,
         little salt and pepper.

340
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,632
          dash of Dijon mustard,

341
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,767
              and mix that up.  

342
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:56,835
  Now, this is only             
 going to get better            

343
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:57,702
 with a little time,            
      correct?                  

344
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,170
                  Exactly,      
              as it chills out. 

345
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,839
   Good amount of               
horseradish in my book.         

346
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,374
Alright, so we go pull          
   the prime rib.               

347
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,042
            Ooh! I can't believe
             that whole thing's 

348
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,910
                 going to be    
               on my sandwich.  

349
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,579
Wait until you see this.        
    There you go.               

350
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,247
                   MURRAY:      
          This is the best part.

351
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,782
Look at that smoke ring,        
    right there.                

352
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:13,317
 Oh, it's beautiful.            
Oh, that's horrible!            

353
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,786
  You don't want to             
  have any of that.             

354
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,321
I think we should get           
     a 12 pack,                 

355
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,189
  turn on the game,             
   get a few TVs.               

356
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,058
  Just whittle off              
   on this thing.               

357
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,992
        Yeah.                   

358
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:21,726
          Stick that up in here.

359
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,528
It's like an angel singing.     

360
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,263
                 That's it.     
 Let's make a po' boy.          

361
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:28,799
         Fresh bread, butter it,
        and put it on the grill.

362
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,535
 Stick a little bit of that down
               in the au jus.   

363
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,270
That's all you giving me?       

364
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,605
    There you go.               

365
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,606
     Let's take that bottom bun,
         give you a little slop.

366
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,874
  Sog that up, huh?             
                     Yeah.      

367
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,209
Fish her out of there.          
Don't go losing none of it.     

368
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:39,544
      Yeah, I'm making sure now.

369
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:42,280
         A little grilled onion,
     couple slices of provolone.

370
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,281
             horseradish sauce. 

371
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,616
             Prime rib po' boy. 

372
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,418
 With you soakifying            
  that bottom bun,              

373
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,353
am I really going to be able    
to pick this thing up?          

374
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,288
            Yeah, you've kind of
              got to do a flip. 

375
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,692
        Mmm.                    
  This thing rocks!             

376
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:55,894
 So you got a little            
 bit of sweet there,            

377
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,028
a little bit of salt,           

378
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,697
  with the tang of              
  the horseradish,              

379
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:01,166
the onions, the bread,          
the smoke of the prime rib.     

380
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,634
 Look at that meat.             
   All that smoke.              

381
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,103
  How much is this?             
                        $6.95.  

382
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,104
   What, per bite?              
                       No!      

383
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,241
              For a 6" po' boy. 

384
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,309
That's a four-napkiner.         

385
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,044
    Big sandwich.               
     Big flavor.                

386
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,113
       WOMAN: Here's your       
    smoked prime rib po' boy.   

387
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,315
          The best smoked flavor
  of any meat I have ever eaten.

388
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,851
      WOMAN: You can taste      
        the horseradish.        

389
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:20,985
      Brings out the flavor     
          in the meat.          

390
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:21,920
         It's very good.        

391
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:22,920
FIERI: They do it right.        

392
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,055
                Do it right.    
And a good price?               

393
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,189
                 Good price.    

394
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,524
    MURRAY: Plating the ribs.   

395
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:28,393
       FIERI: Just the way      
     Mike's stepdad wanted.     

396
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,861
I couldn't even restaurant,     
when I started, you know.       

397
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:31,929
                    Okay.       

398
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,297
             And now            
      he's packing them in.     

399
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,799
 Sweet potato fries             
     coming up.                 

400
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,335
    MAN: Mike had a good job    
      of trying to hang on      

401
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,270
       to the traditional       
      New Orleans flavors.      

402
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:40,538
WOMAN: Seafood gumbo.           

403
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,606
      FIERI: And what makes     
      Mike the proudest...      

404
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:42,741
  Coming to plate.              

405
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:45,810
 ...is serving up his step-dad's
        original recipes.       

406
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:46,945
Side of corn pudding up.        

407
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,146
            And it is delicious!

408
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,280
             What are we making?

409
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,548
 Cajun corn pudding.            

410
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,350
   Start off with               
husking our corn here.          

411
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:53,551
       Take all the silk off it?
     Yeah.                      

412
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,019
        You gonna roast it ahead
                  of time?      

413
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,154
   No. This is it.              

414
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,422
Just going to put it            
in the pan and fry it.          

415
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,624
          You see how hard it is
     to get down into that bowl?

416
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:00,692
                I'll show you   
               a little trick.  

417
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,360
             If you put that up 
              on top of there,  

418
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,295
         the corn is still going
           to fall down into it.

419
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,563
    Well, that is               
  kind of neat now.             

420
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,431
     Great idea.                
Learn something every day.      

421
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,500
Get your skillet going.         

422
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,301
      Olive oil                 
and our corn in there,          

423
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,502
   a little salt.               

424
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,903
 And it wouldn't be             
 Cajun corn pudding             

425
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:13,771
without a little cayenne.       

426
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:14,773
Couple of minutes in there.     

427
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,174
  Add a little bit              
   of bacon to it.              

428
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,308
 Let some of the fat            
  render out of it.             

429
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,510
        Check that really quick.

430
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:19,577
                That's bacon.   

431
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,780
    We add onions               
 and green peppers.             

432
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:22,914
While that's cooking down,      

433
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,182
let's put the liquid mixture    
together for the pudding.       

434
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,186
  Some eggs, cream,             
   and some milk.               

435
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,387
        Oh, this is quiche-like.

436
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,255
  It's quiche-like.             

437
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,058
Add a little nutmeg,            
black pepper, little sugar.     

438
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,592
      That's not a little sugar.
          That's a lot of sugar.

439
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:35,927
Then we add our corn.           

440
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,061
 Now whisk together.            

441
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,262
A little Parmesan cheese.       

442
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,798
                    Whoa!       
       Like the way you do that.

443
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,666
      Cornmeal.                 
That all gets mixed together.   

444
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,668
Alright, I'll butter            
 the casserole dish.            

445
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,069
    Put a little                
breadcrumbs in here.            

446
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,871
Shake it around, and give it    
a little coat everywhere.       

447
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,072
     Then we'll                 
stir up in there good.          

448
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,140
If you don't do that,           

449
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,208
  the cornmeal will             
settle out in the bottom,       

450
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,276
and it will be become           
      a layer.                  

451
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:52,744
          Did you say "who dat"?
   Who dat?                     

452
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,345
 We add the mixture             
to the casserole dish.          

453
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:55,346
             And then right in. 

454
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:56,881
              375 for how long? 

455
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,282
  About 45 minutes.             
                    Alright.    

456
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,350
  Comes out like...             
                   [ Whistles ] 

457
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,352
               Not sure if I'm  
               in quiche land.  

458
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,087
      Be brave.                 

459
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:03,888
                    Mmm.        

460
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,022
             That's corn quiche.

461
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,825
            But outside of that,

462
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,626
       there's a punch of flavor
                  in there.     

463
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:09,961
                   You got      
           a little bit of heat.

464
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,229
                  That corn     
             is nice and sweet. 

465
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,563
                 You've got     
         that fresh corn flavor.

466
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,032
      And look at all of that --
          the egg and the cream,

467
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,900
       bunch of Parmesan cheese,
               holds together.  

468
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,234
      That's a really nice side.

469
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,770
              Nice and sturdy.  

470
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,305
                  Nice job!     
  Thanks, man.                  

471
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:21,773
       Cajun corn pudding.      

472
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,574
     MAN: It was delicious,     
           very sweet.          

473
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,376
       Yet it has a little      
       bit of spice to it.      

474
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,711
         And here's your        
       prime rib po' boy.       

475
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:27,778
             It's all good food.

476
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,647
     Rib plate.                 
Potato salad. Baked beans.      

477
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,049
   WOMAN: I just love it here.  

478
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:32,116
  Very true to Louisiana food.  

479
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,118
        MURRAY: Coming to plate.

480
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,652
            FIERI: Imagine Jim's
             looking down here, 

481
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:35,653
           just proud as can be,

482
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,055
     recognizing what a good job
                you're doing.   

483
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,923
            You're still in here
           working it every day.

484
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,058
     And we've had a blast, man.
Thank you so much, Guy.         

485
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,260
  I appreciate it.              
     Thanks a lot for having us.

486
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,796
        FIERI: Next stop,       
we're heading to Indianapolis...

487
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,330
  Really good food,             
with lots of flavor.            

488
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,532
     ...to pile on the pork.    

489
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,267
Mmm, this isn't your average    
   pork sandwich.               

490
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,138

491
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,340
  I'm here in the Broad Ripple  
     section of Indianapolis    

492
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,742
      to check out a joint      

493
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:00,411
   that's got all the makings   
     of a made-for-TV movie.    

494
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,680
           Let's see,           
    waitress meets line cook.   

495
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,015
       They fall in love.       

496
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,550
    They buy the restaurant.    

497
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:06,785
         And then, yeah,        

498
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,086
          they add meat         
  to the vegan-vegetarian menu. 

499
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,355
   I mean, you hear every day!  

500
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:12,023
     This is 3 Sisters Café.    

501
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,357
         Got an eggplant        
          on the rail.          

502
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,559
     Well, I'm a vegetarian.    

503
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:15,760
             Are you vegetarian 
                  as well?      

504
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,562
  No, I like meat.              

505
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:18,762
        Pork's going on.        

506
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,431
              They can kind of  
             cater to everybody.

507
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,633
             Look what I've got!

508
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,033
      FIERI: That's exactly     
      what Moira Sommers...     

509
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,168
     I'm waiting                
    on my greens.               

510
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,903
       ...and her partner       
       Alex Munroe wanted.      

511
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,172
       Just got on and --       
We never looked back.           

512
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,174
        Here we go, guys.       

513
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:30,575
        Really good food        
      with lots of flavor.      

514
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,377
             You make everything
                from scratch?   
   Absolutely.                  

515
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:33,911
        MUNROE: Chili up.       
   FIERI: From vegan chili...   

516
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,379
                That's good.    

517
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,581
          Bacon is on.          

518
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,715
     FIERI: ...to barbecued     
      chicken with bacon...     

519
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:38,917
    I got a D'Nai               
   in the window.               

520
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,384
    ...to this top seller...    

521
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,987
   Alex's take on               
a ham and cheese sandwich.      

522
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,455
          ...done with          
        a Southern spin.        

523
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,591
 I've never had kale            
on a sandwich before.           

524
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,259
             Mmm, it is so good.

525
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,661
So what are we going            
  to make, brother?             

526
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,328
       The spice rub that we use
     on the D'Nai pork sandwich.

527
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,397
    All of this?                

528
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,998
                  Paprika,      
           we're gonna go cumin,

529
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,967
                white pepper,   
             oregano, coriander.

530
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,535
    And who made                
 this concoction up?            

531
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:58,603
                Me. Kind of.    

532
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,071
                Chili powder,   
                black pepper,   

533
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,405
             granulated garlic, 
                   sugar.       

534
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,007
               You got thyme.   
  A lot of it.                  

535
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,309
            Yeah, a whole bunch.
                  Rosemary.     

536
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,743
                Some ginger,    
       just because we had some.

537
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,278
                    Nutmeg.     
  That's a generous             
     spice rub.                 

538
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,679
               Blend them all   
              together by hand. 

539
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,282
Because if you did it by foot,  
that would really be weird.     

540
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,950
        Would be a little gamey,
                  you know.     

541
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,418
   Somebody's here              
      to play.                  

542
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,087
              We need to set up 
              for a fresh ham.  

543
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,755
          Onions, we're going to
             go celery, carrots.

544
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:18,822
Okay. A little garlic.          

545
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,157
    Liquid Smoke.               
                 Some water.    

546
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,959
              We use the onions 
       to hold the wire rack up.

547
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,694
          And our ham comes BRT.

548
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,563
"Bone rolled and tied."         
                In the fish net.

549
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:26,631
              Put a little salt 
              and pepper on it. 

550
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:27,765
   Pork fish nets,              

551
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,368
available at your Flavortown    
  department store.             

552
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,103
     We're going to put some rub
       all over the top of this.

553
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,438
Very generous with that.        

554
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,372
              And there we are. 

555
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,373
              Foil on the top.  

556
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,507
 Now we're going to             
   go to the oven.              

557
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,109
        350 for about two hours.

558
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,510
           And then another hour
             with the foil off. 

559
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,178
Okay, so it puts a nice         
 little crust on it,            

560
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,380
   a little bark.               
                    Cool it.    

561
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,447
And then to serve it?           

562
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,450
                  Slice it,     
          and then braised kale.

563
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:48,185
  Dude, when it comes to greens,
                  huge fan.     

564
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,720
MUNROE: Well, we're going       
to start with bacon.            

565
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,855
Onions, garlic, cloves.         

566
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,790
                Liquid smoke.   
A little red vinegar.           

567
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:55,192
And, pretty good amount         
  of salt, pepper.              

568
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,794
  And then a whole              
   bunch of kale.               

569
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,463
             My mouth just went 
             into full Niagara. 

570
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,331
Going to put some water         
in there, and let this rip      

571
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,733
about an hour and 15.           

572
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,201
   On to the pork.              
Get the bun warmed up.          

573
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,669
           Good portion of pork.
             Dunk it in au jus. 

574
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:05,803
               And the au jus,  
              what's in there?  

575
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:06,603
The drippings from the pan,     

576
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:07,605
plus a little bit of water,     

577

Just warm up in there.

00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,874

of pepper jack cheese.          

582
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:15,880
 Little more au jus             
    on top of it.               

583

   Stick a lid on.              

584
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,016
Takes about 20, 30 seconds      
 to melt the cheese.            

585
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,084

Melts in your mouth.

Man, it's addictive.
