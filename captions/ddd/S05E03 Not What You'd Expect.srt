JUST HEAVY CREAM.               
                           OKAY.

97
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,902
AND WE MIX IT. IT'LL SEPARATE   
 THE FAT AND THE BUTTERMILK.    
               YOU STRAIN THAT, 
              AND THAT'S BUTTER.

98
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,705
WE'LL ADD TOASTED PINE NUTS,    
     DRIED CHERRIES...          
                            MMM.

99
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:03,041

            AND THIS GETS PUT   
         ON TOP OF THE PANCAKES.

100
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:06,578
YEP.                            
      REALLY GOOD. THE BUTTER IS
     OUTSTANDING. THAT MAKES IT,

101
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,713
             ESPECIALLY WITH    
         THE PINE NUTS IN THERE.

                      COMING UP.

104
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,186
THE SECRET'S                    
GETTING OUT.                    
    AND EVERYBODY LOVES IT.     

105
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:16,788

                LOYAL FOLLOWING.
  OUR CUSTOMERS ARE HERE

TIRED OF IT.

00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,726
                  RIB EYE SALAD.
            (woman)             
    WE JUST CAN'T FIGURE OUT

           FROM THAT            
     LITTLE SIMPLE KITCHEN.     

110
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,198
     BUT AS I LOOK AROUND HERE, 
       WE DON'T HAVE AN OVEN.   

111
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,067
          NO OVENS, NO BURNERS. 
         WE JUST USE TWO GRILLS.

112
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:32,003
AND WHY DIDN'T WE PUT IT        
       UP HIGHER?               
                 BECAUSE WE HAVE
                  SHORT STAFF.  

113
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,006
WE'RE SHORT-STAFFED? YOU SHOULD 
 PUT A "NOW HIRING" SIGN OUT.   

114
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,075
                  YOU DON'T HAVE
                    A FREEZER.  
NO.                             

115
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:40,745
                 A TOMATILLO    
              AND A DRIZZLE OF--
 <i> SO THEY'RE BUILDING THE MENU</i>  
   <i> AROUND WHATEVER'S FRESH.</i>    

116
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,948
    EVERY TIME YOU COME HERE,   
     THERE'S A NEW SURPRISE.    

117
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,751

             DELICIOUS--        
     IT HAD A LITTLE KICK TO IT.

124
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,034
              SO I CAN TAKE IT  
             FROM THE CORN HUSKS

125
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,505

                          RIGHT.

127
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,041

A LITTLE LIME?                  

129
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,579
THAT'S IT.                      
                   SO THE MASA--

               AND SOME WATER.  
AND THAT'S IT.

              YOU LAY YOURS OUT?
YEP.

WITH A LITTLE BIT OF THE SEEDS, 
 BUT THE SKINS ARE TAKEN OFF.   

146
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:47,612
THE STEMS ARE GONE.

00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,681
             LET'S GET IT GOIN'.

OKAY, SO ARE WE

NOW WE GET A LITTLE MILK        
       IN THERE.                
                     FRESH CORN.

              A NICE HOT FLAVOR.
FABULOUS.                       

167
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,856
    ON THE BACK OF YOUR SHIRT   
 IT SAYS, "EAT HERE, NOT THERE."

168
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:34,459
          IT SHOULD SAY,        
   "LITTLE PLACE, HUGE FLAVOR." 

169
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,995
   YOU ALWAYS FIND

216

220
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,517
 AND YOU ALWAYS GOTTA HAVE SALT,
    ALWAYS GOTTA HAVE PEPPER,   

221
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,586
GARLIC, OREGANO.                
                      OREGANO.  
                    I LIKE THIS.

222
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,254
         SO WE'RE NOT GOING     
     FOR A SUPERHOT BLACKENING. 

223
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,725
    WELL, I SEE A LITTLE CAYENNE
          SITTIN' UP THERE.     
YEAH, ADDING A LITTLE BIT

224
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,860

225

226

BLACKENING SPICE--              

228
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,535

              OH, SO YOU MAKE IT
                  A WET RUB.    

229
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,537
MAKE IT A WET RUB--             
 ALL THOSE SPICES               

230
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,071

     WITH OLIVE OIL,            

231
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,807
 ESPECIALLY WHEN IT             
STARTS TOUCHIN' HEAT.           
           WHEN IT'LL ALSO START

232
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,809
           TO WORK ITS WAY      
     INTO THE FISH A LITTLE BIT.
YEP.                            

233
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,878
     WOW, THAT'S A GREAT-LOOKIN'
           PIECE OF FISH.       

234
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,813
          NOW IF YOU WERE GONNA 
        GIVE SOMEBODY AN EXAMPLE

235
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,882
OF WHAT BARRAMUNDI TASTES LIKE--
 I MEAN, ARE WE INTO A SNAPPER? 
A LITTLE BIT MORE FIRM.         

236
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,418
  IS THERE ENOUGH OIL           
IN THE FISH TO COOK IT,         

237
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:16,554
OR DO WE HIT IT--               
        WE'RE GONNA HIT IT      
 WITH A LITTLE CLARIFIED BUTTER.

238
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:19,024
OKAY.                           
            ONCE YOU GOT THE PAN
                NICE AND HOT,   

239
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,826
                 WE'RE GONNA ADD
                 THE BARRAMUNDI.
SO WE'LL PAN-FRY THIS ABOUT TWO,
  THREE MINUTES ON EACH SIDE?   

240
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,227
                            YEP.
FINISH IT OFF IN THE OVEN,      
   OTHERWISE YOU'LL GET         

241
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:26,231
TOO MUCH HEAT ON THOSE SPICES   
 AND THEY'LL ACTUALLY BURN.     
                   THAT'S RIGHT.

242
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,366
IS IT READY?                    
      YEAH, IT'S READY. PUT SOME
      ROASTED RED-SKIN POTATOES,

243
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,768
      PLATE THAT RIGHT ON OVER. 

244

NICE AND JUICY.                 

245
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,905
     AND WE HAVE                
A LEMON-HERB BUTTER.            

246
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,374
IT'S GONNA BE OREGANO,          
BASIL, SAGE AND THYME,          

247
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,443

250
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:43,782

PRIME-TIME SAUSAGE.

AND HEAT 'EM UP.                
                      PRECISELY.

               ALL REDUCED DOWN.

00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:07,137
SERIOUSLY, TAKE ME AWAY FROM IT 
BEFORE I GO INTO A FULL FRENZY. 

505
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:11,675
    THE POLENTA WAS AWESOME.    
          CRISPY ON THE OUTSIDE,
           CREAMY ON THE INSIDE.

506
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,477

    I'D GIVE IT FIVE STARS.     
                IT'S NOT LIKE   
              YOUR NORMAL DINER.

510
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,820

   OF THIS PLACE?               

516
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:35,232
"SORRY, WE'RE OPEN"?

 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

522
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,380
              THE QUESTION IS-- 

523
