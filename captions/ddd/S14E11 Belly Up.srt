00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,743
        EVERY SINGLE PART       
  OF THE ANIMALS THAT THEY GET. 

100
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,411
  <i> AND THEY DO MEAN EVERY PART.</i> 

101
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,614
           OH, THIS'LL BE ON    
     THE FRONT PAGE OF MY BOOK. 

102
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:47,152
     <i> WHEN WE COME BACK...</i>      
      TODAY I MIGHT HAVE PUSHED 
    MYSELF TO ANOTHER BOUNDARY. 

103
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,154
       WE'RE MAKING HEADCHEESE. 

104
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:51,657
              AWESOME SAUSAGE.  
          IT'S AWESOME SAUSAGE.

                 TO TRIPLE "D." 

106
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,132
       SO WE'RE AT ANDERSONVILLE
              IN CHICAGO,       

107
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,534
        HANGING OUT AT HOPLEAF. 

108
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:05,537
                AND BOY,        
         DO WE HAVE A SURPRISE. 

109
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,807
       WE'RE MAKING HEADCHEESE. 
       GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN HERE.

110
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:11,009
  WE'RE GONNA START             
WITH OUR PIG'S HEAD.            

111
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,879
IT'S A LITTLE BIT INTIMIDATING  
         FOR PEOPLE.            
                       NO. WHY? 

112
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,748
WE START WITH HOT WATER         

113
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,150
AND SOME PINK SALT              
FOR PRESERVATION,               

114
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,819
SUGAR, AND SOME KOSHER SALT.    

115
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,355
           A TRADITIONAL BRINE. 

116
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:25,891
     THIS IS VERY WELL ACCEPTED 
           IN MANY CULTURES.    
YEAH.                           

117
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:27,292
           WASTE NOT, WANT NOT. 
ABSOLUTELY.                     

118
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,227
THE BEST PARTS                  
OF THE ANIMAL                   

119
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,028
ARE FREQUENTLY FOUND            
    ON THE HEAD.                

120
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:33,298
  THE CHEEK OF JUST ABOUT       
ANYTHING IS THE BEST EATING.    
                            MMM.

121
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,367
         THAT CHEEK MEAT IS SOME
          OF THE MOST FLAVORFUL 

122
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:37,903
           IN ALL OF THE SWINE. 
MIX THIS BRINE UP               
  A LITTLE BIT.                 

123
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:41,306
                   I HOPE YOU   
               APPRECIATE THIS. 
WE'RE GONNA ADD                 
SOME COLD WATER.                

124
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,375
   SNOUT DOWN,                  
LIFT BY THE EARS.               
                      WHOO-HOO! 

125
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,645
AND...                          

126
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:50,982
        HOW LONG WILL IT BRINE? 
THIS WILL BRINE                 
 FOR TWO DAYS.                  

127
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,118
ALL RIGHT, YOU READY            
     FOR THIS?                  
                            YEP.

128
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,520
ALWAYS BY THE EARS.             
       AND THEY DON'T TEAR OFF? 

129
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,922
NO, THEY ARE TOUGH.             

130
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,457
         OH, THIS WILL BE       
   ON THE FRONT PAGE OF MY BOOK.

131
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:02,327
WE GO INTO THE POT.             

132
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:05,263
WE ARE GOING TO BUILD           
A STOCK, ESSENTIALLY,           

133
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:08,266
SO WE'RE GONNA START            
WITH THE HAM HOCKS,             

134
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:11,136
ONIONS, CARROTS,                

135
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,138
CELERY, LEEKS.                  

136
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,674
  WE'RE STARTING                
TO GET PRETTY FULL.             
                STARTING TO GET 
                 A LITTLE FULL? 

137
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,143
  AND THEN WE'VE GOT            
SOME THYME, PARSLEY...          
                THYME AND LOOKS 
                  LIKE PARSLEY. 

138
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:19,677
                  BAY LEAF,     

139
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:21,212
                 AND PEPPERCORN.

140
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,614
THIS IS GONNA SIMMER            
     OVERNIGHT.                 

141
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,950
         OKAY, SO WE LET THIS GO
             10 TO 12 HOURS.    

142
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,952
IT'S READY TO COME OUT.         
      YOU READY?                

143
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,288
        BASICALLY DO            
THE SALAD TONG APPROACH HERE.   

144
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:31,823
(grunts)                        

145
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,826
              YOU GOT ALL THAT? 
MM-HMM.                         

146
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:38,830
       LIKE I WAS GONNA JUMP IN 
                AND HELP.       
(chuckles)                      

147
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,299
   THOSE HOCKS HAVE JUST TURNED 
     INTO JELLY, PRACTICALLY.   

148
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,368
THERE'S SOME EXCELLENT MEAT     
         AS WELL.               
                            MMM.

149
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,437
         I'M EXCITED TO TRY IT. 
             IT'LL BE GOOD.     

150
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,505
SO WE GOT A GOOD CHEEK          
     ON THIS SIDE.              

151
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,040
                  LOOK AT THAT. 

152
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,108
WE'RE JUST GONNA                
  PICK THROUGH,                 

153
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:53,110
GET THE PIECES                  
THAT LOOK GOOD.                 

154
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:55,380
               OH, HIS TONGUE'S 
                   IN THERE.    
YOU CAN SEE. OH, YES.           

155
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,382
                     (whistles) 
      THIS IS ONE               
OF THE BETTER EXAMPLES.         

156
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,917
                   THERE WE GO. 

157
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:01,052
 THAT'S WHERE THE CHRISTMAS GIFT
      WAS--RIGHT DOWNTOWN.      

158
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:04,188
             THIS IS THE CHEEK, 
                  UNSEASONED?   
 GOOD EXAMPLE--                 
THAT IS THE CHEEK.              

159
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,791
                       MMM.     

160
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:09,194
         SO THE REDUCED LIQUID. 
THIS STARTED OUT AS WHAT,       
   PROBABLY 4 GALLONS?          

161
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,196
             MAN, THAT IS A LOT 
                 OF REDUCTION.  

162
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:13,198
                           OKAY.
THIS IS YOUR DUNCE CAP,         

163
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,132
   BUT WE HAVE                  
TO FILL IT FIRST.               
           THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

164
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:16,935
WE'RE JUST GONNA TAKE           
  THAT PICKED MEAT,             

165
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:18,937
 WE'RE JUST GONNA               
SHOVE IT IN THERE.              
             SHOVE IT IN THERE. 

166
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,739
 THAT LEAVES ME                 
ENOUGH ROOM THERE               

167
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,473
TO COMPACT THE MEAT             
   A LITTLE BIT.                

168
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,743
          IT'S STARTING TO LOOK 
         A LOT LIKE HEADCHEESE. 

169
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,878
AND SO WE'VE GOT                
LIQUEFIED ASPIC.                

170
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,880
         JUST KIND OF SQUEEZE IT
              A LITTLE BIT,     

171
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,949
        LET IT SETTLE DOWN      
   INTO THE NOOKS AND CRANNIES. 

172
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,084
   THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA CONGEAL, 
       TIGHTEN THIS ALL UP,     

173
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,620
    AND MAKE IT INTO A SAUSAGE. 
THERE YOU GO. MAGICAL.          

174
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,556
OKAY, THAT'S GOOD.              
                    WE'RE GOOD? 

175
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:40,292
        THEN WE DO              
SOMETHING CALLED WHIPPING,      

176
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:44,029
     SO WE HAVE                 
A NICE UNIFORM TUBE.            

177
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,031
                  WHIP IT GOOD. 

178
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,432
           LET IT GO OVERNIGHT. 

179
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:48,900
               IT'LL COOL DOWN, 

180
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,369
             AND WE'LL BE READY 
              TO ROCK 'N' ROLL. 

181
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,371
              WOW, IT IS DENSE. 

182
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,373
     THE FIRST SLICE            
WILL TELL US HOW WE DID.        

183
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,309
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.             

184
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,311
PEEL OFF THAT CASING            
   FOR YOU THERE.               

185
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:02,380
       I'LL WORK ON THE SLICES. 
               YOU, UH...       
ALL RIGHT. LOOKS                
PRETTY GOOD, HUH?               

186
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,682
        YEAH. NO, IT CUTS NICE. 

187
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,718
              A LITTLE TURNIP   
           AND A LITTLE MUSTARD.

188
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:09,354
LOAD IT UP TO REFLECT           
 HOW BRAVE YOU ARE.             

189
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,525
                    AWESOME.    
                 IT'S DELICIOUS.

190
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:15,327
              YOU CAN TASTE IT. 
             THE FLAVOR'S REAL. 

191
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,329
               IT'S NOT 1/100th 
                AS INTIMIDATING 

192
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,797
              AS I THINK PEOPLE 
                 WOULD EXPECT.  
MM-HMM.                         

193
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:22,534
        I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT YOUR 
      SEASONING DOWN PAT, DUDE. 
UH-HUH. YEP.                    

194
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,403
   I AM SO IMPRESSED WITH THIS. 
          AWESOME SAUSAGE.      
YEAH.                           

195
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,572
 THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE
    IT. IT'S AWESOME SAUSAGE.   

196

     THE MARINADE               

299
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,582
 WITH A LITTLE BIT OF BUTTERMILK
        WE MAKE IN HOUSE.       

300
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,384
         AND THE REASON TO MAKE 
             THE BUTTERMILK     

301
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,519
                 VERSUS BUY IT? 
        WE LIKE                 
TO MAKE EVERYTHING HERE.        

302
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:11,856
JODI ACTUALLY GOT IT            
FROM HER GRANDMOTHER.           
          IF YOU CAN MAKE IT    
    BETTER THAN YOU CAN BUY IT, 

303
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:15,059
       YOU SHOULD TRY TO DO IT. 
A LITTLE BIT OF HOT SAUCE,      
     SMOKED PAPRIKA,            

304
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,261
GARLIC POWDER, A LITTLE BIT     
    OF MUSTARD POWDER.          

305
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,331
GIVE IT A STIR AND DROP         
 THE THIGHS IN THERE.           

306
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,268
   LET THEM MARINATE            
FOR AT LEAST 24 HOURS,          

307
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:24,669
NO MORE THAN 36 HOURS.          

308
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:25,870
              NOW WE DREDGE IT? 
YEAH.                           

309
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:28,473
ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR,              

310
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,408
GARLIC POWDER,                  
SMOKED PAPRIKA,                 

311
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,277
AND JUST--JUST                  
A LITTLE BIT...                 
                     NICE COLOR 
                       ON THAT. 

312
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,612
PEPPER, THE BALEINE             
 FRENCH SEA SALT.               

313
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,681
 MIX THAT UP.                   

314
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,950
  TAKE THE CHICKEN              
OUT OF THE MARINADE.            
                  CHUG SOME     
             OF THE BUTTERMILK? 

315
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:42,020
MAYBE WE'LL HAVE                
A CONTEST LATER.                
          THROW A LITTLE DREDGE 
                 ON THESE.      

316
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:45,422
       SO WE DO THEM            
AT ABOUT 350--7, 8 MINUTES.     

317
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,424
AND SO WE COOK THEM             
    IN A BLEND                  

318
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,295
OF DUCK FAT, CANOLA,            
   AND OLIVE OIL.               
           OH, GOING OLD SCHOOL 
                  WITH IT.      

319
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,697
                 CAST-IRON      
         AND THE WHOLE GIDDYAP. 

320
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:55,567
              THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. 
    AND WE SERVE IT WITH        
A LITTLE BIT OF REDEYE GRAVY.   

321
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,770
     DO YOU KNOW MY MIDDLE NAME 
          IS REDEYE GRAVY?      

322
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:00,705
                 THIS IS A LOT  
               FOR REDEYE GRAVY.

323
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,507
      COOKING OIL,              
SOME CHOPPED-UP ONIONS--        

324
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,442
     WE'RE GONNA                
LET THOSE SWEAT OUT.            

325
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,777
HOUSE-MADE SAUSAGE,             

326
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,445
AND IT'S ALL HEIRLOOM           
AND HERITAGE BREEDS.            

327
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,779
       BREAK THE SAUSAGE APART. 

328
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,915
LET THAT RENDER DOWN.           

329
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,850
       SO YOU'RE GONNA USE SOME 
               OF THAT FAT      

330
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,186
     TO BUILD SOME OF THE ROUX. 
AND WE'RE GONNA ADD IN          
A LITTLE BIT OF GARLIC,         

331
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,854
SOME FRESH THYME,               
 COFFEE GROUNDS,                

332
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,856
AND THEN A LITTLE BIT           
OF INSTANT ESPRESSO.            

333
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:20,591
                 SO THE ESPRESSO
                  I UNDERSTAND, 

334
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,994
            BUT HOW DOES        
  THAT COFFEE GROUND DISSIPATE? 
IT DOESN'T BREAK DOWN.          

335
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,795
IT GIVES IT ALMOST LIKE         
     A TOOTHSOME--              

336
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,998
          THAT YOU HAVE         
  A LOT OF, LIKE, PEPPER IN IT. 

337
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,733
AND WE'RE GONNA ADD             
   SOME BUTTER.                 
                           WHOA!

A.P. FLOUR.                     
               BUILD THE ROUX-- 
                     GOT IT.    

339
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,671
SO WE LET THE ROUX              
     COOK OUT,                  

340
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,472
AND WE LIKE TO GET              
  A LIGHT BROWN.                

341
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,875
              YOU WANT TO FLIP  
             THAT CHICKEN, BOSS?

342
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,877
NOW THE ROUX'S READY            
  TO ADD THE MILK.              

343
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,679
     BRING THAT                 
BACK UP TO A SIMMER.            

344
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,681
BREWED COFFEE.                  
             SO IT'S GONNA HAVE 
                  THE FLAVOR.   

345
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,617
 IT'S JUST GONNA HAVE CREAMINESS
     AND SAUSAGE IN IT ALSO.    

346
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,086
YES.                            
                    OKAY, THEN. 

347

     TO UNBOLT THE KITCHEN SINK.

350
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,361

          THEN YOU CAN PUT THAT 
                 IN THERE.

  AND WE'LL JUST LET THAT       
COME BACK UP AND COOK OUT.      

352
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:04,302
 SO WE HAVE THE CHICKEN BISCUIT,
      READY TO PLATE IT UP.

360

I DO.                           

398
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:58,649
                YES. I'VE MADE  
             A LOT OF POPOVERS. 
REALLY?                         

399
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,585
           YEAH, BUT THEY NEVER 
                  POP OVER.     

400
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,453
              THEY JUST TURN    
        INTO REAL BAD BISCUITS. 
(laughs)                        

401
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,122
I DON'T HAVE THIS. WHAT IS THIS,
    SIX LITTLE MUNCHKIN HATS?   

402
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,792
THAT'S THE POPOVER PAN.         
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT.          
                            OOH.

403
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,594
          SEE, THERE'S PROBABLY 
              THE BEGINNING...  
 YEAH, YOU CAN'T                
USE A MUFFIN TIN.               

404
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,196
        SEE, THAT'S MY PROBLEM. 
YES.                            

405
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:13,730
RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB.         

406
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,199
FIRST STEP--                    

407
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,001
POPOVER PAN IN THE OVEN.        

408
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:19,336
      IT HAS TO BE HOT          
BEFORE YOU PUT THE BATTER IN.   

409
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,872
IT'S A LITTLE SECRET.           

410
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:24,141
WHOLE EGGS, SOME SALT,          
    BLACK PEPPER.               
                    LOTS OF IT. 

411
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,344
                YES, LOTS OF IT.

412
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,279
AND WE'LL WHISK THAT            
      TOGETHER.                 

413
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,214
           YOU'RE MAKING THIS   
         LOOK TOO EASY ALREADY. 

414
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,615
IT'S EASY.                      
I PROMISE.                      

415
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,084
                 WHERE IS OUR   
               LEAVENING AGENT? 

416
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,153
RIGHT HERE.                     
        YOU GET IT SUPER PUFFED 
                WITH THAT?      

417
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,955
                    WITH JUST-- 
TRUST ME. PROMISE.              

418
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:40,491
       YOU HAVE HAVE A CAPE ON, 
                 DO YOU?        
NO.                             

419
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,294
 THE SECRET IS YOU HAVE         
TO HAVE THE BATTER WARM.        

420
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:44,828
                        REALLY? 
YEAH, SERIOUSLY.                

421
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:46,830
IF YOU HAVE A COLD,             
  IT WON'T WORK.                

422
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:50,034
   LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF PEPPER 
             IN HERE.           

423
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:54,272
          BIG SEASONING--WOW.   
     YOU WANT ME WHISKING OR... 
SURE. HOT MILK.                 

424
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,308
NICE AND STEAMY.                

425
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:59,443
SO WE ARE GOING TO ADD          
   ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR            

426
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,712
   BUT ADD IT                   
IN THREE STAGES.                

427
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,915
AND WE WHISK THAT UP.           

428
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,449
SECOND BATCH OF FLOUR.          

429
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,852
   AND THIS IS JUST TO MAKE SURE
      THAT YOU INCORPORATE IT   

430
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,253
     INCREDIBLY WELL AND IT'S-- 
RIGHT.                          

431
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,255
 IT'S A LITTLE BIT              
LIKE PANCAKE BATTER.            
                PANCAKE BATTER. 

432
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,858
RIGHT, SO YOU DON'T WANT--      
           DO YOU DON'T WANT    
       TO BREAK EVERYBODY DOWN. 

433
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,659
        EXACTLY.                
OUR LAST LITTLE BIT HERE.       

434
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,929
YOU WANT TO MIX IT JUST UNTIL   
   IT'S ALL INCORPORATED.       

435
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:19,864
THERE CAN BE LUMPS.             
 THEY'LL BAKE OUT.              

436
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:22,399
     NOBODY WILL KNOW.          
ALL RIGHT. MOVE THIS OVER.      

437
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:25,736
   I USE A LITTLE               
HANDY DANDY PITCHER.            

438
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:30,073
WE TAKE THE POPOVER PAN         
   OUT OF THE OVEN.             

439
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,410
        IT'S VERY HOT,          
SO BE VERY, VERY, VERY CAREFUL. 

440
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,746
WE'RE GONNA SPRAY IT            
JUST A SMIDGE.                  

441
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,682
       YOU'RE MUCH MORE LIBERAL 
          WITH IT THAN I AM.    

442
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:40,685
THE TRICK IS TO FILL IT         
ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP.         

443
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:43,287
  YOU CAN BE AFRAID OF--        
NONE OF THIS HALFWAY STUFF,     

444
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:44,822
'CAUSE OTHERWISE...             
                RIDICULOUSNESS. 

445
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,491
            THEY WON'T POP OVER.

446
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,026
                   WHEN ARE WE  
               GONNA CHEESE IT? 
RIGHT NOW.                      

447
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:52,029
THEN WE HAVE THE--JUST CUBES    
        OF GRUYèRE.             
                     OH, HO HO. 

448
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:54,832
           GENEROUS--           
  THE MORE CHEESE, THE BETTER.  

449
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:57,768
ALL RIGHT.                      
              AND HOW LONG      
      ARE THESE GONNA COOK OFF? 

450
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,571
THEY TAKE ABOUT 45 MINUTES      
        TO AN HOUR              

451
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,374
  IN ABOUT A 350-               
OR 375-DEGREE OVEN.             

452
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,643
             UNLESS I CAN'T WAIT
                   FOR IT.      

453
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,846
           I'LL GUARD THE OVEN. 
OKAY.                           

454
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,447
                     OKEYDOKEY. 
OKAY, YOU READY?                

455
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:13,984
             I AM READY.        
   WAIT TILL YOU SEE THIS. OHH! 

456
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,454
AND VOILà--                     
 POPOVERS.                      

457
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,389
SEE, AND THEY LIVE UP           
 TO THE NAME, YEAH?             
                             NO.

458
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,858
 I'M GONNA PUT                  
TWO RIGHT HERE,                 

459
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,860
      AND JUST IN CASE          
YOU DIDN'T GET ENOUGH CHEESE,   

460
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:25,796
JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE          
JUST TO MAKE IT PRETTY.         
                   YOU GET TWO  
                 WITH AN ORDER? 

461
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,665
  YES. WE DON'T                 
MESS AROUND HERE.               

462
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:31,335
       CHEESY, SALTY GOODNESS-- 
              LOOK AT THAT.     

463
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,270
(chuckles)                      

464
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,807
   AND IT'S JUST NICE AND LIGHT 
       AND AIRY. LOOK AT THAT.  

465
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,876
                     (crunches) 

466
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:41,078
              MMM. OH, MY GOSH. 

467
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:44,348
   WHEN IT'S DONE THE RIGHT WAY,
        IT'S RICH AND LIGHT     

468
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,750
              AT THE SAME TIME. 

469
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,685
     IT'S LIKE A GRILLED CHEESE 
             GONE WILD.         

470
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,687
         LIKE AN EXPLOSION      
 AT THE GRILLED CHEESE FACTORY. 

471
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,155
                       OHH!     

472
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:53,157
  I WISH I COULD GET TOOTHPASTE 
       THAT TASTED LIKE THIS.   
(laughs)                        

473
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,691
                   THAT'S NUTS. 

474
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:57,227
   THIS SCREAMS FOR TOMATO SOUP 
      AND SOME MAYBERRY RERUNS. 

475
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:59,563
               THIS TOOK ME     
           TO MY COMFORT PLACE. 

476
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:01,966
           THAT'S AWESOME. MMM. 
           THEY'RE OUTSTANDING. 

477

480
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,174

THEY'RE RIDICULOUS.             

481
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,909
AND YOU CAN'T GET IT            
ANYWHERE ELSE.                  

482
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,911
PRETTY MUCH HOME RUNS           
  ACROSS THE BOARD?

           (Guy) THE NAME FITS--
            FOREIGN & DOMESTIC. 

485
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:21,185
         TAKING FOREIGN ITEMS-- 
          MAKING THEM DOMESTIC. 

486
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,988
 COOKING DOMESTIC ITEMS--MAKING 
    THEM A LITTLE BIT FOREIGN.  
(Jodi) MM-HMM.                  

487
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,790
HANDMADE, SCRATCH-MADE FOOD     

488
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:28,191

       RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.   

489
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,994
                 WHAT YOU SEE   
               IS WHAT YOU GET.

          SO THAT'S IT          
 FOR THIS FLAVOR-TOWN ROAD TRIP,
