through the window.

175
00:06:04,306 --> 00:06:06,873
FIERI: ...and Eastern takes
on Western classics.

176
00:06:06,973 --> 00:06:08,873
DARLING:
Cheeseburger fried rice up!

177
00:06:08,973 --> 00:06:11,440
That's exactly what it is ‐‐
cheeseburger fried rice.

178
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,973
Pretty much has everything
that a cheeseburger has in it.

179
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,173
It's almost like a dirty rice.
It's fantastic.

180
00:06:16,273 --> 00:06:17,873
This is where things are going
to get weird, folks.

181
00:06:17,973 --> 00:06:19,640
This is when the New Orleans
attitude steps in.

182
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,106
We're going to make
the cheeseburger fried rice.

183
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:22,573
But it's going to taste
like fried rice?

184
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:23,540
It's going to taste
like a cheeseburger.

185
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,740
In fried rice.

186
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
When you mess with
the fried rice,

187
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,706
you're messing
with my emotions.

188
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:30,173
So we're going start by making
the awesome sauce,

189
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:32,306
that's this sauce that goes on
top of the cheeseburger.

190
00:06:32,406 --> 00:06:33,906
Awesome sauce.
Yeah.

191
00:06:34,006 --> 00:06:38,273
We've got pickle chips made
into a relish, three egg yolks.

192
00:06:38,373 --> 00:06:41,006
Now I'm going to add minced
garlic, mushroom powder.

193
00:06:41,106 --> 00:06:42,406
You love
that mushroom powder.

194
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:44,106
Drizzling a little bit
of soy oil.

195
00:06:44,206 --> 00:06:46,706
So we just made
pickle‐relish‐garlic aoili.

196
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,706
Absolutely.
Alright.

197
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,473
We're in the awesome zone.

198
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:52,806
Now I'm going to fold
in the ketchup.

199
00:06:52,906 --> 00:06:55,306
So, a really fantastic
scratch‐made thousand island.

200
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:57,606
Alright, now we're going to make
the cheeseburger fried rice.

201
00:06:57,706 --> 00:06:59,773
We're going to sautee
some onions.

202
00:06:59,873 --> 00:07:01,613
Bacon.
Copious amounts.

203
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,213
Now I got ground beef.
Add a little bacon fat in there.

204
00:07:04,313 --> 00:07:05,846
This is where we're going
to fry the rice.

205
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:07,280
Doesn't get any better
than this.

206
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,613
White sugar, a bit of mushroom
powder, lettuce.

207
00:07:11,713 --> 00:07:13,680
Whoa!
I didn't see that coming.

208
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,513
Roma tomatoes.

209
00:07:16,613 --> 00:07:18,446
Nacho cheese sauce.

210
00:07:18,546 --> 00:07:20,646
Awesome sauce.
Yellow mustard.

211
00:07:20,746 --> 00:07:23,913
Sesame seeds, pickle chips.

212
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:25,580
How do you eat it?
I use a spoon.

213
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,546
You're breaking the rules!
What rules are there?

214
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:29,046
Exactly.

215
00:07:31,113 --> 00:07:31,880
I love fried rice.

216
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,646
Hawaii Five‐0.
You picked it up!

217
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:35,213
Exactly what I said!

218
00:07:35,313 --> 00:07:37,980
Bro, one minute I get a bite
and it's all cheeseburger

219
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
and I'm like,
"Okay, ground up cheeseburger."

220
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,180
The next bite I get is, like,
all fried rice.

221
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,580
You picked the iconic aspects
of both dishes

222
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,780
and made them really sing.

223
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,213
I can see why
it's such a big hit.

224
00:07:49,313 --> 00:07:50,646
Spot on!

225
00:07:52,246 --> 00:07:55,280
It tastes like exactly
what its supposed to taste like.

226
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,146
And that ends up
being delicious.

227
00:07:57,246 --> 00:07:59,780
The dill pickle on the top
just makes it authentic.

228
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,020
Is it fried rice
and a cheeseburger together?

229
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,820
It's got everything
but french fries.

230
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,986
Everything but french fries.
So it passes?

231
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,586
Oh, I'd say so.

232
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:08,986
Pork buns in the window.

233
00:08:09,086 --> 00:08:11,820
It's just a great place
that is never a bad choice.

234
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,220
FIERI: It's awesome.
I love the place.

235
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,286
And you got an open bar,
you got karaoke at night.

236
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:16,486
This place
must get rocking.

237
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:18,520
It gets weird.
It gets weird.

238
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,453
Come on down,
bring the whole family.

239
00:08:19,553 --> 00:08:22,253

240
00:08:22,353 --> 00:08:25,453
FIERI:
Up next, a decades‐old spot
in Salt Lake City...

241
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:26,853
This is what "Triple D"
is all about.

242
00:08:26,953 --> 00:08:29,786
...continuing a delicious
Scandinavian legacy.

243
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:31,520
That's Norway right there,
buddy.

244
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:43,486
♪♪♪

245
00:08:43,586 --> 00:08:44,786
So the other day I was thinking
to myself,

246
00:08:44,886 --> 00:08:46,653
"You know, on 'Triple
D' we've hit a lot

247
00:08:46,753 --> 00:08:49,453
of Italian places,
Mexican joints,

248
00:08:49,553 --> 00:08:51,620
we've been to a bunch
of Chinese places,

249
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,153
Greek family restaurants,
you name it.

250
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:54,386
But you know what we haven't
done a lot of?

251
00:08:54,486 --> 00:08:55,920
Scandinavian places."

252
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,620
So I roll in to Salt
Lake City, Utah,

253
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,526
and I hear about a place
that's doing American cuisine

254
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:02,560
with kind of, like,
a Scandinavian twist.

255
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,993
And it's got a great story
and tons of character ‐‐

256
00:09:05,093 --> 00:09:06,060
I had to check it out.

257
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,693
This is Finn's cafe.

258
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:10,660
GURHOLT:
One salmon benedict, table 4.

259
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,460
The food is delicious.

260
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,526
Unique flavor
you can only get here.

261
00:09:14,626 --> 00:09:15,893
One sourdough pancake.

262
00:09:15,993 --> 00:09:18,426
It goes back a legacy
of 50 years.

263
00:09:18,526 --> 00:09:20,593
FIERI: Started by the original
Finn Gurholt,

264
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:24,860
a Norwegian immigrant who opened
a Salt Lake cafe in 1952,

265
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,393
and became a local
restaurant legend.

266
00:09:27,493 --> 00:09:28,626
FIERI: He was a character.

267
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:30,193
If there was a camera,
he was in front of it.

268
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:31,860
Now, Finn Jr.'s at the helm.

269
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,460
Two minutes
on the schnitzel.

270
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,793
He switched locations,

271
00:09:34,893 --> 00:09:37,126
but is still carrying
on his pop's legacy

272
00:09:37,226 --> 00:09:40,660
with this breakfast‐lunch joint
he runs with his wife, Nikki.

273
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,626
That's real,
real good stuff.

274
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:45,660
I'd classify myself
as an American cafe

275
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,293
with Scandinavian flair.

276
00:09:47,393 --> 00:09:48,626
Do you speak Norweigian?

277
00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:49,826
[ Speaking Norwegian ]
Yatak.

278
00:09:49,926 --> 00:09:51,326
That's all I have
is "Yatak."

279
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:52,526
One wienerschnitzel.

280
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:53,826
WOMAN: The wienerschnitzel
is very good.

281
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,226
This is the place to come
and get it.

282
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:57,760
What are we going to make,
chef?

283
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,026
We're going to do my brown sauce
for the Wienerschnitzel.

284
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:02,300
I buy an inside round
and I trim it all off.

285
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,800
You make the meat
for different dishes,

286
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,133
and then you reserve the jus
to make for your schnitzel.

287
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:07,566
Exactly.

288
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,266
I start with chopped celery,
carrots, sweet garlic.

289
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:11,633
Some garlic.
Onions, tomatoes.

290
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:13,433
Interesting.
Mirepoix plus plus.

291
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:15,866
Black pepper, salt,
and pickling spices.

292
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:18,566
You get the roast in,
and more of the seasonings.

293
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,400
In the oven, how long?
An hour and a half.

294
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,600
And then we'll take the jus
from this,

295
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,133
and that's
for the schnitzel.

296
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:26,633
And then I add coffee, burgundy
or red wine, ketchup, and water.

297
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,100
Nice.
See that little move?

298
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,600
Then I get it back in the oven
and juice it down.

299
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,000
Draining that, and...

300
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,866
Tighten up with our roux
for the schnitzel sauce.

301
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:36,466
What's next?

302
00:10:36,566 --> 00:10:38,200
We're seasoning the flour
for wienerschnitzel with salt,

303
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,666
crack pepper, and garlic.

304
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,766
You love
that garlic powder.
I do.

305
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:43,466
This is a schnitzel,
and it's done

306
00:10:43,566 --> 00:10:45,166
by my father's butcher.

307
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:46,700
He takes all of his trimmings

308
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,266
and then runs it
through a tenderizer.

309
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:50,633
I love it.
Dip it in the egg.

310
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,633
And I only dredge it
on one side.

311
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:54,566
Really? I've never seen just
the one‐side dredge.

312
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,533
Yeah, no. I don't want
that much flour on it.

313
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm not making
chicken fried steak.

314
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,340
So that goes down.
Yeah.

315
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,473
Flip it over, that's it ‐‐
simple, simple.

316
00:11:02,573 --> 00:11:05,706
Then I got some potatoes,
asparagus that I've grilled up,

317
00:11:05,806 --> 00:11:08,940
my schnitzel, brown sauce it,
garnish it with a lemon.

318
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,006
And some capers to boot.

319
00:11:10,106 --> 00:11:11,440
Yeah.

320
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,240
It's a very simple dish, but it
eats so delicate and so tender.

321
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,406
You're getting all
of that rich flavor.

322
00:11:22,673 --> 00:11:26,073
Just the attention to detail
you take in the schnitzel.

323
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:27,606
The perfectly
cooked asparagus,

324
00:11:27,706 --> 00:11:30,640
beautiful pan‐finished
finger length potatoes,

325
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,773
and the piece de resistance,
really, is this gravy.

326
00:11:33,873 --> 00:11:37,406
Try it with some lemon
and caper.

327
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:39,073
As soon as you add
that little bit of acid

328
00:11:39,173 --> 00:11:42,273
and the little brightness
of one of those capers.

329
00:11:42,373 --> 00:11:44,373
This would be a dish
I would come to enjoy

330
00:11:44,473 --> 00:11:45,773
a couple times a month.

331
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,873
Fantastic.

332
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,373
Wienerschnitzel.

333
00:11:49,473 --> 00:11:51,640
Wienerschnitzel
has got great flavor.

334
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,773
It's super‐light.
It's not heavy.

335
00:11:53,873 --> 00:11:56,473
‐It's perfect every time.
‐Capers please.

336
00:11:56,573 --> 00:11:58,373
It's the little nuances
that make all the difference.

337
00:11:58,473 --> 00:11:59,880
Everything's fresh.

338
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,313
I do all my own baking.

339
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:02,346
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

340
00:12:02,446 --> 00:12:03,346
It's tradition.

341
00:12:03,446 --> 00:12:04,913
My dad was a konditor.

342
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:06,280
A konditor?
Pastry chef.

343
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,380
Konditery is a bakery
in Scandinavia.

00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:02,386
It's flavor city
right here.

515
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:05,986
Didn't see that coming.

516
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,820
I still need green onions.

517
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,386
The 80s said that
I'd impeach the folks.

518
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:13,753
Basil, cilantro, jalapenos,
garlic salt, fenugreek

519
00:18:13,853 --> 00:18:15,553
In the oven.
Look how excited is.

520
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:17,120
Two, three minutes.

521
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,986
It looks like you went and stole
everything off of the pizza line

522
00:18:20,086 --> 00:18:21,320
and put it on one pizza.

523
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,920
That's why I call it
the Bhinda special.

524
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,253
What do you think?

525
00:18:26,353 --> 00:18:30,020
I think I'll have
another piece.

526
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,153
It's actually going to wreck
pizza for me for a while.

527
00:18:33,253 --> 00:18:35,153
You've brought such depth
and such flavor

528
00:18:35,253 --> 00:18:37,386
and such creativity
and new textures,

529
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:38,586
like the cauliflower.

530
00:18:38,686 --> 00:18:40,953
You get a touch of the oregano
and the basil in that sauce,

531
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,920
a little bit of the Italian,
and then you come heavy

532
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,720
with everything from
the fenugreek to the cardamom.

533
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,153
The naan is nice, I mean,
it's thin,

534
00:18:47,253 --> 00:18:48,720
neopolitan‐style crust.

535
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,686
So you get that nice cracker
crunch that you want out of it,

536
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:52,453
but it's still tender.

537
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,586
My expectations were high.

538
00:18:56,686 --> 00:18:57,920
You beat my expectations.

539
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,460
Thank you.

540
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,026
Bhinda special.

541
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:02,860
These are good friends of mine
from a company called Camp Chef,

542
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,093
and they know
a lot about cooking.

543
00:19:04,193 --> 00:19:06,060
So I think they would be
the perfect ones

544
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,093
to ask what they think
of the pizza.

545
00:19:08,193 --> 00:19:10,726
It's spicy, but there's, like,
a really good flavor.

546
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:12,026
I really like the crust.

547
00:19:12,126 --> 00:19:14,060
I would say my favorite pizza
I've ever had.

548
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,993
‐Seriously?
‐I love Indian food.

549
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:17,660
It's the marriage
of the two.

550
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,860
‐Yes!
‐Margarita.

551
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,960
When they do American pizzas,
they do their own.

552
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,626
And then they do
create your own.

553
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:24,726
You guys are brothers,
I take it?

554
00:19:24,826 --> 00:19:26,326
‐Twins.
‐No.

555
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:28,360
Curry Pizza catered
for our school,

556
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,093
and these kids go like,
"Man, this is great

557
00:19:30,193 --> 00:19:31,693
cheese pizza.
Where's it from?"

558
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:34,293
WOMAN:
They have the mozzarella cheese,
the paneer cheese,

559
00:19:34,393 --> 00:19:37,060
which has got a firm texture,
but it's creamy.

560
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,693
Next one
we're making is...

561
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:40,660
Glaze paneer.
Walk me through it.

562
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,860
The honey curry sauce
we made earlier.

563
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,260
In the same dough
that we made.

564
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,926
Yup,
those are all our cheese.

565
00:19:45,026 --> 00:19:46,326
Paneer.
‐Do you make it here?

566
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:47,860
Yes.
They make the yogurt
at home

567
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,193
know they make
the paneer at home.

568
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:50,693
On the ends.

569
00:19:50,793 --> 00:19:52,326
Tomatoes, red feta cheese.

570
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:53,226
Don't forget‐a the feta.

571
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:55,293
We're going
to cook this now.

572
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:57,593
That's arugula.
The balsamic vinaigrette.

573
00:19:57,693 --> 00:19:59,466
I want this monster piece.

574
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:02,900
♪♪♪

575
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,400
I love paneer.
It has such great texture.

576
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,000
It has more like a barbecue
sauce flavor to it

577
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,933
when you mix it
with the balsamic.

578
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:11,066
I mean, it's not
just those eggs.

579
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,900
The cheese pizza ‐‐
wah‐wah.

580
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,833
This is a cheese pizza!
That's the real deal.

581
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:17,333
Congrats, man.
Thank you.

582
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:20,666
‐The glazed paneer.
‐The cheeses all come together.

583
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:22,633
‐Awesome flavors.
‐It's fantastic.

584
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:23,633
Yeah,
you've had a few slices.

585
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:24,866
‐Maybe?
‐I can see it.

586
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:26,566
Maybe I have,
and don't judge me.

587
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,566
MAN: Thai peanut.

588
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:28,700
GIRL: I love Indian food.

589
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,900
Like, that's my all‐time
favorite.

590
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,966
And I love pizza,
and so it's like, awesome.

591
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,466
Oh, I'm sorry
who stole the show.

592
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:36,633
[ Laughter ]

593
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:38,000
Chicken with the sausage.

594
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,633
People are going to be
in a hurry for the curry.

595
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,266
Trademark that.
‐Thank you.

596
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:45,966
I'll be looking for you
next week

597
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:48,533
on "Diners, Drive‐ins,
and dives."

Kids are Minder

Now you're messing it me.
