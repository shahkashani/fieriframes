00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,267
           Hey, there.          

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:04,203
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:04,205 --> 00:00:07,139
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

4
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:08,273
          This trip...          

5
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:09,941
       Dude, you are pulling out
               all the stops.   

6
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,009
  ...we're going for brunch...  

7
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,477
   On your mark, get set, go!   

8
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:13,812
     FIERI: ...to bologna...    

9
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,347
        Maybe we should just try
     a little piece for science.

10
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,615
         ...to a couple         
        of crazy burgers.       

11
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:20,085
             Oh, I'm so stealing
                  that one.     

12
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:21,487
  Like in a diner in Portland,  
            Oregon...           

13
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:22,754
                   Uh-huh!      

14
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,289
       ...where the meat's      
     getting a tricky treat.    

15
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,691
        They just start whooping
        out some fried-up donuts

16
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,627
             and making sliders 
                 out of 'em.    

17
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,362
            And in...           
    -♪ Louisville, Kentucky ♪   

18
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,798
        FIERI: ...one of        
        Damaris Phillips'       
      hometown hangouts...      

19
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,300
      Woo! Thank goodness.      
       Let me get in here.      

20
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:37,503
    FIERI: ...rise and shine    
   with true Southern comfort.  

21
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:41,005
            That is straight up,
               legit awesome.   

22
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:42,440
  Plus a funky burger joint...  

23
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,442
                     Oh.        

24
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,244
 ...spicing up their sandwiches.

25
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:49,047
                You're making   
     fermented pickles, are you?

26
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,716
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

27
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:53,585
      on "Diners, Drive-ins     
           and Dives."          

28
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:10,135
     I am Damaris Phillips.     
    And today on "Triple D",    

29
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:13,338
 I'm gonna take Guy to one of my
  favorite spots in Louisville, 

30
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,808
  Kentucky, in my neighborhood, 
         the Highlands.         

31
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,476
        How'd I do, Guy?        
         -You did great.        

32
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,013
 This is Gralehaus.             

33
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,283
            Order in.           

34
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:25,617
 You can't go wrong             
when it's done right.           

35
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,419
   And they're doing it right.  
    -Biscuits and duck gravy.   

36
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,221
         Food's just out        
         of this world.         

37
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:30,755
     WOMAN: Southern style,     

38
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,291
       a lot of the dishes      
   remind me of my childhood.   

39
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,960
   FIERI: And that's the vibe   
       Louisville natives,      

40
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:37,028
   Tyler Trotter and Lori Beck  
         were going for         

41
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,164
   when they opened this joint  
        in an old house.        

42
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,365
              BECK:             
      Gralehaus was a home.     

43
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,234
      So we wanted the food     
      to reflect, sort of,      

44
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:44,502
   the things that we grew up   
      eating that we love.      

45
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,105
    FIERI: So they brought in   
trained chef and Kentucky native

46
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,641
      Andy Myers to amp up      
   and narrow down the dishes.  

47
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:52,911
It's like a brunch menu         
served 7 days a week.           

48
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,113
Ready to roll on two            
fried bologna sandwiches.       

49
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,115
     There's something about    
    a fried bologna sandwich    

50
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,450
   if you're from this region.  

51
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,585
 And Gralehaus does it so well. 

52
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,321
     So a fried bologna sandwich

53
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:03,855
           is a brunch item here
               in Louisville?   

54
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,190
          -It is, yeah.         
              -Yes.             

55
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,391
    What are you -- what are you
             nodding over there?

56
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,193
   -I think it's all the time.  
          -Okay, good.          

57
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:10,929
The first thing that we do      
is we make a spice kit.         

58
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,197
            I've heard it called
              a lot of things.  

59
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,532
  But a spice kit works for me. 
             -Okay.             

60
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,600
Grated nutmeg, dextrose,        

61
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,069
black pepper, coriander,        

62
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:18,403
   garlic powder,               

63
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,939
   some, uh, salt,              
    curing salts,               

64
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,274
paprika and then we've got      

65
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:24,009
    some non-fat                
  dry milk powder.              

66
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,611
             Milk solids, okay. 
       You know what that's for?

67
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,946
          -Emulsifying.         
-Brings it together, ties it up.

68
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,615
   We add a little              
  bit of ice water.             

69
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:31,083
       -This is all beef?       
              -Yes.             

70
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:32,617
               So we're gonna   
               take these two,  

71
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,819
             blend them together
             and start grinding.

72
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,955
               Sheet tray it.   
            Partially freeze it.

73
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,157
         Cut it. This...        
         -Ready to roll?        

74
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,824
            You can get these at
 the carnival right here, right?

75
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,093
              -Yep.             
        -Grind-a-geddon.        

76
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,629
           I'm, like,           
       resisting the urge       

77
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,564
        to just reach out       
     and touch all over it.     

78
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:46,965
                Don't do it.    
                Don't do it.    

79
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,900
Gonna load this guy up.         

80
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,570
So the casing, I just soak it   
for a second just to...         

81
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:52,771
       Make it a little pliable.

82
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,773
 ...make it a little            
  bit more pliable.             

83
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,308
            Real easy to do that
        when we're standing here

84
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,910
         and Damaris is singing.

85
00:02:57,912 --> 00:03:00,178
     ♪ Well, hello, Dolly ♪     

86
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,181
         ♪ It's so nice         
       to have you back ♪       

87

      ♪ Where you belong ♪      

88
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,385
            He's trying to work.

89
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,454
  After we case it,             
    we smoke it.                

90
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:10,322
              And what are you  
              smoking it with?  

91
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:11,256
       Cherry.                  

92
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:12,858
        Fantastic, so some nice,
                great color.    

93
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,592
  We vacuum seal it             
   and we cook it               

94
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:15,927
   in an immersion              
     circulator                 

95
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,329
to get the temperature          
     up to 155.                 

96
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,331
       Dig it. How are you gonna
            make that egg, chef?

97
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,733
         -Sunny-side up.        
         -There you go.         

98
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,602
              That's definitely 
                   not me.      

99
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:26,271
       That's going to be       
         all this girl.         

100
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,872
 Our house bologna.             

101
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,808
        Maybe we should just try
     a little piece for science.

102
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,277
                See how that    
              sounded official? 

103
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,545
   Yeah, why not?               
    There you go.               

104
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,013
I'm going to fry this           

105
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,682
   on the flat top              
with a little bit of butter.    

106
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:38,417
                That's good.    

107
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,819
      I could just dip that     
     in mustard and eat it.     

108
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,086
    And you know it's even going
             to have more flavor

109
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,488
              once it heats up. 

110
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,423
     -We have a brioche bun.    
  -What kind of cheese is that? 

111
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,627
   -A New York white cheddar.   
        -Is it always two       

112
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,495
   or is it just because Damaris
            and I are both here?

113
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:53,298
  It's always two.              

114
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,634
                There you go!   
          Little finishing salt.

115
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:58,437
   Cracked pepper,              
a little bit of hot sauce,      

116
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,173
  a little baby mustard greens. 
         -Look at that.         

117
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,642
          On your mark,         
          get set, go.          

118
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:06,044
           Oh, my God.          

119
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:09,514
            That is straight up,
               legit awesome.   

120
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,182
      It's super flavorful.     

121
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,251
         This is kind of a cross
               between a nice   

122
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,786
               summer sausage   
               and a bologna.   

123
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,388
                 The balance    
              is really great.  

124
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,323
              And the texture's 
         the best part about it.

125
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:19,991
        This is dynamite.       
        -I like the egg.        

126
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,393
        It makes it kind        
       of saucy and messy.      

127
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:22,527
 I don't like eating a sandwich 

128
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:23,862
        that's not going        
      to run down my arms.      

129
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,031
          So especially         
    in the morning, you know.   

130
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:33,271
   It hits all of those salty,  
   savory notes that you want.  

131
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,006
         It's got a nice        
       little kick to it.       

132
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,407
         Bacon, egg and biscuit.

133
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,610
      The food's delicious.     
  The vibe is just so relaxed.  

134
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:43,682

    Next door, they converted

         this patio in the back?

   can't seem to leave, well,   

141
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:53,425
 then they got a place to stay.

    No, it's not.               
  Is it seriously?              

145
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,230
            -Mm-hmm.            
        -It has 3 rooms.

173
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:58,457
        it just takes it

  ground coriander,             

177
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,400
curing salt and give that       
a little bit of a toss.         

178
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,135
                 All right.     
             So what do we have?

179
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,736
       -Some lamb belly...      
            -Got it.            

180
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,005
...and some pork shoulder,      
rough-chopped garlic,           

181
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,741
onions, fresh cilantro          
   and some mint.               

182
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:17,942
             -Mint.             
         -A bunch of it.        

183
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,143
            Do you have a little
             garden in the back?

184
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,478
             -We do.            
      -A whole wall, yeah.      

185
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,013
        It's real pretty.       
       -It's a whole wall?      

186

  [ Beatboxing ]Like a wall, up 
 a wall, with herbs, up a wall. 

187
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,951
             I was just going to
          add the music in edit.

188
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:28,352
              But why not just  
         let Damaris beatbox it?

189
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:29,421
         You're welcome.        

190
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:31,022
      -Now the spice blend.     
         -This is great.        

191
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,491
We add the hot sauce,           
    some harissa.               

192
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,694
And we're going to go           
right into the grinder.         

193
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:38,630
  I love fresh sausage patties. 
    It's one of my favorites.   

194
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:42,167
We cook them in the circulator  
2 hours at 155 degrees.         

195
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:43,635
   So it'll render              
some of the fat out.            

196
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,703
So you got all that great flavor
        left together and now...

197
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,706
 -We're going to make the grits.
         -I love grits.         

198
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,973
            I mean, I make grits
           all the time at home.

199
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,109
So we're gonna start            
out with milk, water.           

200
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,377
     Then we add                
 a pound of butter.             

201
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,111
              -Oh.              
          -Oh, my God.          

202
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,782
     This -- this actually comes
         with a free gym outfit.

203
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:59,451
Then we add the grits.          

204
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,520
   These are going              
to take 15 to 20 minutes.       

205
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:03,321
    And we season               
   with some salt.              

206
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,990
     Then we add hot sauce.     
             -Whew!             

207
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,326
           All this cheese going
            to go in there, too?
Yes.                            

208
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,727
                 Good, man.     
            What kind of cheese?

209
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,062
  Shredded cheddar.             

210
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,131
Then we'll just set that        
on the back burner and...       

211
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,398
      -Fire up the sausage.     
          -Sure thing.          

212
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,334
So once we start to hear        
it sing a little bit,           

213
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:17,669
we'll put a lid on it.          

214
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,272
Want to go straight into        
the oven about 9 minutes.       

215
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,541
    -All right, chef. Grits?    
         -Now we've got         

216
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,609
     a nice sear                
on our lamb sausage.            

217
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,678
 Right in the middle            
    of the bowl.                

218
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,614
        This half is mine       
     and that half is Guy's.    

219
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,950
                 All right.     

220
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,686
             Don't pop that yolk
           in my grits, Damaris.

221
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,154
  Add a little bit              
 of finishing salt,             

222
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,556
cracked black pepper,           

223
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:39,490
    a little bit                
 of chiffonade mint.            

224
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,691
 And the last thing             
  that we put on it             

225
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:44,162
     is a little                
Ras el Hanout spice.            

226
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,097
                   The old      
             'zel Hanout spice. 

227
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,032
             Mm-hmm.            
         It looks great.        

228
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,502
               Before you mess  
                  all up...     

229
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:52,570
         Guy went ahead         
          and got his.          

230
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,574
      The texture on the sausage
                 is spot-on.    

231
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:56,841
 Awesome, thank you.            

232
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,778
         This has that distinct,
      strong flavor of the lamb.

233
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,179
              And that harissa  
               coming through   

234
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:02,380
                  with that     
              little spice kit  

235
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:03,715
                that you make   
              really is great.  

236
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,717
              I don't know what 
            I'm having more fun,

237
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:10,054
   enjoying this and tasting it,
         or watching you suffer.

238
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,256
             I know!            

239
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:13,858
      I'm dying over here.      
      -All right, Damaris.      

240
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,860
            Go ahead.           
      -Woo, thank goodness.     

241
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,330
       Let me get in here.      
       Little bit of that.      

242
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,731
             You already crossed
              the county line.  

243
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,066
             Sorry.             

244
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:23,802
              Woo.              
          Oh, my gosh.          

245
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,537
           That egg is          
      everything on there.      

246
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,004
     The grits are perfect,     
         not too heavy.         

247
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,874
               So you've taken  
             a Southern staple. 

248
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:31,008
      And you've made it grow up
      a little bit, nicely done.

249
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,943
            Thank you very much.

250
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,145
        -I appreciate it.       
        -Good job to you.       

251
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:37,015
          Deep, hearty          
      but not overly rich.      

252
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,082
          It's so good.         

253
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,417
    -Fried bologna sandwich.    
        -Wow, beautiful.        

254
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,154
            Gralehaus           
    is a perfect combination    

255
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,223

           right here           

256
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,558
        on the crossroads       
    of the Midwest and South.

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,027
   FIERI: She does              
  love Louisville.              

258
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,062
And she's like, "Oh,            
you gotta go to Gralehaus."     

259
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,564

        This is getting it done,
                 my friend.     

265
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,642
     ...and a no-meat feast     
      going the extra mile.     

266
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:04,842
               I've seen a lot  
             of veggie patties. 

267
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:05,877

00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:19,457
          [ Laughter ]          

274
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,859
  So I'm here in the NuLu area  
    of Louisville, Kentucky,    

275
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,328
         about 5 minutes        
         from downtown.         

276
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,263
      This is kind of like      
     the new restaurant row.    

277
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,665
          And I'm here          
      to check out a joint      

278
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,932
 where a husband-and-wife team, 

279
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,267
   well, they started in that   
      trailer right there.      

280
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,804
 And now they've got themselves 
    a full-blown restaurant.    

281
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:35,874
Hey, "Triple D" dude.           
Is this Grind Burger?           

282
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:38,376
           Yeah, kid,           
      this is Grind Burger.     

283
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,814
      JESSE: Kombucha pork      
      with fries, order up.     

284
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,349
You can't find burgers like this
  anywhere else in Louisville.  

285
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,086
I have an Asian pork            
sandwich with sprouts.          

286
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,221
        I can experiment        
       and try new things.      

287
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,223
             I see that you got 
               the kale salad.  

288
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,359
     -Liz is a business wiz.    
         -Third ticket.         

289
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,227
   Jesse is a culinary genius.  

290
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,563
  FIERI: And together, Liz and  
Jesse Huot ditched their careers

291
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,832
          and jumped on         
    the food-truck bandwagon.   

292
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,167
    One patty led to another.   

293
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:04,235
     And now they're totally    
        brick and mortar.       

294
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,437
 We crank out a lot             
of burgers here, 1,200.         

295
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,839
            -A week?            
       -Thereabouts, yeah.      

296
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,240
        That's a lot of burgers.

297
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,843
  FIERI: And it goes way beyond 
   just ground beef on a bun.   

298
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,845
  Veggie with fries, order up.  

299
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,514
     I love veggie burgers.     
       And this one, like,      

300
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:19,383
       has blown every one      
        out of the water.       

301
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,652
               Any time I see   
              a veggie burger,  

302
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:23,788
 in memory of my sister, Morgan,
            I, uh, check it out.

303
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,989
           -All right.          
    -Let's see what you got.    

304
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,924
All right. We start with        
 ground cauliflower,            

305
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:30,128
ground Brussels sprouts,        
ground shiitake mushrooms.      

306
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,130
 So it's gluten-free            
   and vegan, too.              

307
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,731
                 Gluten-free    
               and vegan, too!  

308
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,399
Yellow onion, some oil.         

309
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,868
               I've seen a lot  
             of veggie patties. 

310
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,936
              This, right here, 
  is taking it to another level.

311
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,339
Roast this off to pull out      
a lot of the moisture.          

312
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,674
                    Now,        
            on to the spice mix.

313
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:46,144
    Kosher salt,                
smoked paprika, turmeric,       

314
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,146
         ground sage...         
       -Sage it isn't so.       

315
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,016
  Ground coriander,             
   mustard powder,              

316
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,950
    black pepper,               
    curry powder,               

317
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,285
   garlic powder,               

318
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,554
    white pepper,               
    ancho chili.                

319
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,823
           Dude, you are pulling
             out all the stops. 

320
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,358
   All right. Now               
we're ready to mix everything.  

321
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,826
   I'm gonna start              
 with the chickpeas,            

322
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,696
 ground with potato             
   starch, quinoa.              

323
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:06,363
           You're getting mental
              with the lentil.  

324
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,299
   Got our roasted              
      veg mix,                  

325
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:09,767
toasted pumpkin seeds...        

326
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,170
     -Dude, you don't stop.     
           -Sorghum...          

327
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,638
-You've gotta have your sorghum.
  -A little bit of lemon juice. 

328
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,576
Dump in the spice blend,        
  gluten-free oats.             

329
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,645
                    Woo.        

330
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,780
           You can do it, Rocky.

331
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,517
We're gonna patty it            
right up, go around.            

332
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,253
            Binds together nice.
           That's all she wrote.

333
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,654
 And down she goes.             

334
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:32,656
    So we've got                
 our patty fried up.            

335
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:35,860
Gonna add our smoked            
   tomato ketchup               

336
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,862
and dress it like that.         

337
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,064
             Digging everything 
                 about that.    

338
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,332
                     Mm.        

339
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,268
           That doesn't eat like
      any veggie patty I've had,

340
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,969
        such phenomenal texture.

341
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,807
             You've got crunchy.
              You've got nutty. 

342
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,676
             You've got creamy. 

343
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:53,811
            It's seasoned right.
                It's hearty.    

344
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,947
  That roasted vegetable giddyup
              that you played?  

345
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,282
             -Yeah?             
 -Oh, I'm so stealing that one. 

346
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,018
              That's a dynamite 
                veggie patty.   

347
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,154
  I wanted it to be this good.  
       -Veggie with fries.      

348
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:06,023
   It's a really meaty flavor   
  even though there's no meat.  

349
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:06,958
                You eat a lot   
             of veggie burgers? 

350
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,425
  Not a whole lot.              

351
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,161
  -This one rocks, doesn't it?  
   -This one is worth eating.   

352
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,897
   Everybody will get addicted  
    to one particular burger.   

353
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,098
What's your favorite thing      
    on the menu?                

354
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,233
   -This right here, the B&B.   
         -What is on it?        

355
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,367
               Habanero jelly.  
                  Amazing.      

356
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,768
      Southern with fries.      

357
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,238
       The Southern burger      
 has pimiento cheese and bacon. 

358
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,774
         This is my buddy, Cade.
                 How is it?     

359
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,576
     It's good.                 
I love pimiento cheese.         

360
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,977
  Spicy, but good.              

361
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,645
     FIERI: And if a burger     
  doesn't trip your trigger...  

362
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,114
   Cuban with fries, order up.  

363
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,716
     FIERI: ...pork belly on    
  a Havana classic just might.  

364
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,384
        This is amazing.        

365
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,720
    It's better than I've had   
  at actual Cuban restaurants.  

366
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:36,788
         What are we gonna make?

367
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,922
 We're going to cure            
   the pork belly.              

368
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,056
     It'll go on the Cuban.     
           -Let's go.           

369
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,993
    We got sugar,               
   kosher salt...               

370
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,127
          -Chili flake.         
         -Chili flake...        

371
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,395
          White pepper.         
     -White pepper, got it.     

372
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:45,997
  And then we just              
give that a little toss.        

373
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,266
  -Rub that on that pork belly. 
            -Flip it.           

374
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,867
            And this is all just
               the beginning.   

375
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,003
              -Yup.             
       -We've only just...      

376
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,339
           -♪ Begun ♪           
           -Thank you.          

377
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,207
          Set it in the walk-in.
       How long are we gonna go?

378
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,810
It just goes overnight.         
  We've got onion.              

379
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,478
  Pork belly's ready to roast.  
             -Okay.             

380
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,881
350 for about 3 hours.          

381
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:04,348
     Now we got                 
the fermented pickles           

382
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,616
       that go                  
on the Cuban sandwich.          

383
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,553
           -The what?           
           -Fermented.          

384
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:09,820
              -Oh.              
              -Hmm.             

385
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:13,057
                You're making   
     fermented pickles, are you?

386
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,559
              What's the whole  
               fermented part?  

387
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:18,830
Uh, you just have a saltwater   
solution to lacto-ferment.      

388
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:21,031
                    Okay.       
     Let's ferment some pickles.

389
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,967
  Throw about half              
the cucumbers in the jar.       

390
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,302
         Mustard seed...        
         -Mustard seed.         

391
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,637
     -Bay leaf, allspice...     
           -Allspice.           

392
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,172
Turmeric, black pepper,         
    coriander...                

393
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,440
            A bunch of habanero.

394
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:30,975
 Pureed with garlic.            

395
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,777
          -Okay, then.          
        -And grape leaf.        

396
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,178
 And then we're just            
    gonna fill it               

397
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,915
   with saltwater,              
pack the dill on top.           

398
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,649
              And how long are  
            these gonna ferment?

399
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,984
    About 5 days.               

400
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,720
 Pork belly is done.            

401
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:45,122
   We've got some               
nice fat slices here.           

402
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,058
           -Beautiful.          
    -Sear 'em on the flat top   

403
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,327
 until they're nice             
and crispy on each side.        

404
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,928
            -Got it.            
      -Lots of butter down.     

405
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,796
    French bread                
    on the press.               

406
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,733
Honey ham down first,           
    Swiss cheese,               

407
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,268
      fat slabs                 
 of pork belly down.            

408
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,337
           -Fat slabs.          
  -The rest of our Swiss there, 

409
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,940
garlic mayo and standard        
   yellow mustard.              

410
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,275
             Fermented pickles. 

411
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,611
     -Our fermented pickles.    
             -Okay.             

412
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,746
               Lot of work for  
            one sandwich, homes.

413
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:09,947
Now we're going to cover        
   that in butter.              

414
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:14,018
 Press that about 5,            
     6 minutes.                 

415
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,486
  Cut that in half.             

416
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,755
    Serve it with               
our Brussels sprouts.           

417
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:21,826
                   That's       
             a real-deal Cubano.

418
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:23,628
          There's certain things
    that a Cubano has to have --

419
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,163
       the right bread, pressed,

420
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,831
                a good Swiss,   
         proper amount of ham...

421
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,035
     ...and, in most situations,

422
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,970
                 pulled pork    
         and the correct pickle.

423
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,639
    That's the right acid to cut
      through a lot of that fat.

424
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,575
      You are delivering on this
     sandwich in every category.

425
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,711
        That's right at the top.

426
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,512
           All right.           
   I have a Cuban with fries.   

427
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:44,782
     The bread has a crispy,    
         crusty texture.        

428
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,050
      It just goes so well      

429
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,386
   with the pork in the middle  
    that melts in your mouth.   

430
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,653
And then the pickles,           
   they're sorta,               

431
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,121
like, sweet and dill.           

432
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,790
 It's just a great place to be. 

433
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,192
               This is getting  
             it done, my friend.

434
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,260
                Come on down    
           to Grind Burger at...

435
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,062
829 East Market Street,         

436
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,931
      Louisville, Kentucky.     
         -See you here.         

437
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,398
      -See, that was good.      
         -That was good.        

438
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,734
        That was the commercial,
 right there inside of the show.

439
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,268
       -That felt so good.      
         -It -- it did.         

440
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,370
           I felt magic in that.

441
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,341
   FIERI: Up next, a new take   
       on a classic diner       

442
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:11,276
      in Portland, Oregon.      

443
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:12,677
              That's a hot tub  
               of Flavortown.   

444
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,078
       Changing up chicken      
         and waffles...         

445
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,747
That's a contender for the title
             right there, buddy.

446
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:16,681
 ...and doubling down on donuts.

447
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:17,749
  Don't be afraid.              

448
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,657
         So I'm here in         
   downtown Portland, Oregon.   

449
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,726
    You know, on "Triple D,"    
   I think I've seen 'em all,   

450
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,060
      every kind of diner,      

451
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,862
   from the North to the South  
    to the East to the West.    

452
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,864
    But of course, I come all   
   the way out here to Oregon   

453
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,532
    to find a one-of-a-kind.    

454
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,868
  They say they're part diner,  
        part restaurant.        

455
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,938
 This is The Original Dinerant. 

456
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,143
          O.G. Poutine.         

457
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:47,878
   Definitely one of the best   
 diner-esque places in Portland.

458
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,747
Deluxe burger with bacon        
       for ya.                  

459
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,415
          It's amazing.         
          Gravy on food         

460
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,418
     and breakfast all day,     
       that sort of thing.      

461
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,319
    FIERI: Which is a far cry   
        from the 20 years       

462
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,155
 of fine dining Chef A.J. Voytko
      brought to the table      

463
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:01,291
  when he took over the kitchen 
of this hybrid a few years back.

464
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,960
  It's half diner,              
  half restaurant.              

465
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,296
  But we say we're              
rock 'n' roll and tattoos.      

466
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,099
    And he brings that rebel    
   attitude right to the menu.  

467
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,300
    Donut sliders               
   in the window.               

468
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,369
    WOMAN: It is a hamburger    
       inside a hot donut.      

469
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:12,570
        There's a little        
      bit of cheese on it.      

470
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:13,971
        There's frosting        
          on top of it.         

471
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,706
    Sorry, I get so excited.    

472
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,109
            So you're gonna make
        a burger out of a donut.

473
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,443
            -Correct.           
          -Let's do it.         

474
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,045
 We're going to make            
the, uh, donut dough.           

475
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:22,646
We're going to start            
 with some AP flour.            

476
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,982
             -Okay.             
 -Add some sugar, baking powder,

477
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,652
  salt, some milk,              
  four whole eggs.              

478
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,921
 And we have butter.            
  It takes about 5,             

479
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:31,789
  6 minutes to get              
  nice and smooth.              

480
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,057
    Dump it into                
    a container.                

481
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:34,926
And put it in the walk-in       
overnight. Let it rest.         

482
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:37,128
And we're going to roll it      
out to make our donuts.         

483
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,529
                 I'm up here    
         in the land of granola.

484
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,931
         You just start whooping
        out some fried-up donuts

485
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,800
 and making sliders out of them.
        -I love granola.        

486
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:45,403
  But there's only              
so much you can eat.            

487
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:46,804
               Ready to rock.   

488
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,673
  We're gonna grind             
our beef for our patty.         

489
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,608
You have two different meats.   
Little bit of chuck.            

490
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,610
           Little bit of Norris.

491
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,278
  And then brisket              
   gives it that,               

492
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,146
    "Hey, girl,"                
type of thing to the burger.    

493
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,614
             I've never had that
            before in my burger.

494
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:58,883
You know what I'm talking about 
when you bite into a burger     

495
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:01,618
     and you go,                
  "Oh, hey, girl."              

496
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,020
                    Okay.       
                 All right.     

497
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,622
                  I'm out.      

498
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:07,358
  What size patty we giving em? 
      -Two 4-ounce patties.     

499
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,427
   -That's a big plate, dude.   
   -You go big or you go home.  

500
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:12,096
Patties are on the flat         
 top, cheese melted.            

501
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,564
     And we're ready to go.     
            -Hit it.            

502
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,899
 So we're just going            
to split these real quick.      

503
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,702
They get a little bit           
   of mayonnaise,               

504
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,571
the burger slider patty,        

505
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,975
one there, one there.           
    Top 'em off.                

506
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:26,978
And then to finish 'em out,     
the beautiful glaze.            

507
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,213
  And there you go.             
  Don't be afraid.              

508
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,254
         The contrast, the salt,

509
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,656
                the tanginess   
              of that cheddar,  

510
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:39,923
             really nice texture
                of the meat.    

511
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,125
               It's got a nice  
            little crunch to it,

512
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:42,660
                  you know,     
         that little fried crust

513
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:43,928
     that you get on the outside
                 of a donut,    

514
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,864
          like an old-fashioned.
        Gosh, this sounds wrong.

515
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,465
      Then you have a little bit
     of the sweet, not too much.

516
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,601
        You put it all together.

517
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,737
        And you'll say...       
          -"Hey, girl."         

518
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,739
             Have more than two 
              and you'll say... 

519
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,074
    "Hey, girls."               

520
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,542
    Donut sliders               
   in the window.               

521
00:17:58,544 --> 00:17:59,944
              MAN:              
   Donut slider is a surprise.  

522
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,346
    To have it with hamburger   
     and cheese is amazing.     

523
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,215
 This is incredible             
with the sweet and savory.      

524
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:05,283
And it's -- it's good.          

525
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:06,551
   They complement              
each other really well.         

526
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:07,485
The trainer's not going         
 to see this, right?            

527
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,753
                 No, no, no.    

528
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,354
  This is one of my good buddies
            out of the Bay Area.

529
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:14,625
 Festus played for the Warriors'
        championship team, 2015.

530
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,627
                   And now      
          the people of Portland

531
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,662
              get to adopt you  
                as their guy.   

532
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,965
   It's home now.               
  Portland is home.             

533
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:24,502
It's not so much, "Let's just be
  the standard, ordinary city." 

534
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:25,903
           It's weird.          

535
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,437
      MAN: This restaurant      
  really fits in with Portland. 

536
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,040
      The clientele is just     
    as eclectic as the city.    

537
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,643
FIERI: Where they're eating this
 offbeat meat and sweet mash-up.

538
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:33,911
 Chicken and waffles            
   in the window.               

539
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,447
     So chicken and waffles     
    is a staple in Portland.    

540
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,648
  I've had chicken and waffles. 

541
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,916
           But this is          
     a little bit different.    

542
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:42,253
   It has the jalapeño peppers  
      inside of the waffle.     

543
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,587
            Okay. So what are we
             going to make next?

544
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,523
We are gonna do our version     
of chicken and waffles.         

545
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:47,859
We do chicken confit            
and not a fried chicken.        

546
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:49,726
       And it'll make you say...

547
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,196
This one makes you say,         
       "Damn."                  

548
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,597
 So we're gonna take            
  our chicken legs,             

549
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,999
gonna put 'em in a pan          
     skin down,                 

550
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,668
meat up as tight as they can go 
with some kosher salt,          

551
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,071
some garlic on there            
and then fresh thyme.           

552
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:03,274
And then we're gonna take       
the next layer and do it again. 

553
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:05,209
 This is going to go            
  into our walk-in,             

554
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,211
 allowed to marinate            
     for 2 days.                

555
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:08,946
 So now we've pulled            
this out of the walk-in.        

556
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,082
So we're going to pack that     
into the pan skin-side up.      

557
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,150
          Okay. And what are you
         gonna use for your fat?

558
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,419
Chicken fat and then            
extra-virgin olive oil.         

559
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,221
  That's a hot tub of Flavortown
             right there, buddy.

560
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:19,023
We're just going to do          
a quick parchment top.          

561
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,023
Cover it with a plate.          

562
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,627
Put it in a 225 oven,           
    4 1/2 hours.                

563
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:23,961
    Let it cool.                
Pull it out of the fat.         

564
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,497
And then it's gonna go          
straight into the deep-fryer.   

565
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,166
We're gonna make our batter     
  for our waffles.              

566
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,568
Start with some flour,          
sugar, baking powder,           

567
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,705
baking soda, buttermilk,        
six eggs, gonna whisk.          

568
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,040
      Gonna add                 
  a lot of butter.              

569
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,841
  That's what makes             
 waffles delicious.             

570
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,310
   Put it in the,               
     uh, walk-in                

571
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,844
  for about an hour             
to let it sit up and rest.      

572
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,312
                   Set up       
           with that buttermilk?

573
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,915
Load that into our hot iron,    
our fresh, local cheddar.       

574
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,184
                 Diced, raw,    
              fresh jalapeños.  

575
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:51,188
Yeah, they'll give it           
     some kick.                 

576
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,257
         -There you go.         
  -Yeah, the good crispy skin.  

577
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:56,194
     That's chicken chicharrones
                right there.    

578
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,928
             Uh-huh.            
   -We'll finish out the dish,  

579
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,397
house-smoked maple syrup.       

580
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,899
              Of course you do. 

581
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,871
           Confit chicken's just
  flat-out stupid, super tender.

582
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,006
           You've got enough fat
  in there that it stayed moist.

583
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,541
     It's a great waffle batter.

584
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,877
    You've definitely got a nice
  little jalapeño bite in there.

585
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,079
      Little bit of the cheddar.

586
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,680
               The maple syrup  
              kissed the smoke. 

587
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,415
That's a contender for the title
             right there, buddy.

588
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,417
      -Thank you very much.     
       -The chicken skin,       

589
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,486
  a little bit of maple syrup,  
       tastes really good.      

590
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:25,089
 -It is, like, love on a plate. 
     -Oysters in the window.    

591
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,825
    Dinner, lunch, breakfast,   
       best food in town.       

592
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,293
                  You gotta     
               watch out, man.  

593
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:30,695
              You're gonna lose 
      that whole exercise state.

594
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:31,762
           You guys are healthy.

595
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,097
             You're going to get
              run out of town.  

596
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,933
 And you know what they'll say? 
     -"Hey, girl. Hot damn."    

597
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,904
       So was this a great      
       road trip or what?       

598
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,440
      But don't you worry.      

599
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,975
   I've got plenty more joints  
 to find all over this country. 

600
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:48,045
     I'll be looking for you    
 next time on "Diners, Drive-ins

601
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:49,914
           and Dives."          

602
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,515
        -Woo, thank you.        
             -Ha-ha!            

603
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:53,250
       Beat ya, didn't I?       
            -You did.           

604
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,251
                There you go.   

605
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,386
             You were down there
               for the catch.   

606
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:56,386
       -Behind your back.       
    -But I shortstopped that.   

607
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,355
             -Yeah.             
     -Then go for the throw.
