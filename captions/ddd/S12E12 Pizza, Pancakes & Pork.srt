            SALT, BAKING POWDER,

318
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,467
                   THEN SUGAR...
(normal voice)                  
    OKAY.                       

319
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,870
            AND THEN WE'RE GONNA
                  START IT.     

320
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,939
             FLOUR--MIX THAT UP.

321
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,941
ALL RIGHT, YOU JUST WANT        
   TO MIX THIS ENOUGH           

322
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,943
TO INCORPORATE IT...            
              BUT NOT OVERDO IT.

323
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,678
   SO WE DO WANT                
SOME LUMPS IN THIS.             

324
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,214

              AND YOU'RE DONE.  
            THE BATTER IS READY.

326
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,620
      THIS MEANS YOU'RE SERIOUS.

00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,955

                 5-PLUNGER?

  A GENEROUS PORTION.           

329
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,093
               DON'T LOSE TRACK.
                  THAT'S FOUR.  

330
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,829
AAH.                            
                            AAH.

        WAITIN' FOR THE BUBBLES?
WAITIN' FOR THE BUBBLES.        

333

                    SUPER-DUPER.

00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,645
             HOW'D YOU COME UP  
           WITH THE NAME CITRUS?

339
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:30,314
   IT'S LIKE YOU WAKE UP        
AND YOU WANT SOMETHING FRESH    

340
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,783

341
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:34,252

         NOT FRESH AND INVITING.

343
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:39,390
AND THEN PLATE--PINEAPPLE       
RIGHT HERE IN THE CENTER,       

344
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,858
BANANA.                         
                IT'S A SUNSHINE.

345
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,393
THAT'S LIKE A SUNSHINE.         

346
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,128
WE'RE GONNA TOP IT              
 WITH THIS GLAZE.               

347
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,197
THIS IS WHAT MAKES IT           
      SO GOOD.                  
                     (whistles) 

348
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,199

352
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,072
               AND SOME CITRUS--

YOU'LL BE THINKIN' ABOUT US     
     ALL THE TIME NOW.          

354
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,278
      THE GLAZE IS DYNAMITE,    
  BUT AS SOON AS YOU INCORPORATE

355
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,614
                  THE BANANA    
             AND THE PINEAPPLE--

356
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,748
   YOU FOOL YOURSELF THAT YOU'RE
     HAVING SOMETHING HEALTHY,  

357
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,218
           BUT ACTUALLY, THAT IS
               HALF A BANANA.   
IT IS HALF HEALTHY.             

358
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,088
        YOU GET A LITTLE KISS   
     OF THE CINNAMON AND NUTMEG.
YEAH.                           

359

 OF THE THINGS THAT I COME FOR. 

372
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,314
               WHAT ARE WE INTO?
   WE'RE MAKIN'                 
FRESH HOLLANDAISE.              

373
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,049
FIRST WITH OUR EGG YOLKS,       
      LEMON JUICE,              

374
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,984
HOT SAUCE, SALT,                

375

377
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,456
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HELP ME    
POUR IN THIS BUTTER AND MILK.   

378
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,458
   I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA EVEN 
  PARTICIPATE. THIS IS YOUR GIG.
YEAH.                           

379
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,193
          THROW THE SUPERCHARGER
            ON THAT THING, MAN. 

380
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,662
              OKAY, TAP OUT. GO.

381
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:53,198
                     HERE WE GO.
(as Arnold Schwarzenegger)      
YAH, YOU CAN HEAR IT NOW.       

382
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,932
     IT'S LIKE                  
A MOTORBOAT ENGINE.             

383
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,802
NOW ON LOW HEAT.                
      (normal voice) OKAY, SO WE
      EMULSIFIED ALL THE BUTTER,

384
00:13:57,804 --> 00:14:00,471
AND THE KEY IS, WE STIR         
FOR ABOUT 15, 20 MINUTES        

385
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,340
    TO GET THIS                 
TO THICKEN UP ON US.            

386
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,808
         WITHOUT COOKIN' INTO...
RIGHT.                          

387
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,543
                A BIG, OLD NASTY
                 BATCH OF EGGS. 
YEP.                            

388
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,378
    ALL RIGHT, WELL, HAVE A GOOD
    TIME. I'LL SEE YOU IN A BIT.

389
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,946
           HOLLANDAISE IS READY.
YES, SIR.                       

390
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,949
     NOW WE'RE MAKIN' THE BATTER
         FOR THE SOFT-SHELL.    

391
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:14,018
WE'RE GONNA START OFF WITH      
 FLOUR, PEPPER, GARLIC...       

392
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,020
                LAWRY SEASONING.

393
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,356
OUR SEAFOOD SEASONING,          
     BAKING SODA.               

394
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,224
THESE ARE FRESH CRABS           
OUT OF SOUTH CAROLINA.          

395
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,627
THEY'RE REAL BIG AND THEY'RE    
     FILLED WITH MEAT.          

396
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:23,794
THESE ARE WHALES.               

397
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,630
I BATTER THE CRAB FIRST.        

398
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:28,299
       SO A SOFT-SHELL IS A CRAB
        THAT'S MOLTED ITS SHELL.

399
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,167
  WE DREDGE IT                  
IN OUR EGG WASH--               

400
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,836
                AND THEN BACK IN
                 ONE MORE TIME. 

401
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,771
 AND THE WHOLE KEY WHEN         
YOU LAY IT IN THIS FRYER        

402
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,706
 IS TO JUST GET THOSE LEGS      
SPREAD, AND THAT GETS THAT--    

403
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,308
         SO IT DOESN'T CLUMP UP.
RIGHT.                          

404
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,712
THEN YOU CAN SEE IT'S GETTIN'   
READY TO POP, SO BE CAREFUL.    

405
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,782
THESE CRABS POP 'CAUSE THERE'S  
   WATER INSIDE THIS CRAB.      
                          RIGHT.

406
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,850
             REALLY GET THE POP.

407
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,986
   SO THIS ISN'T JUST A BUSINESS
        TO YOU. THIS IS A--     

408
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,988
I LOVE IT.                      
      THIS IS A WAY OF LIFE. OH!

409
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,858
OHH, SEE?                       
               NICE. GIMME      
        A LITTLE REPLAY ON THAT.

410
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,793
      <i> (distorted voices)</i>       

411
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,662
           OH, DID YOU SEE THAT?
BE CAREFUL.                     

412
00:14:57,664 --> 00:15:00,064
              RIGHT TO THE NECK.
WHOO!                           

413
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,734
  AND THAT SOFT-SHELL           
ONLY TAKES FIVE MINUTES.        

414
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,868
        LOOK AT THAT. BEAUTIFUL.
          YOU BETTER HURRY UP,  

415
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,205
          BEFORE I EAT ALL THIS.
      YEAH, I'M GONNA           
POACH THESE EGGS REAL QUICK.    

416
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,940
  I'M GONNA GET                 
MY SAUTéED SPINACH              

417
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,808
AND PUT OUR TOMATOES            
    ON THE GRILL                

418
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,210
FOR JUST A SPLIT SECOND.        

419
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:14,679

522
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,062
    220, 221,                   
WHATEVER IT TAKES.              

523
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,999
(imitating lightsaber)          

524
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:58,202
THIS IS REALLY WHERE WE'RE GONNA
SEPARATE THE MEN FROM THE BOYS. 

525
00:18:58,204 --> 00:18:59,604
I LIKE THE METHOD               
     SO FAR,                    

526
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,471
BUILDIN' THE EDGE.              
                      (laughing)

527
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,807
THAT'S IT.                      
                      THAT'S IT.

528
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,942
CHEESE, AND WE'RE GONNA         
   PUT SAUCE ON TOP.            

529
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,944
         WE'RE TRYIN' TO KEEP   
     THAT CRUST NICE AND CRISPY,

530
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,813
     SO PUTTIN' THE SAUCE ON TOP
         KEEPS THE TEXTURE--    

531
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,948
AND A LITTLE GOUDA.             
                   SMOKED GOUDA.

532
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,284
          FRESH CUBED MOZZARELLA
             OVER TOP OF THAT.  

533
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:14,885
                 ROASTED GARLIC,
                 CHERRY PEPPERS,

534
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,954
    AND WE'RE GONNA FINISH WITH 
  THE TURKEY WE BRAISED EARLIER.

535
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,956
THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE...         
          THAT IS ALL SHE WROTE.

536
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,825
  AND WHAT TEMPERATURE          
YOU RUNNIN' THAT OVEN AT?       
          THIS OVEN'S GOIN' 670.

537
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,827
I'VE GOT BRICK LINING THE TOP,  
    THE BOTTOM, THE SIDES.      

538
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,495
    THERE'S ALL KINDS           
OF THERMAL MASS IN THERE.       

539
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,796
THIS DOES NOT GET COLD.         

540
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,765
 I CAN OPEN AND CLOSE           
THIS OVEN ALL DAY LONG.         

541
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,167
    NOT SOMETHING YOU HEAR EVERY
   DAY, BUT TODAY ON TRIPLE "D,"

542
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,903
            YOU'VE LEARNED ABOUT
                THERMAL MASS.   

543
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:33,838
    <i> WITH THAT KIND OF HEAT,</i>    

544
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
         <i> THE PIE BAKES</i>         
     <i> FOR ABOUT SIX MINUTES</i>     

545
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,375
      <i> WITH A SPIN MIDWAY</i>       

546
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,510
<i> FOR AN EVEN COOK ON THE CRUST.</i> 

547
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,847
                   LOOK AT THAT.

548
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,884
ENOUGH OF THE TOMFOOLERY.       
        SET UP AND READY TO EAT.

549
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,855
    THAT--LET ME TRY            
TO EXPLAIN THINGS TO YOU        

550
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,657
AS I SHOVE MY FACE WITH IT,     

551
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,725
'CAUSE YOU CAN TELL             
 I DON'T LIKE IT.               

552
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,527
IT'S DEFINITELY LIGHT           
     AND CRISPY.                

553
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,129
A CROSS BETWEEN PROBABLY        

554
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:00,064
   AN AMERICAN STYLE            
AND A NEAPOLITAN STYLE.         

555
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,933
MMM.                            

556
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:03,934
I GIVE YOU AN "A"               
IN THE DOUGH, MAN.              

557
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,003
A NICE BLEND BETWEEN            
 CHEESE AND SAUCE,              

558
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,005
A LITTLE BIT OF SPICE           

559
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,874
  FROM THE VINEGAR              
OF THE SWEET PEPPERS,           

560
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,275
CREAMINESS OF THE GARLIC.       

561
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:14,078
YOU GOTTA TRY THIS.             

562
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,746
         (man) IT'S NOT         
      THANKSGIVING TURKEY       

563
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,615
      THAT SOMEONE CARVED       
        FROM THE TABLE.         

564
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,350
          IT'S SMOKY.           
   IT'S ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS,   

565
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:22,219
  AND IT PAIRS EXCELLENT WITH   
THOSE PEPPERS THAT ARE ON THERE.

566
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,821
      (Dave) LARGE SUPINO       
        READY TO GO OUT.        

567
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:26,089
 (woman) DAVE IS AN ABSOLUTELY  
         FEARLESS CHEF          

568
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,692
 WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING PIZZA. 

569
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,560
    I DON'T HAVE A FAVORITE.    
     I NEVER ORDER A PIZZA.     

570
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,896
 I ALWAYS COME IN HERE AND SAY, 
      "DAVE, SURPRISE ME."      

571
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,765
DO YOU THINK THIS IS SOME       
OF THE BEST PIZZA IN TOWN?      
       IT'S DEFINITELY          
   THE BEST PIZZA IN TOWN.      

572
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,900
  (Dave) I REALLY WANTED TO MAKE
  SURE IT WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL,

573
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,570
         SOMETHING TO SET ITSELF
           APART A LITTLE BIT.  
YOU GOTTA COME DOWN HERE        
  AND TRY THIS PIZZA.           

574
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,438
WELL DONE, BROTHER.             
 REALLY WELL DONE.              
                         THANKS.

575
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,708
