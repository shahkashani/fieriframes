00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,201
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,669
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:07,139
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:08,073
          This trip...          

5
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,341
     Holy moly!                 

6
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,410
  ...we're rocking the retro... 

7
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:12,477
         Why this works,        
         I do not know.         

8
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:15,680
    ...at some off-the-hook,    
       old-school joints.       

9
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,349
            This is Crazytown --
            next to Flavortown. 

10
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,550
     In Delta, Wisconsin...     

11
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:20,352
                  Houston,      
             we have a problem. 

12
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,687
         ...a righteous,        
       real-deal diner...       

13
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,288
    Probably in the top three   

14
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,290
   best pancakes I've ever had  
         on "Triple D."         

15
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:28,293
          ...smack-dab          
    in the middle of nowhere.   

16
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,294
              I'm freaked out!  

17
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,764
     In Duluth, Minnesota...    
                    Whoa.       

18
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,365
           ...a legit           
    Italian family market...    

19
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,367
 Dude, you can work             
     some dough.                

20
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,302
     ...that's not skimping     
         on the staples.        

21
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,304
   Noodle, noodle,              
noodle, noodle, noodle,         

22
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:40,438
cheese, cheese, cheese,         
cheese, cheese, cheese,         

23
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,306
  meat, meat, meat,             
  meat, meat, meat.             

24
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:43,175
    And in Eugene, Oregon...    

25
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:44,243
        Here you go, "Triple D."

26
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:45,844
     ...a throwback café...     

27
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:46,978
           Let me see the magic.

28
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,249
     ...serving up a killer     
       comfort curve ball.      

29
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:51,517
         You could have named it
               "Funkalicious."  

30
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:53,585
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

31
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:56,454
     on "Diners, Drive-Ins,     
           and Dives."          

34
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,402
   I have had so many buddies   
            tell me,            

35
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,071
 "Guido, I have got the perfect 
    'Triple D' join for you.    

36
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,607
   I mean, I used to go there   
   when I was in high school."  

37
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,843
      "My cousin owns it."      
   "It's got the best burger."  

38
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,344
I mean, the list goes on and on,

39
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:22,147
   but to be honest with you,   
maybe 1 in 1,000 of those stick.

40
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,283
          Now, I'm here         
      in Delta, Wisconsin.      

41
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:26,051
      Don't trust your GPS      
   when you come to this place  

42
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:27,619
    because I even got lost.    

43
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:28,954
 It is in the middle of nowhere.

44
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:29,955
        But don't worry.        

45
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:32,424
           This comes           
   with a great recommendation  

46
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,026
  from a very reliable source,  
         and that's me,         

47
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,294
  'cause I was here a year ago, 

48
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,763
      and I knew I'd bring      
        "Triple D" back.        

49
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,665
      This is Delta Diner.      

50
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:43,434
        BUCHER: Order up.       

51
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,703
         I love it here.        
      It's our food church.     

52
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,305
         They built it,         
     and people are coming.     

53
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,307
   There is nothing for miles,  

54
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,109
   and then all of a sudden --  
              boom!             

55
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,844
   It's kind of like a mirage   
            in a way,           

56
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,045
  a red, white, and blue beacon 

57
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,381
       here in the middle       
   of the Chequamegon Forest.   

58
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,917
    The first thing that came   
     to mind is, "Why here?"    

59
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:01,520
     FIERI: A question only     
 founder Todd Bucher can answer.

60
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,255
          [ Laughter ]          

61
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:05,056
We moved up here. Not really    
sure what we were gonna do.     

62
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,858
    We understood               
the passion of diners,          

63
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,793
and we got this inkling         
to put a diner here.            

64
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,730
    He discovered this piece    
  of the past back east in '03, 

65
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:15,200
then had it restored and shipped
   out here to the Northwoods.  

66
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,069
       Here's the pig and pepper
                   omelet.      

67
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:20,271
      The menu is eclectic,     
      whatever that means.      

68
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,141
  We've got a red-eye gravy up. 

69
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:23,675
     It's a rich, dark gravy    

70
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,078
         that they serve        
     on buttermilk biscuits.    

71
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,346
       You taste a little       
    of the coffee, the meat,    

72
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,614
     a little bit of spice.     

73
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:33,552
     I dream of it, really.     
    It's heavenly, you know?    

74
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:34,886
            I am a red-eye gravy
                 aficionado.    

75
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,288
                  I was in      
         the red-eye gravy navy.

76
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,757
          This is red-eye gravy 
     on biscuits with prime rib?
        Yep.                    

77
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,024
                    Wow.        
        Yeah.                   

78
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,693
            That's gravy, baby. 
   All right, let's hit it, man.

79
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,028
   We're gonna do               
  prime rib first.              

80
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,963
It's got a great little rub     
  that goes on it.              

81
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:46,564
     Olive oil.

 Lebanese Breeze --             
pure whipped garlic.            
                   Oh-ho!       

83
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,037
  Got black pepper.             
 Some nice rosemary.            

84
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,906
And we're just gonna            
whip this together.             
                    Okay.       

85
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,375
Just gonna kosher salt,         
rub it in a little bit.         

86
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,444
  This -- can't put             
too much of this on there.      

87
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,512
         Now we're gonna tie it?
  Ah, give me four.

90
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,985
           So, you're doing that
                 so you keep    

91
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:09,120
        the tail of that rib eye
              from drying out.  

92
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,321
     Absolutely.

 Gonna let it rest.

       Honey.                   

119
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,035
      We've got                 
some condensed milk.            

120
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,437
              I'm freaked out.  

121
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,172
And we got some cream.          

122
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,374
   Chicken broth.               

123
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:03,841
     Pork broth.                
               This is crazy.   

124
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,710
            I'm actually scared.

125
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,379
   Let her simmer.              

126
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:11,383
Gonna turn into this just rich, 
wonderful, dark gravy.          

127
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,384
              In the meantime,  
           we make the biscuits?

128
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:13,585
        Yes.                    

129
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,255
So, we got all-purpose flour,   
  cake flour, salt.             

130
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,256
   Baking powder.               
                  Baking powder.

131
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,391
    Baking soda.                

132
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:20,459
And we're just gonna            
    mix that up.                

133
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:24,930
          Cubed, chilled butter.
                   Got it.      

134
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:25,864
   Chilled butter.              

135
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,137
     Buttermilk.                

136
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,672
   The key to this              
 is just fold it in.            

137
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,140
    We don't want               
to work this too much.          

138
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,341
Plop her in the middle.         

139
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,542
                That's barely   
              holding together. 

140
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,010
We're just gonna form it        
    into a round.               

141
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,612
                 That's it?     
     That's it.                 

142
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,348
                 You cut it     
           before you put it on?
       Mm-hmm.                  

143
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,884
                 That's how     
              she's gonna bake? 
   Just like that.              

144
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,553
350, about 13 minutes.          

145
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:49,754
             Last but not least?

146
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,424
   We're gonna add              
some of the hot gravy to a roux.

147
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,960
 It's almost solid.             
You throw the warm stuff on it. 

148
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,696
     Mix her up.                
Get the whisk to it.            

149
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,130
Turns to a nice slurry.         

150
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,965
 All right, back in.            

151
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,301
                [ Whistles ]    

152
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:05,437
So, now this is just gonna      
thicken up a little bit.        

153
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,572
     This is one of the funkiest
               red-eye gravies  

154
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,841
              we have ever seen 
   in the history of "Triple D."

155
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,976
            Here's our biscuits.

156
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,112
             I think to do this 
               the right way,   

157
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,247
     I'm gonna try to load it up
         with all of the bacon, 

158
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,016
                the sausage,    
             and the prime rib. 

159
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:23,121
                    Mmm!        
      Juicy meat, great texture,

160
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,323
            little bit of salt, 
        little bit of sweetness,

161
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,459
            really nice biscuit.

162
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,662
            Super coffee flavor.
 Coffee leads here.             

163
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,331
            This is Crazytown --
            next to Flavortown. 

164
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,866
                     Mm.        

165
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,469
           The more you eat it, 
       the more it grows on you.

166
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:38,203
        Yeah.                   
                     Mm!        

167
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,074
         The beef in it         
       is just to die for.      

168
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,277
 I don't even like coffee, but I
 really love the espresso in it.

169
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,046
   And the biscuits are light   
   and fluffy and fantastic.    

170
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,349
    This is the kind of place   
       that you root for.       

171
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,618
     This is the experience     
        you have to have.       

172
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,622
    If you think this is unique 
and interesting and adventurous,

173
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,691
        wait till you try the...

174
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,626
 Jalapeño hot cakes.            

175
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,895
         You're gonna love them.

176
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,097
             FIERI:             
    That's when we come back.   

177
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,872
          Welcome back,         
 "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives" 

178
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,740
      in Delta, Wisconsin,      

179
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:19,210
    and let me introduce you    
  to the wild, wild west family 

180
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,478
        of the Liautauds.       

181
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,881
     That would be my buddy,    
      Jimmy John Liautaud.      

182
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,617
    That's right -- the dude    
  from Jimmy John's Sandwiches. 

183
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,886
   So, we're hanging out here   
       at the Delta Diner,      

184
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,088
    a place that I discovered   
     with this crazy family     

185
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,424
 a year ago, and now "Triple D" 
        is finally here.        

186
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:33,892
        This is Big Jim.        

187
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,560
           Now, did you find it,
           or did Jimmy find it?

188
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,562
I think I found it.             
         You think you found it?
                    Okay.       

189
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:41,232
           We had some fantastic
             red-eye gravy made 

190
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,633
        with more coffee grounds

191
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,770
         than should ever be put
               into any dish.   

192
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:45,837
             It was outstanding,

193
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,073
              and it just gets  
              crazy from here.  

194
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,110
        Pancakes with jalapeños.

195
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,112
        It sounds crazy,        
      but they're awesome.      

196
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:57,983
             FIERI:             
   Yep, you heard it right --   
       jalapeño hot cakes.      

197
00:06:57,985 --> 00:06:59,384
                 Outrageous.    
         So, let's get it going.

198
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:00,852
         We'll start out        
          with the dry.         

199
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:03,721
       All-purpose flour.       

200
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,056
             Sugar.             

201
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,258
         Baking powder.         

202
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,727
    A little bit of cinnamon    
            and salt.           

203
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,595
           All right,           
     just mix this together.    

204
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,396
          Set it aside.         

205
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,197
              Eggs.             

206
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,866
            That's a lot of egg,
                    baby.       

207
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:15,667
          Mix those up.         

208
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,269
Jimmy, can you pour the vanilla?

209
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,804
            Are you helping now?

210
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:21,539
I'm helping.                    
           All right!           

211
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,741
            This is really nice.

212
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,009
              Milk.             

213
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:26,077
            Want me to stir this
                  for you?      
              Yeah.             

214
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,946
               Come on, Jimmy.  
           You know how to cook.

215
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,213
     All right.                 
                There we go.    

216
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,415
      Just keep her going.      

217
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,083
           Jimmy and his family 
    have this great little cabin

218
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,551
        that we go to ever year.

219
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,020
         And we were hanging out
                  one day,      

220
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:37,288
     and Jimmy says, "I'm gonna 
  take you to this great diner."

221
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,890
                 Then I have    
         this Norwegian pancake,

222
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,424
      so I knew that we would be
              coming back here. 

223
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,960
         Melted butter.         

224
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,695
              A lot of butter,  

225
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:46,297
and this makes what I would call
       a not very thick batter. 

226
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,498
               No.              
       It's gonna be thin.      

227
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,170
     It goes in a container,    
       goes in the fridge.      

228
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,905
             We've had a chance 
 for the pancake batter to rest.

229
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,173
               Onto the griddle?
     This is it.                

230
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,541
    Let's see it.               
                 All right.     

231
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,514
Now you're gonna throw on       
chopped pickled jalapeño.       

232
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,648
                    Yep.        

233
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,851
This does not look like         
it should work at all.          

234
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,853
                Now you smell   
                the jalapeños   

235
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,089
         starting to caramelize 
      a little bit on the grill.

236
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:16,528
           We're gonna sprinkle 
       the powdered sugar on it.

237
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,862
    All right, so, everybody,   
       here's what you do.      

238
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:18,930
        Grab that lemon.        

239
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,665
        Squeeze it around       
         on top of that.        

240
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,467
         Why this works,        
         I do not know.         

241
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:23,435
                      [ Laughs ]

242
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,540
   I don't say it very often,   

243
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,076
      but this is probably      
        in the top three        

244
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:33,678
   best pancakes I've ever had  
         on "Triple D,"         

245
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,747
        if not the best.        

246
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,083
    It's tender. It's light.    
           It's thin.           

247
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:41,219
     Kind of think about it     
     like a crepe gone wild.    

248
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,154
  And it is sweet.              
That's a sweet batter.          

249
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,689
 It's nice and eggy.            

250
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,558
And the lemon and the sugar     
just cut the hot perfectly.     

251
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,026
   It's an amazing              
    combination.                

252
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,428
        Leslie Liautaud,        
       what do you think?       

253
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,364
The jalapeño is not hot.        
    It's savory.                

254
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,234
so you get a perfect            
savory and sweet mixture.       

255
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:01,172
        MAN: I get caught       
   between texture and flavor.  

256
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:02,773
       They're both vying       
     for all your attention.    

257
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,576
     YOUNG MAN:                 
It's really just amazing.       

258
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,777
 I didn't expect it             
 to be this great.              

259
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,914
  It's worth a special journey  
          to get here.          

260
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,117
       So, there you are,       
     in the real-deal diner     

261
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,652
    in the middle of nowhere.   

262
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:14,386
             <i> Adios!</i>            

263
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,923
           Coming up,           
     in Duluth, Minnesota...    

264
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,058
That is thick and dense.        

265
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,594
        ...a doing-it-all       
         Italian spot...        

266
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:23,461
    All day long.               

267
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,863
 ...serving it up family-style. 

268
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,331
              So, it's full-on  
               "Brady Bunch."   

269
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,773
 FIERI: If you've been watching 
     "Triple D" for a while,    

270
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,774
     you know I'm a huge fan    
       of Italian markets.      

271
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,243
             I mean,            
    I don't know what it is.    

272
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,443
     Maybe it's my heritage.    

273
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,112
       Maybe it's the fact      
       that you can go in,      

274
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,781
     it's part grocery store    
          and part deli         

275
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:45,517
 and you can get a little snack 
 or a little Italian specialty. 

276
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,785
I mean, the list goes on and on.

277
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:49,053
         So, I'm here in        
 the Spirit Valley neighborhood 

278
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,322
        right outside of        
       Duluth, Minnesota,       

279
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,325
   to check out a joint where   
a family is doing that and more.

280
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,560
             This is            
   Gannucci's Italian Market.   

281
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,933
          Chicken Parm          
    and a porchetta, table 6.   

282
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,536
  Everything is homemade here.  

283
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:06,270
          Meatball sub          
         and muffaletta.        

284
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,138
                 Thank you.     

285
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,539
       It's family-owned.       

286
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,141
     It's been in the family    
          for a while.          

287
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,143
             FIERI:             
    That would be since 1978,   

288
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,212
  and the guy running the ship  
           since 2011           

289
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,614
        is owner and chef       
        Billy Kalligher.        

290
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,017
So, now, your family works here?
  Your kids work here, as well? 

291
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,685
Yep, my wife, my son,           
 my daughters, yep.             

292
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,220
             How many daughters 
                do you have?    

293
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,688
        Six.                    
                    What?       

294
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,522
        Yeah.                   

295
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,157
                 And a son?     
       Three.                   

296
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,359
                 Whoa. Whoa.    

297
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,694
   It just makes you feel like  
         you're at home.        

298
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,896
   Got a lasagna for table 4.   

299
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,965
    This lasagna ranks as one   
 of the best that I've ever had.

300
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,967
      Lots of good layers,      
          good cheese.          

301
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,104
               All right, so,   
   what are we gonna make first?

302
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:40,872
Make Italian sausage            
    for lasagna.                

303
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,707
       Let's get after it, then.
     All right.                 

304
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,442
 I have a pork butt.            
  Cut up in pieces.             

305
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,310
And I'm gonna feed it           
through the grinder,            

306
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,912
     grind away.                

307
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:52,183
    Now I'm ready               
  to season it up.              

308
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,718
        In goes the ground pork.

309
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,056
             I add water, salt, 
 granulated garlic, fennel seed.

310
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,323
    Black pepper.               

311
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,726
     And some ground anise seed.

312
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:04,062
      How long                  
will you cook this down?        
          Just until it's brown.

313
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,064
   Smells awesome.              

314
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,065
What are we up to now?          

315
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,399
                   Pasta.       
     Beautiful.                 

316
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,201
              The dough's ready 
              to be rolled out. 
    Here we go.                 

317
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,736
            A little flour down.

318
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:12,804
                Roll it out.    

319
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,409
 Dude, you can work             
     some dough.                

320
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:19,143
                 Cut it up.     

321
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,613
      Now we're gonna boil these
          for about 30 seconds. 

322
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:24,616
        Okay, once they're done,
            in some cold water. 

323
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:26,417
Not completely cooked,          
       though.                  

324
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,619
                    Nope.       

325
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,620
 Okay, now I'm going to assemble
                 my lasagna.    

326
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,889
    First our homemade marinara.

327
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:32,957
                 Noodles in.    

328
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,961
                More marinara   
               on top of that.  

329
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,964
          Then I'm going to put 
        my Italian sausage down.

330
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,500
    That is great               
  Italian sausage.              
                 Thank you.     

331
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:45,036
        Top it with some cheese 
   and then build another layer.

332
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,704
     More sauce.                
                 More sauce.    

333
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,905
         Some good Romano on it,

334
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,175
                more sausage,   
and this will be the last layer.

335
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:51,575
    Three layers?               
                Three layers.   

336
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,511
And we're gonna cook this off   
in the oven. What temp?         

337
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,981
About 275, 300, just to bring it
up the temp and melt the cheese.

338
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,717
   That's gonna be              
 out in 45 minutes?             
                    Yep.        

339
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,854
        Wow.                    

340
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,589
That is thick and dense.        

341
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,726
      Low-cal.                  

342
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,161
              Low-cal lasagna.  

343
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,467
   What I like is,              
    it's simple,                

344
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:19,337
it's completely balanced,       
  little saltiness              

345
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:22,006
from that Romano cheese.        

346
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,141
 The kind of lasagna            
  I wanted as a kid             

347
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,544
was noodle, noodle, noodle,     
   noodle, noodle,              

348
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,012
cheese, cheese, cheese,         
cheese, cheese, cheese,         

349
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:29,079
  meat, meat, meat,             
  meat, meat, meat.             

350
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,348
That's what that is.            
                 All right.     

351
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,751
But the ground sausage          
really is the foundation of it. 

352
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,354
   I could eat it               
   all day long.                

353
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,422
                 Good deal.     

354
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,623
    All day long.               

355
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,158
    Outstanding.                
     Delicious.                 

356
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,026
           KALLIGHER:           
Your two lasagnas are up, kiddo.

357
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:45,096
     The pasta's very fresh.    
    It has a perfect texture.   

358
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,564
         It's not tough.        
         It's not chewy.        

359
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:47,965
   My grandfather used to make  
        Italian sausage,        

360
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,633
          and it tastes         
       very much like his.      

361
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,235
  Oh, I definitely get cravings 
            for this.           

362
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,037
     I mean, this is funky.     
        Yeah.                   

363
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,505
   You are right in the middle  
          of a market.          

364
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,440
It's a little like stepping back
into like Little Italy          

365
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,642
or something like that.         

366
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:00,511
   And part of that old-school  
    feeling is the deli load    

367
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,580
          of sandwiches         
    they're making up fresh,    

368
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:06,784
  including an Italian take on  
 a monster New Orleans classic. 

369
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,119
     KALLIGHER: Okay, we got    
      the muffaletta ready.     

370
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:08,853
         It's delicious.        

371
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,321
          It has layers         

372
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,123
       of different types       
       of Italian cheeses.      

373
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,525
             WOMAN:             
       The bread is sweet.      

374
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:16,127
 It contrasts with the spiciness
     of the meats on there.     

375
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,596
  I have to have that at least  
     once a week when I can.    

376
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:20,731
What are making?                
               The muffaletta.  

377
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,799
               Tapenade time.   

378
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,667
     All right.                 

379
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:23,802
              Got black olives. 

380
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,270
              The green olives. 

381
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:26,470
            Roasted red peppers,

382
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,338
                  Kalamata.     

383
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,006
      Capers.                   
                Capers, baby.   

384
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,142
        And then some olive oil.

385
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,076
    Black pepper.               

386
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:32,944
                Black pepper.   

387
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,879
                  Oregano.      

388
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,814
         And the best -- garlic.

389
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:41,185
 Mix this up, let it            
kind of marry together.         
                  You bet.      

390
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,488
     Now we put                 
the muffaletta together.        
                 You betcha.    

391
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,322
       Okay, we got our homemade
               focaccia bread.  

392
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,892
                    Cut.        

393
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,296
             Now we get the oil.

394
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:54,065
           First I'm gonna start
           with the mozzarella. 

395
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,569
                 Now a layer    
              of Genoa salami.  

396
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,971
                Next we'll go   
              to the provolone. 

397
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:02,106
You ever think about putting    
some cheese on this?            

398
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,374
                 [ Laughs ]     

399
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:07,312
         Little bit of capocollo
                   on top.      

400
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:08,579
     Holy moly!                 

401
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:09,513
                [ Chuckles ]    

402
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:13,251
       And now for the tapenade.

403
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,386
              On goes the top.  

404
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,392
            This is our homemade
               dipping sauce.   

405
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,327
                Got vinegars    
              and pepper juice, 

406
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,129
             and that makes it. 

407
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,867
     If you love                
 Italian cold cuts,             

408
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,737
if you love brininess and salty,
this is your sandwich.          

409
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,173
The richness and all these      
different components.           

410
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,410
And the dipping sauce           
 is righteous, man.             

411
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,012
        Yeah, that's good stuff.

412
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,414
This is how you make it.        
This is the Gannucci way.       

413
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,816
    Outstanding.                
                 All right.     

414
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:46,217
             WOMAN:             
     Here's your muffaletta.    
Thank you.                      

415
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,020
    WOMAN: The olives on the    
 muffaletta sandwich are great. 

416
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,154
  The more olives, the better.  

417
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,956
             It's a big portion.
It is a big portion,            

418
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,958
but the best part is,           
you can take some home.         

419
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,827
             WOMAN:             
 I love walking into this place.

420
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:58,229
 It's just -- kind of feel like 
     home when I come here.     

421
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,764
And here's the deal --          
In a mom-and-pop joint,         

422
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,832
it's all that energy            
  and all that love             

423
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,836
and family participation        
that really makes it so great.  

424
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:05,903
           I believe it. Thanks.

425
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,205
   Great job, man.              
     Great job.                 

426
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:12,243
  FIERI: Up next, a unique stop 
      in Eugene, Oregon...      

427
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,445
                 That's awesome.
  ...making outrageous eats...  

428
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,380
                 Very impressed.
        ...without meat.        

429
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,616
       I would challenge anybody
       to try that and tell me  
       that they don't dig it.  

430
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,859
     So, "Triple D" has been    
on the air for over 7 1/2 years,

431
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:29,928
        over 21 seasons,        

432
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,062
       and we have visited      
       over 800 locations.      

433
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,599
  We've had a lot of firsts --  
       first burger joint,      

434
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,934
   barbecue joint, taco joint,  
          you name it.          

435
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,269
    The list goes on and on.    

436
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,671
   I got a new first for you.   

437
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,339
  We're here in Eugene, Oregon, 

438
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,474
          to check out          
    an all-vegan restaurant.    

439
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:44,709
     This is Cornbread Cafe.    

440
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,213
    Fish and chips, table 2.    

441
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,349
         It's wonderful,        
  Southern-style comfort food.  

442
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:54,152
    Barbecue plate, table 3.    

443
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,387
   Everything is really yummy.  

444
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,156
     If you weren't a vegan     
     and you came in here,      

445
00:15:58,158 --> 00:15:59,691
        I think you'd see       
   a lot of the similar items   

446
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:02,026
          that you see          
  at most comfort-food diners.  

447
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,228
             FIERI:             
      Which is no accident.     

448
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,898
  What I like to do             
is veganize traditional recipes.

449
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:11,970
Since 2011, owner Sheree Walters
       has been serving up      

450
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:15,039
         those favorites        
    in a funky '50s building.   

451
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,908
            Was it an old diner?
 It was a drive-in.             

452
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,776
               So, you wanted   
             a diner feeling... 
        Yep.                    

453
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,578
              ...but you wanted 
              to make it vegan. 
        Mm-hmm.                 

454
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,313
    WOMAN: I'm a meat-eater,    
       and this is a place      

455
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:26,651
     that I've never noticed    
   that I am not eating meat.   

456
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:27,919
     Eugenewich up, table 1.    

457
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:29,921
         The Eugenewich         
  is their signature sandwich.  

458
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:33,257
         It's a big slab        
    of fried, flavorful tofu    

459
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:35,059
      with haystack onions.     

460
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,327
         It's delicious.        

461
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,264
We're gonna make Southern-fried 
tofu for our Eugenewich.        

462
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,200
               All right, so,   
            let's get into this.

463
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:43,867
         How many pounds of tofu

464
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:47,271
           do you guys think you
           go through in a week?
Give or take, 350 pounds.       

465
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:48,405
               A lot of tofu.   

466
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,275
We're gonna line it             
on the sheet tray...            

467
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:55,813
bake it for about 14 minutes    
in a 350-degree oven.           

468
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,951
All right, so, we've got        
our tofu that is cooled down.   

469
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:00,952
                    Okay.       

470
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,820
And we're ready to start        
 making the dredge.             

471
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,288
Unsweetened soy milk.           

472
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,290
Apple cider vinegar.            

473
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,025
               Little hot sauce.
 And the hot sauce.             

474
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,094
             So, this is making 
               our buttermilk.  
        Yep.                    

475
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,829
                 All right,     
   we're gonna season the flour.

476
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,297
Yep. Baking powder.             
                Great. Salt.    

477
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,632
    And sea salt                
and poultry seasoning,          

478
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,769
    black pepper,               
  and celery seed.              

479
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:20,371
And then I just get my hands    
in there and mix it up.         

480
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,572
           Let me see the magic.

481
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:22,473
    [ Chuckles ]                

482
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,309
     So, it goes                
into the buttermilk.            

483
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,977
            Dredge them through.
        Yep.                    

484
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,646
Back into the buttermilk.       

485
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:31,115
                And a dredge.   
 You get a nice coating on this.

486
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:34,118
And that goes in the fryer      
for about two minutes.          

487
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,187
        We're gonna fry all this
          and build a sandwich. 
     All right.                 

488
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:39,991
    Then I put on               
the Daiya tapioca cheese.       

489
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:41,926
 Take a grilled bun.            

490
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,660
This is our Eugenewich sauce    

491
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,798
that we made with our house-made
barbecue sauce and vegan mayo.  

492
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,868
And lettuce and tomato,         

493
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,270
 our Southern-fried             
     tofu patty,                

494
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,539
     and this is                
  our carrot bacon.             
                Interesting.    

495
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,008
Our haystack onions,            

496
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,279
then we're gonna pair that      
with our home fries.            

497
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,648
      Here you go, "Triple D" --

498
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:08,953
                That's great.   

499
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:11,088
              It's got texture. 
               It's got chew.   

500
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,090
             The barbecue sauce 
             is out of bounds.  

501
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,226
           The haystack fries --
             that makes it fly. 

502
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:17,161
      I don't get anything like,
            "Ohh, that's tofu." 

503

504
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:20,164
                   I mean,      
       I would challenge anybody

505
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,100
       that says they don't like
                 vegan food     

506
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:24,702
         to try that and tell me
         that they don't dig it.

507
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,039
                  Nice job.     

508
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,141
     Thank you.                 

509
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,778
     You got the crispiness     
          of the tofu.          

510
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,714
    It has a sweetness to it.   
       It has a smokiness.

514

       Tell me                  
what you think, Chef.

                in the food.

               learn to cook?   

519

  from my grandma.

524
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:06,744
        I got the frozen        
       peanut butter pie.       
Oh, boy!

  The frozen peanut butter pie  
        is just awesome.        

527
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,350
    It's almost like a frozen   
       peanut butter cup.       

528
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,220

our frozen peanut butter pie.

Got vegan cream cheese.         

530

  We'll beat that.

Creamy peanut butter here.      

532
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,232
So, we're gonna alternate       
     a few times                

533
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,300
between the soy milk            
and powdered sugar.             

534
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,103
        You want me to sprinkle?

535
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:33,237
        Yeah.                   

536
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,245
     All right,                 
here's our vegan whipped cream.

00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,250
Into the springform pan.        

538
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:50,054
  I'm gonna drizzle             
  chocolate sauce.              

539
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:54,858
Do a little swirly.             
                 Very cool.     

540
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,295
Goes into the freezer           
   for two hours.

00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:07,738
             It's just a really 
             excellent balance  

543
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,208
          of flavor and texture,

544
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,210
               kind of a cross  
            between a cheesecake

545
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,377
           and an ice cream pie.

546
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,615
              That right there  
   has a savory component to it,

547
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:18,816
          like with the peanuts.

548
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,284
              Not overly sweet  
                by any means.   

549
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,820
                It's awesome.   
                It really is.   

550
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:25,356
       WOMAN: It's thick.       
           It's rich.           

551
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:28,959
   It's a perfect combination   
 of peanut butter and chocolate.

552
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,294
            In fact,            
   I would work here for free   

553
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,963
          just to learn

554
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:34,632
         You could have named it
