00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,515
 FIERI: But the heavy hitter... 
         -One more beef.        

118
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:13,785
   ...is something Brad Bogard  
  calls the California Taco...  

119
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,520
          There we go.          
 ...Even though he discovered it

120
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,055
   on a trip to the Caribbean,  

121
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,590
It's a puffy shell taco.        

122
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,525
 -...that he brought to Omaha...
          -Oh, lettuce.         

123
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:23,061
      ...when he decided to     
 settle down and open this joint

124
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,262
   in the old family building.  

125
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,330
Beef taco coming up.            

126
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,531
         Just one hitch.        

127
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:27,733
Never worked at a restaurant    
 before in my life.             

128
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:29,000
            Never worked at one.

129
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,535
Went down to Mexican            
   grocery store,               

130
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:31,603
   pollo, chicken.              

131
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,670
      They started giving you...

132
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,505
Yeah, they would point          
   at what to do.               

133
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,674
     Oh, there's                
the tortilla recipe.            

134
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:37,809
        And that's how you start
              making tortillas? 

135
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,277
             -Yeah.             
   -Give me the rundown here.   

136
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,013
Start with wheat flour,         
sea salt, baking soda.          

137
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,348
         So that's gonna give it
          some of the leavening.

138
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,150
Vegetable shortening,           
then some hot water.            

139
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,885
 Crank this baby up.            

140
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,286
      So once the dough works...

141
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,887
You gotta knead the dough.      

142
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,756
             Now, who taught you
               how to do this?  

143
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,758
     Nobody. Me.                

144
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,926
 Throw my dough down            
     and put it                 

145
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,027
 in the bun divider.            

146
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,095
                Look at that.   
                What is that?   

147
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,496
                 Circa 1840?    

148
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,299
   Patented 1931.               

149
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,632
                    Wow.        

150
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,102
   Into the slot.               
  Confinement ring.             

151
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,370
  Because you will              
   stay in there.               

152
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,038
                Pull it down,   
         then we hit the button.

153
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,508
               Nice drop down,  
                  activate.     

154
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,377
      -Really?                  
    -Pull it up.                

155
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,579
 Wow. Look at those             
little biscuits of friendship.  

156
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,180
  Now you go ahead              
and roll these out by hand.     

157
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,649
           Exactly. Power it up.

158
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,384
             And we don't do it 
         till we get your order.

159
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:20,985
 So that's it. Now, this is what
             we're going to use 

160
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,853
        to make the carne asada?

161
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:22,787
       Steak.                   
      Exactly.                  

162
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,122
Take it over the slicer,        

163
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,056
put the spices together,        

164
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,992
a little black pepper,          
      sea salt,                 

165
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,062
onion, salt cayenne pepper,     
    the oregano.                

166
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:31,663
            I like the seasoning
                mix on that.    

167
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,265
      And then we grill it?     
          -Open flame.          

168
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,333
       Medium rare on both sides
          so it doesn't dry out.

169
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,469
 You got it. And after it cools,
               then we slice.   

170
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:38,870
   If you slice it right away...
            -Lose all the juice.

171
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,672
      Exactly.                  

172
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,007
                 That's some    
             pretty good carne. 

173
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,875
   These get put inside here?   
              Yes.              

174
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,677
That's a healthy little portion,
               and that's it.   

175
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,145
       Bye-bye, let's fry.      
       -Let's do it again.      

176
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,347
        After it's done cooking,
              you let it drain  

177
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,481
        a little bit of the oil.

178
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:50,815
    You see what                
   she looks like.              

179
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:51,950
     That takes                 
 a little something.            

180
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,084
                Look at that.   

181
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,752
      Lettuce,                  
we shred our own cheese here.   

182
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,955
                   Queso.       
                Look at that.   

183
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,557
             That's outstanding.

184
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,493
        Meat's got great flavor,
                  crunchy.      

185
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,161
                 Look at all    
             the juice in there.

186
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,830
             Mmm, that's killer.

187
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:06,932
      Do I look like I just took
         a bath in that or what?

188
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:08,300
              Wow, that's good. 
               Nice job, man.   

189
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:09,835
       -I appreciate that.      
         -Good texture.         

190
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,102
  It's got a great taste to it. 

191
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,103
        Tasted homemade.        

192
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,105
My mom didn't make them         
     this good.                 

193
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,640
       That's kind of like      
      the seal of approval.     

194
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,442
        We've got to make       
     that tunk, tunk sound.     

195
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,244
           Tunk, tunk.          

196
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,079
      It's quick, it's easy     
      and it's great food.      

197
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,114
     It tastes really fresh     

198
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:23,515
             I want everything. 
               cook that day.   

199
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,917
      -This sauce is great      
     -Two kinds. The red...     

200
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,586
Taste like somebody just shot it
          with a tomato         

201
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:28,920
    and put it in the bottle.   

202
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,122
  FIERI: ...and the green made  
      with fresh opinions.      

203
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,724
          Look at that.         
          -That's good.         

204
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,726
          That's mine.          
         -That's money.         

205
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,728
       -All the way down.       
   -And Brad keeps serving up   

206
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,796
       all the favorites.       

207
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,064
Beef hard shell tacos.          

208
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,132
      There we go. Burrito.     

209
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:42,801
      We got Nacho Supreme.     
          Really good.          

210
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,135
  FIERI: And when he heads back 
         to the fryer...        

211
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,336
      BRAD: Chicken chimi.      

212
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,872
Love to make chimichanga,       
a big deep fried burrito.       

213
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:48,873
                  Exactly.      

214
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,342
Maybe 20 ground beef.           

215
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:52,210
  Add the seasonings right after
       we get the meat in there.

216
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,346
             -Ancho.            
      -Ancho chili pepper.      

217
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:55,747
         -The chipotle.         
           -Sea salt.           

218
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,415
             -Okay.             
        -And onion salt.        

219
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,283
             Add a little water.

220
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,684
Everybody's in the pool.        

221
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,753
You're going to let it sit here 
and cook for what? Two hours.   

222
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,423
So, that's cook down.           
I mean that is like beef sauce. 

223
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,825
    [ Whistles ]                
And this is the method, huh?    

224
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:09,427
        The spices help separate
         that oil from the meat.

225
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,097
   That's precise.              
So let these cool down then.    

226
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,364
      Then what goes down?      

227
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,100
Pinto beans. We stored          
  everyone by hand              

228
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,033
 looking for rocks.             

229
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,235
        The thing I love is that

230
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,104
      when you were hanging down
          at the Mexican market,

231
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,706
               you've got some  
  really particular information.

232
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,508
  Something like shorting beans,
          which is quite an art,

233
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,576
              very seldom done. 

234
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:25,643
    And then you cook the beans.

235
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,178
                Mix the beans   
           into the ground beef.

236
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,513

   Flour tortilla.              

237
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,048
        Put a little steam on it
              so it's pliable.  

238
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,516
      Exactly.                  
  Make it pliable.              

239
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:32,717
            So it doesn't crack.

240
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:33,918
A little refined beans,         

241

a good amount of meat,

our milk wash for the onions.

Half a gallon of milk,

Going to start us off

      Very similar to a handmade
   sauteed spinach at the house.

455

Kosher salt.

    when you guys               
    were married?               

1026
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,736
           Oh, he was definitely
             ahead of his time. 

1027
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,971
That gives me goose bumps.

 It's a family environment, man.

1029

       When you come here,      
     you just feel welcome.     

1030
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:41,411
    The food's unbelievable.    

1031
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,346
         There's nothing        
 that you can order on the menu 

1032
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:44,814
 that you'll be displeased with.

1033
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:48,151
            Soft Crab Po'Boy up!

1034
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:50,020
      Absolutely delicious.     

1035
00:34:50,022 --> 00:34:52,089
 It's worth its weight in gold.

    Jimmy's -- It's a legacy.   

1037

          in Baltimore.         

1038
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,561
A lot of family love,           
a lot of family respect.        

1039
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,430
 You guys are doing             
 a phenomenal job.              

1040
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,032
      It's been                 
an awesome experience.          

1041
00:35:02,034 --> 00:35:03,066
 Grazie.                        
           Thank you.           

1042
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:08,638
        Dear, Guy Fieri.        
          -Possibility.         

1043
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,706
        FIERI: Up next...       

1044
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,975
         Hi, Guy Fieri,         
     we're and rolling out.     

1045
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:14,711
    It's the yin                
and the yang of pizza.          

1046
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,847
              It really works.  
          The food is delicious.

1047
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:24,521
 I'm here to tell you about one 
    of my favorite places on    

1048
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:26,456
 "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives." 

1049
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,658
             -Baby.             
    -Don't miss out on this.    

1050
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,326
    Welcome back.               
Hunter and I are here           

1051
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,328
      watching                  
some of the greatest videos.    

1052
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,664
These are people that are trying
   to convince us               

1053
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,466
 that their favorite            
 "Triple-D" location            

1054
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,067
       is one                   
of America's favorites.         

1055
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,737
So we asked them to submit      
some one minute videos          

1056
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:41,872
explaining the type of food,    

1057
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:43,540
   what they love               
about the restaurant            

1058
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:45,074
and make it entertaining        
    and creative.               

1059
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,943
And I got to tell you,          
we've been having a blast.      

1060
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:49,279
 The "Triple-D" fans            
     blow it up.                

1061
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:51,348
               They're crazy.   
     They are -- They are crazy.

1062
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,649
Okay, roll the tape.            

1063
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,819
       Hi, I'm Guy Fieri,       
      and we're rolling out     

1064
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,955
        looking America's       
        greatest diners,        

1065
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:00,490
      drive-Ins and dives.      

1066
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:03,426
            I decided           
  to drive to Kansas City today 

1067
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:06,095
       to just eat at one       
   of my favorite restaurants.  

1068
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,631
  I got nothing going on today. 

1069
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:11,167
 I'm going to go to my favorite 
  restaurant called Grinder's.  

1070
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:14,904
    So I opened up MapQuest.    
    I type in Grinder's, KC.    

1071
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,307
 It's three hours and 15 minutes
          from my house         

1072
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:18,841
     in St. Louis, Missouri.    

1073
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,444
 But that's okay because you got
   to drive around the country  

1074
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:23,779
         in order to hit        
     some of the best spots.    

1075
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,915
      This menu is packed.      

1076
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,851
It has Philly cheesesteak pizza,
       so on and so forth.      

1077
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,588
But I got the pastrami, and just
    like Guy Fieri would say,   

1078
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,458
         "Call my mommy.        
  That's some killer pastrami,  

1079
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,859
        Am I right, Guy?        

1080
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,262
        Me and my dad --        
     Look at this cute pick.    

1081
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:41,064
       Me and my dad made       
       a three-hour drive.      

1082
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:43,066
      We drove back at 2:00     
         in the morning         

1083
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:46,269
      just to eat good food     
   and make lifetime memories.  

1084
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:49,406
     That's all right here,     
    right now, on "Triple-D."   

1085
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:54,744
               Oh, I love it,   

1086
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:55,945
I'm not kidding, you guys,      

1087
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:59,482
 I am so blown away             
  at the creativity             

1088
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:00,817
 and the enthusiasm,            

1089
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,686
and it was the pull up in front 
of Grinder's by the way.        

1090
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:08,024
 Check your attitude            
at the door is what we say.     

1091
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:09,960
     Best wings.                

1092
00:37:09,962 --> 00:37:11,294
          Holding down.         

1093
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,362
  FIERI: His name is Stretch... 

1094
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:13,363
               A very big man.  

1095
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:14,564
       He owns the place.       

1096
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,032
         I'm the guy that colors
             outside the lines. 

1097
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:18,367
            British army helmet,
                 circa 1943.    

1098
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,969
               He's different.  

1099
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:24,107
And he's got an off-the-hook way
 of doin' just about everything.

1100
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:26,443
    -You did that backwards.    
-No, it's however I wanna do it.

1101
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:28,378
         The beer tower.        
     -It's a breathing tank     

1102
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,647
              for oxygen, yeah, 
                Stretchified.   

1103
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:33,316
        Yeah. The food is       
        Stretchalicious.        

1104
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,852
         -There you go.         
 -The pizza is just my favorite.

1105
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:37,520
          It's so good.         
         -With all kinds        

1106
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,722
        of homemade kind.       
        -I love this pie.       

1107
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,191
   From classic to tater-tot.   

1108
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,594
Man, this is like being         
in grade school again.          

1109
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,195
       Cheesesteak Stretch      
           and Sister           

1110
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:47,797
    are better than the ones    
        he grew up with.        

1111
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:49,466
I'm from Philly area.           
 I think I can make             

1112
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:51,334
a cheesesteak wherever          
 I go in the world.             

1113
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:53,536
    Hot wings that'll put you   
       down for the count.      

1114
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:54,971
   Your eyeballs are sweatin'.  
            -[Laughs]           

1115
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:56,406
   In a 100-year-old building   

1116
00:37:56,408 --> 00:37:58,141
     with food in the front     
            -Love it.           

1117
00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:00,477
  And monster metal sculptures  
          in the back.          

1118
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:03,346
        It's about 24 feet tall,
      weighs about 9,000 pounds.

1119
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:04,681
          That's crazy.         

1120
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:08,017
No crazier than Stretch deciding
     it makes perfect sense     

1121
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,086
         for a sculptor         
      to open a restaurant.     

1122
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:12,222
               Art, like food,  
                 like music,    

1123
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,090
                 crosses all    
            cultural boundaries.

1124
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,825
            It does.            
     -And this place is just    

1125
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:18,228
          all that put together,
         just mished and mashed.

1126
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,628
     And tossed, and baked.     

1127
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,897
               That's our pie   
                right there.    

1128
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:22,431
        Starting entirely       
          from scratch.         

1129
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:23,900
    Just working                
  fingers into it,              

1130
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:25,301
   get all the air              
    bubbles out.                

1131
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,571
  I gotta tell ya, he's putting 
     more time into one skin    

1132
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,907
     than I see most people     
   put into their whole pizza.  

1133
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:32,308
     Let me see this thing.     

1134
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,844
  I can almost see through it.  

1135
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:36,178
        Ah, I can't wait        
          to have this.         

1136
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,048
I say we make our famous        
    Bengal Tiger.               

1137
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,516
        Why'd you call it       
          Bengal Tiger?         

1138
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:41,984
  You know, we got              
this chicken in there           

1139
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,386
and the tandoori sauce,         

1140
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:45,054
it's got curry in it,           
and stuff like that.            

1141
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:47,390
     Little pesto goes down.    
     -That's a little pesto.    

1142
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:49,258
   We sprinkle on               
our tandoori chicken.           

1143
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,661
             Curry.             
     -Little curry on there.    

1144
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:52,995
      Now, how does this go     
            over here           

1145
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,797
          in the heart          
        of the beef land?       

1146
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:56,132
     This is one                
of our favorite pizzas.         

1147
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:57,400
   People love it.              

1148
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:59,869
   It's even got a little crab  
   on it, and hearts of palm.   

1149
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:02,138
         'Cause I often,        
    when I'm thinkin' pizza,    

1150
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,473
          I'm thinkin'          
         hearts of palm.        

1151
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:05,008
And we sprinkle a little        
of our cheese on top.           

1152
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,677
 And that's about it            
    right there.                

1153
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,813
       What do you think?       
       -That is gorgeous!       

1154
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:11,481
          So cilantro.          
           -Cilantro.           

1155
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:13,616
      Just drip it in there     
     a little bit like that.    

1156
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,885
          Bengal Tiger.         
              Rawr!             

1157
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:16,953
         [chuckle] Wow.         

1158
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:19,088
   That's like an all-Calypso,  

1159
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,292
       jazz-band-festival       
          funkalicious.         

1160
00:39:22,294 --> 00:39:23,359
  I hear it's good.             

1161
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,494
                 Delicious.     

1162
00:39:24,496 --> 00:39:25,829
    You get like these gems.    

1163
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:27,897
     Little hearts of palm,     
   little bit of the chicken,   

1164
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:29,432
           some crab.           

1165
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:31,835
    It's the yin                
and the yang of pizza.          

1166
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:33,269
        It really works.        

1167
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:34,904
 Stretch'll make<i> anything</i> work. 

1168
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:36,573
       I love it because you can
       kinda specially order it.

1169
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:38,908
     Like you get your own slice
    and you decide what's on it.

1170
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,443
       In any combination.      

1171
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:42,312
 So we're gonna put             
some salmon on here now.        

1172
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:44,714
       Like smoked salmon       
   and cream cheese on pesto.   

1173
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,582
              Wow.              

1174
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:47,984
         That's no joke.        

1175
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:50,987
    There's one with spinach,   
  peppers, artichokes, olives,  

1176
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:52,055
          and almonds.          

1177
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,456
      Four kinds together,      

1178
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:55,792
       with the pepperoni       
     next to the pineapple.     

1179
00:39:55,794 --> 00:39:57,460
         And this baby,         
      that makes you wonder     

1180
00:39:57,462 --> 00:39:59,529
 why no one ever did it before. 

1181
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:01,898
       The chili and the onions,
              fresh cut onions. 

1182
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,333
               The surprise is  
               the tater tot.   

1183
00:40:03,335 --> 00:40:05,201
     So this pie                
 actually has a hole            

1184
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:06,936
out of the center of it         
and we put tater tots           

1185
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:09,472
   in the middle,               
put chili on top of it.         

1186
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:11,407
cheese whiz on top of that.     

1187
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,177
and then, we put some green     
onions on top of that.          

1188
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:15,812
          Look at that!         

1189
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:17,480
        Tasty chili. Mmm.       

1190
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:19,081
       And you know what?       

1191
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,817
 Nothin' goes better than a tot.

1192
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:23,419
      The food                  
is always just great.           

1193
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,222
 And, while Stretch started this
   as an artist, not a chef --  

1194
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:27,957
      Is this like your own     
    little mini art gallery?    

1195
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:29,826
  And that changes,             
people bring us stuff.          

1196
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:31,227
And that's what I like          
      about it.                 

1197
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:34,964
   When it comes to the food,   
he got real serious, real quick.

1198
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:36,366
          Look at that.         
         -I had a friend        

1199
00:40:36,368 --> 00:40:38,501
who went to New York, the       
culinary institute up there.    

1200
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:40,503
He came back and helped me      
open the restaurant.            

1201
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:42,905
So a lot of the recipes         
are derived from his,           

1202
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:44,440
    you know, participation.    
          -Nice. Okay,          

1203
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,709
 so that's why you've really got
 some true culinary foundation. 

1204
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:48,310
        Yeah.                   

1205
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,847
 But there's also the stuff that
  Stretch brought to the party. 

1206
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:52,916
I used to live in Philadelphia, 
and this is the first place     

1207
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:55,518
that's exactly the same         
as I remember from back home.   

1208
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,187
The secret is definitely        
seasoning the grill beforehand. 

1209
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,857
And we've thrown bacon on there 
all day long and cheesesteak,   

1210
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:01,791
so it's going to be fine.       

1211
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:06,396
Nice, lean roast beef we use.   

1212
00:41:06,398 --> 00:41:07,563
     Chop it up.                

1213
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,465
  The other secret              
 is slicing the bun.            

1214
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,200
You don't want to go            
all the way through.            

1215
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,202
 That bird's first,             

1216
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,471
       put a little onions      
            on there.           

1217
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:19,275
       I mix it in there,       
   put my cheese whiz on here.  

1218
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:22,145
That's a Philly cheesesteak     
   in Kansas City.              

1219
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,613
            -Cheers.            
          -Bon appetit.         

1220
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:25,681
  That's tasty. That's good eats
              right there, man. 

1221
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:29,619
  Grinders is just an artistic  
    and usual friendly place    

1222
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:31,554
        where you can get       
 a really great piece of pizza. 

1223
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:33,623
    Very eclectic atmosphere.   

1224
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:34,824
    We came from the other side,

1225
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,559
           not from the culinary
                 background.    

1226
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:37,894
      We don't know what's right
              and what's wrong, 

1227
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:39,495
        but we know what we like
                 and we try     

1228
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,898
     and put it into into action
                 in a place     

1229
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,099
          that we all want to go
                and hang out.   

1230
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:44,167
          [ Applause ]          

1231
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:46,435
 They love you here.            

1232
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,971
      MAN: Love that money      

1233
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:52,441
    Hi, thank you               
for being in my lap.            

1234
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:53,576
Smokey's helping me.            

1235
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:54,644
        Hey.                    

1236
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:56,111
        Hey.                    

1237
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,314
Okay, can I do my work?         
     Thank you.
