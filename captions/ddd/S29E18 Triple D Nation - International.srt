   Beef rouladen.               

339
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,309
    It's also one of the best   
   sellers in the restaurant.   

340
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,111
This is my seasoning that I use.

341
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,979
    Mixture of white pepper,    

342
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,115
         seasoned salt,         
       and brown mustard.       

343
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,518
      Make sure that we get     
  a nice, good coating on that. 

344
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,521
  Now we do the onion, pickle.  

345
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,790
       And then our bacon.      

346
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,525
Now we're going to roll this up.

347
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,126
  We sear them on the flat top, 

348
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,861
         get them brown         
       all the way around.      

349
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,197
       When they're done,       
 we put those in an au-jus bath.

350
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,733
        We warm those up.       
    We put those on a plate.    

351
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,068
        We put our gravy.       

352
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,404
   We serve that with spaetzle  
        and red cabbage.        

353
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:02,407
  WOMAN: The meat is so tender. 
           It's juicy.          

354
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,142
    I love the gravy on top.    

355
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:06,977
     It's so tender that you    
     really don't even need     

356
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,413
    the knife to cut it with.   

357
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,882
So, I am concerned that next    
time I go out looking for this, 

358
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,684
  I'm gonna have to             
   interview them.

365

I've never had like that.       
That's got some killer crunch.  

366
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,635
Oh, the sauce is money.

  dedicated to keeping it real, 

373

 what better place to dig up new
recipes than Grandma's cookbook?

374

     MAN: Oma's hackbraten.     

375
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:53,257

   It's like German meatloaf.   

376
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,728
  The first thing we start with 
    is a little celery salt,    

377
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,131
        granulated onion,       
    caraway seed, parsley...    

378
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:03,601
    marjoram, white pepper...   

379
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,736
     fresh garlic, curry...     

380
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,939
        Worcestershire...       

381
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:11,676
   beef concentrate, our eggs.  

382
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:14,411
  And now, last but not least,  
       panko breadcrumbs.       

383
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,949
          There we go.          
        Now the fun part.

       I'm not gonna argue      
      with my grandmother.      

386
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,219
         Now our bacon.         

387
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,488
          This gives it         
     just more good flavor.     

388
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,890
    We're ready for ketchup.    

389
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:28,293
    This helps brown the top,   
    make it nice and crusty.    

390
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:31,162
   And we are gonna bake this   
      for about two hours.      

391
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,563
 Pour our gravy on top of that, 

392
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:36,367
         and we serve it        
    with German potato salad.   

393

  FIERI: And that potato salad  
          had me going.         

394

   That's killer.
