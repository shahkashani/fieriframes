00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:02,334
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:03,802
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:06,005
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:07,472
          This trip...          
                    Let's do it.

5
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:09,274
   ...we're tackling tacos...   

6
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:11,343
 I don't know if I should eat it
      or take a picture with it.

7
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,745
         ...tri-tips...         
That's competition tri-tip      
     right there.               

8
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,480
...and a tasty island tradition.

9
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:17,750
                  Then you      
             "sophistifunk" it. 

10
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:20,152
   In Stockton, California...   
                         Ow!    

11
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:21,619
     ...a little New Orleans    
            flavor...           

12
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,888
    Get after it.               

13
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,823
      ...with a meaty take      
          on the crepe.         

14
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:27,159
             That does not sound
   like any crepe I've ever had.

15
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,627
    In Islamorada, Florida...   

16
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,695
 Dude!                          
       ...a local icon...       

17
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,364
             I'm excited to see 
       what's gonna happen here.

18
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,766
         ...shelling out        
      their legendary stew.     

19
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,236
I don't know that most          
people have ever had turtle.    

20
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:38,570
  And in Oakland, California... 

21
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:39,637
            Gorgeous.           

22
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,239
  ...a true taste of Mexico...  

23
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,774
             I feel like I need 
                my passport.    

24
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,978
        ...at the corner        
  of Authentic and Outrageous.  

25
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,980
         How did our bite taste?
              Tastes fantastic. 

26
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,716
     That's all right here,     
           right now,

     you're enjoying a meal

    How about an open market?   

38
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:22,748
     So I'm here in Oakland,    
   California, in Old Oakland,  

39
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,482
   to check out the real deal.

               pico de gallo.   

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,560
WOMAN: I've been to, like, every
type of Mexican restaurant,     

43
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:36,962
    and, by far,                
 Cosecha's the best.            

44
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,163
       Four tacos all day?      

45
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,365
                    MAN:        
   Dominica is truly the nicest,

46
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,101
   most engaging chef in Oakland
               that I know of.  

47
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,238
 FIERI: And Dominica Rice earned
 those chops working in kitchens

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,308
   from San Fran to Manhattan   
        to Mexico City...       

49
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,642
             I got it, I got it.

50
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,044
    ...before setting up shop   

51
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:55,581
       in a nearly vacant       
      marketplace in 2011.      

52
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,050
  When people started to realize
          how good her food was,

53
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:01,186
           how authentic it was,
she really filled this place up.

54
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,054
 A revival happened,            
  which was great.              

55
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,123
                  What kind     
    of Mexican restaurant is it?

56
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,959
     We're doing                
Oakland Mexican food.           

57
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,394
This type of cooking            
has always been in California.  

58
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:10,929
     But it's her own twist     
           on the taco          

59
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,664
        that's got folks        
       filling this joint.      

60
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,667
    Fish tacos, shrimp tacos,   
        pork belly tacos.       

61
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,669
       We have two orders       
         of pork belly.         

62
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:21,540
         Amazing, juicy,        
       succulent, nom nom,      

63
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,409
        pork belly tacos.       
              Yeah!             

64
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,878
                 Get me into it.
This is skin-on pork belly.     

65
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,346
             Where'd you get all
              the earthen-ware? 

66
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,216
I have them come in             
from Mexico that we             
have custom made for us,        

67
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:33,085
and then the other half         
comes in from Spain.            

68
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:34,419
                  Gorgeous.     
                  Rumor is      

69
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,155
              that Alice Waters 
            comes in and eats --

70
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:38,556
      Oh, yeah.                 
One of the most important...    
                  Amazing woman.

71
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,026
...woman chefs in the world,    
        yeah.                   

72
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:42,761
    -Salt it, and that's it?    
           -That's it.          

73
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,564
And we let that marinate        
     overnight.                 

74
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,966
  We're gonna start             
to prepare the achiote paste    

75
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,101
 for the pork belly.            

76
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:51,169
Whole garlic, kosher salt.      

77
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,505
       -So, you got a nice      
    little paste out of that.   
              -Yes.             

78
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,508
And then we just add the achiote
paste, which is annatto seed.   

79
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,178
Beautiful red color.            
And we're breaking this up.     

80
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,180
 We're ready to add             
     the citrus.                

81
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,415
 Oh, gracias.                   
           I'll load the cannon.

82
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,719
 Lemon and lime and             
a little bit of orange juice.   

83
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:12,391
So, take a little bit           
of the achiote paste,           

84
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,125
we're gonna rub this            
   on both sides.               

85
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,661
     And you're doing everything
                 authentic.     

86
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:17,529
       It's the whole enchilada,
              no pun intended.  

87
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,864
    [ Chuckles ]                
So, we're gonna add --          

88
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,267
         The Mexican mirepoix of
  jalapeños, onions, and garlic.

89
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,536
  Garlic, exactly.              
     Here we go.                

90
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,406
I'm gonna top this off          
with some nice cerveza.         

91
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:28,907
                    Okay.       
                  Covered?      

92
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,742
        Yep.                    

93
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:34,012
And place it into the oven      
       at 350                   

94
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,148
     for an hour                
   and 45 minutes.              

95
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,883
  So, we're making              
the pickled red onions          

96
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,619
that we use on a lot            
    of our tacos.               

97
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:45,023
Kosher salt, jalapeños,         
   chili de àrbol,              

98
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,692
     the Mexican                
  piloncillo sugar.             

99
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,760
              Piloncillo sugar? 

100
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,495
So, this is cooked-down         
  sugarcane juice.              

101
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,564
So it has all the molasses.     
Everything's together.          

102
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,233
           Bay Leaves.          
           -Hibiscus?           

103
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:55,500
        Yeah.                   
 The jamaica flower.            

104
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:56,902
Two cinnamon sticks.            

105
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,504
We're gonna add some water      
      to that,                  

106
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:02,374
and then we're gonna add        
  red wine vinegar.             

107
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:05,377
And I let that simmer           
for about 10 to 15 minutes.     

108
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,513
             I'll be over here. 

109
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,582
 Whoo! Press it down            
  with the weights,             

110
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,584
and then let it sit for,        
like, an hour and a half.       

111
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,652
                  Love it.      

112
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,053
 Then we've chilled             
  our pork belly --             

113
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,588
  And then I'll check the onions
              that we've made.  

114
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,790
      -Yes. Yes, yes, yes.      
       -That's important.       

115
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,792
 So, I'm gonna slice            
 off a few portions.            

116
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,461
             Those will be fine.
       A little acid bite there.

117
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,663
Then we salt them up.           

118
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,064
    And then into the non-stick.

119
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,466
             -Yeah.             
         -Sear 'em off.         

120
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,600
So, we make tortillas.          

121
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,602
          That's, like, the most
     perfect hand-made tortilla.

122
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,938
They're made to order,          

123
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,475
so the skin-on pork belly       
I love, because it has that     

124
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,676
     little bit                 
of that chicharrón crunch.      

125
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:42,147
And we put a little bit         
of the tomatillo salsa.         

126
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,481
   Pickled onion.               

127
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,618
  You've outweighed the tortilla
             5:1 with the pork. 

128
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,289
Fresh sliced jalapeño,          
and then a little cilantro.     

129
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:54,092
A little sprinkle of salt       
and a little bit of lime.       

130
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,827
   Ready to roll.               

131
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,899
             The skin is so thin
       in that part of the belly

132
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:02,967
          it starts to crunch up

133
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,703
              with a little bit 
               of its own fat.  

134
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,037
             It's quintessential

135
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,707
 that you have the pickled onion
              inside of there.  

136
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,309
            It's every aspect --
       the squeeze of the lemon,

137
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,576
          the touch of the salt.

138
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,178
                 For people     
      right now that are saying,

139
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,382
           "I wish I was there,"
         I'm doing this for you.

140
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,419
         How did our bite taste?
              Tastes fantastic. 

141
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,621
   Two pork bellies up on 19.   

142
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,791
     These tacos are kind of    
 an emotional experience for me.

143
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,594
      MAN: Just perfectly crispy
         pieces of pork belly --

144
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,463
                nice contrast   
             with the red onion.

145
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:34,065
   Makes you feel like you're   
   no longer in the Bay area.   

146
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,068
             FIERI: You eat out 
   of the little pottery dishes,

147
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,203
            and you're thinking,
      "I'm in a Mexican market."

148
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,937
    Doesn't it feel like it?    
        -Yeah, for sure.        

149
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,873
      MAN: You can actually     
       smell the tortillas      

150
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,141
    from about a block away,    

151
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,610
         so it's always         
      luring you over here.     

152
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,279
-But that's not all your tricks.
              -No.              

153
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:48,613
          We have more.         
     -I heard you got more.     

154
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,682
         -Carne Adovada?        
         -Carne Adovada?        

155
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,417
              <i> -Sí.</i>             
      -You can't miss this.     

156
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:53,885
                I'll see you    
              in a little bit.  

157
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:56,220
    I'm gonna have one more taco
            just for us, though.

158
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,689
          -[ Chuckles ]         
           -Come back.          

159
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:07,866
  Welcome back. We're at Cosecha
         in Oakland, California.

160
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,535
           Now, I know you think
        you've seen enough tacos

161
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,404
               on "Triple D,"   
            but I'm telling you,

162
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:14,472
               we are talking   
              about real deal.  

163
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,675
 They hand-make their tortillas,
     they make all their salsas.

164
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:19,277
     It's all about as authentic
              as you can find.  

165
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,146
          Carne Adovada's ready.

166
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,681
        Today I'm having        
       the Carne Adovada.       

167
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:26,217
       The pork is local.       
   It's fresh. It's delicious.  

168
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,954
                Our next dish   
      is gonna be Carne Adovada.

169
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,155
        RICE:                   
It's a pork shoulder.           

170
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:33,225
I salt this the night before,   
 and we tied it up.             

171
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,693
                So, trust it    
       so it doesn't fall apart.

172
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:37,295
We're gonna be adding           
toasted and ground cumin.       

173
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,297
      -Old-school methods.      
        -Maximum flavor.        

174
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,433
And then we have a little bit   
of the Spanish paprika --       

175
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:45,103
smoked pimenton -- tomatoes,    
and then bay leaves,            

176
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,439
     some onion,                
     and garlic.                

177
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:50,842
     Cerveza...                 
that we love so much.           

178
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:53,244
And some jalapeño, as well.     
 Ready for the oven.            

179
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,981
           Here we go.          
-How long are we gonna cook off?

180
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,316
For about two and a half hours  
       at 350.                  

181
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,450
                    Okay.       
           What are we into now?

182
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,985
We're making guajillo salsa.    

183
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:04,256
       So guajillo, chili àrbol,
                 and garlic?    

184
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,725
And letting it steep            
  for five minutes.             

185
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:10,127
Okay. I'm gonna puree           
the guajillo chilies.           

186
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,596
Add in the chicken borth.       

187
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,533
Add a little bit of salt.       

188
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:16,534
Strain the guajillo chili.      

189
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,802
                    Okay.       

190
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,605
This is one of the mother       
sauces for Mexican cuisine.     

191
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,275
Sauté it with some airomatics   
and a little bit of olive oil.  

192
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:26,344
 Bay leaves, onion,             
     and garlic.                

193
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:27,879
 We're gonna add in             
      the cumin                 

194
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:30,147
    and the Mexican oregano.    
           -Oh, yeah.           

195
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,217
 It's very different            
than the Italian oregano.       

196
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,885
              Twice the flavor. 

197
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,486
We're adding the guajillo.      

198
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:38,689
   Let this simmer              
for about 10, 15 minutes.       

199
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,960
A little kosher salt,           
and it's ready to go.           

200
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:46,832
This is the Carne Adovada,      
   ready to serve.              

201
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:49,301
             She just threw away
 the dental floss of Flavortown.

202
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,036
 Gonna get a little             
of chili sauce on top this.     

203
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:52,103
                    Okay.       
                   Get it.      

204
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:54,306
You have just a little bit      
    of cilantro.                

205
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,440
And some homemade tortillas.    

206
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,509
                I don't know    
             if I should eat it 

207
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,110
              or take a picture 
                  with it.      

208
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,052
You have good tortilla          
technique, so that's important. 

209
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,654
           I've got a good hold.

210
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,922
       <i> Bien?</i>                   

211
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,657
                 I feel like    
             I need my passport.

212
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,259
     It's a simple Mexican dish.

213
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:16,261
          It's not over-the-top.
              It's pork roast,  

214
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:18,930
        guajillo chili de àrbol,
          simple rice and beans,

215
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:22,667
       great handmade tortillas.

216
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,937
    Everything's just what it is
             in the great form. 

217
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,339
          That's the difference.

218
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,741
         -Carne Adovada?        
       -It's so tender --       

219
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,077
  just simply paired with rice  
    and beans and a tortilla.   

220
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,279
       It's all you need.       

221
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:37,082
  -Like, everything is perfect. 
         -Every detail.         

222
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,751
         But it remains,        
 nevertheless, fully accessible.

223
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:41,820
     That's what I want my shirt

  -I got to be honest with you, 

265

I don't know that most people

266
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,349
               Then this will

      -Very "fall apart-y"?

  in the Flavortown dictionary. 

270
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,156
How are we gonna make it?       

271
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,891
     First we're gonna start off
               with our meat.   

272
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,493
               We're gonna get  
           our steam kettle hot.

273

 Got to love having             
 that steam kettle.

   Add a little olive oil. Meat.
             Montreal seasoning.

275
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,034
The meat's seared up.           
Now the mirepoix part goes down?

276
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,370
            Correct. Sweat these
            till they're tender.

277
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:40,838
       Next up, crushed tomatoes
              from California,  

278
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,973

 let this cook down?            

291

  this turtle meat              

294
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,602

                 Lay it on.     
 Mix it up, and let it simmer...

340
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,877
For about 45 minutes            

341
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,579
   and then hit it              
with the immersion blender.     

342
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:02,781
                   Dig it.      

343
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,449
            Now we're gonna make
                the meatloaf.   

344
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,851
This is ground pork-and-beef    
      mixture.                  

345
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,586
   We're gonna add              
fresh chopped garlic,           

346
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,789
  red bell pepper,              
sweet vidalia onion,            

347
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,257
chopped green bell pepper.      
                         Okay.  

348
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,126
   Two large eggs.              
   Worcestershire.              

349
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,728
                You guys like   
your Worcestershire around here.

350
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,063
      Sure do.                  
 Panko breadcrumbs,             

351
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,333
     whole milk,                
  ground coriander,             

352
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,935
 parsley and chives,            

353
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:25,670
  salt, pepper.                 
                    All right.  

354
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:28,138
Now here's where the love       
      comes in.                 

355
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,807
             I'm excited to see 
       what's gonna happen here.

356
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,576
     All right.                 
Now we weave the bacon.         

357
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,611
 Now we're gonna add            
  our meat mixture,             

358
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,546
 make a little vein             
   in the meatloaf              

359
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,016
for our bistro sauce            
with cremini mushrooms.         

360
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,484
        All that flavor -- okay.

361
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,085
And cover it with the rest      
    of the meat.                

362
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,887
Now we're gonna thatch it       
       again.                   

363
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,489
                 I like it.     

364
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,757
   Flip her over.               

365
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,358
         In the oven, what temp?

366
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,961
350 for about 45 minutes.       

367
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,163
  Just coats it in the bacon fat
                as it cooks.    

368
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,498
                  And then      
            when it comes out...

369
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,966
Let it cool down, slice it.     

370
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:56,367
               What the sauce   
               we put on top?   

371
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,903
  Ketchup and house             
bistro sauce mixture.           
                      I like it.

372
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:01,439
 Finish in the oven,            
   then serve it.               

373
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:02,974
      -Let's see it, buddy.     
           -All right.          

374
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:06,176
Creamy mashed potatoes,         
portabella mushroom gravy,      

375
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,312
   butter braise green beans,   

376
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,582
    and for the grand finale,   
        Bacon Wrap Love.        

377
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,284
  Enjoy, my friend.             

378
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,657
               Mmm. It's nice   
           and light and tender.

379
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,792
            That bistro sauce --
              really dynamite.  

380
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:26,264
        You got this old-school,
           nostalgic reputation,

381
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,532
            and you're thinking,
           "That's what you have

382
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,667
        in an old-school place,"
           is you have meatloaf.

383
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,869
                  But then      
           you "sophistifunk" it

384
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,272
                and stuff it    
             with the mushrooms.

385
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,674
                  Dynamite.     

386
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,810
 I mean, it's wrapped in bacon, 
          first of all,         

387
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:40,345

   folded into it,              

390
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,683
and it's just awesome.          

391
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,819
  Can I get some more meatloaf  
      to the line, please?

-So we've got our fat-free milk,

447
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:58,316
      a splash of vegetable oil,
              our liquid eggs,  

448
00:16:58,318 --> 00:16:59,517
           a little bit of salt.

449
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,918
   Nice measuring.              

450
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,853
          And last but not least
      is your all-purpose flour.

451
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,321
        Wait.                   

452
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,924
       <i> -That's</i> your lid?       
        -This is my lid.        

453
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,926
  FIERI: Oh, I'm so not standing
                   by you.      

454
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:15,733
Make sure you get the sides     
and you got a nice consistency. 

455
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,804
This bad boy's done.            

456
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,539
                       Ow!      
   [ Chuckles ]                 

457
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,008
       So, now                  
we've got to make our crepe.    

458
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,209
  Drop it on here.              

459
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,011
Drop it like it's...            
         Drop it like it's hot. 

460
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:28,679
     Thank you.                 

461
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:32,616
Ooh, I like the little wooden   
dowel Geppetto made for you.    

462
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,419
                    Yes.        
       Geppetto made a good one.

463
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,288
And then you bring out          
your "Pirates of the            
Caribbean" sword.               

464
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,357
                   You do.      
      And you flip this bad boy.

465
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,024
   Nice and thin.               
That's what we're looking for.  

466
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,160
Just a little brown.            

467
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,694
             We're gonna flip it
                 back over,     

468
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,229
    just for 30 seconds more.   
             -Okay.             

469
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,831
     -Now we're gonna put it    
            together.           
           -All right.          

470
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,699
          We take our asparagus,
               and then we add  

471
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,635
               that wonderful,  
      slow-smoked tri-tip to it.

472
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:53,203
       We're gonna put it       
       on top right here.       

473
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,307
        -Lot of filling.        
      -You want to be full.     

474
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,641
                There we are.   

475
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,844
         And last but not least,
             basil-pesto sauce. 

476
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,045
       And that's the Rex Crepe.

477
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:02,446
And why do you call it          
      the Rex?                  

478
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,915
        The Rex means "The King"
               in New Orleans.  

479
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,451
The Rex means "The King"?       

480
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,393
You've knocked this crepe       
  out of the park.              

481
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,761
     It's light,                
got a great texture to it.      

482
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,064
The basil cream sauce           
     is spot-on.                

483
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:24,202
I like the little inclusion     
  of the asparagus.             

484
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:25,536
   If you weren't               
in the crepe business,          

485
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,471
I would tell you to get         
into the barbecue business.     

486
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,073
That's competition tri-tip,     
    right there.                

487
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:31,075
       This is                  
a really good crepe.            

488
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,278
        Mmm.                    

489
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,412
           Rex Crepe!           

490
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,215
         It's delicious.        
   They're tri-tip's amazing.   

491
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,217
You get that nice smokey        
flavor coming through.          

492
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,685
  The crepe is nice and fluffy. 

493
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:41,952
         Big Easy Crepe.        

494
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,888
             Had you had crepes 
before you came to the Creperie?

495
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,423
I have in New Orleans.          

496
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:48,025
         And how do their crepes
                  compare?      

497
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,361
I feel like I'm back            
    in Louisiana.               

498
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,696
             FIERI:             
     And that's no accident.    

499
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:53,097
        The owners' love        
         of New Orleans         

500
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,732
 is stamped all over this joint.

501
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,968
 You've got the nice            
French Quarter vibe going on.   

502
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,769
               Oh, that patio   
            out there, for sure.

503
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,305
    Plus, they're serving up    
       a Big Easy classic       

504
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,907
  with their own added flavor.  

505
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:04,375
            MELISSA:            
      Beignets & Gravy up.      

506
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,443
     People aren't expecting    
      a country-type gravy      

507
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,845
          to be placed          
     over a French beignet.     

508
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,181
                We're making    
             our beignet batter.

509
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:13,250
  So we start it off with yeast.
           We add our hot water.

510
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,719
    So, not just                
  dry active yeast.             

511
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,520
      We've got                 
some real live yeast.           

512
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,323
               Yes. You put in  
              evaporating milk, 

513
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,525
                soybean oil,    
           a little bit of salt,

514
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,460
                  and then      
           you've got four eggs.

515
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,062
        Okay.                   

516
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:27,664
       And then you start adding
   your flour, little by little,

517
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,467
        get it all incorporated.

518
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:31,202
                  And then      
        we're gonna roll it out.

519
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:32,403
    Get after it.               

520
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:35,072
        You want it not too soft
              and not too firm. 

521
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:38,142
             Now we roll it out,
            cut it into squares,

522
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:39,544
                just like so.   

523
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:40,811
         They go in the freezer.

524
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,212
So they don't proof at all.     
     All right.                 

525
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,614
                We're making    
             our country gravy. 

526
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,149
                So we've got    
               our whole milk,  

527
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,751
            rub -- sage, pepper,
               little salt --   

528
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,354
   and we cooked off our sausage
               and our bacon.   

529
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,757
               Come to a boil.  
And then it'll just reduce down,

530
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,091
               and you've got   
             your country gravy.

531
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:56,226
   And then we fry              
    the beignets.               

532
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,762
              Two nice beignets 
is what you get with your order.

533
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,365
And then give it some good gravy
                  on there.     

534
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,034
                Here we are.    

535
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:08,105
Nice and light and fluffy.      
Tender, not overcooked.         

536
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:12,109
   Gravy's creamy,              
  not over-salted.              

537
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,911
Sage and gravy go together.     

538
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,713
  A lot of sausage,             
   a lot of bacon.              

539
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,182
That's a country breakfast      
if I've ever seen it.           

540
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:21,652
             We got             
      two Beignets & Gravy.     

541
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:24,121
      I would never have it     
       on biscuits again.       

542
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,457
         The perfect combination
             of sweet and salty.

543
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,125
   Just something new to try.   

544
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,726
            MELISSA:            
      Beignets. Jambalaya.      

545
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,996
       -I love this place.      
    -I'm glad you enjoyed it.   

546
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:34,198
        It's refreshing.        

547
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,668
   Excellent job.               
    Really nice.                

548
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,738
      So, was that another      
  righteous road trip or what?  

549
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,073
      But don't you worry,      
    we got plenty more joints   

550
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,742
 to find all over this country. 

551
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,410
         I'll be looking        
        for you next week       

552
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,679
     on "Diners, Drive-Ins,     
           and Dives."          

553
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:51,282
   How many people              
   take it to go?               

554
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:54,218
         A day, a week, a month?

555
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,487
Talk about interesting stuff.   
I'm just trying to eat.
