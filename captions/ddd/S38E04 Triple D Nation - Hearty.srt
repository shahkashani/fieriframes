1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:01,934
   You know, people are asking  
   me all the time, hey, Guy,   

2
00:00:01,936 --> 00:00:03,068
       that one joint you       
        checked out that        

3
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:06,137
  one city when you were doing  
   "Triple-D," how they do it?  

4
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:06,738
     You know, I don't know.    

5
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,107
     We should check it out.    

6
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:10,742
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
         Over the years,        

7
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,811
  I've seen and tasted it all.  

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,945
    This is ridiculous, dude.   

9
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,748
   GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): But   
    it turns out it was only    

10
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,549
         the beginning,         
       because "Triple-D"       

11
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,484
    joints have been blowing    
       up, and we're going      

12
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:21,153
   back to see what's cooking.  

13
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,489
       Like on this trip.       

14
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,556
              What?             

15
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:25,424
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
       We've got hearty--       

16
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:26,424
               Mm.              

17
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:26,825
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
           --heaping--          

18
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:27,625
               Mm.              

19
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:28,726
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
           --helpings.          

20
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:29,628
       We're going to have      
    trouble eating all those.   

21
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,629
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
          A Pittsburgh          

22
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:31,497
  joint serving local staples.  

23
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,432
        SERVER: Sausage,        
      biscuits, and gravy.      

24
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,499
  This is what we grew up with. 

25
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:35,900
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
      And family favorites.     

26
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:39,838
   That's one of the surprise   
 dishes I've had on "Triple-D." 

27
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,573
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
      A diner in Florida--      

28
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:42,574
        Did you say glob?       

29
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:43,908
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
   --getting their inspiration  

30
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:44,576
         from up North.         

31
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:45,911
         I feel like I'm        
        back home again.        

32
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,446
     I just can't get enough    
       of that matzo ball.      

33
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:49,647
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
        And in Oklahoma.        

34
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,917
      [chuckles] I love it.     

35
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:55,254
 GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): A second
  generation churning out chili 

36
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,721
   that would make dad proud.   

37
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,323
    SERVER: Frito chili pie.    

38
00:00:58,425 --> 00:00:59,792
       It's dynamite, man.      

39
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,727
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
   Familiar faces, new places,  

40
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,464
 and more off the hook flavors. 

41
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,032
   This is "Triple-D Nation."   

42
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:12,337
         [music playing]        

43
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,671
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
          Back in 2009,         

44
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,740
     I met this self-taught     
         diner owner who        

45
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,976
  dove headfirst into the biz.  

46
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:19,944
      Took out a small loan     
    and bought a little joint   

47
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:23,414
 in a strip mall, and turned it 
  into a neighborhood favorite. 

48
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:24,683
      KELLY O'CONNOR: Here      
        you are, ladies.        

49
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,618
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
    Now she's the number one    

50
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,420
 choice in two different hoods. 

51
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:29,388
   Got to check out KellyO's.   

52
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,357
   COOK: Plating the polenta.   

53
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:33,958
         Sausage, gravy         
        and biscuits up.        

54
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:37,763
     "Triple-D" and KellyO's    
   are a match made in heaven.  

55
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,498
   Perfect comfort food diner.  

56
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,767
       She was big before       
    "Triple-D" came to town.    

57
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,635
Her legend just grew after that.

58
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,571
   KELLY O'CONNOR: Here's your  
   KellyO's Pittsburgh chili.   

59
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,639
   GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): He's  
 talking about the one and only 

60
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,907
        Kelly O'Connor--        

61
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:49,908
         Kelly O, O, O.         

62
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,710
   GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): --a   
    fearless waitress turned    

63
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:54,980
      diner owner who threw     
      caution to the wind.      

64
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:55,980
          You come in.          

65
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:56,915
     You don't have any real    
      culinary experience.      

66
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,917
       You've been in the       
  restaurant industry forever.  

67
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,452
   And then you say, I'm just   
    going to open up my joint   

68
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,121
        and start serving       
      things I like to eat.     

69
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:03,989
              Yeah.             

70
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:06,324
        Nice to see you.        

71
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,392
      How long ago was it?      

72
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,593
              2009.             

73
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,529
   You're one of the original   
 gangsters of this whole thing. 

74
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,864
      I meet people all the     
       time, they'll say,       

75
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,532
      yeah, I went to that      
       funky little place.      

76
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,533
     It's out in Pittsburgh.    

77
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,535
       And I go KellyO's,       
      and it's like, yeah.      

78
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,604
      And I had the noodle      
       dish with the ka--       

79
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:19,470
       yeah, the haluski.       

80
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,605
              Yeah.             

81
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,341
        How long have you       
     been making this dish?     

82
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:23,275
         My whole life.         

83
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,409
      Some butter in there.     

84
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,476
 GUY FIERI: Some regular onions.

85
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:26,545
         KELLY O'CONNOR:        
        Boil the cabbage.       

86
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,946
     GUY FIERI: Just cooks.     
 No salt in the water, anything?

87
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:28,747
       KELLY O'CONNOR: No.      

88
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,616
       Nothing like a hot       
      warm cabbage facial.      

89
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:31,483
          Oh, I agree.          

90
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:32,550
       You ever try those       
         in the morning?        

91
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,685
            I agree.            
      It's great for pores.     

92
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,754
      And then just cut it.     

93
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,755
 Are you going to cut it for me?

94
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,423
        Whatever you want       
        there's sunshine.       

95
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,024
       KELLY O'CONNOR: OK.      

96
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:39,891
   Just julienne it. in there.  

97
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,492
          There you go.         
     Put it right in there.     

98
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,360
          In the pool?          

99
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:42,961
              Yeah.             

100
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,761
       it will caramelize.      

101
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,496
        It will turn like       
        brown, you know.        

102
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:46,364
             Dig it.            

103
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,299
       Garlic salt, bacon.      

104
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:49,034
         Lots of bacon.         

105
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,102
         GUY FIERI: How         
       much goes in here?       

106
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:51,703
    KELLY O'CONNOR: 10 ounces   
    of cooked chopped bacon.    

107
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,572
     GUY FIERI: I'm already     
     liking what I'm seeing.    

108
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:54,973
        Once you have it,       
      you won't forget it.      

109
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:57,342
 GUY FIERI: So some egg noodles 
    that are cooked al dente.   

110
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,912
     KELLY O'CONNOR: Just a     
      little Romano cheese.     

111
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,914
     GUY FIERI: You going to    
   hit a little bit on there?   

112
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:03,715
               Oh.              

113
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,850
        The first time I        
        ever had haluski.       

114
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:09,654
   That's one of the surprise   
 dishes I've had on "Triple-D." 

115
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,123
   That's exactly what I would  
     want to eat every day.     

116
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,058
             Really?            

117
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,992
         I'm making this        
    weekend when I get home.    

118
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,594
       I took haluski back      
     to California, made it     

119
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,863
         for my friends,        
       and everybody said       

120
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,666
there's no way it can taste this
  great, and it is that great.  

121
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,535
   Mom, I found a new haluski.  

122
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,604
    She's going to spank your   
     cabooski when she finds    

123
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,205
   out you love this haluski.   

124
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:28,207
            [laughs]            

125
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,676
   How are things at KellyOs?   

126
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:31,943
      Give me the rundown.      

127
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:36,414
  Well, since haluski, we have  
 made like a Pittsburgh platter 

128
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,950
        with haluski, and       
    pierogies, and kielbasa.    

129
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,554
  And then we have a Pittsburgh 
 chili, just a version of chili 

130
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,689
  with no beans, a lot of meat. 

131
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,158
      Pittsburgh chili up.      

132
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,492
       KELLY O'CONNOR: Our      
       homemade Pittsburgh      

133
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,895
 chili is made with hot sausage.

134
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,764
    We make it here in house,   
     a little bit of pepper,    

135
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:56,368
     a little bit of fennel,    
     sage, red pepper flake,    

136
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,903
        and it has a nice       
        kick spice to it.       

137
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:03,841
   We add ground chuck, green   
   pepper, red pepper, onion,   

138
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:07,646
      spices, chili powder,     
        cumin, red pepper       

139
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:11,717
    flake, and then once that   
  simmers, we add tomato sauce. 

140
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,586
     We serve our Pittsburgh    
    chili with a little side    

141
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,586
          of cornbread.         

142
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:16,421
        Pittsburgh chili.       

143
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:20,792
  It's a little bit spicy, but  
  no other seasoning is needed. 

144
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:24,395
       The flavors are so       
       perfectly married.       

145
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:25,364
       It's unbelievable.       

146
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,666
    You got three generations   
   working in the same joint.   

147
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:29,735
      You got your daughter     
          working here,         

148
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,737
    you got your son working    
 here, your mom's working here. 

149
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,339
       This is Judy, this       
         is Kelly's mom.        

150
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,206
               Hi.              

151
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,341
        Nice to meet you.       

152
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,209
           Hi, camera.          

153
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,411
    It's a family atmosphere.   

154
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,613
 They're going to recognize you.

155
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,682
That's what you want in a place.

156
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,350
         My whole family        
     comes down here to eat.    

157
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,218
       It's just wonderful      
        warm place to go.       

158
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,887
  You are definitely one of the 
  "Triple-D" family favorites.  

159
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,556
        KELLY O'CONNOR: I       
     came from a big family     

160
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,826
so I love making family recipes.

161
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:58,429
       It's like grandmas       
     in the kitchen cooking.    

162
00:04:58,432 --> 00:04:59,497
   Now, what else do you make?  

163
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:00,698
       I make fried mush.       

164
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:04,369
      My grandmother served     
    fried mush for breakfast.   

165
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,504
     You know what mush is?     
            Polenta.            

166
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:06,505
     I know what polenta is.    

167
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:07,572
        You call it mush?       

168
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:08,307
       Let's get it going.      

169
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,041
         A little bit of        
       salt, your polenta.      

170
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:10,842
    I'm in the stirring mode.   

171
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,511
       You want me to make      
        motorboat jumps?        

172
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:13,312
      KELLY O'CONNOR: Yeah.     

173
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:15,847
            Stir it.            

174
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,515
  Stir it, get it really thick, 
    and then you loaf pan it.   

175
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:18,449
          Cooled down.          

176
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:19,518
              Yup.              

177
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:22,387
       Slice it, deep fry       
      it until it's crispy.     

178
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,388
  Now what do you put on yours? 

179
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:24,656
         KELLY O'CONNOR:        
        Butter and syrup.       

180
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:27,325
  Butter and syrup on polenta?  

181
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,860
     Yeah, it's a breakfast.    

182
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:32,597
    I grew up, my grandmother   
      served it with syrup.     

183
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:33,932
            Oh, wow.            

184
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,466
              What?             

185
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:35,400
     Don't put that on mine.    

186
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,536
   I'm putting syrup on mine.   

187
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:40,072
     Oh, taste a little tiny    
     baby taste with syrup.     

188
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,674
            Quit it.            

189
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,011
     This is how you get it     
     going, with some bacon.    

190
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,347
               Mm.              

191
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,382
             Oh no.             

192
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:53,285
           Way better.          

193
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,686
           Way better.          

194
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:55,954
         KELLY O'CONNOR:        
       After Guy showed me      

195
00:05:56,022 --> 00:06:00,291
  how to do the fried mush with 
 the bacon, I put it on my menu 

196
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,359
       and people love it.      

197
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,760
      Guy's mush, table 12.     

198
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,497
   She makes the best polenta.  

199
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:06,764
      It's actually better      
     than my grandmother's.     

200
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:09,700
    All the items that we did   
  on "Triple-D," it has its own 

201
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,503
  specific section on the menu. 

202
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:12,704
        People come, they       
         want to try it.        

203
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,140
        Because Guy loved       
        it, they love it.       

204
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,511
 GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): Loved it
 so much, she had to multiply-- 

205
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,445
           I have two.          

206
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,046
         Oh, you're big         
        shotting it now.        

207
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,915
  GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): --and  
 make way for more on the menu. 

208
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,451
     That's winner, winner,     
      jerky pot pie dinner.     

209
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,652
         Sausage, gravy,        
        and biscuits up.        

210
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,020
  GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): Next.  

211
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:31,957
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
       I'm in Pittsburgh,       

212
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:36,427
  PA hanging with a self-taught 
    chef I met back in 2009.    

213
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,696
         Kelly O, O, O.         

214
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:38,697
  We were just getting started. 

215
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,565
 What were you, a year old then?

216
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:41,899
       You're like one of       
        the OGs, an owner       

217
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:43,835
          with a lot of         
    personality, a restaurant   

218
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,505
     with a great following     
      and unique food, food     

219
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,172
  that we don't see everywhere. 

220
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,709
 I've been cooking all my life, 
  I've never heard of haluski.  

221
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:53,378
     These things that Kelly    
     has on her menus, this     

222
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:54,579
    is what we grew up with.    

223
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,716
    Not only does Kelly have,   
     you know, normal food,     

224
00:06:57,718 --> 00:07:00,385
        but she has some        
       off the wall items.      

225
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,520
        COOK: Platter up.       

226
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,456
    GUY FIERI: Tell me about    
      turkey pot pie soup.      

227
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,858
      Start with a bone-in,     
        breast of turkey.       

228
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,195
        What do you do to       
     the turkey to roast it?    

229
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,662
          Um, nothing.          

230
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,732
        I didn't have any       
       culinary training.       

231
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,734
     You can just accentuate    
       this a little bit.       

232
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:18,737
   KELLY O'CONNOR: So I didn't  
     know all of the tricks     

233
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,473
  and the magic little secrets. 

234
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:22,807
          Make a little         
        bit of a dry rub.       

235
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,277
    A little seasoning salt,    
     little bit of parsley,     

236
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:26,478
  basil in, that won't hurt us. 

237
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,746
     Paprika, garlic powder.    

238
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:29,881
        KELLY O'CONNOR: I       
       was really honored       

239
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:32,951
   that he would take the time  
     to show me a few tricks    

240
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:33,685
          that he has.          

241
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,887
         I don't debling        
       just for everybody.      

242
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,423
    Now you get up underneath   
  that turkey skin, like this.  

243
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:39,491
KELLY O'CONNOR: All right, yeah.

244
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,825
     GUY FIERI: See how the     
      seasoning is sitting      

245
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,494
    off, sitting on the meat.   

246
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,829
        I'll go ahead and       
     throw some onions down     

247
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,831
   in there, carrots in there.  

248
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,900
         KELLY O'CONNOR:        
       We roast 3 and 1/2       

249
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,504
  hours, get it nice and golden 
  brown, boil off the carcass.  

250
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:54,439
     GUY FIERI: With all the    
    veggies that we roasted,    

251
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:55,640
   simmer in a bunch of water.  

252
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,776
       Get a little flavor      
    in the broth, strain it.    

253
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,511
    GUY FIERI: Now we're left   
     with our turkey stock.     

254
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:00,912
      KELLY O'CONNOR: I add     
     the celery and onions.     

255
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,914
     How long is this going     
    to sit there and simmer?    

256
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:03,648
           10 minutes?          

257
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,383
   Now ready for the potatoes?  

258
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:06,318
      Frozen vegetables in.     

259
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,452
       GUY FIERI: That's a      
      heaping helping, huh?     

260
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,786
     I'll give it to you on     
     the frozen veggie thing    

261
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,855
       because that's kind      
     of what people expect.     

262
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,791
     All the turkey that we     
      pick from the bones,      

263
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,526
    we'll make a little roux.   
           OK, ready?           

264
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,593
   Now we're going to go down.  

265
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:16,595
       It's thickening up.      

266
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,330
    That's just my two cents.   

267
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,531
     I like your two cents.     

268
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,600
        And we still use        
        that to this day.       

269
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:23,935
        I made pie crust.       

270
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,538
   GUY FIERI: Mm, that's just   
  creamy goodness right there.  

271
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,873
       I mean, that tastes      
         like a baked--         

272
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:28,940
            Pot pie?            

273
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,276
      Yeah, that's winner,      
 winner, turkey pot pie dinner. 

274
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:31,876
           Thank you.           

275
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:32,744
            Good job.           

276
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:35,479
         Turkey pot pie         
     soup, it's phenomenal.     

277
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,814
       Really, really one       
        of my favorites.        

278
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,750
 You just keep evolving, you're 
   just going to keep getting   

279
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,553
 bigger, and badder, and better.

280
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,021
      Rumor has it, you've      
        done another one.       

281
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:43,555
              Yep.              

282
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:44,689
     KellyO's in the strip.     

283
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,824
So I'm right in the heart of the
  strip district of Pittsburgh, 

284
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,693
          which is now          
      booming and growing.      

285
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,829
      Super awesome to have     
 KellyO's in the city down here.

286
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,499
       Both locations are       
       packed constantly.       

287
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,233
      That's for a reason.      

288
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,970
         Oh, you're big         
        shotting it now.        

289
00:08:59,039 --> 00:08:59,637
           I like it.           

290
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,306
Take it and run with it, sister.

291
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,307
      It's been a blessing.     

292
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,308
   I'm so happy to hear that.   

293
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,442
   It's been such a blessing.   

294
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:05,777
        And what are the        
      big hits on the menu?     

295
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,646
    KELLY O'CONNOR: Sausage,    
      gravy, and biscuits.      

296
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,847
   That's your claim to fame?   

297
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,049
   KELLY O'CONNOR: Here's your  
  sausage, gravy, and biscuits. 

298
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,585
My papa handed down this recipe.

299
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,854
       We use our homemade      
         sweet sausage.         

300
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:18,523
       We add fresh thyme,      
        the heavy cream,        

301
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,326
       and then we tighten      
     it up with the slurry.     

302
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,727
 Our biscuits are made in house.

303
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:25,530
        We start off with       
       flour, sugar, salt,      

304
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:28,466
      baking powder, cream      
     of tartar, and then we     

305
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,735
 incorporate the frozen butter. 

306
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,537
        And then add your       
        egg, buttermilk,        

307
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,007
   and mix that all together.   

308
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,409
      You pat that out, and     
   then you cut your biscuits   

309
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:42,414
      and bake them at 450.     

310
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,549
  Sausage, biscuits, and gravy. 

311
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,284
   She makes her own sausage.   

312
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:47,318
    It's perfectly seasoned.    

313
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:48,086
         It's delicious.        

314
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,621
        Sausages like all       
      into the white sauce,     

315
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:53,358
 and her biscuits are homemade, 
   and they're really fluffy.   

316
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,160
       You don't even need      
         butter on them.        

317
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,995
         It's so yummy.         

318
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,566
        GUY FIERI: Great        
       story, great visit.      

319
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,668
      KELLY O'CONNOR: It's      
    been an amazing journey.    

320
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,503
       Just unbelievable.       

321
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:07,372
         The people from        
       all over the world.      

322
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:08,372
     Dude, I'm world famous.    

323
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,174
      You are world famous.     

324
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:09,641
            You are.            

325
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,109
        I'm world famous.       

326
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:11,643
           You did it.          

327
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:13,244
     I appreciate you guys.     

328
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,112
              Mwah.             

329
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,181
            KellyO's.           

330
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:17,215
            [laughs]            

331
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,251
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
           Coming up--          

332
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,318
            [laughs]            

333
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:22,186
   GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): --a   
    fan favorite in Florida--   

334
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:22,854
       It's the real deal.      

335
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,055
   Show's kind of right here.   

336
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,658
 GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): --still 
  serving up New York staples.  

337
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,860
          I haven't had         
        a lot of knishes,       

338
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,663
   but the ones that I've had   
     do not compare to that.    

339
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:32,731
           Delicious.           

340
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:33,531
      Here are your latkes.     

341
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,399
             Enjoy.             

342
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,705
      You know, diners come     
     in every shape or size.    

343
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,874
   I think we've seen that as   
    we toured with "Triple-D"   

344
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,075
       around the country.      

345
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,878
We've seen our freestanding ones
  and the ones in strip malls.  

346
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,748
      Today, I got a combo      
   joint, a diner bakery deli.  

347
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:50,882
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
           This place           

348
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:53,551
         was dishing out        
    traditional Jewish foods    

349
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,352
   with serious New York cred.  

350
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:55,886
       It's the real deal.      

351
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:56,821
       It's the real deal.      

352
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,689
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
     And since 2009, they've    

353
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,692
 blown up all around the state. 

354
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,628
          We've got to          
      check out Flakowitz.      

355
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:06,631
         [music playing]        

356
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:10,368
    As a "Triple-D" die hard,   
  I saw Guy came to Flakowitz,  

357
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,635
      and I started coming.     

358
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,370
     Didn't steer me wrong.     

359
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,439
      Everything's so good.     

360
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,708
      Being a boy that grew     
      up in Brooklyn where      

361
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,510
        all this type of        
        food is famous, I       

362
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,712
 feel like I'm back home again. 

363
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,246
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
           Which makes          

364
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:25,516
   sense because owner, Robert  
 Pirozzi, is from New York too. 

365
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:26,718
  I wanted to move to Florida.  

366
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,887
     So I called my dad and     
     asked him to come down.    

367
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,589
       I wanted to get him      
        out of the cold.        

368
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,590
     Wait, wait, wait, wait.    

369
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:33,792
        You wanted to get       
      him out of the cold,      

370
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:37,462
   or you just knew that that   
   madman could bake anything.  

371
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:38,729
    ROBERT PIROZZI: Correct.    

372
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,731
       GUY FIERI: Because       
        your pops was one       

373
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,534
      of the premier Jewish     
   pastry bakers in the area.   

374
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:44,602
        Without a doubt.        

375
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,604
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
      That would be Angelo.     

376
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:47,272
      You know how to skip.     

377
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,272
             - Yeah.            
         - You remember?        

378
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,140
               OK.              

379
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:49,541
         So let's skip.         

380
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,343
           [laughter]           

381
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,345
         Before you guys        
       came, my father had      

382
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:55,880
  no clue what "Triple-D" was.  

383
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,282
       He just thought it       
      was just another one      

384
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,617
   of my harebrained schemes.   

385
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:00,819
            [laughs]            

386
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,887
         And we're going        
      to make the knishes.      

387
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,088
        This is pre-boil.       

388
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,657
   I'm going to start chopping  
   them into little sections.   

389
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,626
      Add the onions to it.     

390
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,628
        This is the white       
         pepper, garlic.        

391
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:11,896
        GUY FIERI: I call       
         that vitamin G.        

392
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:12,897
            Yeah, OK.           

393
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,565
       And this is a salt.      
 GUY FIERI: All right, be quiet.

394
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:15,433
          I heard you.          

395
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:16,568
           [chuckles]           

396
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,568
       ANGELO PIROZZI: Now      
       this is the butter.      

397
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:18,636
        I'm not going to        
        put all of it in.       

398
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,638
        I'm going to cube       
      this up a little bit.     

399
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,506
      I didn't think we're      
       putting it all in.       

400
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:23,341
        We might as well.       

401
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,445
    So what temperature this    
   is going to be in the oven?  

402
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:30,515
         About 350, 375.        

403
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,383
           [laughter]           

404
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,856
  GUY FIERI: Where-- the show-- 
 the show's kind of right here. 

405
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,526
    My father, he just wanted   
      to get the work done,     

406
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,495
       and Guy was fooling      
        around with him.        

407
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,729
   ANGELO PIROZZI: We're going  
   to put the potato mixture.   

408
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:46,798
         GUY FIERI: Into        
       the mixture, right.      

409
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,600
       ANGELO PIROZZI: We       
     put the sour cream in.     

410
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:49,534
 GUY FIERI: So are we done now? 

411
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:50,401
         ANGELO PIROZZI:        
       Yeah, this is done.      

412
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,669
       It's mixed enough?       

413
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:53,671
  ANGELO PIROZZI: I'm going to  
 take one piece of phyllo dough,

414
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,674
        at a time coated        
      with butter, fold it,     

415
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:58,743
    and then you're going to    
    put a nice glob in there.   

416
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,145
  GUY FIERI: Did you say glob?  

417
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:01,613
          I like that.          

418
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:02,814
    OK, let me jump in here.    

419
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,150
   ANGELO PIROZZI: Very good,   
 should we sign them up or what?

420
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,618
         Beautiful, Guy.        

421
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,153
  And then I wash it with eggs. 

422
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,488
 GUY FIERI: To get a nice sheen?
     ANGELO PIROZZI: Right.     

423
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,489
GUY FIERI: It'll go in the oven.

424
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,224
       ANGELO PIROZZI: For      
        about 20 minutes.       

425
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,692
    GUY FIERI: We're going to   
  have trouble eating all this. 

426
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:15,893
        Is there a method       
        of eating it or?        

427
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,029
       ANGELO PIROZZI: Try      
     with a little mustard.     

428
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,832
           Delicious.           

429
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,367
 I haven't had a lot of knishes,
   but the ones that I've had,  

430
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,302
     do not compare to that.    

431
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:25,637
         Oh, thank you.         

432
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,572
       Since the last time      
       you guys were here,      

433
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,308
          my dad, he's          
      retired, but we sell      

434
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,443
 more knishes than we can make. 

435
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,711
         It's fantastic.        

436
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,780
      So we saw the potato      
  knishes on the first episode, 

437
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,648
      and we said OK, what      
        else does he have       

438
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,384
 in the potato end of the world?

439
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,520
        SERVER: And here        
       your latkes, enjoy.      

440
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,389
         The latkes are         
       out of this world.       

441
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:45,789
    Truthfully, I love them.    

442
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:46,857
       ROBERT PIROZZI: To       
      do our potato latke,      

443
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:50,528
   you get the boiled potatoes  
     and then white onions.     

444
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,996
        We grind them in        
       the Buffalo chopper      

445
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:56,668
    and we add white pepper,    
    salt, and garlic powder.    

446
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,937
   And we grind that up until   
  we get the right consistency. 

447
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,674
  Through that, we're going to  
add eggs, matzo mill, and flour.

448
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,676
       And we're going to       
       mix that until it's      

449
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,612
   a very smooth consistency.   

450
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,413
      We're going to spoon      
      them out and fry them     

451
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,182
  until they're a golden brown. 

452
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,285
  SERVER: Here are your latkes. 

453
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:18,489
    Very fresh on the inside,   
   very crispy on the outside,  

454
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:19,823
       and very delicious       
         to your palate.        

455
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:21,693
       It's a traditional       
          Jewish food.          

456
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,695
         Is a little bit        
       like a hash brown.       

457
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,330
     So thick, it's amazing.    

458
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,833
      ROBERT PIROZZI: Last      
       time Guy was here,       

459
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:33,704
   we made traditional Jewish   
    dishes, stuffed cabbage.    

460
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,773
  Mm, we have matzo ball soup,  

461
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,909
      Mm, I just can't get      
   enough of that matzo ball.   

462
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:39,843
        There are so many       
        different things.       

463
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,446
        You sit down and        
        look at the menu,       

464
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,247
      and you say, what am      
      I going to do today?      

465
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,783
     The sloppy Joe here at     
     Flakowitz is delicious.    

466
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:46,984
         ROBERT PIROZZI:        
        Our sloppy Joe is       

467
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,719
 not like a regular sloppy Joe. 

468
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:52,323
     It's more like a Reuben    
      and it's a big mess.      

469
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,424
           [chuckles]           

470
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,729
  To make corned beef, we boil  
 brisket with a pickling spice, 

471
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:01,532
    and then we put it in the   
 steamer for three, four hours. 

472
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,533
           To make our          
      sandwich, we're going     

473
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:03,935
       to take four ounces      
         of corned beef         

474
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:08,539
  and four ounces of pastrami,  
   take a dollop of coleslaw,   

475
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,408
       and put it right in      
      the middle, and then      

476
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,010
     we're going to roll it.    

477
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,679
  Then we're going to take some 
   Russian dressing and Swiss   

478
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,347
 cheese, put it on the sandwich.

479
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,885
 Here's your sloppy Joe on rye. 

480
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:24,756
    Corned beef and pastrami    
  is tender, not overly spiced, 

481
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,825
    but just a combination of   
   different types of textures  

482
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:28,959
      and really delicious.     

483
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,029
   The pastrami and the corned  
  beef are actually very light. 

484
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:34,632
     And it's lean meat, and    
   it's just very, very tasty.  

485
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,635
  It's just like you would get  
 in a great New York restaurant.

486
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:41,072
    He was able to bring that   
  right here to South Florida.  

487
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,844
         Since 2009, the        
     business has rocketed.     

488
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:52,317
   We've opened up five cafes,  
 another location in Boca Raton.

489
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:52,917
        What a pleasure.        

490
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:53,718
       What a great place.      

491
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,253
         Thank you very         
      much, appreciate it.      

492
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:56,154
      Thank you very much.      

493
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,857
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
   And coming up in Oklahoma,   

494
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:02,727
    a family dinner featuring   
   their award-winning chili--  

495
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:03,995
      Two-time state champ.     
               Mm.              

496
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:06,330
   GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): --on  
     all kinds of creations.    

497
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,398
      There's a chili dog.      

498
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,466
    SERVER: Frito chili pie.    

499
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:09,600
    MAN: Chili on the fries.    

500
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,035
       It's all so great.       

501
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:15,006
  You know, one of my favorite  
  things about doing "Triple-D" 

502
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:18,542
  is cruising Main Street, Main 
  Street of small town America. 

503
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:19,677
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
          That was back         

504
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,146
       in 2009 in Norman,       
         Oklahoma, where        

505
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:26,417
  I found the Main Street Diner 
 serving up more than just eggs.

506
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,552
        Southside Burger.       

507
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:28,952
       You get A in chili       
     cheese fries, student.     

508
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:31,422
   GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): Now,  
    a new generation's taking   

509
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,557
   over the family-run joint.   

510
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,027
      Welcome to the diner      
      they call The Diner.      

511
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:38,830
         "Triple-D" came        
      down here, and I can      

512
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:40,697
          tell you it's         
     definitely a place that    

513
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,366
  is worth being on their show. 

514
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,702
   It's just that place where   
    you feel like you're home   

515
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,570
 and you're part of a community.

516
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,740
      It really is its own      
   little family-run business.  

517
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,576
 GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): A family
 that was run by this character,

518
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:54,445
         Mark Amspacher.        

519
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:55,380
   Think it's going to be hot?  

520
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:56,280
         It's a hot dog.        

521
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,117
         Two men enter.         

522
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,584
         One man leaves.        

523
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,954
         Welcome to The         
       Diner Thunderdome.       

524
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,657
      Dude, that's winner,      
     winner hot-dog dinner.     

525
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,127
       [laughs] I love it.      

526
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,998
  GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): Sadly, 
    Mark passed away in 2010.   

527
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,536
 But his legacy isn't forgotten,
 thanks to his daughter, Bonnie.

528
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,538
    My dad had very definite    
      opinions about food.      

529
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:24,876
    And he taught me all his    
  secrets and all the recipes,  

530
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:25,809
         like burgers--         

531
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,411
       SERVER: I've got a       
      chicken-fried steak.      

532
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:28,479
          --and chili.          

533
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:29,880
      Award-winning chili.      

534
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,216
       Oh, I like how you       
    threw that in so smooth.    

535
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:33,350
         Well, you know.        

536
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,019
    5 pounds of ground beef.    

537
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:35,953
         A little 80-20?        

538
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:38,022
      So you're gonna cook      
      that meat down first?     

539
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,689
               No.              

540
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,625
  It's all gonna mesh together. 

541
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,825
      Some diced tomatoes.      

542
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,428
        We're just gonna        
       dump everything in?      

543
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,428
              Yep.              

544
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,429
      That's how we do it.      

545
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:48,633
       Two-times Oklahoma       
      State chili champion.     

546
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,701
     Then I will stand down.    

547
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,170
      I wouldn't question.      

548
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:52,970
               I--              

549
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:53,871
            You know?           

550
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:58,642
    We're gonna to put about    
   a cup of dark chili powder   

551
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,445
 in there, fresh pureed garlic. 

552
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:02,713
         You can't make         
      chili without some--      

553
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:03,781
     MARK AMSPACHER: Cumino.    
       GUY FIERI: --cumin.      

554
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:04,849
   I like where this is going.  

555
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,717
     I mean, you got all the    
   right ingredients in here.   

556
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,651
    Where's the heat coming?    

557
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,452
      We're gonna any heat?     

558
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:09,386
        Oh, there we go.        

559
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,387
          Crushed red.          

560
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,256
          Whoa, I love          
       your real precise,       

561
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:12,857
    scientific measurements.    

562
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:13,791
           Thank you.           

563
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,460
       Salt, ground black       
     pepper, a little sugar.    

564
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,328
       Put the buffer on.       

565
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:18,596
        Smoothing it out.       

566
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,865
     Now, kick this around,     
         get it started.        

567
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,400
       And you want to try      
      and keep it covered.      

568
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,536
       About 2 hours into       
         cooking, I like        

569
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,673
to put a couple more tablespoons
      of each of the spices     

570
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,542
 to be sure it's nice and tasty.

571
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,478
       3 hours later, this      
        is what you get.        

572
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:34,545
  GUY FIERI: Look at that, man. 

573
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:35,546
          There you go.         

574
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:36,380
         There's chili.         

575
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,282
               Mm.              

576
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:39,417
       It's dynamite, man.      

577
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:40,618
You know what I'm talking about?

578
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,485
MARK AMSPACHER: I'm hearing you.

579
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:42,620
        You're picking up       
      what I'm laying down?     

580
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,223
        I'm smelling what       
       you're stepping in.      

581
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,824
       That's kind of the       
   Oklahoma version of picking  

582
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,426
      what I'm laying down.     
  MARK AMSPACHER: There you go. 

583
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:49,760
        My dad was really       
       proud of his chili.      

584
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:50,895
  A little bit of heat in that. 

585
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:51,829
            A little.           

586
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:55,499
     And he was happy to get    
     to show it to America.     

587
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:56,967
 That's really good chili, bro. 

588
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,703
        And now it's also       
       on the Indian taco.      

589
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,572
         If you're from         
        Norman, Oklahoma,       

590
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,307
        you know that The       
      Diner's a great place     

591
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,508
     to get an Indian taco.     

592
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,043
       It's so delicious.       

593
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:06,644
        It's a favorite.        

594
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,146
    I just love the frybread.   

595
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,583
      It's a simple dough,      
      flour, baking powder,     

596
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,518
      salt, and warm milk.      

597
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,054
    We mix that up and let it   
    proof for a couple hours.   

598
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,990
  Once it's proofed, we can now 
   roll it out and flatten it.  

599
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:23,761
 We'll put the frybread into the
 fryer until it's golden brown. 

600
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:28,799
Once the frybread is done, we're
   ready to assemble our taco.  

601
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,735
        We start with our       
        house-made beans.       

602
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,937
       Then we'll add our       
       world-famous chili.      

603
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:35,873
     We'll top it with some     
  onions, cheese, and lettuce,  

604
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,342
      a little more cheese      
        and some tomato,        

605
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,212
   green onion, and jalapeno.   

606
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:42,012
          Indian taco.          

607
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,014
        The Indian taco?        

608
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,416
      Nice, zesty, not too      
   spicy, good amount of meat,  

609
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,151
  and a really delicious meal.  

610
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,486
        I'd recommend it.       

611
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,688
      The richness of that      
  bread-- and it's kind of like 

612
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,490
        the texture of a        
     freshly made doughnut,     

613
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,625
    then the beans and chili.   

614
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,759
       It's all so great.       

615
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,496
    Your leading character in   
 this, of course, is that chili,

616
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,397
      two-time state champ.     

617
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:03,768
      After the show aired,     
      we were really busy.      

618
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,238
      I didn't ever imagine     
     that it would be such,     

619
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,706
     like, a huge onslaught.    

620
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,243
   It brought a lot of people   
   in from all over the place.  

621
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,277
    I'm here at least weekly.   

622
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:18,515
     I feel a real sense of     
     connection with my dad,    

623
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,518
        cooking his food        
        in this building.       

624
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,389
      And he was happy that     
     Guy liked his cooking.     

625
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:26,724
   And it meant a lot to him.   

626
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,459
      You gonna [inaudible]     
       spark that Camaro?       

627
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,327
    We'll be here for a week.   

628
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,328
              Sure.             

629
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,128
       Nice job, brother.       

630
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:34,799
       Here you go, folks.      

631
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,533
       MARK AMSPACHER: But      
    those are the only places   

632
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:39,604
   dishing out hearty helpings  
     of your favorite foods.    

633
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,672
 Sausage gravy and biscuits up. 

634
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:44,408
       We got plenty more       
   joints to look back on all   

635
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,076
   over the "Triple-D" nation.  

636
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:46,744
          Interesting.          

637
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,278
  Maybe we could open up a spa. 

638
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:49,747
      All right, after it's     
 actually baked, we put it in-- 

639
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,749
       He's not even going      
        to pay attention        

640
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:52,683
    to any of my one-liners.    

641
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,418
      Just right past him.      

642
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,620
           [laughter]           

643
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,354
        He's a jet liner,       
        and I'm a pigeon.       

644
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,489
         Just a-- whoo.         

645
00:20:58,491 --> 00:20:59,357
           All right.
