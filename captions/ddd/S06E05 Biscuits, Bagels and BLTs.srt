              THEY'RE DELICIOUS.

205
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,171
FOOD'S A PASSION.               

206
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,972
  FOR ME, THE THRILL IS REALLY  
SEARCHING OUT GREAT INGREDIENTS,

SOFT-SHELL CRAB BLT.            

211
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,317
             THE BLT's NOT GOOD 
              ENOUGH BY ITSELF. 

212
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:08,386
           WE'RE GONNA MAKE ONE 
           WITH SOFT-SHELL CRAB.

IT'S GOT A LITTLE BIT           
OF GRANULATED GARLIC            

215
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,858

217
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:17,395
I THINK THAT'S GOOD.            

218
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,397
DROP 'EM IN, TWO PER ORDER      
      AND TWO SIDES.            
                           OKAY.

219
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,332
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GO RIGHT   
INTO SOME ORGANIC BUTTERMILK.   

220
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,801
          AND THEN MORE FLOUR   
       STICKS TO THE BUTTERMILK.
WE'RE USING CAKE FLOUR          
     FOR FRYING.                

221
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,803
       'CAUSE CAKE FLOUR ALMOST 
         HAS NO GLUTEN TO IT,   

222
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,805
         SO IT'S NICE AND LIGHT.
AND THEN SLOWLY                 
 DROP THAT IN.                  

223
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,674
             DREDGE 'EM DOWN IN.

ORGANIC SOURDOUGH BREAD.        

225
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,945

THROUGH THE HEIRLOOM TOMATO.    

226
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,014
           LOOK AT HOW BEAUTIFUL
                 THAT IS.       

227
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,216
  SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE OUR CRABS 
    AND DRAIN 'EM RIGHT AWAY,   

228
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,285
  'CAUSE OIL ON THE SURFACE     
WILL GO FROM CRISPY TO SOGGY    

229
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,687
IN JUST A SECOND.               

230
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,823
TAKE OUR BACON.                 
        THIS ISN'T GONNA BE BAD,
             I CAN TELL YA.     

231
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:47,759
WE USE GARLIC-BASIL AIOLI THAT  
WE MAKE HERE, ROASTED GARLIC.   

232
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:50,761
WE USE THAI BASIL.              
    I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
         SWEETER NOTE TO IT.    

233
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:54,132
A COUPLE NICE PIECES OF TOMATO, 
       ORGANIC LETTUCE,         

234
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:57,168
BACON, THESE CRABS.             
     AND THERE WILL BE A TRASH  
   COMPACTOR TO SMUSH IT DOWN...

235
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,170
(imitating trash compactor)     
                 SO I CAN GET IT
                   IN MY FACE.  

236
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:01,305
        CRAB CLAWS--            
THEY'RE GONNA BE OUR "GARNY."   

237
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,842
AND WE'RE GONNA PART THIS       
 RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE.         

238
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:08,113
                         NICE.  

239
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,247
                    OH, HO.     
               THAT'S FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU.                      

240
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:11,783
         THE CRUNCH IS PERFECT. 

241
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,718
            THE HEIRLOOM TOMATO 
           IS SO NICE AND SWEET.

242
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,720
                  NOW I'VE MADE 
                 A LOT OF BLTs. 

243
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,722
        I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER 
      PUT SOFT-SHELL CRAB IN IT,

244
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,358
         BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT
         THE PICTURE'S CHANGED. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.            

245
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,461
        KEEP AN EYE ON THIS GUY.
 THE COMBINATION IS DELICIOUS.  
        IT'S EXCELLENT.         

246
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:24,930
        IT'S SPECTACULAR.       

247
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,231
       EVEN THE BASIC STUFF HERE
        IS REALLY, REALLY GOOD. 

248
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,201

       THE CLASSICAL DINER FARE 

251
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,207
         SO SOMETHING, LIKE, UH,
         OUT THERE ON THE EDGE. 

252
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,209
  AHI POT STICKERS--            
A BIT OUT ON THE EDGE.          

253
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,144
      THOSE POT STICKERS--      
      NOBODY CAN BEAT THAT.     

254
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,613
SO LET'S GET THIS GOING.        
                      ALL RIGHT.

255
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,748
THIS IS SUSHI-GRADE AHI.        
       THIS IS NUMBER ONE, BABY.

256
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,151
       THAT LOOKS LIKE          
GOOD-BYE-FINGERTIP CHOPPING.    

257
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,219
           WHERE THIS LOOKS LIKE
            I'M JUST CHOPPING,  

258
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,622
      IT IS REALLY PASSING      
 THROUGH THE FISH IN A NICE WAY 

259
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,690
       THAT'S KEEPING A LOT     
   OF THE CELL STRUCTURE INTACT.

260
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,026
            WE'RE GONNA ADD THIS
               INTO THE BOWL.   
OKAY.                           

261
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,096
                  WE'RE GONNA   
                ADD THE TRINITY.
    THE TRINITY                 
IN JAPANESE COOKING.            

262
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,498
          FRESH CHOPPED GARLIC, 
          GINGER, GREEN ONIONS. 

263
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,900
         A LITTLE BIT MORE HERE.
OKAY.                           

264
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,902
                 AND THEN MIRIN.
JAPANESE COOKING WINE--         

265
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,904
A LITTLE BIT SWEET.             
                      RICE WINE.

266
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:09,507
CORNSTARCH TO TIGHTEN.          
      CORNSTARCH. WE'RE GONNA DO
      A LITTLE BIT OF EGG WHITE.

267
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:11,710
        MIX THIS ALL UP WITH    
     A LITTLE BIT OF SOY SAUCE. 

268
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,845
    MY MOUTH'S                  
STARTING TO WATER.              
                WE REALLY WANT  
              THE TUNA TO SHINE.

269
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,847
                   THOROUGHLY   
                 COMBINE THERE. 

270
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:19,317
                    OUR SAUCE   
                 IS VERY SIMPLE.
   WELL, AND THAT'S A REAL      
JAPANESE PHILOSOPHY ABOUT FOOD  

271
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:20,851
IS LESS IS MORE.                

272
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,387
       START OFF                
WITH GREAT INGREDIENTS,         

273
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:23,788
USE 'EM THE RIGHT WAY,          

274
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,391
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO DOCTOR 'EM
  WITH A BUNCH OF EXTRA STUFF.  

275
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,393
  SO THIS IS GONNA              
BE THE DIPPING SAUCE.           

276
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,395
 SO I ASSUME A LITTLE RICE WINE 
     VINEGAR, SOME SOY SAUCE    

277
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,397
AND SOME SESAME OIL?            
                  AMEN, BROTHER.
                    YOU GOT IT. 

278
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,266
FANTASTIC. ARE WE MAKING        
THE PASTA FOR THAT, TOO?        
                         WE ARE.

279
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,135
OHH, LOVE THAT.                 

280
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,204
                  WE'RE GONNA   
               MIX CAKE FLOUR...
WHAT WAS THE OTHER FLOUR        
   YOU'RE POPPING IN?           

281
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,740
                   ALL-PURPOSE. 

282
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:44,476
 WE'RE GONNA CRACK SOME ORGANIC 
   BROWN EGGS INTO THE WATER.   

283
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,478
             WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT
              JUST A NICE MIX,  

284
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,480
       AND WE'RE GONNA FLAVOR IT
         WITH SOME SEA SALT--   

285
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,014
               ALWAYS SEASONING.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.               

286
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,617
              WE DON'T HAVE     
         TO MIX THIS BY--OH. OH!
OH, NO. COME ON.                

287
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,485
SO THE FLOUR                    
JUST GOES IN.                   

288
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,821
WE'RE GONNA TURN IT ON          
     FOR A SECOND.              

289
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,223
 GONNA GO BACK AND FORTH SLOWLY 
       TO MIX IN THE WET.       

290
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,359
TAKE A LOOK. WE WANT TO MAKE    
SURE IT'S CLUMPING TOGETHER.    

291
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,361
               CRAZY HOW YOU CAN
                 JUST TOUCH IT  

292
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:06,297
                AND GET AN IDEA 
               OF WHERE HE'S AT.
THESE ARE TRADITIONAL           
  ITALIAN BRASS DIES            

293
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,767
 THAT'LL GIVE SURFACE ABRASIONS 
     THAT'LL HOLD THE SAUCE.    

294
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,236
   KIND OF GIVES YOU THAT LITTLE
      BIT OF DUSTY, RAW FEEL.

QUICKLY, IT WILL DRY OUT.       

303
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,186
     SO WE'RE GONNA USE NATURE'S

304
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,722

305
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,724

     CUT THAT DOWN INTO SHEETS, 

306
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:35,593
  AND I'M JUST GONNA STACK IT UP
      IN A CUT DEAL, LIKE SO.   

307
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,595

315
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,082

    ORGANIC CLARIFIED BUTTER.   

316

 WHEN WE COOK IT.               
         LAY A LITTLE BASE DOWN.

490
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,218
THIS IS PREBOILED.              

491
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:43,287
I'M GONNA START CHOPPIN' 'EM    
    INTO LITTLE SECTIONS.       

492
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,023
               AND WE'RE LEAVIN'
                 THE SKINS ON?  
YES, THAT'S VERY HEALTHY.       

493
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:49,360
YOU ADD THE ONIONS TO IT.       
THIS IS THE WHITE PEPPER.       

494
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,495
GARLIC.                         
        I CALL THAT VITAMIN "G."

495
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:53,764
     YEAH, OKAY.                
AND THIS IS THE SALT.           
         "ALL RIGHT, BE QUIET"--

496
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,433
                     I HEARD YA.
(chuckles)                      

497
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,835
     NOW THIS IS THE BUTTER.    
 I'M NOT GONNA PUT ALL OF IT IN.

498
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,970
I'M GONNA CUBE THIS UP          
     A LITTLE BIT.              

499
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:04,107
          I DIDN'T THINK WE WERE
            PUTTING IT ALL IN.  
WE MIGHT AS WELL.               

500
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,844
MIX IT ALL UP.                  
        WHAT TEMPERATURE IS THIS
         GONNA BE IN THE OVEN?  

501
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,846
UH, ABOUT 350.                  

502
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:11,849
   WE'RE GONNA PUT              
THE POTATO MIXTURE...           
                 INTO THE MIXER.

503
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,051
                 RIGHT. WE PUT  
              THE SOUR CREAM IN.

504
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,920
BY THE HANDFUL.                 
                 BY THE HANDFUL.

505
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,855
SO ARE WE DONE NOW?             
             YEAH, THIS IS DONE.

506
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,856
GET MIXED ENOUGH?               
        ONE, TWO, THREE, AND GO.

507
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,259
WELL, WE HAVE TO DO IT          
  TOGETHER, THOUGH.             
                OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

508
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:24,995
            ONE, TWO, THREE, GO.
THREE, GO.                      

509
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:27,064
OKAY. SEE?                      

510
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,934
  YOU'RE LUCKY                  
I'M HERE TODAY.                 
               YEAH, I NEED YOU.

511
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,404
       I REALLY FELT            
THE SINCERITY IN THAT ONE.      

512
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:37,074
 I'M GONNA TAKE ONE PIECE       
OF PHYLLO DOUGH AT A TIME,      

513
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,677
COAT IT WITH BUTTER,            
      FOLD IT,                  

514
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:43,080
 AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA          
PUT A NICE GLOB IN THERE.       
             DID YOU SAY "GLOB"?

515
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,483
(chuckles)                      
             I LIKE THAT.       
      OKAY, LET ME JUMP IN HERE.

516
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:48,019
ALL RIGHT, GOOD. SHOULD         
WE SIGN 'EM UP, OR WHAT?        

517
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:50,021
              WHAT DO YOU THINK?
BEAUTIFUL, GUY.                 

518
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,757
      AND THEN                  
I WASH IT WITH EGGS.            
        SO IT GETS A NICE SHEEN.

519
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,225
RIGHT.                          
             YOU PUT ON EGG WASH
             LIKE I PAINT FENCE.

520
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:58,429
IT'LL GO IN THE OVEN            
FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES.           
        WE'RE GONNA HAVE TROUBLE
           EATIN' ALL THOSE.    

521
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:02,032
               IS THERE A METHOD
                 OF EATING IT?  
        TRY IT                  
WITH A LITTLE MUSTARD.          

522
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,768
                MMM, DELICIOUS. 

523
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,769
                THE PHYLLO DOUGH
                    IS GREAT.   
UH-HUH.                         

524
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,571
         IT'S LIGHT. THE POTATO 
            IS NICE AND HOT.    

525
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,906
          YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE? 

526
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,707
          YOU LEFT THE SKINS ON,
            AND YOU ROASTED IT, 

527
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,443
                 SO IT KIND OF  
               GIVES SOME COLOR.

528
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,178
         MMM. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT, 
          BUDDY, THE MUSTARD... 

529
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,914
 I HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF KNISHES,
      BUT THE ONES I'VE HAD     

530
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,649
         DO NOT COMPARE TO THAT.
OH, THANK YOU.                  

531
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,918
        AND THE STUFFING        
      IS REALLY EXCELLENT.      

532
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:22,653
    NICE. IT'S LIGHT, FLAKY.    

533
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,056
                      DELICIOUS.
 MEAT LOAF'S                    
IN THE WINDOW.                  

534
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,191
                I'VE NEVER,     
           NEVER HAD A BAD MEAL.
THE FOOD IS GREAT.              

535
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:30,261
       GOOD JOB, FELLAS.        
IT'S A BIG FAMILY OPERATION,    
   THOUGH. IT REALLY IS.        

536

538
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:36,067

                 ON THAT.       
WELL, YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

  DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES.  

544
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,081
     ...IN YOUR--YOUR SPORTS CAR
              AND LEAVE?
