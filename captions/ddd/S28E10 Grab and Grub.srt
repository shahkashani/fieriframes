1
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:02,568
Hey, I'm Guy Fieri,
 and you know what I need?

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:03,969
I need you riding shotgun.

3
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:05,704
I'm on my way to Flavortown.

4
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:09,475
This is
 "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

5
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:12,244
This trip...
 Can I get
a drum roll, please?

6
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:14,580
...we're hitting up spots
 where you can dive right in...

7
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:16,949
Whoo!
   ...and grab
  all kinds of grub.

8
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:18,984
Are you
 serious about that?

9
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:20,619
Like a money Miami joint...

10
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,554
You feel like you're
  on vacation right here.

11
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,590
...going out of the box
  with the Cuban...

12
00:00:24,592 --> 00:00:26,058
This is a game-winner
 right here, man.

13
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,293
...a funky little pub
  in North Carolina...

14
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:31,363
I like it.
  ...spinning gourmet
  into their bar food.

15
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:32,998
This will blow
 people's minds.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,234
Plus, a taste of Chicago
   in Arizona...

17
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:36,602
Come on, now!

18
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:38,337
...going deep
  with their pizza...

19
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:39,571
Man, that's a big pie!

20
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:41,306
...and wicked with their sticks.

21
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:44,043
What part of your mouth
survives after you eat this?

22
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:47,346
That's all right here,
 right now, on "Triple D."

23
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:02,194
So, when I think
  of the term "snowbird,"

24
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:04,029
I'm thinking somebody
  from New York City

25
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,731
that goes all the way down
   to Florida.

26
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,233
But what about the people
 from Chicago that come down to,

27
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,569
say, like here,
  in Tucson, Arizona,

28
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,704
and they want some of
 their hometown favorites,

29
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:15,541
like Italian beef
  or deep-dish pizza?

30
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:18,210
Well, don't worry, there's a guy
 that's here saving the day,

31
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:19,645
for the last 20 years.

32
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:21,180
This is Rocco's.

33
00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:25,184
We got a half a meatball
  sandwich coming up.

34
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:28,520
You can't possibly come to
Tucson without going to Rocco's.

35
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,189
Large, thin sausage,
  going in!

36
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:31,757
Best pizza, best wings.

37
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,092
Got a beef sandwich!

38
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:35,594
Rocco definitely makes it
 feel like Chicago in here.

39
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,329
And, yeah,
 that's really his name --

40
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:39,898
Rocco DiGrazia,
  a Tucson transplant

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,733
who's bringing a piece
  of the Windy City

42
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,402
to sunny Arizona.

43
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:45,504
Do you get a lot of snowbirds
    coming from Chicago

44
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:48,407
that are coming here and going,
   "Oh, thank goodness"?
It's staggering.

45
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,509
So, are you known for your
  thin or are you known
  for your deep-dish?

46
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:52,311
We sell about
 half of each.

47
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:53,712
Well, see,
   I'm an all-thin guy,

48
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:55,848
but I hear that the deep-dish
  you do is pretty gangster.

49
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,783
And it comes fully loaded.

50
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,551
Kitchen Sink going in!

51
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,687
It's called the Kitchen Sink
 for a reason.

52
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,655
It's deep, it's hearty.
  It's a full meal.

53
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:04,957
All right,
 so let's make this.

54
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,658
We're making some
   deep-dish pizza dough.

55
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,060
High-gluten flour?
      Yep.

56
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:09,728
Are you serious
  about that?

57
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,498
Arr!

58
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,466
Salt, sugar, yeast.

59
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,768
Water goes in all at once,
    and canola oil.

60
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,438
Go for about three, four minutes
till it comes together?

61
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,240
What size portions?
      20 ounces.

62
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:22,441
Really?
     Yeah.

63
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:23,675
We're gonna do
 a single proof?

64
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,043
24 hours
    is the sweet spot.

65
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:26,378
Got to love
that yeast build-up.

66
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,213
Now, we're gonna make
    our pizza sauce.

67
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:31,650
So, first, we got ground
  tomatoes, peeled tomatoes.

68
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,952
Tomato paste, garlic,
    light olive oil.

69
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,354
Chiffonade
    of fresh basil.

70
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:36,989
Listen to you
with your chiffonade.

71
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,124
Dried oregano,
    a little sugar.

72
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:40,425
Honey.
    Dried basil.

73
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:43,362
Black pepper. We got salt,
    and dried marjoram.

74
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:44,763
Gives it
   a little fruity flavor.

75
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:47,900
Let it sit.
It gets better over a day.
    Yeah, it does.

76
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:50,335
Then I oil my pan.
Oh, I like that move.

77
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,770
Now we're gonna roll
   this out a little bit.

78
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,373
Toss it just
   a little bit to size.

79
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,942
Halfway up the sides.
 Yeah, it's called
 the Kitchen Sink.

80
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:59,278
I assume
it's getting everything.
  It's getting everything.

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,346
- So, this is mozz and provolone?
   -Mozz and prov.

82
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,115
Hurry up, make the pizza
before I eat it all.

83
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:04,316
Flat meats first.

84
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,051
You don't read that
  on every bumper sticker.

85
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,453
Cooked Italian sausage,
  red onions,

86
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,489
green peppers,
  mushrooms.

87
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:11,924
Squish it down
 a little bit.
      Whoa.

88
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:13,992
Fat ladle of sauce
  on there.

89
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,494
Parmesan cheese.
      Got it.

90
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,129
Use one of these things.
 It's a heat sink.

91
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:19,498
This is going to grab heat
  and put it in the center?

92
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,532
Right,
 and in a deck oven,

93
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,202
this pizza will take
 about 25 minutes.

94
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:24,670
Since we got
 a conveyor oven,

95
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:26,872
we cook it
 in about like 17.
      Not bad.

96
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,041
All right,
   so we got this baby.

97
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,309
Make sure
    it's not sticking.

98
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:32,444
Pull away the pan.
    We're ready to go.
 Okay.

99
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,548
So, the sauce
 is on the top.

100
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,750
Where God intended it
    for a deep-dish.

101
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,686
Because, otherwise,
it wouldn't crust up?
     That's right.

102
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,622
From all the deep-dish
 that I've had,

103
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:47,526
this is far more in balance
that it typically is.

104
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:50,095
'Cause this becomes
a little bit more al dente,

105
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,064
and I like crunchy veggies,
so that works for me.

106
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,066
The crust is great.
 It's not all dough.

107
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,434
You got good yeast
  to it.

108
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:58,370
The oil on the bottom of the pan
makes a nice crust to it.

109
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,339
That pizza sauce
 is the real deal.

110
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:01,607
Man, that's a big pie!

111
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,275
All the way out in Tucson,
  real-deal,

112
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,844
Chicago-style pizza
 from a gangster.

113
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,913
It's so cheesy and delicious.

114
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,916
The sauce is amazing.
  It's full of spice.

115
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,418
Very robust.
 -The crust here is so good.

116
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,120
So, why not just have that?

117
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,956
Well, you can, with a big,
 old pile of these babies.

118
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,224
Here's your hot sticks.

119
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,892
Hot sticks have the wing sauce

120
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,427
in the middle
  of the pizza crust.

121
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,862
It's twisted and baked off.

122
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:27,633
You cannot beat the sauce.
The sauce is homemade, it's hot.

123
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:28,767
What are we
 making next, buddy?

124
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,302
Making Lefty's
   vinaigrette dressing.

125
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:32,170
Lefty's vinaigrette?
       Yeah.

126
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,640
- Who is Lefty?
 -It's my old drummer's mom.

127
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:36,008
Come on, now!

128
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,442
You're a musician, also?
    -Yeah.

129
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,377
Playing drums in a punk-rock
   band I'm in right now.

130
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,445
I would never
  imagine.

131
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,647
So, what do you do
with this vinaigrette?

132
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,715
It's a component
  of our famous wing sauce.

133
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:45,017
That's why --
 -You -- No, no, whoa, wait.

134
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:47,519
The salad dressing is part
 of the wing sauce?
      Yeah.

135
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,121
All right, first,
    we got canola oil,

136
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,589
extra virgin olive oil.

137
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:51,990
Red wine vinegar.
 Okay.

138
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:54,426
Balsamic vinegar.
   Got to have the garlic.

139
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,561
Ground black pepper,
    dried oregano,

140
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,497
mustard powder.
 -A little emulsification.

141
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,165
Basil, salt,
    and the sugar,

142
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,267
and then the flaky
    parsley goodness.

143
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,503
And you want it to sit overnight
    so the dry herbs...

144
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,238
- Right, right, right.
 -...blossom a little bit.

145
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,272
Works for me.

146
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,440
Now we're gonna build
 the wing sauce.

147
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:09,841
First, we got
    our hot sauce,

148
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,277
we got liquid margarine,
   Lefty's vinaigrette,

149
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,446
ground jalapeños.
A lot of them.

150
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:15,847
Black pepper, garlic,

151
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,916
red pepper flakes.
 Whoa!

152
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,484
And a bunch
    of cayenne pepper.

153
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,253
- Are you really serious?
  -Flame on, dude.

154
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:23,689
What part of your mouth
survives after you eat this?

155
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,924
You'll be enjoying
    every minute of it.
 Whoo!

156
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,260
And while you do all this,
you make some of the garlic --

157
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:29,795
what are the things you call
the bread, the twisty thing

158
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,496
in the middle --
      Hot sticks.

159
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,433
The wing sauce thrown
 on the dough,

160
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:37,169
twisted up,
run through the oven.

161
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,470
You got to try it
  in the bleu cheese, though.

162
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,772
That completes
 the picture of the dish.

163
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,544
I love the crust of pizza.
It's my favorite thing.

164
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:48,280
When you can get spicy
pizza crust, you're winning.

165
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,882
Wow!
 Those are good.

166
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,784
That's the real deal.

167
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,052
Really unique to Rocco's.

168
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,620
I've never had breadsticks
 like this anywhere else.

169
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,055
Who wouldn't want
  breadsticks with that

170
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,324
amazing hot-wing sauce
   inside of them?

171
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:00,625
What's the story
 on the wings?

172
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,461
We par-cook them
    through the oven.
  Okay.

173
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:04,763
So, you render some of the fat,
you get them cooked.
     That's right.

174
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,466
Then we fry them until
they're crispy and golden brown.

175
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:08,834
- Tossed in the sauce?
    -Yep.

176
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:10,168
Coat them all up.

177
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,375
Mm-hmm.
That's a great wing.

178
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,043
Really good texture.
Really good fry to it.

179
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,579
It's not dried out.
It's got a great sauce.

180
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,047
It's not
 overwhelmingly hot.

181
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,316
Bleu cheese is right.

182
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:25,884
I got any right there?

183
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,853
Just right.

184
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,055
Chicken wings,
   they're my favorite.

185
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,924
Perfect, crispy wings,
   hot sauce. The best.

186
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,726
Spaghetti with meatballs,
   coming up!

187
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,128
I always come back to Rocco's,
   'cause I know

188
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,863
I can get a really solid meal.

189
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,664
Never leaves me unsatisfied.

190
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,600
A punk-rock drummer
 from Chicago

191
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:42,768
in a funky,
 little joint.

192
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,936
I mean, you are
representing simple food,

193
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,239
made the right way,
 a lot of integrity.

194
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,640
Well done.
    Thanks, Guy.

195
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,277
Up next,
 it's game time in Miami...

196
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,812
That's awesome, brother.
  I dig it.

197
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,881
...where Coach Gruden's
  taking the field...

198
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,516
You're gonna be busy
 for the day, Coach.

199
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,418
...for some Cuban
  that's hard to beat.

200
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,286
I love this job.
  You got it made, man.

201
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,896
So, I'm here
in Miami's Little Havana --

202
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,532
Hey, Coach,
enough on the engine.

203
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,600
...to check out a joint
where a husband-and-wife team --

204
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,502
Dude,
 you're killin' me.

205
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,204
A husband-and-wife team
 are serving up

206
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:22,040
some Cuban food elevated
 to another level.

207
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,509
Whoo!
 Coach, enough!
 Are you hungry?

208
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,378
Come on,
 Coach Gruden.

209
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,047
This is
 Doce Provisions.

210
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,682
Awesome, but after we eat,
    we got to do

211
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:33,452
some burnouts
    in this Camaro.
You're killin' me.

212
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,556
- Short rib taco up.
 -That's like home cooking.

213
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:38,657
The food is awesome.
  You can't go wrong.

214
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,025
The plantains working?

215
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,227
I haven't tried anything
  like these in Miami.

216
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,728
It's not your typical Cuban.

217
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,130
Which is all part
   of the strategy

218
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,633
for owner Justin Sherrer
and his wife, Lisetty Llampalla,

219
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,935
to bring something different,

220
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:52,170
but still celebrate
   Little Havana.

221
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,672
I love the neighborhood,
    I love the culture.

222
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:56,541
My wife's Cuban.
    I love Cuban food.

223
00:07:56,543 --> 00:08:00,245
And their Cuban food
 is all about big flavors

224
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,514
What do we got,
 maybe 15 items, if?

225
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,782
And when you have
  somebody

226
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:06,418
that's doing those few items,
you can bet it's because

227
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,153
each one of those items
 he's vetted out.

228
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,155
It's kind of like having only
15 plays in your playbook.

229
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,491
People know what they're getting
  when they come in here.

230
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:16,661
It's a perfect menu.
 It's just what you want.

231
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,996
Chorizo croquettes.

232
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,564
The chorizo croquettes,

233
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,466
he's thinking
  outside of the box.

234
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,335
Most croquettes
   are just soft.

235
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,970
This actually
  has a crunch to it.

236
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,505
So, croquettes --
let's get into this.

237
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,640
If you're in Miami and you
  don't have a good croquette

238
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,141
on the menu,
    you know, like...

239
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,376
And there are more
 bad croquettes

240
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,611
than there are good croquettes.
    -A lot.

241
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,946
I mean, I'm getting
   hungry here.
Let's go.

242
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,848
Butter, garlic.
     Boom.

243
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,450
Shallot. Next going in
    is the bacon.

244
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:40,685
What I do is take
    the Miami Smokers'
    bacon, puree it.

245
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,854
Miami Smokers is a "Triple D"
joint we did years ago.

246
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,123
Let's throw Coach in.
Let's throw him in the pit.

247
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,758
Step right
 over here, man.

248
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,126
A little nervous
  right here, Justin.

249
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,529
- Nope.
 -This is my first time in a --

250
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,998
"My first time on Food Network
and now I got to cook."

251
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,065
A little bit
    different than

252
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,334
the oatmeal I cook
    back at my house.

253
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,169
Now, drop your chorizo.

254
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,704
Ground, smoked pork.

255
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,406
It gets hot working
    over the stove.

256
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,309
It's like calling the plays
    on a third down.

257
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,744
With a bad
    offensive line.

258
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,679
I mean, it's hot, man.

259
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,080
Right on. So, yeah,
   add some milk,

260
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,448
put your heavy cream
   right there.

261
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,684
Bring that to a boil.
  More house seasoning.

262
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,252
Okay, and what do we have
in our house seasoning here?

263
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,521
A little bit -- just paprika,
   Sazón, salt.

264
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,156
Sazón.
   Smoked paprika.

265
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,858
You got a little sweet
 in there. Mmm.
    Yep.

266
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,526
We're gonna drop
  some flour in there.

267
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,762
Once it's tightened
  up, we're gonna let it
  cool on a sheet tray,

268
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:26,164
just enough to where
  we can put it in a bag.

269
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,867
I'm gonna pipe it out
  into a log, score them.
 Got it.

270
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,602
We're gonna cool them
   in the cooler,

271
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,537
hen we're gonna pop them
   and bread them.

272
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,974
We're just gonna use egg wash
 and our seasoned bread crumbs.

273
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,842
Okay, you're gonna be busy
 for the day, Coach.

274
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:41,313
Yeah,
    I'll tell you.

275
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:42,414
All right,
so what are we making?

276
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,448
Sauce for
    the croquettes.

277
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,617
Dijon mustard,
    Kewpie mayonnaise.

278
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:48,420
Japanese mayonnaise --
really fatty, really thick.

279
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,854
I mean, you could repair
 a hole in your wall

280
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,523
in college with that.
That and a little bit of flour.

281
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:52,724
I could've used
   some Kewpie.

282
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,327
Fresh lime juice,
    kosher salt.

283
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:57,095
Let's fry up the croquette
 and get this done.

284
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:00,231
We're gonna drop our mustard
    on the plate,

285
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,334
frisée and a couple pickles
     on there.

286
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:03,668
The croquettes.

287
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,003
It's a nice
   presentation.

288
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:07,238
And garnish with
    some Cotija cheese.

289
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,840
All right, Coach,
I'm gonna let you in first.

290
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:12,277
Oh, it's my honor.

291
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,878
Okay, now this,
ladies and gentlemen,

292
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,313
is a very
 important moment.

293
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:18,049
Can I get
a drum roll, please?

294
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,320
That's some
   magical stuff.

295
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:25,423
The crunchiness.
 It's firm, but it's moist,

296
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,791
but it's not wet.

297
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,493
Coach picked
 it out perfectly,

298
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:31,262
is that it is so moist
without being soggy,

299
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,531
it's so rich with the bacon
coming in with the chorizo

300
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,300
and coming in
with the loin -- rich city.

301
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,935
This Dijonnaise
  is perfect.

302
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:39,871
Brilliant how you have
  all these ingredients

303
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:43,441
that go into one
  of these little guys.

304
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,577
It's a heck of a job.

305
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,312
Chorizo croquettes.

306
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,582
The croquettes are delicious.
 They pack a flavorful punch.

307
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,917
It's like this symphony
   of flavors.

308
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,252
Short rib burger.

309
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,087
Doce is actually one
  of my favorite places

310
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,255
down here in Little Havana.

311
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,490
Where'd the name
  come from?

312
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,824
I was sitting here,
   thinking about a name,

313
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,159
I looked up
    at the sign outside

314
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,129
and I saw 12, and I said,
    "How about Doce?"

315
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,164
That's awesome, brother.
  I dig it.

316
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,633
Doce's a great place.
  It's a quaint place.

317
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,201
It has a very relaxed ambiance.

318
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,536
Everything is very,
   very artistic.

319
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,171
I mean, this place just
 makes you want to come in.

320
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,741
Coach Gruden and I hanging out
at Doce, here in Little Havana.

321
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,476
When we come back, we're
gonna make something else?

322
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:19,644
Masa de puerco chinos.

323
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,346
Masa de puerco --
   fried rice.

324
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:24,416
It's got, like, the pork chunks
 on top, the fried plantains.

325
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,051
This is something
 I would definitely order

326
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,352
every single time I'm here.

327
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,653
You do not
 want to miss this.

328
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,088
We'll see you
 in a little bit.

329
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,761
Here we are
   back at Doce's.

330
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,496
My man, Guy.
 We got Justin, the chef.

331
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,031
What are we
  doing right here?

332
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,299
You like that?
 It was awesome!

333
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,301
I'm so worried
 about my job future

334
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:46,671
because I cannot
call football at all!

335
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,573
But I do know
 how to find the all-stars,

336
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:51,676
like this Latin-fusion joint
 in Miami's Little Havana,

337
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:53,611
and I'm teaming up
  with Coach Jon Gruden

338
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,380
to check out their game plan.

339
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,781
Bacon-egg pad Thai up.

340
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,284
He takes a dish
 that isn't traditionally

341
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:00,552
like a very Hispanic dish,

342
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,320
and then adds
 Hispanic components to it.

343
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:03,588
So, like the fried rice.

344
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,356
Masa de puerco chino.

345
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,358
You've got a little bit
   of the sweet

346
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,461
and a little bit of the Asian.

347
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:10,395
What are we
putting together here?

348
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,197
Our Masa
    de puerco chino --

349
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,999
fried pork tossed into
  homemade sweet chili sauce

350
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,335
on top of a fried rice
   with sweet plantains.

351
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,837
Basically,
  we salted this overnight.

352
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,472
Put some holes
    in this guy.
 Okay.

353
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:22,107
These garlic cloves are
gonna sit inside of there.

354
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:23,241
Stud it up.

355
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,509
First, we'll mix it
   all together here --

356
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,612
the sour orange,
  fresh lime juice, cumin.

357
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,681
Throw some bay leaf
     in there.

358
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:30,949
I just, you know,
    give it a rub

359
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,917
and then put
   the garlic in there.

360
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,920
That garlic is just gonna
  bleed right over there.
      Get right
    into there, yeah.

361
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:39,557
350, 400, 5 to 6 hours,
and in the meantime,

362
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,560
we'll work on
the pineapple confit?

363
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,429
Yes, sir.
  Dig it.

364
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,865
Blended oil,
    bell peppers.

365
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,767
Add a little salt.
     Pineapple.

366
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,201
A little bit of sugar

367
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,437
and a little bit
   of togarashi seasoning.
 Interesting.

368
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:56,107
The togarashi playing into a
little bit of this Asian fusion.

369
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,943
We're just gonna cook this down
  for about 15, 20 minutes,

370
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,045
and that's what we toss
    with our pork.

371
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,981
And next?
    We're gonna make
   our sweet chili sauce.

372
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,416
Okay.
   So, we're gonna start
   with a little water.

373
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:06,851
We got
   the red bell peppers,

374
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:09,053
crushed garlic,
    crushed red pepper.

375
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:10,155
We're gonna puree this.
    -Okay.

376
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:13,825
Start with rice vinegar,
   sugar, pepper puree.

377
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,227
Cook for about
    10, 15 minutes.

378
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,062
And now, we're gonna make
    our fried rice.
 Hit it.

379
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:20,098
Green onions,
   bell peppers in there.

380
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,232
Cold rice.

381
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:22,534
Tamarind
    fried-rice sauce.

382
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:25,103
So, the tamarind pot has
this nice sourness to it

383
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,305
in a lot of Asian food.

384
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,439
Then we're gonna add
    our bean sprouts.

385
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,941
Look how beautiful
  that is.

386
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:33,444
Now we're gonna fry
   the plantains and pork.
Okay.

387
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,213
We're gonna add
   our pineapple confit.

388
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,148
- The sweet chili sauce you made.
 -Give it a little squeeze.

389
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,585
Now we're gonna plate
   our rice, pork here.

390
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:43,888
Wouldn't be Miami
  without sweet plantains.
Okay.

391
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,790
And a little frisée
    and pickled pepper.
Gorgeous, man.

392
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,025
Just gorgeous.

393
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,426
Coach.
   Thank you.

394
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,998
You feel like you're
  on vacation right here.

395
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,168
I love this job.
  You got it made, man.

396
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,304
What's your one loss, Guy?
  Do you lose any?

397
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,072
The attention
that you put to the pork

398
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,507
so it's nice and tender,
 and then you put

399
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,342
that little bit of fry
on the outside of it

400
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,011
so you get tender in the middle,
and you get that nice crisp.

401
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,379
You put the sweet plantain
  next to it,

402
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,515
you're getting
all of these counterbalances.

403
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,283
You're getting sour,
and you're getting sweet,

404
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,252
and you're getting salty,
and you're getting crunchy,

405
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:15,453
and you're getting soft.

406
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,155
It's dynamite, bro.
    That's the goal.

407
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:19,424
That's the goal.

408
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:20,959
Masa de puerco chino.

409
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:23,328
The plantains
  are cooked perfectly,

410
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,763
the pork has that little
  crunchy exterior.

411
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:28,099
Everything is just
 phenomenal and delicious.

412
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:29,200
Enjoy, guys.

413
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,768
Some of the best food in Miami.

414
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,737
This is game-winner,
right here, man. Well done.

415
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:33,938
Great job, Justin.
      Thank you.
     Thanks, Coach.

416
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,141
I loved it, man.
  Appreciate it, brother.

417
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:39,210
Coming up,
in Wilmington, North Carolina...

418
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,613
Come on down for some duck
fancy-wing and duck l'orange.

419
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,648
What looks like
 your typical bar bites...

420
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,250
I'd pass out
 eating that.

421
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:47,218
...are way more
  than you bargained for.

422
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,786
"Delicious"
is an understatement.

423
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,523
And these are
the croquettes that beat

424
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:53,892
the legendary
 Richard Hales.

425
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,560
the chef
from Sakaya Kitchen?

426
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,961
I think
    I got lucky.

427
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,297
--Oh, man. How you doing, bro?

428
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,705
So, I'm here
  in historic downtown

429
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,140
Wilmington, North Carolina.

430
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,943
Beautiful place, and you're
 right in the middle of it all.

431
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:14,379
All kinds of restaurants,
  you got the river walk,

432
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,214
and you got big decisions.
 Where are you gonna eat?

433
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,149
Well, I've heard from some
 locals, "You got to check out

434
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,784
this little place where you got
  to expect the wait,

435
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,287
'cause they only got 40 seats,"
  and it's well worth it,

436
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,088
'cause this is
  The Fork-N-Cork.

437
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,028
Got a fonduta
  and some wings, Table 4!

438
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,730
It's more of a dining experience
 that somewhere just to go eat.

439
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,299
Got a Reuben wearing fries!

440
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:35,800
You can count
  on the food being good,

441
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,869
you can count
 on the people being friendly.

442
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:40,672
And a lot of folks count
 on self-made chef James Smith

443
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:43,041
to give their taste buds
  a run for their money.

444
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:45,576
I wanted to take all the food
you ate when you were in college

445
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,245
and elevate it
  with better ingredients,

446
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,280
and then take some
   fine-dining menu items

447
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,648
and kind of dumb
    them down and --
Bar-ify them?

448
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,649
Yeah.
  Okay.

449
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:52,951
Duck wings.

450
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,586
You can go anyplace in town
   and get chicken wings.

451
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:59,290
Confit duck wings with
  habanero orange marmalade.

452
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,192
You can't beat them.
 -So, what are we making first?

453
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,760
All right, we're gonna do
   our duck confit wings,

454
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:03,795
just the drumettes.

455
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,463
A little bit
   of kosher salt, sugar.

456
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,698
Black peppercorns.
Black pepper, okay.

457
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,799
Juniper berries.

458
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,400
Juniper's got to play
 in there somewhere.

459
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:11,402
Fresh garlic
    and fresh thyme.

460
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,204
Cover it
    with the duck fat.

461
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:16,541
At what temp
and how long?
     275 for about
    4, 4 1/2 hours.

462
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,109
Let them cool
 in the duck fat.

463
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,777
And then pull them out,
  'cause we're gonna fry 'em.

464
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:22,647
Corn starch first.
 Okay.

465
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,948
And what are we
 serving them with?

466
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,550
- Habanero orange sauce.
    -Okay.

467
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:26,784
- And a hot honey garlic.
   -Bring it.

468
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,419
We're doing
  our hot honey garlic sauce.

469
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,388
Butter, a little bit
     of garlic,

470
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,724
red chili flake.
Whoa, a lot of it.

471
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,792
And then just
   a little bit of honey.
All right, sugar.

472
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:37,095
Let it cook down
  for about 10, 15 minutes.

473
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:38,363
- And that's all she wrote.
 -Then it'll be ready to go.

474
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:39,664
I like it.
Next one's gonna be...?

475
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,232
Orange habanero
     marmalade.

476
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:42,266
Orange marmalade.
    Orange habanero --

477
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,769
Is it
 orange habanero...

478
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,004
marmalade?
     Marmalade.

479
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,972
Come on down for the jazz
fingers. They're fantastic.

480
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:50,208
We've got our orange marmalade,
    habanero sauce.

481
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,909
- Nothing wrong with this.
 -Nothing wrong with that.

482
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,478
Fresh ground pepper,
    kosher salt.

483
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,747
And then, we're just
  gonna whisk that together.
 I like it.

484
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,749
All right, we've pulled
  our wings out of the fryer.

485
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,418
I don't think we've ever seen
duck wings on "Triple D."

486
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,453
Hot honey garlic.
 -Give them a little coating.

487
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:03,621
Right.

488
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,490
And then we've got
   our orange habanero.

489
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:08,159
What's your favorite
 of the two?
    I love them both.

490
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,664
A duck wing.
That is so fantastic.

491
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,100
It's got a richness to it,
 got great texture.

492
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:17,935
So, what's your favorite?

493
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,070
I think the honey.

494
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:22,774
It's got good heat,
 not really thick.

495
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:26,110
That right there.
   Habanero orange sauce.

496
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:29,580
Duck l'orange,
 with some attitude,

497
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:30,848
and duck fancy-wing.

498
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,184
Come on down for some duck
fancy-wing and duck l'orange.

499
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:36,154
And I have your duck wings.

500
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:38,089
It's more tender than
  a regular chicken wing.

501
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:39,490
It's just excellent.

502
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:43,027
The honey garlic sauce is light
  and a little bit spicy.

503
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:45,930
That orange flavor. Whew,
 it has a lot of kick to it.

504
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,198
How do you describe
 the place to folks,

505
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,533
when you're telling them
about coming down here?

506
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,101
I always tell people
 who've never been here before

507
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,469
you can't go wrong
    with the burger.

508
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,471
Especially one
  that's personalized.

509
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,573
Tell me about how
  the Ava burger came about.

510
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,475
He asked me
if I wanted my own burger,

511
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:58,976
and I said yes.
      Okay.

512
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:02,246
I told him
that I wanted bacon.

513
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,449
So, you would've been happy
   if the whole Ava burger

514
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:05,850
was just
   a giant bacon burger?

515
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:07,285
I like my burger.

516
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,320
You should like your burger
  when it's named after you.

517
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,522
And beyond the burger,
  this place definitely

518
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:13,691
raises the bar on bar food.

519
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,193
Wellington bites,
     Table 2!

520
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:18,429
Kind of like getting a steak as
 an appetizer, all in one bite.

521
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,697
Well, we're gonna
get into something now

522
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,065
that we've never seen
 on "Triple D" --

523
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,067
a Wellington bite?
    Beef Wellington.

524
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,503
We've just miniaturized it.
  Turned it into bar food.
 Fantastic.

525
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:26,971
We're gonna make
   our mushroom duxelle.

526
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,372
A little bit
    of olive oil,

527
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,575
butter,
   diced-up prosciutto,

528
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:33,077
mushrooms -- creminis.
Cremini's my favorite.

529
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,279
Fresh thyme, a little bit
    of salt and pepper.

530
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,415
We're gonna go ahead and let
  this render 15, 20 minutes.

531
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,750
And let it cool
 so we can stuff it.
      Absolutely.

532
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:40,885
I like the way
 he's rolling.

533
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:42,320
We're gonna
   cube up some fillet,

534
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,188
typically used
   for your Wellington.

535
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,656
Seasoned with a little salt
     and pepper.

536
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,091
Now we've got
   our mushroom duxelle.

537
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,759
Add a little bit
    of Dijon mustard,

538
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:51,229
a little bit
   of goose-liver pâté.

539
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:52,763
In a bar.

540
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,233
And we're just gonna mix
  this just so you have
  a nice, smooth paste.

541
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,101
Okay.
   Spray our sheet tray.

542
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,636
Add our puff pastry,

543
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,506
our duxelle mix,
    one cube each.

544
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,007
And then we're just
   gonna wrap these up,

545
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,242
little Christmas
    present-style.

546
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,277
So, what everybody
loves about beef Wellington is,

547
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,512
they love
 the crust anyways.

548
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:09,180
And the nice little ratio
 he's made here

549
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,915
gives you the chance
you're gonna get great puff,

550
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,817
nice little piece
 of fillet inside.

551
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,886
We're gonna go in

552
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:16,120
and add
    a little egg wash

553
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,289
just to get them nice
    and brown. Perfect.

554
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,725
We're going at 425
   for about 10 minutes.
 Okay.

555
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,693
And we're making our
   port wine cherry sauce.
Dig it.

556
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:25,062
- Start with our port wine.
 -A lot of dried cherries.

557
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,697
A little white sugar,

558
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,099
a little bit
    of fresh rosemary,

559
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,300
fresh-ground
    black pepper.

560
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:30,501
And we're gonna bring that
    to a simmer.

561
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,969
We're gonna add
   a little bit of butter,

562
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:33,738
then we're gonna hit it
   with the boat motor.

563
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,339
- Let's put it together, man.
   -All right.

564
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,409
Toasty and brown
    Wellington bites.
Look at that.

565
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:41,045
It's very luxurious.

566
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,648
That's the one.

567
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,449
Mmm!
  Delicious.

568
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:49,820
This will blow
 people's minds.
    That was the plan.

569
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:50,821
I'm serious.

570
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,758
I enjoy it
so much more because --

571
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,760
You get all
    the good parts.

572
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,862
The pastry.
   That's where you're at.

573
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,964
The duxelle is delish.

574
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,732
I'd pass out
 eating that.

575
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:04,702
"Delicious"
is an understatement.

576
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,438
Mmm!
 Outstanding.

577
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,740
Awesome.
 <i> Outstanding.</i>

578
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:12,710
Jay, your personal favorite,
  the Wellington bites.

579
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,712
What's there not to like
  about medium-rare fillet

580
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,147
and a puff pastry?

581
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:18,583
You get your fix, because
  it is a very rich dish.

582
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:20,384
It's very unique
  and it's delicious.

583
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,519
Short rib mac!

584
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,187
Hot chicken, french fries!

585
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,922
I've been to some
   funky little joints,

586
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:27,925
but for 40 seats and,
  I don't know, six tables,

587
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,560
that's -- it's
   a pretty neat place.

588
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,729
You always know that it's gonna
  be really, really good.

589
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:32,930
It's remarkable.

590
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,131
You deserve all the recognition
 you're getting.

591
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:35,433
Well, thank you very much.
    I appreciate that.

592
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:38,436
Thank you, man.
  Congrats.

593
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:40,471
Was that a road trip
   or what?

594
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,540
But don't worry,
 there's plenty more joints

595
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,208
all over this great country.

596
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,544
I'll be looking for you
 next time on "Triple D."

597
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:51,415
I can't believe I'm sitting
    in this ride, man.

598
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,851
"Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives"!

599
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:54,986
Where's Guy at?

600
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:57,388
Tell him I'm leaving.
     Yeah!
