00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,215
        WE TEACH OUR KIDS       
        WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG      

100
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:37,549
        HOW TO PICK A CRAB.     

101
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:38,750
       MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME THIS 

102
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,752
         BACK IN SOUTH BALTIMORE
              40 YEARS AGO.     

103
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,888
    I TAKE OUT ALL THE CLAWS    
      AND THE FINS FIRST.       
   SOME PEOPLE                  
WILL USE A KNIFE.               

104
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:47,425
  YOU USE IT TO CUT THE CRAB IN 
  HALF SO YOU CAN GET TO THIS.  

105
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,694
        THAT'S A WASTE OF TIME. 

106
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,696
      JUST CRUSH IT IN MY HANDS.
          IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.   

107
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,698
I SMASH IT, REACH IN            
    AND GRAB IT.                

108
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,367
   I FEEL LIKE I'M IN           
LITTLE SANTA'S WORKSHOP.        

109
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,634
I'M MAKING CRAB                 
  FOR SUSIE.                    

110
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,704
NOW DO YOU GUYS                 
KNOW THIS GAME--                

111
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,973
THE BREAK-OFF, PEEL-OFF,        
     PICK-AND-DIG?              
                 NEVER DID THAT.

112
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,241
HUH? HUH? HUH?                  

113
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,578
              NOW DO YOU ONLY   
           EAT THEM WITH BUTTER?
    THAT'S HOW I WAS RAISED.    

114
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,713
       YOU GET HORSERADISH. MMM.
 VINEGAR.                       

115
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,782
        THIS IS VINEGAR.        
             NOW IS THIS THE WAY
                  TO DO IT?     

116
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,784
ABSOLUTELY.                     
          I JUST LIKE           
       TO EAT MINE PLAIN.       

117
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:17,522
        I LIKE 'EM NAKED,       
BUT A LITTLE BIT OF SPICE ON IT.

118
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:19,590
                            OHH.
   YOU LIKE IT                  
WITH SOME VINEGAR?              

119
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,660
           THAT MIGHT JUST BE IT
                  FOR ME.       

120
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,663
          NOW HOW ELSE          
   DO THEY DO THE CRAB HERE?    
THEY DO A FRIED HARD CRAB,      

121
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,465
WHERE YOU PEEL THE BATTER       
     OFF AND EAT IT.            
           SERIOUSLY?           

122
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,668
           THAT'S CREAM OF CRAB?
    YEAH. HEAVY ON THE CRAB.    

123

  IT'S JUST PURE LUMP CRABMEAT. 

136
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:02,301
   WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE SAUCE

     OLD BAY, PREPARED MUSTARD,

           A LITTLE LEMON JUICE,

   IT INCORPORATES A LITTLE BIT.

141
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,642
             NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD
               THE LIQUID EGG.  

142
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,644
 THIS IS THE GLUE.              
THIS IS THE BINDER.             
                           YEAH.

            THIS IS A CRAB CAKE,
              NOT A BREAD CAKE.

                GONNA FORM 'EM.

172
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:24,582
     THE BEST PART ABOUT IT     
   IS THE AMOUNT OF CRABMEAT.   

173
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:27,652
   IT'S GOT A LOT OF CRAB IN IT.
      I GET IT ALL THE TIME.    

174
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,988
ANYTHING CRAB RELATED           
 IS VERY GOOD HERE.             

175
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,857
   I'VE BEEN TO OTHER PLACES,   
  AND CRAB JUST AIN'T THE SAME. 

176
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,592
         THERE'S NOTHING BETTER.
       IT'S REALLY GOOD.        
         IT'S PERFECT.          

177
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,861

           CONDIMENT.           

189
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,288
I HAVE WANTED TO KNOW HOW       
 TO MAKE THIS FOR YEARS.        

190
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,222
THAT'S GREAT.                   

191
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,793

192
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,795

       AN ACCIDENTAL TURN

        I LIKE TO SAY CHA-CHA-- 
       GIVE A LITTLE JAZZ TO IT.

230
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,281
       WHICH IS FANTASTIC.      

231
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:37,882
FIRST, WE'RE GONNA              
SALT THE CABBAGE?               
               ABOUT THREE HEADS
                  OF CABBAGE.   

232
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,352
       AND THE REASON WHY YOU'RE
       PUTTING THE SALT ON IT-- 

233
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,621
          TO SOFTEN THE CABBAGE.
  RIGHT, IT'S GONNA             
SWEAT IT A LITTLE BIT.          

234
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,623
        EXACTLY. MAKE IT TENDER.
IT'S GONNA DRAW OUT             
  SOME MOISTURE.                

235
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,959
NOW HOW LONG IS THAT            
GONNA SIT LIKE THAT?            
      TWO, TWO AND A HALF HOURS.

236
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,694
       THEN WE'RE GONNA WASH IT.
THIS IN THE RINSED CABBAGE      

237
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,363
THAT SAT WITH THE SALT          
 ON IT FOR TWO HOURS?           
                        EXACTLY.

238
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,499
     TAKE ABOUT 3 CUPS OF WATER,
         4 CUPS OF VINEGAR.     

239
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:57,435
                  THEN WE TAKE  
                 PICKLING SPICE.
ABOUT 6 TABLESPOONS.            

240
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,638
        WHILE THIS IS BOILING,  
       WE GET OUR PEPPERS READY.

241
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,838
     THIS IS THE JALAPEÑO HERE. 

242
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,575
        WE DO BOTH HOT AND MILD.
A LITTLE RED CHILI.             

243
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,910
           I'M GONNA GO AHEAD   
        AND PUT THE SUGAR FIRST.
LET IT DISSOLVE.                

244
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,912
        LET IT DISSOLVE, AND IT 
       DON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE

245
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,914
               WHICH PROCESS    
           YOU PUT THIS IN, GUY.

246
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,916
   IT'S ALL GONNA GET           
MIXED IN TOGETHER ANYWAY.       

247
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,918
HERE, I'LL TRADE YOU.           
          OKAY, BABY. THANK YOU.

248
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,920
  THERE YOU GO.                 
3 CUPS OF ONIONS.               
                         MM-HMM.

249
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,922
THREE HEADS OF CABBAGE.         
          EXACTLY. THAT IN HERE.

250
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,924
   AND THEN HOW LONG            
IS THIS GONNA SIT HERE          

251
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,926
   AND SIMMER                   
OR BOIL TOGETHER?               
                ABOUT TWO HOURS.

252
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,462
WOW. SO NOW WE'RE GONNA         
ADD THE REGULAR TOMATOES        

253
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,797
AND THE GREEN TOMATOES.         
                          RIGHT.

254
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:29,000
HOW LONG ARE THESE GONNA        
GO AND COOK INSIDE THIS?        
               ABOUT 45 MINUTES.

255
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:30,668
SO IT REALLY IS LIKE            
  A 5 HOUR PROCESS.             

256
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,870
BUT LOOK AT THOSE PEPPERS,      
        THE ONIONS,

258
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,275

262

386
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:31,836
           I COME HERE          
   FOR THE SPECIAL RED SAUCE.   

387
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:34,238
       YOU CAN REALLY TELL      
     THAT THEY MAKE IT HERE.    

388
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,373
AND IT'S MADE                   
EVERY MORNING?                  
                  EVERY MORNING.

389
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,375
      SIX CANS OF TOMATO PASTE. 

390
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,511
          NOW AFTER ALL THAT,   
      WE'RE GONNA ADD OUR PURéE.

391
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,513
                 TOMATO FILLETS.
TOMATO FILLETS?                 

392
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,582
      IT'S SLICED UP TOMATO,    
   AND THEN WE GRIND IT ALL UP. 

393
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,785
    THIS LOOKS LIKE             
A SPLASHING OPPORTUNITY.        
                       OH, YEAH.

394

YEAH. YEAH, YEAH.

399
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,064
                A LOT OF WATER. 

400
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,534
        WE USUALLY LET IT SIMMER
          ABOUT 8 HOURS A DAY.  
SMELLS PRETTY FANTASTIC.        

401
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,069
   BUT THE MEAT                 
DOESN'T GO IN THIS?             

402
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:08,606
          NOPE, WE TAKE THIS OUT
         AND PUT IT IN THE MEAT.
SO LET'S GO MAKE THE MEAT.      

403
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,808
THEN WE'LL PUT THAT             
     IN THERE?                  
                            YEP.

404
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:13,077
     SO WE JUST DUMP OUR GROUND 
      BEEF ON AND BREAK IT UP.  

405
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:16,614
      WE'RE GONNA ADD OUR GARLIC
       AND OUR STEAK SEASONING. 
SO WE SCOOP IT UP,              
 PUT IT IN THERE,               

406
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:19,283
 ADD THE SAUCE, AND THEN        
THAT'S READY TO BE SERVED       

407
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,818
ON TOP OF THE MOSTACCIOLI.      
                            YEP.

408
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,820
ADD A LITTLE CHEDDAR,           
A LITTLE MOZZARELLA,            

409
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,154
AND MIX IT ALL UP.              

410
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,492
   TOP IT OFF WITH              
MORE MEAT SAUCE HERE.           
        WHAT IS THAT OVER THERE?

411
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,893
(laughs)                        
                           WHAT?

412
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,562
               MMM. THAT'S GOOD.
   THEN WE PUT                  
THE MOZZARELLA ON               

413
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,431
AND SOME CHEDDAR.               

414
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,965
              WHY DON'T WE ADD  
             SOME CHEESE TO IT? 

415
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,901
 AND THEN WE PUT IT IN THE OVEN 
     FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.    

416
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,971
                            WOW.

PARMESAN ON THERE.              

417
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:43,441
     I DON'T KNOW IF THIS COULD 
     POSSIBLY HAVE MORE CHEESE. 

418
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,776
              MMM. REALLY GOOD.
