00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:03,201
       Hey, I'm Guy Fieri,      
    and you know what I need?   

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:05,537
   I need you riding shotgun.   
  I'm on my way to Flavortown.  

3
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:09,274
             This is            
 "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives."

4
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:10,408
          This trip...          

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,477
                 I love it.     

6
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:12,677
  We're crossing the country... 

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,812
I'll have all that to go.       

8
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,814
       ...for a wild ride       
       through Flavortown.      

9
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:19,418
I mean, it is, like, goosebump  
time, it's really spot on.      

10
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,287
   We've got a comfort cooking  
    brew house in Santa Fe...   

11
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,423
    So now we're getting chef-y.

12
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:26,558
...a bagel emporium in Boston...

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,027
     It's of the best we've ever
              had on the show.  

14
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,229
 ...and a funky spot in Reno... 

15
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,898
   Out of bounds.               

16
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,500
        ...going big time       
       with the big game.       

17
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:38,503
 Bro, please tell me            
this is on the menu forever.    

18
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:42,174
      That's all right here     
    right now on "Triple D."

21
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:57,355
   I love this food revolution  
   that's going on right now,   

22
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:00,058
   I mean, people are getting   
   so connected to their food.  

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,726
     And I love coming back     
     to cities that we shot     

24
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,396
    "Triple D" in years ago,    
   and seeing what's going on.  

25
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,930
  So I'm here in Reno, Nevada,  

26
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:09,334
 and I got to tell you the food 
  revolution is alive and well. 

27
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:12,871
             This is            
    the Washoe Public House.    

28
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,873
   Sticky Thai chicken wings,   
          five minutes.         

29
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,008
       Washoe Public House      
        is one of a kind.       

30
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,410
        Two Irish Nachos.       

31
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,612
 This is, like, my happy place. 

32
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,414
           -[ Laughs ]          
  -I'll have what she's having. 

33
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,750
  It's out of the norm of Reno, 
 and Reno needs out of the norm.

34
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,085
    Your wild boar schnitzel.   

35
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,020
  There was a need for something
              that I wanted to, 

36
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:32,357
         which was from scratch,
   seasonal, super high quality.

37
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,692
   FIERI: And when it comes to  
        putting together        

38
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,560
 his wild menu, chef and owner, 

39
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:38,029
         Brett Moseley's        
      definitely got game.      

40
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,364
   Brett's a huge outdoorsman,  

41
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,301
       big game is huge in      
 the northern Nevada community. 

42
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:43,768
  Double elk chops going down.  

43
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,571
  Brett cooks a mean elk chop,  

44
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:47,506
      better than any steak     
         I've ever had.         

45
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,374
  Just outstanding. Pretty much 
    you're licking the plate.   

46
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,042
       FIERI:                   
What are we gonna make?         
                Double elk chop.

47
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,311
               Dark red meat,   

48
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:55,046
              really great for  
            a medium rare steak.
Excellent.                      

49
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,716
The first thing we're gonna make
  our luxardo cherry demi-glace.
Okay.                           

50
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,784
            Luxardo cherries are
 the original maraschino cherry,

51
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,720
             and they're, like, 
              really dark red.  

52
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,188
              We're gonna start 
               with veal bones  

53
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,322
         that have been roasted.

54
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,925
         Carrots, onion, celery.
            Water going in this.

55
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:08,393
-Then we'll reduce it overnight.
            -Got it.            

56
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:11,062
           Then we add red wine,
        let that reduce by half.

57
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,998
       Add our Luxardo cherries.

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,466
             So we're gonna sear
       this double elk chop here

59
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,335
              with kosher salt  
  and fresh ground black pepper.

60
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,670
         Throw it into the oven.

61
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,806
While that's working, we'll work
on the potatoes and the squash? 

62
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,876
   Yep. Roasted russet potatoes,
                salt, pepper.   

63
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:26,344
           And we're gonna sauté
            our pattypan squash.
Right.                          

64
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,547
A little bit of salt and pepper.
  Starting get some color on it.

65
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,349
              Garlic, shallots. 

66
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,084
                   I think      
     our elk chop's almost done.

67
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:33,151
      Gorgeous.                 

68
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,220
        Hit it with some butter,
             so we can baste it.

69
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,422
Look at that technique,         
bringing all those flavors      

70
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:38,890
off the bottom of the pan.      

71
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,759
        -Our fine herbs.        
          -Fine herbs.          

72
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,828
          -Fine herbs.          
  -He's just getting all fancy. 

73
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,830
             Parsley, tarragon, 
              chervil, chives.  

74
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,699
     A little bit of lemon juice
 to finish. Add a little butter.

75
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,634
        -More fine herb.        
          -Lemon zest.          

76
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,836
Got a lot going on just         
for the side dish, boss.        

77
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,439
          Potatoes and we hit it
 with the fine herb, lemon zest,

78
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,773
       and a little lemon juice.

79
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,175
    And we're ready to plate up.

80
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,245
            Potatoes down first,
              squash, elk chop, 

81
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:01,914
                a little bit    
             of that demi-glace.

82
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,582
        Garnish with pea shoots.

83
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:05,317
     Beautiful.                 

84
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:09,187
  Nice medium rare,             
great crust on the outside.     

85
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,191
That's fantastic. Look at that. 
It's rich, tons of flavor.      

86
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,193
    Super tender,               

87
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,062
 dynamite compliment            
with this cherry demi.          

88
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:20,332
The pan-fried potato,           
you get this nice crunch,       

89
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:23,001
  and then a creamy             
velvety potato inside.          

90
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:25,470
There's good texture            
   in that squash.              

91
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,539
Being that you're a hunter,     
you know how to treat it.       

92
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,809
I mean it is, like, goosebump   
time, it's really spot on.      

93
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,145
     Excellent.                 

94
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:34,613
    And your double elk chop.   

95
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,881
The tenderness of it is amazing.

96
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,818
  With the luxardo cherry demi, 
         it's top-notch.        

97
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,688
 Almost exotic, because it's not
 something you find everywhere. 

98
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,823
       Spinach cappelleti       
          with ricotta.         

99
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,357
   Reno, we've changed a lot.   

100
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,825
        High quality food       
         really came in.        

101
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,428
 Brett's restaurants centered in
the heart of the community here.

102
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,297
     Everything on the menu     
       is a winning item.       

103
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,833
      I got four orders of      
  wild boar schnitzel all day.  

104
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,835
       Wild boar schnitzel      
     is a really great dish.    

105
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,770
        He does a pickled       
         mushroom on it.        

106
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,373
        With the spatzle,       
  it's a gorgeous German dish.  

107
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,442
      -What's on the menu?      
     -Wild boar schnitzel --    

108
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:04,976
             -Okay.             
     -...with rice spatzle.     

109
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,646
Schnitzel and spatzle goes      
together like Bogie and Bacall. 

110
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:08,980
   -I don't know who that is.   
             -What?             

111
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,648
             -What?             
        -We have to talk.       

112
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,984
           -Rye flour.          
            -Rye not?           

113
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:15,921
      Yeah. AP flour, some eggs,
   a little bit of salt, pepper.

114
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:16,988
   We got an imperial brown ale,

115
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,590
         they make it right down
                 the street.    

116
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,058
     Blanch it in boiling water,

117
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,793
           by forcing it through
                 a perf pan.    

118
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,263
You got to go quick.            
Chef, great technique.          

119
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,598
That is the quickest            
I've ever seen it done.         

120
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,600
  -Blanch it in the cold water. 
   -Stop the cooking process.   

121
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,602
Mm, I liked that little         
 rye note in there.             

122
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,937
            Something different.

123
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,539
I'll have all that to go.       
What are we into now?           

124
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,941
    It's a garnish for the dish,
     which is pickled mushrooms.

125
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,545
    So I have rice wine vinegar,
              water, soy sauce, 

126
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,413
    brown sugar, fish sauce.    
              -Wow.             

127
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,349
             And then we've got 
  three kinds of mushrooms here.

128
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:47,085
       Brown albas, white albas,
               king trumpets.   

129
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,554
            Pour that hot brine,
      and let it rest overnight.

130
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:50,822
 Now we're on to...             

131
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:53,158
 The schnitzel with the seasoned
               flour breading.  

132
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,628
     AP flour, cornstarch, salt,
  pepper, cumin, smoked paprika,

133
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,997
      chili powder, fennel seed,
               mustard powder.  

134
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,566
Anything that you haven't       
    put in there?               

135
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:04,836
         Old Bay, garlic powder,
    onion powder and some clove.

136
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,838
Wing of bat, and eye of newt.   

137
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,640
  And you're using              
wild boar tenderloin.           

138
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,309

      Butterfly it a little bit.

139

Plastic wrap on top.            

140
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,845
                Pound it out,   
      then we're gonna bread it.

141
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,980
           A little bit of milk,
               panko breading,  

142

 -We're gonna make the spatzle. 

145
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:24,055

       of oil, salt, and pepper.

                on one side.    

147

Lemon zest and fine herb.       

148

start off with the brine.       

220

Hot water, garlic powder,       
kosher salt, some sugar.

00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,085

 to cool that down,             

222
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,020
so we are not scorching

00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:14,425
               So the airliner  
            was to make the food

226
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,093
            a little bit fancier
               on the airline.  

227
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,828
              They would leave  
       the wing connected to it.

228
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,564
But I also heard, because       
it's still got the wings,       

229
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,766
    so it flies.

00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,034
       I haven't heard that one.
        I'll go with that, also.

00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,302
   -So you just trim off this.  
       -We trim off that.       

232
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,637
      Save that for wings later.

233
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,973
Yep. We just want to            
make it a little more flat.     

234
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,641
   We're gonna let              
this brine overnight.           

235
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,843

236
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,912
      Correct.                  
We're going to bag it up,       

237
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,780
put it in our Cryovac machine.

00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,850
165, and we let this go         
 for about an hour.             

240
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,051
             Par-cook it a bit, 

241
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,452
      so when you're breading it
               and frying it,   

242
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,321
         you're gonna be able to
 achieve that really nice crisp.

243
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,923
     And not have to wait for it
    to cook all the way through.

244
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,123
Exactly. It stays nice,         

245
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,859
and juicy and tender            
    all the time.               

246
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,528
Dredge it in rice flour,        
and fry it at order.            

247
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,930
 -We've got to make the biscuit.
              -Yep.             

248
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:56,601
So we add our flour in, salt,   
baking soda, baking powder.     

249
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:57,802
       Mix the dry a little bit.

250
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,870
   We're gonna add              
 our cold butter in.            

251
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,873
      -Local goat cheddar.      
     -Goat cheddar, really?     

252
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,274
Yeah. Green onion, as well.     

253
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,742
         And last but not least,
               the buttermilk.  

254
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,211
As soon as this kind of         
all sticks together, it's done. 

255
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,747
Dump this out on here.          

256
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,414
And then we're gonna do         
a little fold on it,            

257
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,017
 and we're gonna do             
that a couple times to make sure

258
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,151
we got some nice layers.        

259
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,285
      We've got                 
our little custom maker         

260
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,353
that's a little bit bigger.     

261
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,555
           That's a big biscuit.

262
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,422
It's a big sandwich.            
   I'm a big guy.               

263
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:21,693
         -And what temp?        
   -350 for about 18 minutes.   

264
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:22,827
  All right, Jeff, let's see it.

265
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,896
-Toasted our house-made biscuit.
             -Okay.             

266
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,132
 And we're gonna put            
a little horseradish crema.     

267
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:28,967
Our chicken breast that         
we just took out of the fryer.  

268
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:32,237
             House-made pickles.
Real thin batter on that chicken

269
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,972
            from the rice flour,
         but it's super crunchy.
Yeah.                           

270
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,173
And then our onion rings        
from the rice flour as well.    

271
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:37,775
                 I love it.     

272
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:41,913
            Nice tender biscuit.

273
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,383
             Mm, great chicken. 
   This is tender, great flavor.

274
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:48,386
       You're definitely getting
      a little bit of the brine.

275
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:51,322
         It's a light crisp fry,
    and the brine of the pickle,

276
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,124
       and the horseradish sauce
                is dynamite.    

277
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,393
              I give you props. 

278
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,794
    Chicken biscuit sandwich.   

279
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:00,265
    The chicken is fantastic.   
     It's moist, it's fresh.    

280
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,534
 The biscuit is just phenomenal.

281
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:03,567
 I think that's one             
  of my favorites.              

282
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:04,802
  I think that goes with beer.  

283
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,472
       The beer is great.       
John Rowley's the master brewer.

284
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:10,075
   Makes wonderful barrel-aged  
       and farmhouse ales.      

285
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,877
   He and Jeffrey are some of   
 the biggest beer nerds I know. 

286
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,745
  You get that nice             
vanilla flavor in there.        

287
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,415
     The beer shows so much     
           character,           

288
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,350
     the food reinforces it.    

289
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,619
  New England clam chowder, up. 

290
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,820
  The New England clam chowder  
         is the freshest        

291
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,556
    you can get in Santa Fe,    
           New Mexico.          

292
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:25,957
       The presentation's       
       totally different.       

293
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,759
          With the clam         
      still in the shells.      

294
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,561
      FIERI: It's an a la minute
                clam chowder.   

295
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,429
  We build the dish             
   one at a time.               

296
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,631
We get live Manila clams in.    
We're gonna clean them,         

297
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,566
and we're gonna try to          
simulate the tide pool,         

298
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,169
   because that's               
  what clams like.              
                 Beautiful, huh?

299
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,771
We let these chill out in water 
      like this                 

300
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,240
for about half an hour,         
and then we'll strain them out. 

301
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,775
  Keep them alive,              
  keep them happy.              

302
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,510
We never want to serve the ones 
that are already dead.          

303
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,578
Then we're just gonna cover     
this with a nice wet towel,     

304
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,647
     pour some ice on this.     
          -Next steps?          

305
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,915
 We're gonna cut up             
   a little leek,               

306
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,984
and then we do the corn.        

307
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,320
Ah, that's a cool trick.        
I've never seen that before.    

308
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,255
       When you're doing volumes
of corn and you don't want to --

309
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,456
          -Yeah, yeah.          
    -...chase it all around.    

310
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,792
  Sweet. All right,             
now we're ready to cook.        

311
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,995
  Olive oil, bacon.             
Get that a little crispy.       

312
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,997
The leeks, shallots,            
   and our garlic.              

313
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,532
Then we're gonna add            
    in our clams.               

314
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,667
  That's my kind of clam chowder
                right there.    

315
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,203
Heat things up a little bit,    
add some white wine.            

316
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:13,471
Cover this to steam it.         

317
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:14,939
  So he's keeping all the flavor

318
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,542
             of all those clams 
             in that little pan.

319
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,677
Make sure they're all open,     
make sure they all look good.   

320
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,079
            And if they weren't,
             we'd pick them out?

321
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,748
Pitch them out, yeah.           
Heavy cream, potatoes, too,     

322
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,283
which are par-cooked            
all the way through.            

323
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,417
Bring that back to a boil.      

324
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,685
   We're gonna add              
a little salt and pepper.       

325
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,819
Throw our corn in here.         

326
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,221
Got a little parsley            
 and some tarragon.             

327
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,489
  Tarragon is a nice kick there.

328
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:33,358
Kind of looking for that        
right thickness right now.      

329
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,559
     Just gonna                 
  plate it up here.             

330
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,027
Nice little mountain of clams   
   in the center.               

331
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,629
A little fresh lemon zest,      
and oyster crackers.            

332
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,566
                     ♪♪         

333
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,234
      Mm, what I just got there,

334
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,636
              was a little kiss 
              with the tarragon 

335
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:46,237
              and a little bit  
             of the lemon zest. 

336
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:49,307
        Big piece of sweet corn.

337
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,242
  Bites of bacon, creamy potato.

338
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,177
        Broth is nice and light,
               and not heavy.   

339
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,912
           Just the right amount
               of white wine.   

340
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,447
      Just a touch of the cream,

341
00:11:56,449 --> 00:12:01,452
            and really delicious
                fresh clams.    

342
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,388
                 Well done.     

343
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,456
   -New England clam chowder.   
           -All right.          

344
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,859
            The clams           
     are completely tender.     

345
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,260
   They've got a great flavor.  

346
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,462
      The tarragon just gives it
         a little licorice lift.

347
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,331
                I think it's    
              a fantastic dish. 

348
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,200
            -Cheers.            
    -Great neighborhood spot.   

349
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,268
    They put a lot of passion   
  into everything they do here. 

350
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,604
         Watch out for this guy,
      it'll hurt your waistline.

351
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,806
                  Nice job.     

352
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:25,009
    Up next, the bomb bagels    
 in Cambridge, Massachusetts... 

353
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,344
             The only thing that
                I don't like    

354
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,546
             is that one-quarter

00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,841
     You get some sweetness     
         from the tomato        

471
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,777
       and some smokiness       
      from the crisp bacon.     

472
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:55,579
     The spicy cream cheese     
 has a lot of, like, heat to it.

473
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,849
  My sinuses open up. So good.  

474
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,318
     If these two look familiar,
     it's because you tuned into

475
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,186
                 "Triple D"     
           like seven years ago.

476
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,388
             Rachel and Charles 
                from Cutty's.   

477
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,324
              I find out today  
  when I'm visiting Bagelsaurus,

478
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,194
       that our chef was working
        for you back in the day.

479
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,263
     She was working for us     
         when we filmed         

480
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:16,534
   "Triple D" and she started   
    making bagels at Cutty's.   

481
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,269
She started with a few dozen    
 bagels, and then --            

482
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,337
        -Grew, and grew.        
             -Grew.             

483
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,004
  And then she had to move out. 

484
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,406
  I would say that Bagelsaurus  

485
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,675
         kind of started        
  the bagel movement in Boston. 

486
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,878
  It's become its own landmark  
          for the area.         

487
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,280
             So here's the deal,
     we're hanging right outside

488
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,149
       of Boston at Bagelsaurus.

489
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:32,483
      And when we come back     

490
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,752
    we're meeting the bagel's   
         unholy cousin.         

491
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:35,953
     Hot smoked on a bialey.    

492
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,488
      Bialeys are so good.      

493
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,291
   They're just like a big old  
    dough that's not boiled.    

494
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,360
      And ingredients baked     
         into the center        

495
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,694
    is what makes it so good.   

496
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:44,629
              See you in a bit.

498
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,136
Guy, I'm gonna need those.      

499
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:55,739
             -Sorry.            
           -Thank you.          

500
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,209
        Welcome back, "Triple D"
      hanging out at Bagelsaurus

501
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,744
     in the Cambridge-Somerville
                    area.       

502
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,548
      You opened up a bagel shop
            that is serving over

503
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,684
            6,000 bagels a week,
   13 different types of bagels.

504
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:09,420
    And didn't you go and create
       dishes with these bagels,

505
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,089
so you're not just a bagel shop,
        you're bagel restaurant?

506
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,757
      -Did I get it right?      
       -You got it, yeah.       

507
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,958
                    Whew.       

508
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,029
     They have sweet bagels,    
       and savory bagels,       

509
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:19,430
       and they're always       
       a little on unique.      

510
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,299
        Like the bialeys        
        are really good.        

511
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:23,701
   A bialey is like a thinner   
       version of a bagel       

512
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,436
      and it's a little bit     
         more delicate.         

513
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,104
     Hot smoked on a bialey.    

514
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,174
    A hot smoked is bunch of    
       hot smoked salmon,       

515
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,376
 and then pickled cabbage, dill,

516
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:33,578
       with cream cheese.       

517
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,979
       It is so delicious.      

518
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,780
We're going to make something   
  called a bialy --             
                           Okay.

519
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,585
...which is another traditional 
Jewish bread product.           

520
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,787
 The difference is,             
we don't boil these.            
                           Okay.

521
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,055
And we can use the same dough   
that we use for our bagels,     

522
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,524
so they've already done         
  all the resting.              

523
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:48,125
I'm not gonna put you           
 through that again.            

524
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,195
   So, we're gonna              
  close the holes.              
                           Okay.

525
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:54,198
And we're gonna fill it with    
onions and poppy seeds again.   

526
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,800
             You love your onion
      and poppy seed, don't you?

527
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,335
            -I know.            
          -Maldon salt.         

528
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:59,870
A little maldon on top,         
  just to be fancy.             

529
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,339
Spray them with a little water  

530
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:02,940
just to give them a little bit  
of steam in the oven.           

531
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,942
 -It just gets a bit of a mist. 
            -A mist.            

532
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,610
             All these get done 
         in the oven, what temp?

533
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,479
Around 15 minutes, 450.         

534
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,880
           Now what are we into?

535
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,149
  Now, we're making             
 our pickled cabbage            

536
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,884
  for the hot smoked sandwich.  
    -All right, let's see it.   

537
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:18,956
White vinegar, water, sugar,    
 salt, mustard seed.            

538
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,558
            And a lot of garlic.

539
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,360
Bring this to a boil,           
    pour it over.               

540
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:23,627
That's gonna sit over night,    

541
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,896
and then we're ready            
to build our sandwich.          

542
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,098
         -Let's see it.         
      -Onion, poppy bialey.     

543
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,101
 Plain cream cheese             
   on both sides.

Sliced red onion on the bottom. 
 Hot smoked salmon.             

545
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:36,640
Our pickled cabbage here,       
 and a lot of dill.             

546
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,642
             That is a big dill.

550
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,922
         You have that huge acid
          hit from that cabbage,

551
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,125
   compounded with the smokiness

        cut through that.       

560
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,211
  This bialey's unique because  
   it has that nice thin size,  

561
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,680
     so I get that chewiness
