00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,134
   So when I come off the road  
      from doing triple D,      

2
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,736
   the first thing I wanna do   
  is to get home to my kitchen  

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,405
 and cook my food for my family 

4
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:07,605
     and after a few weeks,     
          I gotta be--          

5
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:08,807

  to some of our favorite chefs

122
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:40,419
     How are we making that?    

123
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,420
      You'll need a mixer.      

124
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,554
           Nice mixer.          

125
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,623
     Yeah. Come on. You guys    
  expected anything different?  

126
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,091
      Does it make a vroom,     
          vroom sound?          

127
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,693
    Does it have an exhaust?    
      Does it have wheels?      

128
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:50,428
         So, butter down        
        and cream cheese.       

129
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:51,496

      it's really roadside.

263

 on a little rope or something,

00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,487

         [Robin laughs]

00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,712
      <i> Sautee those around</i>      
        <i> for about five,</i>        
      <i> six, seven minutes.</i>      

279
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,714
            Alright.            
    So, while that's working,   

280
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,515
           can we see           
     if these cinnamon rolls    

281
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:05,584
    look good for you? Robin,   

282
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,651
     are we proofed enough?

       <i> They look great.</i>

      You can bake suckers.

285
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,659
       So, on this burger,      
       why the red stock?       

286
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:15,594
       <i> Because it tastes</i>       
         <i> really good.</i>

       I've never had it.

          No. I'm gonna         
        make a visit here       

291
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,869
    <i> and make it off a show,</i>

  <i> Oh, Tom, I didn't even know</i>  
   <i> that you were still here.</i>   

293
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,339
     Let me get the remote.     

294
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:28,406
       Tom, thanks a lot.       

295
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:29,975
    Let's say goodbye to Tom.

          onion powder,         

303
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,756
   fresh crushed black pepper.  

304
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,626
   <i> Correct. Now just season</i>    
   <i> both sides of your patty.</i>

       <i> It's 85% red deer</i>       
       <i> and 15% beef fat.</i>       

306
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,896
   The red deer is super lean,  

307
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,831
     so I love that you put     
     some beef fat in there.    

308
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,367
         The onions are         
     starting to soften up.     

309
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,302
  There goes the chicken stock. 

310
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,704
  You see that cascading pour?  

311
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:00,772
     I'm doing my best work.

 <i> for just a couple of seconds.</i> 

313
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,509
   Here it goes, the patties.   

314
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,846
     <i> That's a good sizzle.</i>     

315
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,515
      The reduced balsamic,     
  chopped up rosemary going in. 

316
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,450
           And another          
      little pinch of salt.     

317
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,718
       How are we treating      
       these buns, sister?

     like eight minutes left    

322

     on the cinnamon rolls.     

323
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,529
  Okay. She might have stuck us 

324
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:25,597
   with making cinnamon rolls,  

325
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,399
    but the fact that you're    
    timing it in Colorado...    

326
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,534
  I'm impressed. I'm impressed.

  The onions and the balsamic.

        That looks good.        
      Get your blue cheese.     

335
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:47,619
          We didn't see         
        any blue cheese.        

336

     the<i> cabrito</i> burger was,    

348
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,844
       the same thing here      
 with this New Zealand venison. 

349
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:16,647
      The depth of flavor,      
  the richness is outstanding.

00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,350
     we put on the seafood.     

700
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,485
        It gives a little       
          more texture.         

701
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,819
      Seafood super tender.     

702
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,054
      Nothing's overcooked.     

703
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,557
          And it really         
        helps that sauce.       

704
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,626
          When we added         
     in chopped clam juice.     

705
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,362
    It took the whole seafood   
    flavor to the next level.   

706
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,563
  I would drink that as a soup. 

707
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,765
    Wow! It just got so much    
        complexity to it.       

708
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,301
  I just hope you have enough.  

709

             Enough?

712
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,507
    The dishes are dynamite,    
     but we gotta figure out

     get you cash or prizes.    

715
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:14,512
         It's just a bit        
       of bragging, right?      

716
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,180

    the biggest dish, right?    

719
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,520
      Folks, we have a tie.     

720
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,455
               Oh!              

721
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,657
      So I gotta give it up     
       to two of the OG's.      

722
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,659

   to Gus from Marietta Diner,  

725

      because Gus, this is      
    the most ridiculous thing
