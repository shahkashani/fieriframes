      It's a heck of a job.

318

  The croquettes are delicious. 
  They pack a flavorful punch.  

319
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:54,118
     It's like this symphony    
           of flavors.

326
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:05,463

 It's got, like, the pork chunks
  on top, the fried plantains.  

337
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,352
        This is something

364
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,204
                 Basically,     
       we salted this overnight.

365
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,873
               Put some holes

00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:28,946

379
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,436
           A little bit of sugar

380
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,705
              and a little bit  
         of togarashi seasoning.
    Interesting.

       for about 15, 20 minutes,

383
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:02,380
         and that's what we toss
               with our pork.   

384
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,381
 And next?                      
              We're gonna make  
          our sweet chili sauce.

  Okay.

            with a little water.

386
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,252
                   We got       
           the red bell peppers,

387
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,388
               crushed garlic,  
             crushed red pepper.

388
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,522
     We're gonna puree this.    
             -Okay.             

389
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:15,260
        Start with rice vinegar,
            sugar, pepper puree.

390
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,662
               Cook for about   
               10, 15 minutes.  

391
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,463
       And now, we're gonna make
               our fried rice.  
  Hit it.

              fried-rice sauce. 

395
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,404
So, the tamarind pot has        
this nice sourness to it        

396
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,672

529
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,477
  and I said yes.               
                      Okay.     

530
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,814
     I told him                 
that I wanted bacon.            

531
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,950
     So, you would've been happy
         if the whole Ava burger

532
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,417
                  was just      
           a giant bacon burger?

533
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,819
  I like my burger.             

534
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,888
     You should like your burger
      when it's named after you.

535
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,024
     And beyond the burger,     
      this place definitely     

536
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,159
   raises the bar on bar food.  

537
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,760
              Wellington bites, 
                  Table 2!      

538
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,031
 Kind of like getting a steak as
 an appetizer, all in one bite. 

539
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:21,165
  Well, we're gonna             
get into something now          

540
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,566
that we've never seen           
  on "Triple D" --              

541
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,568
a Wellington bite?              
              Beef Wellington.  

542
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,037
     We've just miniaturized it.
        Turned it into bar food.
   Fantastic.                   

543
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,539
              We're gonna make  
           our mushroom duxelle.

544
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,841
                A little bit    
                of olive oil,   

545
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:32,109
                   butter,      
            diced-up prosciutto,

546
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,578
          mushrooms -- creminis.
Cremini's my favorite.          

547
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,847
       Fresh thyme, a little bit
             of salt and pepper.

548
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,983
    We're gonna go ahead and let
     this render 15, 20 minutes.

549
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,252
   And let it cool              
 so we can stuff it.            
                     Absolutely.

550
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:42,453
   I like the way               
    he's rolling.               

551
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,854
                 We're gonna    
            cube up some fillet,

552
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,722
               typically used   
            for your Wellington.

553
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,191
     Seasoned with a little salt
                 and pepper.    

554
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,592
                Now we've got   
           our mushroom duxelle.

555
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,328
              Add a little bit  
              of Dijon mustard, 

556
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,663
                a little bit    
            of goose-liver pâté.

557
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,298
      In a bar.                 

558
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,667
        And we're just gonna mix
        this just so you have   
        a nice, smooth paste.   

559
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,536
  Okay.                         
           Spray our sheet tray.

560
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:00,137
            Add our puff pastry,

561
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,073
              our duxelle mix,  
               one cube each.   

562
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,609
             And then we're just
            gonna wrap these up,

563
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:05,743
              little Christmas  
               present-style.   

564
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,811
 So, what everybody             
loves about beef Wellington is, 

565
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,079
      they love                 
 the crust anyways.             

566
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,681
And the nice little ratio       
   he's made here               

567
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,416
gives you the chance            
you're gonna get great puff,    

568
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,351
  nice little piece             
  of fillet inside.             

569
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,420
              We're gonna go in 

570
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:17,655
                   and add      
              a little egg wash 

571
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,823
           just to get them nice
             and brown. Perfect.

572
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,292
             We're going at 425 
           for about 10 minutes.
 Okay.                          

573
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,228
            And we're making our
         port wine cherry sauce.
Dig it.                         

574
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,564
   -Start with our port wine.   
    -A lot of dried cherries.   

575
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,166
           A little white sugar,

576
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,633
                a little bit    
             of fresh rosemary, 

577
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:30,834
                fresh-ground    
                black pepper.   

578
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,035
      And we're gonna bring that
                to a simmer.    

579
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,503
               We're gonna add  
         a little bit of butter,

580
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,306
         then we're gonna hit it
            with the boat motor.

581
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,907
  -Let's put it together, man.  
           -All right.          

582
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,977
               Toasty and brown 
               Wellington bites.
Look at that.                   

583
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:42,579
It's very luxurious.            

584
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,116
   That's the one.              

585
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:46,984
        Mmm!                    
     Delicious.                 

586
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:51,322
   This will blow               
   people's minds.              
              That was the plan.

587
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,390
    I'm serious.                

588
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:55,326
     I enjoy it                 
so much more because --         

589
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,328
                 You get all    
               the good parts.  

590
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,396
                 The pastry.    
         That's where you're at.

591
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,399
The duxelle is delish.          

592
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,200
    I'd pass out                
    eating that.                

593
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,203
     "Delicious"                
is an understatement.           

594
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,873
        Mmm!                    
    Outstanding.                

595
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,208
                    Awesome.    
   <i> Outstanding.</i>                

596
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,211
  Jay, your personal favorite,  
      the Wellington bites.     

597
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,346
   MAN: What's there not to like
        about medium-rare fillet

598
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:17,615
             and a puff pastry? 

599
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:20,083
    You get your fix, because   
     it is a very rich dish.    

600
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,819
        It's very unique        
       and it's delicious.      

601
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,020
               Short rib mac!

        FIERI: I've been to some

604
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,426

00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,095
               that's -- it's   
            a pretty neat place.

606
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,230

     be really, really good.    

607
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,432
  It's remarkable.              

608
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:35,666
You deserve all the recognition 
   you're getting.
