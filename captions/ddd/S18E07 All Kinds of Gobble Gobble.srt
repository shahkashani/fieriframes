37

  all over this great country,

 have been baking up New Mexican
     specialties since 1972,    

43
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:39,297

  the type of turkey they bake. 

44

 This is Golden Crown Panaderia.

45
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,239
        It's a fantastic        
     family-oriented bakery.

  We feel really lucky to have  
  them right around the corner.

    FIERI: The father-and-son   
  powerhouse behind this joint. 

51
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,458
      It all began in '72,      
 when military man Pratt Morales

52
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,795
            got after           
   what he really loved to do.  

53
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,129
PRATT: I always wanted          
   to be a baker,               

54
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,332
and everywhere in the world     
that I traveled in the military,

55
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:15,000
  I always wound up             
at the local bakery.            

56
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:17,068
           And it took          
      just another 30 years     

57
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,271
        to get a reliable       
        business partner.       

58
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:21,406
I couldn't afford a C.E.O.,     
 so I raised my own.            

59
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,675
     Together, they turn out    
      a one-of-a-kind menu.     

60
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,344
         It's all about         
      the biscochitos here.     

61
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:27,145
  I like the pumpkin empanadas. 

62
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,414
    FIERI: But when it comes    
       to Thanksgiving...       

63
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,882
Isn't that beautiful?           

64
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:34,753
    ...it's no surprise that    
the bird is absolutely the word.

65
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:35,754
     Turkey bread is great.     

66
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:38,356
        They make it look       
       just like a turkey.      

67
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,625
               Okay, what are   
               we gonna make?   
I want to make some dough.      

68
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,894
And this is gonna be the wheat  
part of the turkey...           

69
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,296
               The wheat part.  

70
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:45,764
...which is the leg,            
the drumsticks, and the wings.  

71
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,967
    Got some nice               
stone-ground wheat flour.       

72
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,502
This is the bread flour.        

73
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,769
A lot of gluten in here.        

74
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,371
Put a little bit of salt        
      in there.                 

75
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:54,773
A little bit of shortening.     

76
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,175
   And let it mix               
  for a little bit.             

77
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,444
Some molasses. That's gonna     
give us some of the color.      

78
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,112
   It's also some               
of the sweetener, too.          

79
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,981
And to soften up the dough      
    a little bit,               

80
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,183
   we're gonna put              
     some honey.                

81
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,384
                     Darling.   
Beautiful.                      

82
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:08,053
And now we're going to add      
  some water to it.             

83
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:12,257
I'm gonna add it slowly,        
little by little by little.     

84
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,659
 Time for the yeast.            

85
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,094
We got all the mixes in there,  
   so here we go.               

86
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:20,331
     We stop it,                
bring it all out here.          

87
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,534
And what I'm gonna do now       
 to make a turkey --            

88
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,269
 It's gonna be made             
   in three parts.              

89
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,138
    I'm gonna cut               
   the drumsticks.              

90
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,074
The wings is gonna be           
 about 1/2 a pound.             

91
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,877
    There you go.               

92
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,545
I have another dough            
     that I need                

93
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,881
to make the white               
part of the turkey,             
which is the breast.            

94
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,682
    White flour,                
a little bit of sugar,          

95
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,884
salt, the shortening.           

96
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,086
                   Gotcha.      
  Water.                        

97
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,722
 And add the yeast.             

98
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,959
  Well, here we go.             
                           Okay.

99
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,362
                  How long      
       have you been doing this?
About 40 years.                 

100
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:51,763
                  40 years      
       you've been making these?

101
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:52,798
    Yes. Mm-hmm.                

102
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,568
Oh, this is gonna be            
   the drumsticks.              

103
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,636
                  I see it.     

104
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:58,904
 They're dark meat.             

105
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,505
And then we're gonna do         
      the body,                 

106
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,308
which is the white part         
of the turkey -- the breast.    

107
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,443
And this is gonna go            
   right in here.               
                      Seriously?

108
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,379
Okay. And I'm gonna twist it    
     like this.                 

109
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,648
 Now we're gonna do             
     the wings.                 

110
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,323
 Now we're gonna cut            
the top part of the turkey,     

111
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:19,457
    separate it.                

112
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,592
    There you go.               
 And then the wings.            

113
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,395
Separate them over here, also.  
      The bone.                 

114
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:24,863
               Could have been  
               a taxidermist.   

115
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:27,198
                  Giving it     
               a little texture.
There you go.                   

116
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,334
  And I'm gonna do              
a very light egg wash --        

117
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,602
Give it the golden color.       

118
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,937
   Some rosemary.               

119
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,538
A little bit of parsley.        

120
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,008
     Let it rise                
 as high as it will.            

121
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,210
                Wait for it!    
                   Ready?       

122
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,812
          [ Drumroll ]          
 Ta-da!                         

123
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,547
  Here we go, guys.             

124
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:43,815
                Look at that.   

125
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,684
              That's beautiful. 
Isn't that beautiful?           

126
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,486
          I think people would  
          like to have a turkey 
          that looked that good.

127
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,421
I'm gonna slice you a piece.    
    How is that?                

128
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,089
              I'd like to have  
              some of the knee. 

129
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,891
    A little knee               
    right there.                

130
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,962
                    Mmm.        

131
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,665
           Great crust on there.

132
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,901
             I get a little bit 
             of that molasses.  
There you go.                   

133
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,570
         Try some of the breast.

134
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,839
 There's a good part            
    right there.                

135
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,841
        It has huge crust on it,

136
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,244
 but then it's just pillowy soft
               on the inside.   

137
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,116
             I get a little bit 
     of that rosemary on that --

138
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,184
               On that bread.   

139
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,052
          It tastes like holiday
             right off the bat. 

140
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,054
              MAN:              
   It looks good on your table  

141
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,789
        with your flowers       
    or whatever you're doing.   

142
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,192
             MAN #2:            
   It's a great place to come   

143
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,060
  and feel like you're welcome  
          all the time.         

144
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,062
    There you go.               

145
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:31,996
               Pratt, amazing.  
Thank you, my friend.           

146
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,931
                 I love it.     

147
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,200
       FIERI: Coming up...      

148
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,001
      So, you're kind of pimping
          when you're crimping. 

149
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,670
     I'm pimping                
    all the time.               

150
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,540
      ...we're headed north     
to Santa Fe for a hidden deli...

151
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,941
              Got it. Love it.  
           Can't wait to try it.

152
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,411
         ...ladling out         
    a post-feast favorite...    

153
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,212
             I'm done shooting. 
   I'm just eating the soup now.

154
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,415
    ...and one savory slice.    

155
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,050
                Look at that.   
Just like Thanksgiving.         

156
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,526
    So, the Thanksgiving tour   
            continues           

157
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,994
  here in Santa Fe, New Mexico, 

158
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,996
       in the East Capitol      
          neighborhood,         

159
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,598
     where there's a "blink     
    and you'll miss it" deli    

160
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,866
   that you got to check out,   

161
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,934
      where they're rocking     
       award-winning soups      

162
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,669
   and keeping it traditional   
          with the pie.         

163
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,372
 This is the Back Street Bistro.

164
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,745
       The food is superb.      

165
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,814
  It's awesome.                 
             Order up!          

166
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,083
             It's home cooking. 
     I could eat here every day.

167
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,351
What do you think makes         
 the place so great?            

168
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:27,619
                Well, David.    

169
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:28,754
             -David.            
             -David.            

170
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:31,623
    FIERI: That's David Jacoby, 
       a Brooklyn transplant    

171
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,559
  who made his restaurant dream 
      a reality back in '94     

172
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,962
       and has been making      
  a name for himself ever since 

173
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,563
     with deli sandwiches...    

174
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,631
       Corned-beef Reuben,      
      avocado Amish cheese.     

175
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,167
 FIERI: ...scratch-made pies... 

176
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,302
         Coconut cream,         
        peach-crumb pies.       

177
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,370
             FIERI:             
     ...and standout soups.     

178
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,307
My friend Sydney that comes in  
 here, he's a rabbi,            

179
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:50,908
    and he said,                
"What can we call you?"         

180
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,777
I said, "Sydney, we'll          
call me the soup rabbi."        
He goes, "I love that."         

181
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,246
       So, why soup in Santa Fe?

182
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,648
Contrary to popular belief,     
it is cold here in the winter.  

183
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,583
     FIERI: And just in time    
        for the holidays,       

184
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:02,320
  the soup rabbi's blessing us  
 with an award-winning recipe...

185
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,121
            One bowl            
    smoked-turkey wild-rice.    

186
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,758
      FIERI: ...chock-full      
   of Thanksgiving favorites.   

187
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,726
      Conjures up thoughts      
        of, like, family.       

188
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,661
It's like a home away from home,
            you know?           

189
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:11,796
              Mmm.              

190
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,131
             Let's get into it. 

191
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,933
Okay. We're gonna start with    
one whole smoked turkey.        

192
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,469
                        Hit it. 
Take all the meat               
  off the bone.                 

193
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:20,472
This is the beginning of        
my smoked-turkey wild-rice soup.

194
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:23,008
It was the winner of the        
Souperbowl of Soup Cook-off     

195
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,209
held every year in town.        

196
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:26,011
          The Souperbowl of Soup
                  Cook-off.     

197
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,279
   That's correct.              
   Cube the meat.               

198
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,215
          On to the turkey soup.
We're gonna make the stock.     

199
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,283
Start with bones, skin,         

200
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,752
everything that's not           
  in the meat pot.              

201
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,086
                       Got it.  
 Add the water.                 

202
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,155
              And this is just  
             to make the stock? 
  Yes.                          

203
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,690
   Liquid smoke...              
                           Whoa!

204
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,758
...just to fortify it           
    a little bit.               

205
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,561
     And I have                 
  my chicken base.              

206
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:43,962
              Any garlic salt?  

207
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,163
        Nope.                   

208
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,765
And onto the stove we go.       

209
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,099
                And how long    
              will that simmer? 

210
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,634
  That's gonna cook             
  for four hours.               
                      I like it.

211
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,603
Next step we have --            
 Take our stockpot.             

212
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,506
 We add our butter.             
   Melt that down.              

213
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:55,707
                We're making    
              a mirepoix roux?  

214
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,042
That's correct.                 
      Or our roux with mirepoix.

215
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,979
 We add our onions,             
  carrots, celery.              

216
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,314
And I begin to cook.            
        Okay.                   

217
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,650
               Then we'll add   
               that flour in?   
That's correct.                 

218
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,385
Incorporate the flour.          
                          Great.

219
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,787
Cook about 15 minutes.          
Cook the flour flavor out.      

220
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,056
 And then we'll add             
     the stock.                 

221
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,258
                    Nice.       

222
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,927
 I'm gonna boil this            
for around 15, 20 minutes,      

223
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:17,328

258
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,866
        Because of the roux and 
   the pureeing of the mirepoix,

        of silkiness to it from 
        the milk and the cream, 

261
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:32,571

3 cups of a.p. flour.           

287
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,388
                         Okay.  
  A pinch of salt.              

288
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,922

That's it.                      

289
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,590
             So then you create 
               the flakiness.   

290
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,994
  I start pulsing.              

291
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:31,463
Then I add my 6 tablespoons     
 of ice-cold water.             

292
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,664
                    Okay.       

293
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,466
 It goes immediately            
    into a bowl.                

294
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,268
 I will chill it                
  a little bit.                 
      Just put it in the cooler.

295
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,270
About a half an hour.           
    Pull it out.                

296
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:40,405
     And get it                 
all squeezed together.          

297
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,674
     Cut in half                
 and begin to knead.            

298
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:45,210
Form it into a ball.            
Wrap it in the plastic wrap.    

299
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:46,678
                     Wrap it up.
Flatten it out.

refrigerator for the night,     

301
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,348
 and in the morning             
    it's relaxed.               

302
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,349
         Butter, butter, butter,
         butter, butter, butter.

303
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,553
           That is gonna make it
           flaky, flaky, flaky, 
           flaky, flaky, flaky. 

304
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:58,089
Once it's rolled out,           
I like to tighten up the        
edges a little bit.             

305
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,024
    So now we get that in there.
                There we go.    

306
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,827
And you're making your edge,    
   and you crimp.               

307
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,163

          when you're crimping. 

308
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,497
I'm pimping all the time.

       but if he says it's good,
                I'll try it.

            What temp? How long?

315
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,644
 375 for 25 minutes.            

316
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:22,046
             Crust is baked off.
     I'm ready                  
to make the filling.            

317
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,315
  Start with salt,              
      cinnamon,                 

318
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:27,652
   clove, ginger,               
nutmeg, brown sugar.            

319
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:30,054
                   That is      
          one flavorful filling.

320
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,656
Give that a little heave        
      together.                 

321
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:32,991
I'm gonna add my pumpkin.       

322
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,392
        Not pumpkin-pie filling?

323
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:38,730
    This is just cooked, pureed,
           straight-up pumpkin. 

324
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:41,166
First mix this together.        
Now I add my three eggs.        

325
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,068
    My molasses.                

326
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,804
                  Molasses?     
Molasses.                       

327
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,338
  Evaporated milk.              

328
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,741
   And you want to              
incorporate it real well,       

329
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:51,609
'cause you want to get          
those eggs working --           

330

       from the inside out, too,

444
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,331
                when you have   
              that cavity open. 

445
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,465
    That's good.                

446
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,666
All right, let's put            
the whole thing together.       

447
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:12,036
          Carve off a little bit
                 right here.    

448
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,939
  Got a little slaw             
      on there.                 

449
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:19,444
              The rancher beans 
              go on that plate. 

450
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,214
        And that's good and hot.

451
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,349
      Oh, yeah.                 

452
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:28,319
That utensil is far undersized  
for this kind of food.          

453
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,625
   This is tender,              
  not overseasoned,             

454
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:35,693
still nice and moist.           

455
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,829
          It tastes like turkey.
It tastes like turkey.          

456
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,331
But I think perfuming it        
with a little bit of wood       

457
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,499
just adds so much to it.        

458
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,834
I got a couple buddies          
      with me.                  

459
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,669
    I want to see               
what they have to say.          

460
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,774
  This is the crew              
  from Motley-Que.              

461
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:52,243
We all met down at barbecue camp
down in Houston, Texas.         

462
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,579
Smoked turkey? Come on.         
           Oh, it's really good.

463
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,447
    Dark meat's really juicy.   

464
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,315
Don't get your hands            
too close to the cage.          

465
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,617
          [ Laughter ]          

466
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,186
    FIERI: Buy two turkeys --   

467
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,323
         One to snack on        
 on the way to the family event.

468
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,325
 'Cause you know once you get it
      to somebody's house,      

469
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,660
   you're not taking any home.  

470
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:11,462
  What else you got             
   up your sleeve?              
                    The Big "D."

471
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,197
     It's a great sandwich.     

472
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,798
      It's like                 
 a barbecued Reuben?            

473
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,467
                A little bit.   
      Like that, only different.

474
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,402
 A barbecued Reuben             
    with issues?                

475
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,570
    FIERI: When we come back.   

476
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,712
    FIERI: It's the last stop   
    on the Thanksgiving tour,   

477
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,449
  and the Motley-Que team and I 
         are loading up         

478
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:34,385
      at Danny Edwards BBQ      
    in Kansas City, Missouri.   

479
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,921
   I've got a burnt-end dinner  
 and coleslaw for Josh, please. 

480
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,190
     FIERI: I got to say --     
   I am tapped out on turkey,   

481
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:44,128
so Danny's laying out one of his
  signature barbecue originals. 

482
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,329
           All right,           
       I got a Big "D" up.      

483
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,932
        Brisket sandwich        
   with onion ring and cheese.  

484
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,867
     It's a great sandwich.     

485
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,403
     FIERI: That's all about    
    the point of the brisket.   

486
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,138
    The charred outside part    
         of the brisket.        

487
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,607
FIERI: You have to cook         
  the whole brisket             

488
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,009
 before you can get             
to the Big "D" point.           

489
00:17:58,011 --> 00:17:59,276
           And you got to season
             the whole brisket. 

490
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,678
          Get it going.         

491
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,480
              Start with sugar. 

492
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:05,016
               Seasoning salt,  
                garlic salt,    

493
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:09,153
          paprika, black pepper,
               Cayenne pepper.  

494
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,756
Is that a little accent         
just got in there, Danny?       
                 A little cumin.

495
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,957
 Then we're gonna work it around
            here and mix it up. 

496
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,894
   So, we're gonna              
    dry-rub this.               

497
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:19,497
          Fatty side on the top.

498
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,165
  And this is all               
  for the Big "D."              

499
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,300
                  Big "D."      

500
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:24,568
      Big "D."                  
    Big trouble.                

501
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,437
How long is this gonna go       
   on the smoker?               

502
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,173
   It's gonna go on all night --
      about 16 hours, probably. 

503
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,842
  Really? 210, 212?             

504
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,448
        Now we're gonna separate
        the flat of the brisket 

505
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,782
               from the point   
               of the brisket.  

506
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,250
    Flat. Point.                

507
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,320
          Right, and you can see
          right where to do it. 

508
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,322
          There's a natural spot
           to stick your knife. 

509
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,124
                 I slide it     
    all the way through normally

510
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,325
       and just follow the line,

511
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,126
       and it goes straight down
             about right there. 

512
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,329
            This will stay here.
              This is the flat. 

513
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,297
               We'll use that   
         for brisket sandwiches,

514
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:57,468
             and we'll trim this
               just like this.  

515
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,069
             Your barbecue team 
               will like this.  

516
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,338
      Oh, yeah.                 

517
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,074
         Now we can season this.

518
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,409
 We're gonna hit it             
with more seasoning,            

519
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,077
so it's just right on its way   
to being burnt ends.            

520
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,347
                Pretty close.   
Now back to the smoker.         

521
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,015
               About an hour,   
             an hour and a half,

522
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:13,818
               maybe two hours  
                at the most.    

523
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,887
Hit it up, boss.                
                We're gonna make
                  the Big "D."  

524
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:19,957
        Get some of this really 
     beautiful stuff right here.

525
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:24,095
                  And we're     
              gonna start here. 

526
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:25,162
       Tender.                  

527
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,231
  Tender, tender --             
I'm on a brisket bender.        

528
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,833
     Put a little barbecue sauce
                  on that.      

529
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,168
This is a little sauce          
 you make yourself?             
                       Oh, yeah.

530
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,037
            Now we're gonna put 
      this Swiss cheese on here.

531
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,139
               We're gonna put  
             the onion rings on.

532
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,046
And that's the Big "D."         

533
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,514
             That's the Big "D."

534
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,585
  That's the crown              
  of the brisket.               

535
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:48,853
When you've cooked it           
   down perfectly,              

536
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:49,987
  and it just gets              
    to the point                

537
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:52,323
  where all the fat             
 is just cooked out,            

538
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,525
it's basted all that meat.      

539
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:58,529
This is a nice balance          
     between...                 

540
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,198
        meat,                   

541
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,867
really nice toasted rye,        
a little onion ring in there.   

542
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,002
Nicely done, my friend.         
     Great job.                 

543
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,270
                   Thanks.      
               Big "D" pickup.  

544
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,005
        Big "D" special.        

545
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,207
       The brisket is just      
       melt-in-your-mouth.      
       It's so juicy.           

546
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,809
    The best brisket sandwich   
         in Kansas City.        

547
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:14,212
         I like Danny's.        
   It's pretty much the best.   

548
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,013
        It's number one.        

549
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,682
I got Motley-Que sitting        
at the table, salivating.       

550
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,351
     Time to see                
  what they think.              

551
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:23,553
     That is blowing my mind    
           right now.           

552
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,423
        I'm gonna use it        
         like a pillow.
