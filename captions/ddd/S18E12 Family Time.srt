1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:03,201
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:06,005
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

3
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:07,072
          This trip...          

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,407
     It's bomb?                 
                     It's bomb. 

5
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:11,810
  ...we're settling in for some 
    full-blown family time...   

6
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:13,679
              This is gourmet   
              right here, man.  

7
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:16,014
        ...a double dose        
   in Nashville, Tennessee...   

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:16,948
         This girl been cooking.

9
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,617
 ...where a food-truck couple...

10
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:19,751
       We got                   
some Tennessee cheddar.         

11
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:20,953
               It's a monster.  

12
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:24,022
       ...is flipping out       
on the grilled-cheese concept...

13
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,758
I'm gonna go into, like,        
a little dream sequence.        

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,826
       ...and a down-home       
        Italian joint...        

15
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:28,960
    Rustic, baby.               

16
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,829
   ...is dishing out the goods  
           on grandma.          

17
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,564
    Look at that.               

18
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,232
      Then, in Kansas City,     
           Missouri...          

19
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,368
                 It's spicy.    

20
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,036
  ...the family noodle shop...  

21
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,971
Who's a better cook --          
 you or your sister?            

22
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,707
           Of course my sister. 
         She's right over there.

23
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,711
   ...laying out the wizardry   
        of the won tons.        

24
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,047
For scientific purposes,        
I'm gonna have eight more.      

25
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:50,382
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

26
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,983
         on "Triple D."         

29
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:07,933
   So I'm here in Nashville,    
   Tennessee. Got to love it.   

30
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,068
     I mean killer barbecue,    
          great music,          

31
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,204
       and you never know       
      who you'll run into.      

32
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:13,939
      So anyhow, I'm here       
      to check out a joint      

33
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:15,140
  that's doing grilled cheese,  

34
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:16,875
       but grilled cheese       
      to a different level.     

35
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,477
          It's not just         
     <i> what</i> they're serving,     

36
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,078
            it's what           
    they're serving it<i> from.</i>    

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,349
    Get this -- a food truck.   
             This...            

38
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,617
        Was that...? Nah.       

39
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,153
         Anyhow, this is        
     The Grilled Cheeserie.     

40
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,990
JOSEPH: Pimento mac and cheese  
   melt, no bacon.              

41
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:37,496
 This truck is one of the best  
 food trucks here in Nashville. 

42
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:39,565
B&B and tots.                   
             FIERI:             
      And the word is out.      

43
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:43,101
 It's almost impossible to find 
    them without a long line.   

44
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,037
              We have two macs  
                on the grill.   

45
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:48,107
  It's not trying to be fancy.  
It's just good and what's right.

46
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,241
               Short rib melt.  

47
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:50,709
      FIERI: Translation --     

48
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,512
    gangster grilled cheeses    
       and standout soups.      

49
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:56,248
       A simple menu that       
   chef Crystal De Luna-Bogan   

50
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,651
    and her musician husband,   
      Joseph, have stuck to     

51
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:02,387
   since they opened the truck  
            in 2010.            

52
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,923
   The sandwich is like heaven  
         in your mouth.         

53
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,091
I heard from other folks in line
      this is your anniversary. 

54
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,261
  MAN: Yeah, it is.             
        I like the way you roll.

55
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,929
This place does it right.       

56
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,864
        Great ingredients       
        from local farms.       

57
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,399
 So it's gourmet grilled cheese,

58
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,534
         but it's still,        
      like, a comfort food.     

59
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,471
 FIERI: With awesome combos like
   short ribs and pepper Jack,  

60
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,607
       cheddar with bacon,      
   and this funky top seller.   

61
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,076
Two pimento mac and cheese.     

62
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:27,613
  Partnered up with their take  
  on the classic tomato soup.   

63
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:31,183
 It's nice and cheesy and gooey 
       and hot and spicy.       

64
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:33,818
       We got                   
some Tennessee cheddar.         

65
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,420
               It's a monster.  

66
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,354
It's a 40-pound block.          

67
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,489
We're gonna cut this up,        

68
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,891
shred it up for the pimento     
mac and cheese base.            

69
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,092
               So you're gonna  
               cut the cheese?  

70
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:44,295
I'm gonna cut this cheese       
  with this knife.              

71
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,765
          So no processed cheese
                in this crew.   

72
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:48,967
      No, sir.                  

73
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,068
               Mm. Delicious.   
                    Okay.       

74
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,508
             So cheese is done. 

75
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,442
I'm gonna make some mayo.       

76
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:01,779
    Eggs, garlic,               
  our spice mix --              

77
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,183
paprika, cayenne pepper,        
     and then...                

78
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,250
                 Hot sauce?     

79
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,252
...hot sauce in the mayo.       

80
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,321
             It's a slow stream.
Slow stream.                    

81
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,390
  And then the oil.             

82
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,792
So this kind of replaces        
the whole roux situation.       

83
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:14,860
                 I got you.     

84
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,128
This actually makes it          
  a lot more gooey.             

85
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,264
And we love our mayo here       
    in the South.               

86
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,066
     All right.                 
Now we just assemble.           

87
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,136
 So we got our mac.             
We already cooked it            

88
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:26,405
into some salted boiling water, 
    a little oil.               

89
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:27,805
We got our mayo made.           

90
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,141
   Whoa, this girl -- think she 
   was pretty, little bartender.

91
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,010
         This girl been cooking.
[ Chuckles ]                    

92
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,945
      And then                  
here comes the good stuff.      

93
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,680
Got our cheese.                 
                 I'm digging it.

94
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,149
You just want a little bit of   
noodle just for some texture,   

95
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,751
   but it's mostly              
  about the cheese.             

96
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,152
                 Righteous.     

97
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,622
And then we're just gonna add   
our roasted peppers.            

98
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:46,158
So that's basically it.         

99
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,159
            All right. Let's go.

100
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:48,960
              We're gonna make  
          the famous tomato soup

101
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,229
               that goes along  

102
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,297
 with the pimento mac and cheese
               grilled cheese.  

103
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,499
        Yes.                    
     Little oil.                

104
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,768
     Gonna start                
charring these onions.          
                           Okay.

105
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,237
    Fennel seeds,               
chili flake, garlic.            

106
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,106
We're just gonna sweat this out,
   get some color.              

107
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,841
San Marzano tomatoes.           

108
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,576
    So just roasted San Marzano,
     a little bit of olive oil. 

109
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,713
A little bit of olive oil       
and some roasted red peppers.   

110
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:09,781
And we're actually gonna add    
a little bit of veggie stock    

111
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:10,982
'cause this soup is vegan.      

112
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,485
We're just gonna blend it       
with our stick blender.         

113
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,723
               Fire in the hole.
 Fire in the hole.              

114
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:21,860
                       Okay.    
      Leave it                  
a little bit chunky.            

115
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,395
              'Cause it's funky 
              when it's chunky. 

116
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:24,596
    [ Chuckles ]                
        Okay.                   

117
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,532
We're gonna put a little bit    
 of turbinado sugar.            

118
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:30,669
And then we're gonna add        
  the baking soda,              

119
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,405
which helps alkaline            
    the tomatoes.               

120
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,873
  And it brings out             
  all the flavors.              

121
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,074
It's like night and day.        

122
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,342
    So how long are we gonna let
                this simmer?    

123
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,943
Just for 20 minutes,            
and then it's good.             

124
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,278
                This is done,   
         sits there and simmers.

125
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,347
       Now we make the sandwich,
           put it all together. 

126
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,682
      Yes, sir.                 
                       Okay.    

127
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:44,750
               Assembly time.   

128
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,417
           So we're gonna butter
                 the bread.     

129
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,019
             This is our special
                 butter mix.    

130
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,221
 Which is?                      
                Butter and mayo.

131
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,556
     I like it.                 

132
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,358
         Pimento mac and cheese,

133
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,226
           some of our beautiful
               local tomatoes,  

134
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,895
                 bacon bits,    
       and then we finish it off

135
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:59,497
          with the same cheddar 
         that we've just sliced.

136
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,899
Then we go to the grill.        
                           Yeah.

137
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,367
       Get it.                  

138
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,435
           And we press it down.

139
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:05,103
            How long's that take
                  to melt?      

140
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,239
About two and a half minutes    
    on each side.               

141
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,040
   It's all melty.              

142
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,843
  Cut them halfway.             

143
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,111
        We present it open-faced

144
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,180
               so you can see   
              all the goodness. 
     Okay.                      

145
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,115
    And we serve it up with some
     of our house-made pickles. 

146
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,584
So the roasted red pepper       
  and tomato soup.              

147
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:20,985
        Little basil oil on top.

148
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,788
                 Pimento mac    
              and cheese melt.  

149
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:31,129
   Rustic, sweet,               
a little bit of spice.          

150
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,997
That basil oil's the bomb.      

151
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,399
I got to try this sandwich      
     by itself.                 

152
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,602
              What'd you think  
                 about that?    

153
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,804
   You know what?               
I'll tell you something --      

154
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,407
if you're left with just        
mac pimento by itself...        

155
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,008
                   Mm-hmm.      

156
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,010
   ...it's really               
 not enough texture.            

157
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,679
                         Yeah.  
Texture was the word.           

158
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,815
But you put the pasta           
in there and the tomato --      

159
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:52,083
a little bit of spice coming out
  of that, as well.             

160
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,886
This is where it goes on.       

161
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:57,422
       Uh-huh.                  
                    Yeah.       

162
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,224
           That's how you do it.
This is so good.                

163
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,361
I'm gonna go into, like,        
a little dream sequence.        

164
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:03,695
I am telling you what --        

165
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,831
this just takes me back         
    to childhood.               

166
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,499
          It's a labor of love, 
    so we better produce, right?

167
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,968
    They call it                
"The Grilled Cheeserie."        

168
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,302
                [ Chuckles ]    

169
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,839
               We're the place  
 where grilled cheeses are made.

170
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,573
   We're the place              
    where dreams                

171
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,175
about grilled cheeses           
   are fulfilled.               

172

                [ Chuckles ]    

173
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,714
   I got a pimento mac going out
               with the soup.   

174
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,583
     You can never go wrong     
     with that combination.     

175
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,986
So you've only been in Nashville
    for a month?                

176
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,522
   And I've already eaten here  
an embarrassing amount of times.

177
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:31,722
Seriously?                      
              Yeah.             

178
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,659
  FIERI: Here, everybody's got  
        to wait in line.        

179
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:37,329
   This joint's even catering   
    to country star royalty.    

180
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:39,864
I come to Nashville,            

181
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,401
I expect to see, you know,      
  some superstars,              

182
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:45,804
  but Trace Adkins              
at a grilled cheeserie.         

183
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,138
              This is gourmet   
              right here, man.  

184
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,740
      House-made pimento cheese,
      local cheddar, macaroni --

185
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,942
           that's this sandwich.

186
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,878
  He reads the menu             
   of a food truck              

187
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,013
and makes it sound like         
   a country song.              

188
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,482
     This is a food-truck mecca.

189
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:58,483
    This does it.               
                    This is it. 

190
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,084
Trace, good luck on tour,       
      brother.                  

191
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,686
               Thank you, Guy.  
               Appreciate it.   

192
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,422
              Wow.              
    Nashville -- what a town.   

193
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,292
 I mean, Trace -- I should have 
 given him a ride or something. 

194
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,894
        [ Tires squeal ]        

195
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,095
           Not again.           

196
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:14,833
          Coming up...          
Hit it, Danny.                  

197
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,367
 ...we're staying in Nashville, 

198
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,037
     but headed to the house    
       that grandma built.      

199
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,105
              When I asked her  
   what she put in it, she said,

200
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,207
          "A little bit of this,
          little bit of that,   
          a little bit of this."

201
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:31,082
   So I'm about two miles west  
      of downtown Nashville     

202
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,484
   on Murphy Road to check out  
      a joint where a chef,     

203
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,554
       who's a transplant       
      from New York City --     

204
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:36,554
    he's had a couple places.   

205
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,756
You've probably heard of them --

206
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:39,691
        The Dancing Bear,       
        The Red Rooster,        

207
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,561
   and for the last 15 years,   
  he's been rocking this place. 

208
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:43,962
      This is Caffé Nonna.      

209
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,434
             Pickup, table five.

210
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,236
       I start craving it       
       through the week.        

211
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:53,838
         It's like I'm in Italy.
Really?                         

212
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,374

      meatball arrabiata...     

213
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:57,709
The balance of the flavors      
 is just wonderful.             

214
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,578
  ...or the seafood angelina... 

215
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,846
The best Italian dish           
   I've ever had.               

216
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,648
   The home-style preparation   
           feels like           

217
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,250
         you're sitting         
       at grandma's house.      

218
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:08,920
   FIERI: So it's fitting chef  
Danny Maggipinto named the joint

219
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:11,122
 for the woman who first got him
          into cooking.         

220
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,592
  My interest came from watching
           my grandmother cook. 

221
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,128
        But, you know, she never
              had any recipes,  

222
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,663
              so I used to try  
                to watch her.   

223
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,932
           And when I asked her 
   what she put in it, she said,

224
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,567
          "A little bit of this,
          little bit of that,   
          a little bit of this."

225
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:28,006
       So while studying        
       at culinary school       

226
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,340
  helped him learn the science, 

227
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,010
    his nonna's at the heart    
        of every dish...        

228
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,478
          like his take         
     on her Italian classic.    

229
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,613
     We've got the lasagna.     

230
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,016
             FIERI:             
    Piled eight layers high.    

231
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,684
   Hit it, Danny.               

232
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,753
           We've got the filling
              for the lasagna.  

233
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:44,755
    So what we have here is some
     whole-milk ricotta cheese. 

234
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,223
  Okay.                         
            Add the cream to it.

235
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:52,163
         Shallots, garlic, sage,
               dried oregano,   

236
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,366
                dried basil,    
             crushed red pepper.

237
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,501
              Salt and pepper.  
              Then we whip it.  

238
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,638
                Whip it good.   
      See?                      

239
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,241
             All right, so what 
            we're gonna do first

240
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,476
             when we layer this 
                all together,   

241
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,980
             we're going to add 
            some marinara sauce.

242
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,249
         Next -- lasagna sheets.

243
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,516
A nice, fresh lasagna.          

244
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:15,854
           And then we add some 
         of the ricotta mixture.

245
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,322
              Add some spinach. 

246
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:18,789
         Put another layer down.

247
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,526
And we put the -- in the middle,
     goes the butternut squash. 

248
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:22,661
    Rustic, baby                

249
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,729
     Some more layers of lasagna
                 going down.    

250
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:28,266
    Then again, we put some more
           of the ricotta down. 

251
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,335
That's a lot of ricotta.        
               A lot of ricotta.

252
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,871
           Then we put some more
               of the spinach.  

253
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,139
What, the entire garden?        
     Very nice.                 

254
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:35,607
                    Yeah.       
               Another layer.   

255
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,542
Okay.                           
      All right, we put that on.

256
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:41,012
    And then, to finish it off, 
  we top it with marinara sauce.

257
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,281
Awesome. I mean, I've made      
  a lot of lasagna.             

258
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,216
 I've never seen it             
 look this rustic.              

259
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,384
            We feel really good.

260
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,887
                 Hit it with    
      some parmesan cheese here.

261
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,288
 We got some shredded mozzarella
                 right here.    

262
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,889
   Okay. This goes              
in the oven how long?           

263
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,892
  400 degrees for about an hour,
              hour and a half.  

264
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,026
      Covered.                  
                        Covered.

265
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,498
      So here's                 
our cooked-off lasagna.         

266
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,033
      Now it's ready to portion.

267
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,636
    Look at that.               

268
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,571
       Now we put it in the pan.

269
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,106
        Hit it with a little bit
             of marinara sauce. 

270
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,441
        Okay.                   

271
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,510
    Hit it with some reggianito 
    parmigiano, some mozzarella,

272
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:15,180
  and then we put it in the oven
               for 10 minutes.  

273
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:19,917
           All right, so this is
           the finished product.

274
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,919
             And what we do is  
             we put down the -- 

275
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,923
   the mornay sauce has a little
         bit of parmesan in it. 

276
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,992
Take a little bit of Swiss chard
           that's been steamed. 

277
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,527
       Then we take the lasagna.

278
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,196
    There we go.                

279
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,665
    Little bit of marinara sauce
                 like that.     

280
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:34,799
        Wow.                    

281
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,734
                 Hit it with    
           some parmesan cheese,

282
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,803
                a little bit    
               of fresh basil.  

283
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:42,006
         And then these are some
         fried julienne carrots,

284
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,676
             julienne zucchini, 
            and julienne squash.

285
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,010
Nothing wrong with that.        

286
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,278
And that's all she wrote.       
       And that's all she wrote.

287
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,479
           That's lasagna nonna.

288
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,281
     And this is                
 the kind of lasagna            

289
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:53,218
that your grandmother would     
make when you were a kid?       

290
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,485
     This is sort of my version.

291
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,287
               I wanted to put  
            a little spin on it.

292
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,023
You know what I like, is look   
at the amount of spinach        

293
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,292
    this guy puts               
   on his lasagna.              

294
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,030
Nice, big, thick noodles        
      in there.                 

295
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:07,032
You definitely don't hold back  
   on the cheese.               

296
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,400
Three different sauces          
      in there.                 

297
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,702
I mean, you put a lot of time   
  and work into it.             

298
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:12,837
                       Yes, sir.
It tastes like it.              

299
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,038
   Nice job, chef.              
                      Thank you.

300
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,972
    Really nice.                

301
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,041
             WOMAN:             
     We've got the lasagna.     

302
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,377
         It's delicious.        
                Extremely tasty.

303
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,312
           FIERI: What was that?
It was the lasagna.             

304
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,181
There's really not much left    
     of it now.                 
                      No.       

305
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,251
    MAN: They put themselves    
    into what they're doing.    

306
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,119
  And it comes out in the food. 

307
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,520
   FIERI: And for chef Danny,   

308
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,390
    it's more than just about   
   making his customers happy.  

309
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,994
 He's also cooking in the memory
      of his daughter Zoe.      

310
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,529
                 MAGGIPINTO:    
          After she passed away,

311
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,863
               I wanted to try  
              to figure out how 

312
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,131
       how I could I raise money

313
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,133
       'cause it was a rare form
              of brain cancer.  

314
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:46,204
   So he started the Zoe Marie  
   Brain Tumor Research Fund,   

315
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,539
      raising money for it      

316
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,407
 by selling his nonna's marinara
         to the public.         

317
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,810
FIERI: If people want to help   
out, is there a website?        

318
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,279
              Well, they can go 
                to cmft.org.    

319
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,748
And if they want to get         
 your tomato sauce,             

320
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,549
 they can go online             
   at your place.               

321
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,685
             They can go online 
       to Nonna's Gourmet Foods,

322
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,354
           and they can order it
               through there.   

323
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:11,362
 WOMAN: He just creates amazing 
  food that is fresh and real.  

324
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,697
     So that's what we love.    

325
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,700
I see why you're doing so well  
and why Nashville loves you.    

326
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:18,703
You got to check this guy out   
and buy that marinara sauce.

    to Kansas City, Missouri,   

329
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,113
     for some sweet songs...

    Winner, winner, chili pepper

                    Yeah!       

334
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,899
   So I'm here in Kansas City,  
            Missouri.           

335
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,101
  Now, I can almost promise you 

336
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,903
        I've been in this       
      neighborhood before.      

337
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,571
 Bookstore looks super familiar.

338
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,306
 And if I'm right -- take a look
     at this, right there --    

339
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:56,708
  that was Bell Street Mama --  

340
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,576
      a joint that we shot      
        in season three,        

341
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,377
       and then they moved      
      to a larger location.     

342
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,513
   I mean, to think, the place  
   I'm about to visit was here  

343
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,848
   at the same time I shot it.  

344
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,450
   I could have double-dipped.  
     I could have shot both.    

345
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,719
              Ugh.              
I'm not gonna miss it this time.

346
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,053
        This is Blue Koi.       

347
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:18,396
      It is traditional Chinese,
      but it's a bit of twist...

348
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,664
    Firebird chicken's ready!   

349
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:20,999
                    MAN:        
      It's not Kung Pao chicken.

350
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,935
                  It's not      
          General Tso's chicken.

351
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:25,203
        It's just a whole       
         different game,        

352
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:26,337
  whole different kind of food. 

353
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,872
            How you doing there,
                    Jane?       

354
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:31,142
   FIERI: ...'cause the Chang   
     siblings are serving up    

355
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,679
  Chinese-family recipes mixed  
   with big-time personality.   

356
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:35,880
      Chicken lettuce wrap!     

357
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,615
   Got it! Got it!              

358
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:41,218
        For brother Scott       
 working the front of the house 

359
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,554
    to sisters Jane and Mindy   
      cooking in the back.      

360
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,690
Two order chili pepper          
   won tons here!               

361
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:46,991
                Okay, got it!   

362
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,827
Who's a better cook --          
 you or your sister?            

363
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,896
           Of course my sister. 
         She's right over there.

364
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,299
 We'll stick with Mindy for now 

365
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,835
   'cause she's cooking up one  
    of my all-time favorites.   

366
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,636
      Chili pepper won ton!     

367
00:13:58,638 --> 00:13:59,971
                  It's fabulous.
It's the perfect meal.          

368
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:02,973
                It's awesome.   
                 It's bomb.     

369
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,575
 It's bomb?                     
                 It's bomb. Yes.

370
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:08,446
          We need the soy sauce,
                  vinegar.      

371
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,447
Is it rice wine vinegar         
or is it regular vinegar?       

372
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:11,983
        This is regular vinegar.
Okay.                           

373
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:15,853
              Yeah. Sesame oil, 
            white pepper, sugar.

374
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,188
       Garlic?                  
                    Garlic. Yes.

375
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,522
      Cilantro.                 
                       Cilantro.

376
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,192
                 Lots of it.    
     They say you like cilantro.

377
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,861
       We chopped extra for you.
                Green onion.    

378
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,097
        And a home-made hot oil.

379
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,600
            And we'll just stir.

380
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,601
And that's all she wrote.       
                         Mm-hmm.

381
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:31,535
     Fantastic.                 
                      Yes.      

382
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,937
    [ Whistles ]                

383
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:35,740
         Next, we're gonna make 
   chili pepper won ton filling.

384
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:36,807
        Okay.                   
                     Okay.      

385
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,009
    Ground pork.                

386
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:40,611
    Ground pork, ground chicken,
            and chopped shrimp. 

387
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,612
     I like it.                 

388
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,082
      A little bit of soy sauce.

389
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:49,286
          Rice wine, sesame oil,
               white pepper...  

390
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,622
                green onion.    

391
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,491
     Okay, and we'll just mix it
                really well.    

392
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:54,959
        Okay.                   
                          Yeah. 

393
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:58,162
 And then we're gonna let it sit
             for 10, 20 minutes 

394
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,897
             just to let it all 
             marinate together. 

395
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,366
Marinate a little bit.          
        Okay.                   

396
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:03,401
Next?                           
              We're gonna make  
       the chili pepper won ton.

397
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:06,971
    There we go.                

398
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,706
     And we'll just kind of seal
               the two sides.   

399
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,508
   Seal the deal.               
       Got it.                  

400
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,243
          And so then that way, 
        the meat won't fall out.

401
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,644
        Yeah.                   

402
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,447
 Okay, and then put a little bit
              on the side here. 

403
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,182
There we go.                    
               And just fold it.

404
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:19,316
     And -- ooh.                
                    All right.  

405
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,919
     That's when                
 the magic happens.             

406
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,053
           And that one's yours.

407
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,654
How many come -- wait,          
 what are you doing?            

408
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,790
You know how many I make        
  of these at home.             

409
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,525
         I just want to see it, 
     you know, with my own eyes.

410
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,028
 You want to see it             
 with your own eyes?            
                       Yeah.    

411
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,264
 I don't think mine             
    looks right.                

412
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,533
   Is that right?               
                         Yep.   

413
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,401
Okay, so now we're gonna        
   pan-fry these?               
                      Yep.      

414
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,537
And I like it crispy.           

415
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,873
      All right, then we'll just
         make it extra for you. 

416
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,410
We ready to go?                 
                    Yep. Mm-hmm.

417
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,680
Okay.                           
        Nice and crispy for you.

418
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,348
                There you go.   

419
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,320
        And we're gonna put this
        awesome sauce in there. 

420
00:15:58,425 --> 00:15:59,357
                There you go.   

421
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,365
Mm. I love the vinegar smell    
      in that.                  

422
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,537
Little sweet, little heat.      

423
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:15,907
 These are awesome.             

424
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:18,843
         Mm.                    

425
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,778
 This dipping sauce             
   is ridiculous.               

426
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,449
Now, as everybody at home knows,
I'm a huge Chinese-food fan.    

427
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:29,654
So just for scientific purposes,
I'm gonna have eight more.      

428
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,658
    Awesome job.                
                        Yes.    

429
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,260
    Winner, winner, chili pepper
             won ton for dinner 

430
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,196
                at Blue Koi!    
                    Yeah!       

431
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:41,999
       They're incredible.      

432
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,334
       Quite a nice kick.       

433
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,469
FIERI: So what do you think     
makes the food so great?        

434
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,872
              Love.             

435
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,607
         Love for sure.         

436
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,008
   MAN: They've really become,  

437
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,211
  like, the family that I have  
          in the city.          

438
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,478
  There's no "hello, goodbye."  

439
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,147
         It's just like         
      I never really left.      

440
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,615
     All right,                 
so here's the deal --           

441
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,484
we're hanging out at Blue Koi   
in Kansas City, Missouri,       

442
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,752
making -- you got it --         
    Chinese food.               

443
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,087
So we have two sisters.         

444
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,621
  We're gonna cook              
 with the next one.             

445
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,257
    We'll see you               
  in a little bit.              

446
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,202
          Welcome back.         

447
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,671
     "Triple D" hanging out     
   in Kansas City at Blue Koi.  

448
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:24,542
  Now this is Jane,             
and I cooked with Mindy.        

449
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,943
   But now Jane's               
   Mindy's sister,              

450
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,478
   and they share               
 the same birthday,             

451
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,613
 but different year.            
Did I get that right?           

452
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,015
                 That's correct.
I'm so confused.

      So, Jane,                 
what are we gonna make?         

454
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,352
       Okay, we're going to make

455
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,120
            the firebird chicken
                 on noodles.    

456
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,290
    Firebird chicken's ready!   

457
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:44,162
   The firebird chicken is my

   WOMAN: You get a little bit  
   spicy. You get some sweet.

00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:49,000
    It's stuff you can't get    
other places in town. I love it.

460
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,436
  Firebird chicken.             
                      Right.    

461
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,971
             We need to marinate
             the chicken first. 

462
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:54,906
Marinate the chicken?           
                          Yes.  

463
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,308
       Got it.                  
Sliced chicken breasts.         

464
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,311
        And then we need to add 
   a little bit of water into it

465
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,313
              because you need  
              to massage them.  

466
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,448
You massage the chicken.        

467
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,449
          Until all the water go
               in the chicken.  

468
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,052
               And then we add  
         some cornstarch into it

469
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:11,222
               so the moisture  
           will be held into it.

470
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,325
      Massage, massage, massage,
                  you know?     

471
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,794
Is that a massage song          
   you're singing?              

472
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:19,029
                 Yeah. Yeah.    
               To the chicken.  

473
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,532
             And they are happy,
             so my customers -- 

474
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,801
  they are very happy, you know?
            That's how we cook. 

475
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,070

   as your sister.

477
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,074
           And then a little bit
            of ginger onion oil 

478
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,008
              we make in-house. 

479
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,144
             And then that way, 
               when you cook,   

480
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:35,213
      they don't stick together.
Got it.                         

481
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,950
  You got to brown              
     both sides?                

482
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,486
            Brown it both sides.

483
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:42,819
      And then I put the noodles
                in the water.   

484
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,821
 That you make here             
      in-house?

486
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,892
     So we'll add some seasoning
                  in there.     

487
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:50,761
             We put the garlic  
             and the rice wine. 

488
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,563

 "Here comes fire."             

490
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:57,301
           Now we add the sugar,
                 soy sauce,     

491
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,238
         Chinese barbecue sauce,
              nice red pepper.  

492
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,305

          and the green onions.

           we're ready to plate.

498
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:19,991
   So we'll put a little bit of 
 our house-made ginger onion oil

499
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,726
   and a little bit of soy sauce
