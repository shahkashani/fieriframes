Take another quart 'cause you
want some more juice in there

it gives off that steam

520
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:20,680
You still get cauliflower.

521
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,180
The acid in the sauce
countering the fry

522
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,646
and the sweet with
the fat of the mayo

523
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:27,513
and the punch
of the sriracha

524
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,380
is all just done

525
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,213
in this little micro‐balance
just the right way.

526
00:17:32,313 --> 00:17:33,780
That's one of the most
simplistic recipes

527
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,313
I've ever seen on "Triple D,"
and it's dynamite.

528
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:37,346
Awesome job.

529
00:17:37,446 --> 00:17:39,480
And the Bangin' Cauliflower.
Enjoy.

530
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,913
It has a great kick,
but it's refreshing and cool.

531
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:44,613
I know that when
I bring my kids here,

532
00:17:44,713 --> 00:17:45,880
they will eat
their vegetables.

533
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,946
Every time you come,
you got to get them.

00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:48,613
Steak Frites, coming over!

535
00:17:48,713 --> 00:17:51,380
The Roost was exactly
what Longmont needed.

536
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Cool bar. The rooftop patio ‐‐
it brings so much to

537
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,880
the community and downtown.

538
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,720
All their food is local ‐‐
local beef, local pork.

The pork burger
is phenomenal.

It is so delicious. I have
tasted nothing like it before.

542
00:18:05,553 --> 00:18:07,053
Just an awesome dish.

543
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,153
Alright, chef.

544
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,786
We are making the Perfect
Pork Burger patties.

545
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:14,620
First, you got to sauté
the aromatics in sesame oil.

546
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,520
Okay.

547
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,053
Fresh garlic,
fresh‐ground ginger.

548
00:18:17,153 --> 00:18:18,186
You don't want to
over‐caramelize

549
00:18:18,286 --> 00:18:19,420
'cause those are
delicate ingredients.

550
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,953
I gotcha.
Chili sambal.

551
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:23,453
Deglaze with soy sauce.
Let it cool down a little bit.

552
00:18:23,553 --> 00:18:24,320
Okay.

553
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,420
So, this is my buddy
Clint's pork

554
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,986
he raises right here
in Longmont.

555
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:28,453
What's Clint's ranch called?

556
00:18:28,553 --> 00:18:29,586
Buckner Family Farms.

557
00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:31,720
He's raising the pork,
has it butchered,

558
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,186
has it ground, and you get it?

559
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:34,253
That's right.
Love it.

560
00:18:34,353 --> 00:18:36,720
You add in the
aromatics, scallion,

561
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,153
cilantro,

562
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:39,586
fresh basil, kosher salt...

563
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,353
And fresh‐ground
black pepper.

564
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,620
...fresh‐ground
black pepper.

565
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,653
Like that.
Like that.

566
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:45,253
And you just make
a perfect patty.

567
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:47,420
How are we gonna prepare
this Perfect Pork patty?

568
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,086
We're gonna push
the Perfect Pork patty

569
00:18:49,186 --> 00:18:50,520
into the perfect ring mold.

570
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,786
Now we take it over to
the planch and make it perfect.

[ Laughter ]

572
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,320
Now we make kimchi.

573
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,520
Napa cab.

574
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,926
I love Napa cabbage because
the texture is perfect.

575
00:19:00,026 --> 00:19:01,493
So, we take that,
start salting?

576
00:19:01,593 --> 00:19:02,860
Sure.

577
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,160
Draw out all that extra
moisture, and then some water.

578
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,326
Mix it up, cover with plastic,
room temp, at least 12 hours.

579
00:19:08,426 --> 00:19:09,493
Here's the Napa cabbage.

580
00:19:09,593 --> 00:19:11,326
We've strained off
the excess water.

581
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:14,793
Fish sauce, sambal,
green parts of scallion,

582
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:15,460
fresh ginger...

583
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,460
Holy moly!

584
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,226
...fresh garlic,
a little sugar.

585
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:20,326
Three weeks in the walk‐in?
That's right.

586
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:23,126
And that's the mount
for this perfect pork patty.
Yeah.

587
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:25,193
So, these buns are from the
bread ladies across the street.

588
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:26,793
Got it.
The Bangin' sauce.

589
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:28,793
Oh, really? Bangin' sauce
makes another appearance?

Some of our kimchi

Perfect Pork patty.

Lot of pressure when
you call it "perfect."

Blistered shishitos just tossed
in a little salt and lime.

My buddy Mark also grows
these here in Longmont.

the shishito move.

I don't use
the word "perfect."

600

It's just too much
of an ultimate term.

601
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:52,093
It's like "always"
and "never."

602
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:53,493
The way I would describe this

603
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,760
is there is nothing
I would do different to that.

604
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,660
The little touch
of the shishito, the acid,

605
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,933
the tang, the funk
of the kimchi,

606
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,633
you allow the pork
to have some flavor.

607
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:04,433
You didn't put too much
into it.

608

The patty itself
is really juicy.

Bangin' sauce should be
available by the gallon,

typically put an egg on it.

keeping it ‐‐ but this

Using that "P" word
