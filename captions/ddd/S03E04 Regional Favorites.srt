00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,292
         A LITTLE BIT OF CARROTS
               AND CELERY.      

402
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,294
      LET'S GET ABOUT A SPOONFUL
            OF FETA CHEESE.     

403
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,564
    DON'T SEE FETA OFTEN        
IN SOUTHWESTERN FOOD, DO YOU?   

404
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,032
                    NOT REALLY. 

405
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,702
          THIS IS MORE OF A DISH
             FROM THE YUCATAN.  

406
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:39,237
            ADD OUR TWO EGGS... 

407
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,439
  SOME OF THAT WONDERFUL GREEN  
CHILI SAUCE WE PREPARED EARLIER.

408
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:43,374
               YOU ADD ONE SLICE
               OF SWISS CHEESE, 

409
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,177
     PUT THIS IN THE SALAMANDER.
     PUT THIS UP IN             
THE CHEESE MELTER? OKAY.        

410
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,779
      WE ADD OUR FRIED BANANAS. 

411
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,981
       TOP IT OFF WITH SOME     
   FRESHLY DICED PICO de GALLO. 

412
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,116
AM I SUPPOSED TO GET A SLAB     
    OF BANANA ON THERE?         

413
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,585
           YOU SHOULD GET A BITE
              OF EVERYTHING.    

414
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,787
WOW.                            

415
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:59,123
AND THE GREEN CHILI SAUCE       
     IS OUTRAGEOUS.             

416
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,259
        THE BANANA--            
THE CREAMINESS AND SWEETNESS    

417
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:03,861
COUNTERACTING THE SPICE,        

418
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,863
  'CAUSE THAT GREEN CHILI SAUCE 
             IS HOT.            

419
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,665
           THE BANANAS          
     REALLY MAKE IT SPECIAL,    

420
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,001
     BECAUSE YOU GOTTA HAVE     
     THAT LITTLE SWEET BITE.    

421
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,669
            GREEN CHILI--       
    YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE SECRET.

422
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,271
 (Guy) IT'S KIND OF             
LIKE THE WHOLE THEME.           

423
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:14,739
<i>BUT THAT'S ONLY HALF THE STORY.</i> 

424
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:17,141
        I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY   
    THE OFFICIAL STATE QUESTION.

425
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,343
     HOW DO YOU WANT YOUR CHILI,
     RED OR GREEN OR CHRISTMAS? 

426
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,079
   IF YOU WANT TO COME ACROSS   
            AS SAVVY,           

427
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,614
    GET THE RED AND THE GREEN   
    AND JUST SAY "CHRISTMAS."   

428
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:26,017
I LOVE ALL KINDS OF CHILI,      
BUT RED CHILI, ESPECIALLY.      

429
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,086
RED CHILI SAUCE.                
                    RED CHILI...

430
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,887
                  IT'S ACTUALLY 
                THE SAME PEPPER.

431
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,690
   WHAT IT IS--YOU KEEP IT ON   
 THE VINE LONGER, IT TURNS RED. 

432
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,760
 SO WHAT WAS ONCE THE GREEN     
THAT WE USED TO MAKE THIS...    
                         MM-HMM.

433
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:37,161
IS NOW THIS.                    
                            YES.

434
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,163
DIG IT.                         
             IT'S ON A DIFFERENT
               FLAVOR PROFILE.  

435
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,731
    WELL, YEAH,                 
WHEN IT DRIES OUT.              

436
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,233
ALL THE TOPS                    
ARE TAKEN OFF                   

437
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,235
BECAUSE THE STEM                
ISN'T TOO TASTY.                
                        EXACTLY.

438
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,371
      WE TRY TO TAKE OUT AS MUCH
       OF THE SEEDS AS POSSIBLE.
OKAY.                           

439
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,973
RECONSTITUTE 'EM                
 IN WARM WATER?                 
            ABOUT 1/2 A TEASPOON
                 OF GARLIC.     

440
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,976
A LITTLE SALT?                  
                      THAT'S IT.

441
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,313
       (blender whirring)       

442
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,315
(imitating blender whining)     

443
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,117
THAT'S LIQUI-PEPPER.            

444
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,652
 WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS PUT THIS 
    ON THE STOVE AND SIMMER.    

445
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,720
AND THEN TIGHTEN IT UP          
 WITH A LITTLE ROUX?            
                   YES, EXACTLY.

446
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,790
AND THIS IS GONNA BE THE SAUCE  
THAT ALSO GOES ON THE ADOVADA.  

447
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,727
WHAT IS CARNE ADOVADA?          
                IT'S A RED CHILI
                   WITH PORK.   

448
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,196
THAT WAS--I MEAN, THOSE ARE     
 BOTH OF MY MIDDLE NAMES.       

449
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,198
          WHAT WE WANT TO DO    
       IS GET THE PORK STARTED. 

450
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,466
         LITTLE BIT OF WATER... 

451
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:17,734
  THIS IS A 3/4-INCH CUBED PORK.
        THIS IS A PORK LOIN     

452
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,736
                WITH A 1/2 CUP  
               OF CHILI PEQUIN, 

453
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,873
      WHICH IS A RED CHILI SEED.
THIS WOULD BE THE SEED          
  OUT OF THE PEPPER?            

454
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,474
                       YES, YES.
OKAY.                           

455
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,875
           CRACKED BLACK PEPPER,
              CHOPPED GARLIC,   

456
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:26,744
              MEXICAN OREGANO...
MEXICAN OREGANO.                

457
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,480
A LITTLE CHILI POWDER?          
                CHILI POWDER... 
              SOME SALT AS WELL.

458
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,682
 SOME SALT FROM THE WELL, OKAY. 
       LOOK AT THAT SAUCE.      

459
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,684
CAN YOU GET THAT                
 BOTTLED TO-GO?                 

460
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,153
         YOU ACTUALLY CAN.      
   WE DO QUARTS AND PINTS TO-GO.

461
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,555
I WAS THINKING ABOUT, LIKE,     
 GALLON AND TANKER TRUCK.       

462
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,225
         (whistles)             
THAT'S, LIKE, SUPERMAN SPICY.   

463
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,227
NOW HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?         

464
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,631
      ME? I LIKE IT JUST WITH   
   THE TORTILLA, JUST LIKE THAT.

465
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:50,635
NICE, REALLY ROUND HEAT...      

466
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:53,237
A LOT OF PEPPER FLAVOR.         
                         MM-HMM.

467
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:56,774
     AND THE PORK IS TENDER.    
IT'S ALL IN THE COOKING PROCESS.
          LOW AND SLOW.         

468
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,776
THAT IS REALLY WARM.            
   I MEAN, IT'S--               

469
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,778
   EVENTUALLY, IT DOES KICK IN. 
       IT EVENTUALLY DOES--     

470
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,647
      IT IS SERIOUSLY           
TOO LEGIT TO QUIT, THOUGH.      

471
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,183
THIS HAS GREAT HEAT,            

472
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,318
SO IT'S NOT TOO HOT,            
AT LEAST NOT FOR ME.            

473
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,587
