ADD SOME HALF-AND-HALF.         
                THAT WHOLE QUART

AND ADD A LITTLE NUTMEG.        

125

WHILE WE MIX UP THE MEAT.       

129
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:54,692
    THAT LOOKS LIKE GROUND BEEF,
            GROUND PORK.        
YEP, BASICALLY                  
HALF-AND-HALF.

            BUT FOR SOME REASON,

194
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,177
       BETWEEN THE STORY,       
 THE PEOPLE AND THE GREAT FOOD, 

195
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:29,581
         LA TEXANITA HAS BECOME 
          ONE OF OUR FAVORITES. 

196
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,250
CHILE RELLENO'S UP!             
     WE'RE IN WINE COUNTRY,     
          BUT THIS...           

197
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,986
                   THE HUARACHE.
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN MEXICO       
     WHEN I'M HERE.

   <i> AND THIS REALLY IS WHERE</i>    
<i>I BRING MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS.</i>  

200
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,727
                 HOW IS IT, MOM?
FANTASTIC.                      

201
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:45,664
                         POSOLE.
   EVERY TIME I BITE INTO IT,   
    IT REMINDS ME OF MEXICO.    

202
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,732
 <i> 'CAUSE OWNER ALMA MENDEZ...</i>

204
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:52,403
FIVE YEARS.                     
       WE BOTH GET OUR HAIR DONE
            BY THE SAME GUY.    

205
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,405
THE HUARACHE CARNITAS           
     IS COMING.                 

206
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:58,410
             WHERE DID YOU GET  
           ALL THE RECIPES FROM?
FROM MY MOM, MY SISTER.         

207
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:00,945
WE HAVE OUR OWN WAY             
 TO MAKE OUR FOOD.              

208
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,947
         <i> AND FOR ALMA,</i>         
    <i> IT'S STILL THE ONLY WAY.</i>

00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,817
(speaking Spanish)              
             YOU MAKE EVERYTHING
                FROM SCRATCH?   

210
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,485
EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH.        

211
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:10,955
     THE SOPES, THE CARNE ASADA,
     THE TORTILLAS, YOU NAME IT.
EVERYTHING.                     

212
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,557
    THE HANDMADE TORTILLAS--    
            SO GOOD.            

213
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,960
TORTILLAS UP.                   
        IT MAKES A GREAT        
          DIFFERENCE.           

214
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:17,962
   WE'RE GONNA MAKE REGULAR-SIZE
       TORTILLAS FOR TACOS.     

215
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,964
     THIS STARTS                
WITH ADDING THE MASA,           

216
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,100
AND THIS IS DRIED CORN?         
     YEAH. WE USE WATER IN HERE.

217
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,102
        THIS IS THE HARD PART-- 
        GETTING THE MASA READY. 

218
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,571
  SO WE WANT IT TO BE           
JUST A LITTLE BIT TACKY?        
                           YEAH.

219
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,840
PUT IT IN A NICE, FIRM BALL     
  SO IT DOESN'T DRY OUT.        

220
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,842
THAT'S ONE BIG TORTILLA.        
                            YEP.

221
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,979
NOW WHERE DID THIS              
    COME FROM?                  
               IT'S FROM MEXICO.

222
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,713
I'VE NEVER SEEN                 
   THIS ONE.                    

223
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,715
THIS IS LIKE THE TERMINATOR     
    OF TORTILLA MAKERS.         

224
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,719
  DID YOU KNOW THAT SOMEONE'S   
PROBABLY GONNA STEAL THIS TODAY?
                             NO.

225
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,721
YEAH. NOW YOU PATTY YOURS       
      A LITTLE BIT              

226
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,722
BEFORE YOU PUT IT DOWN?         
                YEAH, YOU HAVE  
              TO GO LIKE THIS...

227
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,792
THERE YOU GO.                   
   AND YOU GOTTA MAKE THAT NOISE
    WHEN YOU'RE DOING TORTILLAS.

228
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,862
OH, YOU DO?                     
          OH, YEAH. AND PRESS,  
       AND THIS IS THE TORTILLA.

229
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,998
                 SO NOW         
         WHAT ARE WE GONNA MAKE?

230
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,732
   WE'RE GONNA MAKE             
THE CARNE ASADA TACOS.          

231
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,601
          THE FAMOUS CARNE ASADA
              AT LA TEXANITA?   
YES.                            

232
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,402
               I'VE BEEN ASKING 
                FOR THIS RECIPE 

233
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:00,671
     SINCE I'VE BEEN COMING HERE
      FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS.  

234
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,273
    BETTER NOT BE SUPER SIMPLE, 

235
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,275
         BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN
         ABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT. 

236
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,677
IT'S REALLY SIMPLE.             
                             AH!

237
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:08,680
 WE HAVE SOME CHOPPED ONIONS.   
COOK A LITTLE BIT--ONIONS HERE. 

238
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,282
      LIKE YOU'RE AIR DRUMMING. 

239
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,884
    WHEN WE HEAR THIS NOISE,    
 THAT MEANS THAT WE'RE COOKING. 

240
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,486
   PUT THE MEAT ON IT,          
AND THEN WE ADD THE SALT.       

241
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,956
      WHEN YOU'RE CHOPPING,     
  YOU HAVE TO SHAKE YOUR BOOTY. 

242
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,691
                    THAT'S PART 
                  OF COOKING IT?
YEAH.                           

243
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,626
              I WANT THIS TO BE 
             A BIG WINDOW HERE. 

244
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,828
         I'M DONE NOT BEING ABLE
            TO SEE BACK HERE.   

245
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,764
                IT'S BEEN GOING 
               ABOUT 30 MINUTES.
WHEN IT'S ALMOST READY,         

246
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,234
WE ADD SOME LIME JUICE,         
    AND WE'RE DONE.             

247
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,169
           HERE'S THE TORTILLAS 
            THAT WE JUST MADE.  

248
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,372
            COOK 'EM UP UNTIL   
         THEY'RE NICE AND BROWN.
SO NOW WE'RE READY              
TO MAKE OUR TACO.               

249
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,308
     WE HAVE TO PUT SOME ONIONS,
      CILANTRO AND SOME SALSA.  

250
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:40,445
  AND YOU MAKE                  
THE SALSA, TOO.                 
              WE MAKE THE SALSA.

251
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,114
           WE ADD RADISHES, LIME
            AND SOME JALAPEñOS, 

252
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,116
       AND THEY'RE READY TO GO. 

253
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,652
LOOK AT THAT SETUP.             

254
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,454
OH, SO SIMPLE,

00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,189
BUT SO GOOD.                    

256
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,191
    ONIONS ALMOST HAVE          
THEIR OWN SWEETNESS TO 'EM,     

257
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,193
 AND THE NATURAL JUICES         
AND THE FAT FROM THE MEAT       

258
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,262
       COOKED EVERYTHING,

I HAD THE TACO TRUCK

     THE PORK'S STILL BOILING.  

303
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,959
NOW WE HAVE TO ADD

AND THEN WE GET THE FALAFEL.    

465
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:35,086
                     THE TAHINI.
    YES, YOU COULD SMASH

470
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,430

            AS IT IS, IS GREAT, 

471
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,365
   BUT YOU GOTTA PUT THE PICKLE 
       AND TOMATO IN THERE.     

472
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:50,935
THAT GIVES IT                   
MORE FLAVOR.                    
           THAT'S FALAFEL-ISTIC.

00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,059
      <i> WHEN WE COME BACK.</i>       
                OH, THAT'S GOOD.

483
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,330
       TWO FALAFELS,            
TWO TABBOULEH, READY TO GO.     

484
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:23,334
    <i> AT PRINCE LEBANESE GRILL</i>   
  <i> IN NORTH ARLINGTON, TEXAS...</i> 

485
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:25,202
                   HOW WE DOIN'?
       WE'RE GOIN' WELL.        

486
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,204
         <i> FRANCIS KOBTY,</i>        
       <i> A.K.A. "PRINCE"--</i>       

487
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,206
     ONE MORE SHISH TAOUK.      
        <i> IS WINNING OVER</i>        
          <i> THE LOCALS.</i>          

488
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,276
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?           
     THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE     
     THAT I ACTUALLY CRAVE.     

489
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,412
        I'VE BEEN HOOKED        
    ON THE CHICKEN SHAWARMA.    

490
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,214
          SHISH TAOUK.          
                 SOUNDS LIKE    
             A "STAR WARS" DISH.

491
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,216
                   GIVE ME      
            TWO OF THE WOOKIEES!
      IT'S JUST WONDERFUL.      

492
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:41,285
IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO TRY 
   A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS.   
        <i> LIKE THIS ONE.</i>         

493
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,621
           THYME PIE.           
            IT'S LIKE NOTHING   
         I'VE EVER EATEN BEFORE.

494
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,089
                         MMM.   

495
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,625
             WHAT ARE WE MAKING,
                   PRINCE?      
WE'RE MAKING THE THYME PIE.     

496
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:49,627
             LET ME GET STRAIGHT
               WHAT'S IN HERE.  

497
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:51,629
ZA'ATAR PLANT, SESAME SEEDS,    
    A LITTLE BIT OF SALT.       

498
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:53,631
        TASTES LIKE A LITTLE BIT
               OF OREGANO.      

499
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,766
IT'S SIMILAR TO OREGANO.        
    IT'S NOT OREGANO.           

500
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:58,235
WE CALL IT ZA'ATAR.             
              WHY DO YOU CALL IT
                  THYME PIE?    

501
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,238
      IT'S KIND OF HARD         
FOR PEOPLE TO SAY "ZA'ATAR,"    

502
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:02,440
SO WE AMERICANIZE IT            
    A LITTLE BIT.               

503
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:05,176
      SO YOU JUST GO TO A MIDDLE
     EASTERN STORE AND BUY THIS?
YEAH, I'LL CALL                 
 MY MOM AND--                   

504
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,045
   OH, YEAH, WELL, EVERYBODY'S  
GONNA GET YOUR MOM ON THE PHONE.

505
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:10,981
                           OKAY.
      PUT A LITTLE BIT OF       
THE TOMATOES, SOME DICED ONIONS,

506
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,983
PUT SOME OLIVE OIL              
     IN THERE.                  

507
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,986
       GOT A MIDDLE EASTERN     
   PESTO-LOOKING MIXTURE THERE. 

508
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,920
JUST MIX IT UP                  
  REAL GOOD.                    

509
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,523
PIZZA BREADS.                   

510
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,525
DID YOU JUST CHUCK IT?          
        YEAH, CHUCK IT IN THERE.

511
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,527
       OKAY, WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
           IS PUT SOME HERE.    

512
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,529
               A LOT OF PEOPLE  
            EAT IT AS BREAKFAST.

513
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,664
MY KIDS EAT ENGLISH MUFFIN      
    WITH PEANUT BUTTER,         

514
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,400
  AND YOURS BUST DOWN WITH SOME 
 OF THE ZA'ATAR AND SOME ONIONS.

515
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:32,470
 YOU'RE DOING A LOT OF STUDYING,
      THEY USED TO TELL US,     

516
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,472
          "YOU HAVE TO EAT      
     THE ZA'ATAR IN THE MORNING.

517
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:37,441
      IT'S GOOD FOR YOUR BRAIN."
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS IT.         
THE ZA'ATAR IS A STARTER.       

518
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:39,810
            AND THE ZA'ATAR     
      IS THE AWESOME STUFF HERE.

519
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,613
THAT DIDN'T RHYME AT ALL.       

520
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:45,516
IT'S READY TO GO.               
                  FOR BREAKFAST?

521
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,285
                         MMM.   

522
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:48,686
                OH, THAT'S GOOD.
GOOD ONE?                       

523
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,221
                     GREAT ONE. 

524
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,690
            I LIKE SOUR, TANGY, 

525
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:55,092
             CRUNCHY, SALTY--   
           THIS IS ALL OF THAT. 

526
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:57,428
IT'S GOT A COMBINATION          
        OF IT.                  
            THIS HAS GOT IT ALL.

527
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,430
                 THAT'S CRAZY.  
               IT'S GOT A REAL--
TEXTURE.                        

528
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,298
        REAL DEEP FLAVOR TO IT. 

529
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,834
        THAT'S GREAT. I'D LIKE  
       A LITTLE CHEESE ON THAT. 

530
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,636
              YOU COULD PUT     
        GRILLED CHICKEN ON THAT.

531
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,438
         YOU COULD PUT LETTUCE. 
            I MEAN, THAT'S--    

532
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,506
         I WOULD TAKE THAT INTO 
         LEBANESE TOSTADA. MMM. 

533
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,442

       I'M HAVING ANOTHER.      

534
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:14,645
HAVE YOU EVER HAD THE THYME     
 PIZZA THAT HAS NO THYME?       
                             NO.

535
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,114
NO? REALLY?                     
        I WILL TRY THAT, THOUGH.

536
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,717
       OH, YOU DO.              
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE TIME.        

537
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,452
        EVERYTHING'S BEEN GREAT.
