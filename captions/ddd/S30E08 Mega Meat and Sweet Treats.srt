              without question, 

111
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:05,043
             the pickled onion, 
      which cleanses the palate.

112
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,778
         That's a badge of honor
             right there, buddy.

113
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,780

              Man:              
  Reminds me of New York, where 
  there's more meat than bread. 

116

    Homemade sourdough bread    
     is just another level.     

117
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:19,057
And the mustard just adds       
enough of that tang.            

118
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,992
     When my friends come in

   some life-changing pastrami

It's just the level of detail   
in every layer of every dish.

    Fieri: And when it comes    
       to their desserts,       

127

     they take those layers     
           literally.

I like to use pineapple juice.

443
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,802
          Okay, husband and wife
     are married for four years,

444
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:07,538
              divorced for 23,  
             got back together, 

445
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,740
       and they got a restaurant

446
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,407
    where they're not interested
             in making a profit.

447
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,542
                They're just    
              really interested 

448
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,945
            in giving the guests
          a positive experience.

449
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,213
       -What do you mean?       
     -I don't know, Hunter.     

450
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,547
          We'll have to find out
               for ourselves.   

451
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,883
                   This is      
           The Folded Pizza Pie.

452
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,684
        Man: Behind you,        
    Holy Moly's in the oven.    

453
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,487
      We eat here at least      
       three times a week.      

454
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,956
      The food is amazing.      
           It's fresh.          

455
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,824
  Legacy calzone in the window. 

456
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,826
    It's the greatest calzone   
        you can ever get.       

457
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,160
             Fieri:             
    And it's one of the stars   

458
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,630
   of Dale and Taryn Leikam's   
           second act,          

459
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:33,764
  'cause their retirement plan  

460
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,567
       meant going all in       
         at this joint.         

461
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,236
  -Why do two normal people --  
       -We're not normal.       

462
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,505
          I apologize.          

463
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,039
 I didn't mean to offend anybody
         with that one.         

464
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,507
            Get into            
     the restaurant business    

465
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,109
        after they've got       
   these great careers going?   

466
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,511
   We're not in it              
 to make any money.             

467
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,911
      Our focus                 
  is on the people.             

468
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,714
 You ever seen "Twilight Zone," 
       the pizza edition?       

469
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:51,249
    There you go!               

470
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,851
       It's a world where       
  nothing's flat, only folded.  

471
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,187
  The Folded Pie, it's a pizza  
      that he just rolls up     

472
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,923
      into a calzone shape      
      or a stromboli shape.     

473
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,190
Holy Moly for Carrie.           

474
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,993
    The Holy Moly Stromboli,    
          they pack it          

475
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:04,528
 full of seven different meats, 
 and it's absolutely delicious. 

476
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,531
We're making this gigantic      
Holy Moly Stromboli?            

477
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:07,732
              We're gonna start 
              with out dough -- 

478
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:10,268
              4 cups of water,  
         salt, sugar, olive oil.

479
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,003
  Parmesan cheese.              
             Italian seasonings.

480
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:13,604
I've never seen pizza dough     
   made like this.              

481
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,874
 That's what makes our calzones,
           strombolis stand out.

482
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:19,943
           Flour, bloomed yeast.
        Get a nice big old blob.

483
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,879
   -That's the culinary term?   
     -That's our term, yeah.    

484
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:23,748
             -Blob?             
   -The Folded Pizza Pie blob.  

485
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,616
-What are we up to now, Captain?
       -Chicken meatballs.      

486
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:28,419
          So we start with 60/40
       dark meat/white meat mix.

487
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,821
Whoa, you get after it          
with the Italian seasoning.     

488
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,224
    Garlic powder, onion powder,
              salt and pepper,  

489
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:36,160
 minced garlic, Cajun seasoning,
      and then our bread crumbs.

490
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,495
            -Got it.            
         -Roll them out.        

491
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,629
 Roast in the oven,             
     what temp?                 

492
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,365
                625 degrees.    

493
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:41,632
       Really?                  
      That hot?                 

494
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,234
   When you get that chicken fat
            coming out of there,

495
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:44,368
         it's time to pull them.

496
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,370
        Okay, we're gonna do our
           oven-roasted chicken.

497
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,505
  All right, boss.              

498
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,039
      Add some balsamic vinegar,

499
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,043
            dried minced garlic,
    onion powder, garlic powder,

500
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,245
              nutmeg, cinnamon, 
             Italian seasoning. 

501
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:55,313
 Italian seasoning?             
         No?                    

502
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,714
             -Yeah!             
              -You?             

503
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:57,648
              Salt and pepper.  

504
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,916
Marinate it for 24 hours.       
                        Yep.    

505
00:16:58,918 --> 00:16:59,917
Throw it in the oven.           
                         Yep.   

506
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,053
     What temp?                 
                    625 degrees.

507
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,254
 625 degrees again?             

508
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,589
             That's how we roll.

509
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,190
      We know it's done when you
    start smelling the cinnamon.

510
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,258
  We don't time it.             

511
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,060
  We just wait till             
we smell the cinnamon.          

512
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:11,262
      So now we're going to make
        the Holy Moly Stromboli.

513
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:15,266
So this super-herb-laden,       
 Parmesan cheese dough.         
                            Yep.

514
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:16,734
         Italian-seasoned dough.

515
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:19,137
You really don't care           
that a lot of your methods      

516
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,471
and styles are unorthodox.      

517
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:21,605
               It's my place.   

518
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,074
          Genoa salami.         
Don't you know-a.               

519
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,742
         Spicy sausage.         

520
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,011
      You want to try some?     
Oh, no. Who, us?                

521
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:28,879
      Bacon, the meatballs      
          we just made,         

522
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,581
    the oven-roasted chicken,   
           pepperoni.           

523
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,284
       And Canadian bacon.      

524
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,551
    You've got to               
   be kidding me.               

525
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,955
  We have mozzarella, Fontina,  
        Asiago, Parmesan,       

526
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:40,091
   Romano, cheddar, and Gouda.  

527
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,159
       Now we roll it up,       
    brush it with olive oil,    

528
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,362
  dust it with Parmesan cheese, 
    and throw it in the oven.   

529
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,029
            -At 625.            
              -625.             

530
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,231
      Holy Moly Stromboli.      

531
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,033
                  Would you     
                look at that?   

532
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,434
       Put a little sauce       
            on there.           

533
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,503
       Dip it, pour it on,      
       whatever you like.       

534
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:53,704
 I'll tell you what             
  it's not lacking.             

535
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:54,772
            -Flavor.            
            -Flavor.            

536
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,240
     [ Laughs ]                 

537
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,509
What goes on in here            
  is a flavor bomb.             

538
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,244
Lots of herbs.                  
        The texture of the bread

539
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,712
     and the flavor of the bread
                is fantastic.   

540
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,581
       You get                  
this cracker crunch.            

541
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,583
     It's dense,                
   and it's rich.               

542
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,119
I mean, it is not in any way,   
   shape, or form               

543
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:10,187
what most people expect.        

544
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,455
But it's really good.           
             Thanks.            

545
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,923
      Holy Moly Stromboli.      

546
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,925
           It's huge.           

547
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,526
     It's got a really good     
           seasoning.           

548
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,062
   What makes it is the crust.  
  It's the reason people come.  

549
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:19,930
     Fieri: Well, Dale helps    
         with that, too.        

550
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,399
     Driving by,                
he's standing outside.          

551
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:22,800
He's like, "Come eat."          

552
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,402
