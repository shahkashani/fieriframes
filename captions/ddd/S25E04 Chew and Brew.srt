1
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:02,601
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:04,102
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:06,404
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

4
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,339
          This trip...          

5
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,941
                  I'm out!      
                  I am out.     

6
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,010
    ...we've got funky joints   
       to grab a drink...       

7
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,346
I know beer is not going to go  
good with this at all.          

8
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,682
   ...while digging into some   
       dynamite dishes...       

9
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,083
   This "Culinary               
   Flavortown" --               

10
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,685
this is the amusement           
     park there.                

11
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:22,087
  ...like a monster Minneapolis 
           brewery...           

12
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:24,490
It might be our biggest         
Triple D building yet.          

13
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:26,959
   ...where the grub's as good  
          as the suds.          

14
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:28,293
                   FIERI:       
             If this was a band,

15
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,095
         it would be "Barky Bark
          and The Funky Crunch."

16
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,163
      And a restaurant bar      
        in Los Angeles...       

17
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,231
            You had me at hello.

18
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,766
  ...that's got me coming back  
            for more.           

19
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,502
  That's the pizza              
     I remember.                

20
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:38,770
   Plus a southern-style stop   
           in Miami...          

21
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,906
That's one of the best          
we've ever seen on the show.    

22
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:43,242
      ...serving up comfort     
           gone crazy.          

23
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:44,710
  It's outstanding.             

24
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:48,179
It's just out standing          
in the rain by itself!          

25
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,848
      That's all right here     
            right now           

26
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,551
      on "Diners, Drive-ins     
            & Dives."           

27
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:07,199
So, I'm here in the Coral Gables
        area of Florida,        

28
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,667
    just a couple blocks away   
       from Miracle Mile,       

29
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,203
           hanging out          
       with my buddy KC --      

30
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:12,738
            you know,           
     from The Sunshine Band?    

31
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,673
Anyhow, KC, let me tell you     
  about this place.             

32
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,075
This is the place where you're  
going to get down tonight.      

33
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,276
                   Really?      

34
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,278
Yeah, and I'm going to tell you,
the food is so dynamite,        

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,080
it's going to make you want     
to shake your booty.            

36
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,215
                Come on, Guy.   

37
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,215
I'm telling you, KC,            

38
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,884
this guy makes a chicken        
    and dumpling,               

39
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,420
and he does it from scratch,    
and that's the way I like it.   

40
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:29,554
               That's the way   
                <i> you</i> like it.   

41
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:30,689
   Yeah, exactly.               
                           Okay.

42
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,091
      This is "The Local."      

43
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,229
  Steak tartare in the window.  

44
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,631
 The Local -- it really is just 
     a breath of fresh air.     

45
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,500
   There's always local beers   
             on tap,            

46
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:43,835
   and the cocktail list here   
      is pretty extensive.      

47
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,237
   Plate up shrimp and grits.   

48
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,371
     And the food itself --     

49
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,240
      I don't think "good"      
    accurately describes it.    

50
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:49,708
     I think it's marvelous.    

51
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,511
 FIERI: Thanks to the amped up, 
         down home grub         

52
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:54,512
chef Phil Bryant been cooking up

53
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,848
   since he rebooted the menu   
            in 2014.            

54
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,116
What's the menu like?           

55
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,251
       Well, it's casual dining,
          a lot of small plates.

56
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,053
             And we focus mainly
             on southern cooking

57
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,255
       and regional ingredients.

58
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:04,323
   I eat a lot of things here   

59
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:05,924
      that I never heard of     
        and I didn't know       

60
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,526
   that could be incorporated   
         inside a dish.         

61
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,061
         Lamb belly BLT.        

62
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:11,062
The lamb belly BLT is fantastic.

63
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,131
      MAN: I'm okay living      
         without bacon,         

64
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,068
       because lamb tastes      
         so much better.        

65
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,536
     Lamb belly?                

66
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:18,737
               Yeah, it's one   
              of those off cuts 

67
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,004
              that are getting  
          more and more popular.

68
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,874
Oh, then take me to Lamb Belly  
Town, whatever that is.         

69
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,143
             We're going to make
                 our brine.     

70
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:25,477
                  Start off     
          with some kosher salt.

71
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,346
Pig salt. Keep a little bit     
    of the color.               

72
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:28,480
                 We got some    
              brown sugar here. 

73
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,215
                 Some local     
           orange blossom honey.

74
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,349
               Minced garlic.   

75
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,417
A little pickling spice.        

76
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,086
            And then we're going
              to add our water. 

77
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:35,554
        Bring this up to a boil.

78
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,289
    And then we're going to pour
             this over some ice.

79
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,892
And how long are we going to let
this brine that lamb belly?     

80
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:41,226
             For about 24 hours.
Okay.                           

81
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,361
             So now we're going 
                to season it    

82
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:43,628
              with a little bit 
              of black pepper,  

83
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,630
  and then we're going to get it
        on our stove top smoker.

84
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,698
Make it happen, baby.           

85
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,299
Soak wood chips down.           
 What kind of wood?             

86
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,568
                  Hickory.      

87
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,169
Just going to perfume this      
with a little smoke.            

88
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,637
   What, half hour              
   on this stove?               

89
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,106
              About 45 minutes. 

90
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,574
Then finish it in the oven      
at 225 for how long?            

91
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:57,643
             Two to three hours.

92
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,177
    Let it cool,                
then slice it by hand,          

93
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,646
and that's put together         
      the BLT.                  

94
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:02,046
                  Exactly.      

95
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,116
   Now we're going to make pesto
     out of some mustard greens.

96
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,383
        Okay.                   
                      Olive oil.

97
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,652
              Grated Parmesan.  

98
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:07,986
        Normally pestos are made
               with pine nuts.  

99
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:10,656
      We're going to use peanut,
very much a southern ingredient.

100
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:11,723
             Fresh lemon juice. 

101
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:12,858
             Crushed red pepper.

102
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,459
               Minced garlic.   

103
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,061
              And kosher salt.  

104
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:19,264
       Blend that till it's nice
                 and smooth.    

105
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,133
That works for me.              
        Sweetness from the nuts.

106
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,936
        Now we're ready to grill
               our lamb belly.  

107
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,604
   I'm impressed.               
  That looks great.             

108
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,472
              We got out bread  
                toasted off.    

109
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:28,807
Local bakery?                   
                  Local bakery. 

110
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,076
     Going to smear a little bit
          of our pesto on there,

111
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,144
              add a lamb belly. 

112
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:33,345
Is that how it always is?       

113
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,146
                 Yeah, man.     
         Some heirloom tomatoes.

114
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,215
   Put a little bit of olive oil
                and sea salt.   

115
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,750
      And we got some more local
                greens here.    

116
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,620
             Dress that lightly.
      That's our lamb belly BLT.

117
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:42,821
     Ridiculous.                

118
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,557
You tell me that's not          
a righteous looking BLT.        

119
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,827
  Without question,             
   you killed it.               

120
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,496
                    Thanks, man.
It's dynamite.                  

121
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,231
 You're getting all             
 the flavor of lamb             

122
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,500
with that great, crunchy        
  texture of bacon.             

123
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,435
                  Exactly.      
Mmm.                            

124
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,171
Cooking it on the flat top      
was definitely a great move.    

125
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:02,307
Beautiful fresh greens          
and heirloom tomato in there.   

126
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,708
Perfect choice of the bread.    

127
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,511
        Mmm.                    
 Dude, nicely done.             

128
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:07,845
This Culinary Flavortown --     

129
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,648
this is the amusement           
     park there.                

130
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,383
        Okay?                   
Go take a ride on the BLT.      

131
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,719
We got the lamb belly BLT       
     right here.                

132
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,920
        Perfectly smokey.       
     It melts in your mouth.    

133
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,656
      And when he pairs it      
         with the pesto         

134
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:20,191
   that kind of just drenches   
  the bread -- it's phenomenal. 

135
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,460
 FIERI: And with a lineup loaded
        with microbrews,        

136
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,863
   The Local really is a place  
     for locals to hang out,    

137
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,064
         like this cat.         

138
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,666
So, you've lived down in Florida
    for how long?               

139
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,200
           Born and raised here.
             Welcome to my home.

140
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,271
There's really an energy of     
the culinary world down here,   

141
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,138
  from great chefs              
to funky little joints.         

142
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,007
           There's a great place
           on every corner here.

143
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,343
  FIERI: But there's something  
         about this one.        

144
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:39,945
There's just not a lot of places

145
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,946
    that you can get southern   
          comfort food.         

146
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,616
 FIERI: And not a lot of places 
     where you can get this.    

147
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,018
  Pick up roasted bone marrow.  

148
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,220
      Roasted bone marrow.      
              Yes.              

149
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:49,887
       Rich and decadent.       

150
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,756
             I wanted you to try
              some bone marrow. 

151
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,158
    I heard you're a big fan.   
    -I'm a bone marrow junky.   

152
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,160
         We have our femur bone.

153
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,361
        We brine this overnight,

154
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,096
     a little bit of a housemade
               barbecue spice,  

155
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,498
          a little bit of water,
                 some sugar.    

156
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,832
       Took it out of the brine,

157
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,500
      and then coat it with more
          of that barbecue spice

158
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:03,501
       and roast it in the oven.

159
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,903
How long did you roast it?      

160
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,571
           Eight to ten minutes.
 You have a nice, savory flavor.

161
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,173
   Place that right on the bread
                  like so.      

162
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:10,842
    And then to add a little bit
               more richness.   

163
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,178
Yes, 'cause that's what         
 bone marrow needs.             

164
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,379
     Whipped horseradish butter.

165
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,980
         And when all that stuff
               melts together,  

166
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,315
               it'll be a nice  
               kind of sauce.   

167
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,917
             We're going to add 
              a little relish,  

168
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,185
          so this is egg whites,
                   capers,      

169
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:21,653
                a little bit    
            of anchovies, herbs,

170
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,589
       and then some herbs, some
 radishes, a little green onion.

171
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,724
 I'd say bone marrow            
gone wild right here.           

172
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,327
               And that's it.   

173
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,531
Yo, you just can't fake         
that kind of flavor.            

174
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:37,135
I mean, that's just real deal,  
genuine flavor going on there.  

175
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,404
        Mmm.                    

176
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,672
The little horseradish kiss     
really makes a difference.      

177
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,274
  Fresh brightness              
 of the green onion             

178
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,076
   really takes it              
 to the next level.             

179
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,478
Nicely done, my friend.         
                      Thank you.

180
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,079
    Here's your bone marrow.    
             Enjoy.             

181
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,481
         It's delicious.        

182
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,216
   In its uniqueness in it of   
  itself, it's worth ordering.  

183
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,886
    FIERI: When we come back,   
 something else worth an order. 

184
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,754
      WOMAN: Here's the hen     
    and buttermilk dumplings.   

185
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:57,956
 The hen and dumplings is one of

186
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,758
      the best dishes that      
       they have out here.      

187
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,692
      Every time I get it,      
     my eyes just light up.     

188
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,828
     We'll see you in a bit.    

189
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,599
    Hey everybody, welcome to   

190
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,734
  The Local Craft Food & Drink  
        in Coral Gables.        

191
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,136
 Hey hey. Hey. Hey.             
       I'm...                   

192
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:13,271
      You had stepped out, so...
I -- Oh.                        

193
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:16,541
            ...I just kind of...
Welcome back to The Local.      

194
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,209
             FIERI:             
    With this guy Chef Phil,    

195
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,511
      he's putting out some     
    serious southern comfort    

196
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,814
    right here in the middle    
     of a craft beer joint.     

197
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,950
      It warms itself with      
    that old southern flare.    

198
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:28,152
I'm an old southern boy, so it's
   as close as I get to home,   

199
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,687
       especially out here      
        in south Florida.       

200
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,088
 This is your hen and dumplings.

201
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,291
             Enjoy.             
 -I love the hen and dumplings. 

202
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,693
 MAN: This thick, creamy gravy, 
          shredded hen,         

203
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,429
    dumplings, corn, chives,    

204
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,831
  I mean, it's one of the best  
          on the menu.          

205
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:40,866
      One of my favorite dishes,

206
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,433
             I take on a chicken
               and dumplings,   

207
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,302
      but we're going to make it
             with stewing hens. 

208
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:45,503
Why do you call them            
    stewing hens?               

209
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,039
             Well, stewing hens 
          are more mature birds.

210
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,975
        They tend to have a more
        chickeny kind of flavor.

211
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:51,176
    A "chickeny."               

212
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,444
If you're ever looking          
 for more "chickeny"            

213
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:54,579
  kind of chicken,              
    here you go.                

214
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,381
 We're going to braise these off
             for a couple hours 

215
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,383
        and kind of make a broth
                 out of it.     

216
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,452
       A little bit of mirepoix,
                  parsley.      

217
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:01,787
    I'm going to add some water.

218
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,588
  This is actually going to take
              about four hours. 

219
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,490
About four hours because of     
the size of the, uh...          

220
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,459
                Stewing hen.    
 ...stewing hen.                

221
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,860
 Okay, stalk's done.            

222
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,929
 Let the bird cool,             
   shred the meat.              

223
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,463
Now we're going to make         
   the dumplings.               

224
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,065
        So, we're going to start
           with some buttermilk.

225
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,801
     Some butter. Garlic powder.
                Onion powder.   

226
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,069
             Going to bring that
                 to a boil,     

227
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,737
     and then we're going to add
             all-purpose flour. 

228
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,272
So this is going to make        
like a hot dough here.          

229
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,407
    Then we're going to transfer
          that to a stand mixer.

230
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,076
      We're going to add one egg
                  at a time     

231
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,277
     till it's all incorporated.

232
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,812
    Roll it out,                
 cut it into shape.             

233
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,281
            And then we're going
               to parboil it.   

234
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,815
     -So it stays in a form.    
            -Exactly.           

235
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,150
              Add a little bit  
              of whole butter.  

236
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,285
      We got our dumplings here.

237
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,554
The gigantic yokey-looking      
       things.                  

238
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:36,888
     Get a little brown on that,

239
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,823
      and then we're to add some
          finely diced mirepoix.

240
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,025
       Dig it.                  

241
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:41,092
                 Some of our    
              pulled hen meat.  

242
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:43,628
Pulled hen meat.                
         This is some sour corn.

243
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,029
           We salt and sugar it.

244
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,365
 We let it sit out for 24 hours,
       kind of start to ferment.

245
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,833
    Interesting.                

246
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,770
     A little bit of caramelized
      onion, salt, black pepper.

247
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:53,104
               A little pinch   
          of crushed red pepper.

248
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,439
                Some bourbon.   

249
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:55,707
          Burn out that alcohol.

250
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,242
 Then we got our strained liquid
           from cooking our hen.

251
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,911
Also known as chicken stock.    
                  Chicken stock.

252
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:02,180
          And we're going to add
               Parmesan broth,  

253
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:05,450
which is heavy cream that's been
   simmered with Parmesan rinds.

254
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,051
     A little bit more Parmesan.

255
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,786
     Let all that come together.

256
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,521
Looks like a small portion,     

257
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,924
but I bet you it's going        
     to be rich!                

258
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:16,728
 Just a little bit of some chive
   oil and some fresh cut chive.

259
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,563
 Hen and dumplings.             

260
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,335
     Ridiculous.                

261
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,203
 Oh, my gosh, dude.             

262
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:30,475
It has the depth and the        
richness of lobster bisque,     

263
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,410
     but chicken                
   and dumplified.              

264
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,546
The dumpling's so nice and light
    and delicate.               

265
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:38,350
The broth is so rich.           
Right amount of chicken.        

266
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,951
Chive oil's on point.           

267
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,753
A little red chili flake        
     is awesome.                

268
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:45,156
That Parmesan cream sauce that  
you make and the sour corn --   

269
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,025
that's that acid kick that      
you get inside of there.        

270
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,159
                  Exactly.      

271
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:49,961
That's a new definition         
 right there, buddy.            

272
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,363
  It's outstanding.             

273
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,633
It's just out standing          
in the rain by itself.          

274
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:55,834
                 [ Laughs ]     

275
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,502
        Hen and dumplings       
         in the window!         

276
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,504
      He's able to mix all      
     these flavors together     

277
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:00,839
  and just create an explosion. 

278
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,240
Those are dumpling pillows.     

279
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,575
                Oh, they are.   
              They're amazing.  

280
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,111
        Calamari pick up!       

281
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:08,513
  It's genuine. It's authentic. 
      It's from the heart.      

282
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:09,514
     Remarkable.                

283
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:10,782
You're a real talent, man.      

284
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,250
               Thank you, man.  

285
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,385
That's one of the best          
we've ever seen on the show.    

286
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:14,786
  I can't say that              
     very often.                

287
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,521
That's one of the best          
   I've ever seen.              

288
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:17,522
               Thank you, man.  
   Wow.                         

289
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,457
I'm going to go take a nap.     

290
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,195
 FIERI: Coming up, a Minneapolis
   spot known for its brew...   

291
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,730
         I'll take some of that.
Yeah.                           

292
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,466
      ...also killing it in     
  the kitchen with their 'cue.  

293
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,602
             I compete barbecue.
       I make a lot of barbecue.

294
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:31,803
         That brisket stands up.

295
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,412
So, I'm right here on the border

296
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,115
 of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, 
           Minnesota,           

297
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,317
    and I'm looking for this    
      scratch-made kitchen      

298
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,053
      that has this really      
         creative chef,         

299
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:50,121
       and it just happens      
        to be surrounded        

300
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,389
   by this ginormous brewery.   

301
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,491
        This is the Surly       
        Brewing Company.        

302
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,329
      This place is heaven.     

303
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,266
 When you think about Minnesota 
  beer, people just know Surly. 

304
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,068
   They were really leaders of  
 the whole craft beer movement. 

305
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,270
      FIERI: And like a lot     
       of craft breweries,      

306
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,739
     trailblazer Omar Ansari    
     had humble beginnings.     

307
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,207
                 Yeah, when     
            the brewery started,

308
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,743
               myself and Todd  
              our head brewer,  

309
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,144
       it was just the two of us
                making beer,    

310
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,412
                selling beer,   
              delivering beer.  

311
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:15,280
         That was ten years ago.

312
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,481
                Two years ago   
               we built this.   

313
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,682
     What was it                
 built out on this?             

314
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,817
             50,000 square feet.
Psh.                            

315
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,220
That might be our biggest       
Triple D building yet.          

316
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:25,290
 FIERI: And their big reputation
    goes way beyond the beer.   

317
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,024
     This stands on its own     
        as a restaurant.        

318
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,627
      Great beer hall food      
    taken to the next level.    

319
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,030
  FIERI: With Chef Jorge Guzman 
           putting out          

320
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,633
    those bold flavors mixed    
     with some big barbecue.    

321
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,434
        All right, we got       
        the pork shoulder       

322
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,102
    with the Brussels sprouts   
           and grits.           

323
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,370
Get a huge potion of pulled pork

324
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,038
     along with a little bit    
         different take         

325
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,840
      on a Brussels sprout.     

326
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,174
              What are we into? 

327
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,775
Right now, we're making         
our Thai chili vinaigrette      

328
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:45,777
for our Brussels sprouts.       

329
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,912
     So, I start                
with fresh lime juice.          

330
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,247
Quite a bit of fish sauce.      

331
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,649
                    Okay.       
Some lime leaves.               

332
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:51,916
Little bit of garlic.           

333
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,052
    Thai chilies.               

334
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:56,387
       Ginger.                  
 Rice wine vinegar.             

335
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,456
       Copious amounts of sugar.

336
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,458
     Hey, look mommy, milkshake!

337
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,727
  Fresh lime zest.              
 Little chili sauce.            

338
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,262
          But we didn't throw it
          just into the blender?

339
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,663
We want the seeds to be         
      in there.                 

340
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,798
We want a little bit            
     of texture.                

341
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,201
         I'll take some of that.
Yeah.                           

342
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,870
Now, we're going to make        
our smoked pork shoulder.       

343
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,137
  Put a little bit              
  of black pepper,              

344
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,673
salt, and cayenne pepper.       

345
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,274
               Rub this down.   
        Let it rest for an hour.

346
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,676
Then we go into the smoker.     
 225 for nine hours.            

347
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,944
          What kind wood are you
                running here?   

348
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,880
Hickory or cherry or apple.     
                         Dig it.

349
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,481
     All right,                 
we're gonna do grits,           

350
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,617
so we put a ton of butter,      
 cheese, olive oil.             

351
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:26,885
           Grits in a beer hall.

352
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,152
    Put a little                
 pickled jalapeños.             

353
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,754
    We make these               
   in house, too.

Brussels sprouts quick.         

355
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,291
We just fry these for like two  
or three minutes tops.          

356
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,094
We hit it with out Thai chili   
    vinaigrette.                

357

Toasted sesame seeds.           

358
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,699
And then a touch of cilantro,   
then we just mix those up.      

359
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:41,899
You have to try that.

Now we go with our pork,        

362
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:45,503
 and we'll pull off             
 some of that bark.             

363

We just want a nice,            
    meaty chunk.

 And that's it, man.            

365
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,176
        The grits are fantastic.

366

          Look at the smoke ring

367
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,846
       on that pork right there.

368
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:55,880
           That smoke's no joke.

369
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,519

        are super tasty.        

375
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,832
 Kind of crunchy on the outside 
and nice and soft on the inside.

    to sell beer at a brewery   
          in Minnesota.         

382

         the Surly bill.        

383

                 to stay on?

               are you using?   

396

 For brisket we use             
  post oak or oak.

We're using kosher salt.        
    Black pepper.               

401
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,249

a bourbon smoked paprika.

    and I tell you something,   

460
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,304
    I'm having a total blast    
         from the past.         

461
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,571
    You see, back in the day,   

462
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,039
         I was shooting         
       "Minute To Win It"       

463
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,642
          down here at          
    the Sunset Gower Studios.   

464
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:12,510
      When we had wrapped,      
      well, we'd come down      

465
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,712
     to check out this joint    
    for great pizza and beer.   

466
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:15,780
    You're going to love it.    

467
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,982
 This is Delancey Pizza and Bar.

468
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:22,787
            Pizza up.           

469
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:27,391
It is a little gem in the center
     of historic Hollywood.     

470
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:31,128
   This takes me back to Italy  
  with a stopover in New York.  

471
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,531
  FIERI: Which was exactly what 
   NYC transplant George "AD"   

472
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,868
   had in mind when he opened   
            in 2008.            

473
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,537
             The whole idea was 
               New York City,   

474
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,339
               lower east side  
             Italian restaurant.

475
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,274
So he created the right recipes,

476
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,411
    and now he has Chef David   
 Luevano dishing up his vision. 

477
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,611
          Calamari up.          

478
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,547
      -This food is legit.      
          -It<i> is</i> legit.         

479
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:50,814
        Legit's perfect.        
           -[ Laughs ]          

480
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,149
          Gramercy up!          

481
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,953
 The Gramercy is pizza nirvana. 

482
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:58,089
 Only place you can get multiple
    forms of pork on a pizza    

483
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,423
    and it still feels light.   

484
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,360
 The guanciale on it really adds
       something special.       

485
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,762
               The guanciale.   
              The pork cheeks.  

486
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:09,433
      This is just a great ratio
       of fat to meat to flavor,

487
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,502
      and we're going to cure it
        and use it on the pizza.

488
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:12,770
On the pizza as a topping.      

489
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,171
          You had me at "hello."

490
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,306
              Red chili flake.  
                Black pepper.   

491
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,176
Some salt and sugar.            

492
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,044
     A little curing salt and...

493
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:20,978
   ...fresh thyme.              

494
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,647
     Rub this all over the meat,

495
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,183
     and then throw the thyme up
                on top of it.   

496
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:26,583
Wrap it for a whole week.       

497
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,653
    And it's just going to start
           pulling moisture out.

498
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:32,056
After it's been cured,          
we wash all the salt off.       

499
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,591
            And then we're ready
            to slice it thin and
          throw it on the pizza?

500
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,660
Yeah.                           
                   Got it.      

501
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:36,894
       All right, make the dough

502
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,863
         with just enough gluten
              to stay together. 

503
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,265
 We're going to add             
    pizza sauce.                

504
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,134
Whole milk mozzarella?          
                            Yes.

505
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,069
             We're going to add 
               the pepperoni.   

506
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:47,204
             Sopressata. Bacon. 

507
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,807
I know beer is<i> not</i> going to go  
good with this at all.          

508
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,876
                 [ Laughs ]     
              Add the sausage.  

509
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:54,078
A lot of people don't put raw   
sausage on top of a pizza,      

510
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,746
'cause you got to have          
 your timing right.             

511
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,815
When it starts to cook          
and it starts to render,        

512
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,418
all that fat and flavor is going
to stay right on top of it.     

513
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,953
That's why this pizza           
   is so rocking.               

514
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:04,222
I remember having this when I   
was shooting down the street.   

515
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,424
And then the guanciale.         
                      Guanciale.

516
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,025
We're good?                     
                 We're good.    

517
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,293
At what temp we running         
    that oven at?               

518
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:10,962
                    550.        
550.                            

519
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:13,031
    Look at that.               

520
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:16,033
See the guanciale just melts    
   right into it?               

521
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,435
  That's the pizza              
     I remember.                

522
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:19,837
              We do our garlic  
              infused saligao.  

523
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,306
                  Slice it.     

524
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,108
  Nice looking pie.             

525
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,580
That's a lot going on, man.     

526
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:32,116
The guanciale, the sausage,     

527
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:35,386
I mean, just all these          
components start to cook down.  

528
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,454
It creates so much flavor.      

529
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,956
More flavor than normal.        

530
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,394
   Real deal, man.              
 Thank you, brother.            

531
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,728
  I appreciate it.              

532
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,598
     Get a glamorous pizza.     

533
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,667
  I mean, everything just works 
       perfectly together.      

534
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,135
              I love the crust. 

535
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,203
             Crust is what makes
              a pizza anywhere. 

536
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,339
     Anda Lari and gnocchi,     
           pick it up.

     It's really tasty food,    

538
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:00,144
   but it's also just a place   
       you can just relax       

539
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,346
         and have a beer

          all the time.

Yeah, you watch out, 'cause     
this place gets packed.         

542
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,485
 The party's great.             

543
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,886
  I left here late.             

544
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,287
             -Yeah.             
          -A few times.         

545
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,822
   You don't necessarily think  
     of it as a restaurant,     

546
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,091
  more of a bar, it feels like. 
             -Right.            

547
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,959
But then when you come in,      
you get these dishes.           

548
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,426
       Gnocchi wild boar.       

549
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,962
             Wild boar gnocchi? 
Yeah.                           

550
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,763
     It's one of my favorite    
          dishes here.          

551
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,032
         So, let's get it going.
This wild boar leg.             

552
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,834
                      Got it.   
Some salt, pepper.              

553
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,436
          So we'll sear this off
               on both sides.   

554
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,972
    Take it out,                
  add the mirepoix.             

555
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,641
             It's going to sweat
                 all those.     

556
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:34,045
They're caramelized.            
 Then add red wine.             

557
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:36,247
    De-glaze it.                
   Chicken stock.               

558
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,515
        You can see a little bit
                 of that fat    

559
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,183
             floating to the top
          of that chicken stock.

560
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:40,584
              That's how I knew 
            he made it in house.

561
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,053
             And a little water.

562
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:43,888
So it has enough liquid.        

563
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,390
             Drop these back in.
         Bring them to a simmer.

564
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,593
          Then we're going to go
            into the oven at 350

565
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,194
          for about three hours?
Yes.                            

566
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,929
'Cause it's tender and it       
falls apart on itself.          

567
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,331
      Will you strain that sauce

568
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,399
          and use that reduction
              with the gnocchi? 

569
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:56,800
Yeah.                           
                 Okay, Chef.    

570
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,802
Right now we're going           
to make our gnocchi.            

571
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,437
                So we've got    
             our rice potatoes. 

572
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,206
      Nice and light and tender.
Yes, sir.                       

573
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,208
 We add eggs to it.             

574
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,476
               A little salt.   

575
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,812
I just want it wet enough       
so I can actually make a dough. 

576
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:11,081
Now I'm going to add            
 two cups of flour.             

577
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,483
  We roll them out.             

578
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,353
  You cut them off              
  to about an inch.             

579
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:18,422
          This is about as loose
                and as light    

580
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:19,690
     as you can possibly get it.

581
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,359
   Little pillows,              
    I call them.                

582
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,760
 Get these boiling.             

583
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,428
       He's got a delicate hand.

584
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,230
      And let those go for what?

585
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,299
 Around four minutes            
until they float up.            

586
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:29,433
                 All right.     

587
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,369
I'm going to brown them         
   on both sides.               

588
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,037
             While that's going,
                 you want me    

589
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,173
              to shred and eat  
         the wild boar, correct?

590
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,374
Uh, correct. [ Laughs ]         

591
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,042
                     Oh!        
[ Laughs ]                      

592
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,445
Just so I can make the sauce    
and add the reduction.          

593
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,115
Some fresh sage leaves,         
       olives.                  

594
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:45,449
                Melt it with    
              a little butter.  

595
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,518
 Just got to reduce             
     the sauce.                 

596
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,987
  Add the gnocchis.             

597
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,855
  And then we just              
   finish it off.               

598
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,457
            A little fried sage.

599
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,395
                    Mmm.        
          Brother, this gnocchi,

600
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,464
       I'm surprised it can even
    survive sitting on the fork,

601
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,199
                 'cause once    
     you put it in your mouth...

602
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,668
It melts.                       
                ...it's gone.   

603
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,269
            You get a little bit
               of that texture  

604
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,671
                from when you   
               pan sautéed it,  

605
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:09,273
which is nice, because sometimes
   gnocchi can be just so mushy.

606
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:14,078
    Now we're into the wild boar
 au jus from the brazing liquid.

607
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,212
                    Mmm.        

608
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,615
              And the brininess 
                of the olive    

609
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,349
                 really adds    
           that extra dimension.

610
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,819
     This dish is smoking, dude.
                 Fantastic.     

611
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,821
     Gnocchi on the window!     

612
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,689
    These are little pillows    
         of perfection.         

613
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:29,360
     The wild boar gives it     
  a very strong flavor profile. 

614
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:30,761
       Bringing the clam.       

615
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,563
      MAN: The environment      
        they create here        

616
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,765
      has made this kind of     
         a second home.         

617
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:37,301
I dig it, man, congratulations. 
     Nice place.                

618
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,636
           -Thank you.          
       -I'm glad I finally      
          made it back.         

619
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,972
 So, was this a great road trip 
            or what?            

620
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,240
      But don't you worry.      

621
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,176
I got plenty more joints to find
     all over this country.     

622
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,911
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

623
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,848
     on "Diners, Drive-Ins,     
           and Dives."          

624
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,182
            We're going to slice
              or pull the pork? 

625
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,584
We're going to pull it.         

626
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,986
    You see all the karate moves
              I just did there. 

627
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:56,720
  I taste a little bit if the --
We don't do this.               

628
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,923
               And then all of  
              a sudden [laughs]
