103
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,867
  ALL RIGHT, WELL,              
GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN.            

104
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,803
  FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS 
 TAKE OFF THIS BLASTED MEMBRANE.

105
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,805
      <i> (zipping, whipping)</i>      

106
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,807
THAT'S A LITTLE ABRACADABRA     
       RIGHT THERE.             

107
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:39,478
      (laughs) ALL RIGHT, THEN  
   WE WANT TO SEASON BOTH SIDES.

108
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,681
  THE MUSTARD ACTS AS A SEALANT.
           RUB THIS IN.         

109
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,216
     NOW THEY GO IN THE WALK-IN.
OKAY.                           

110
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:46,218
                 WE LEAVE 'EM   
             IN THERE OVERNIGHT.

111
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,887
     WHAT KIND OF WOOD          
ARE WE GONNA SMOKE 'EM WITH?    
               WE'RE GONNA SMOKE
                  WITH PECAN.   

112
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,356
       I'M GONNA RUN THESE      
 AT 220 FOR THE FIRST 2 HOURS...
  OKAY.                         

113
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:55,026
        AND THEN I'LL BUMP IT UP
                 TO 230.        
OKAY. FOR HOW LONG?             

114
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,629
               FIVE HOURS TOTAL.
FIVE HOURS TOTAL.               

115
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,231
            ALL RIGHT, GOT THESE
               OFF THE SMOKER.  

116
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,768
            SAUCE ONE SIDE,     
       DRY RUB THE OTHER SIDE...
I DIG IT.                       

117
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,437
   'CAUSE I'M GONNA LET YOU PICK
        WHAT YOU LIKE BEST.     

118
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,440
THAT DRY RUB IS CRAZY...        
                         I KNOW.

119
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,708

        TO THE SALT,            

120
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,512
BUT IT'S NOT OVERLY SWEET.      

121
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:16,114
SEE HOW THE MEAT                
COMES OFF THERE,                

122
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,450
 BUT EVERYTHING                 
DOESN'T COME OFF.               

123
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,585
    WHEN YOU SAY                
THAT YOU DO 'EM WET,            

124
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,588
THAT'S NOT SLOPPY WET.          
                             NO.

125
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,724

   IS TIGHT TO IT.              

126
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,992
SO THE RIB WAS STILL HOT ENOUGH 
      THAT IT MELTED IN.        

127
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,795
HUH? IS THERE SOME

A BEACH TOWEL.                  
        IT'S NOT GOOD BARBECUE  
     IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT ALL...

129
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,733
