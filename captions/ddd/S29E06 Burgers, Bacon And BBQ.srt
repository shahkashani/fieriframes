but I got to be honest
with you, these are fine.

174
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,573
Slaw's got a nice,
little finishing touch to it,

175
00:06:16,573 --> 00:06:18,906
that little brininess,
the acidity of that feta,

176
00:06:18,906 --> 00:06:21,506
those barbecue sauces
really play well together.

177
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,540
The hot link is dynamite,
and it's the kind of thing

178
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,773

eat half of,

the rest for dinner.

It's impressive.
Never seen that before.

Today we've got sirloin

to patty it up?

pull that ring,

You know, the yin and yang.

Mm. The ground beef has got
fantastic texture.

great bun choice.

The pickle is
definitely needed.

The fact that they can make

out of that little kitchen
is pretty impressive.

Not counting the patio,
the whole building

You're going to open a funky

Absolutely.

527
00:18:34,586 --> 00:18:35,853
Did you guys make ramen at home
when you were a kid?

528
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:37,420
‐We made ramen by hand.
‐Really?

529
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,953

‐AP flour.
‐"All‐purpose."

Water, liquid smoke.

533
00:18:43,453 --> 00:18:46,120
‐In the noodles?
‐Gives it a little smokiness.

534
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,920
Potassium
carbonated water.

535
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,320
Oh, that's what
I thought it was.

536
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,053
Gives it a little
carbonation.

Pinch of salt,
add more water.

538
00:18:53,286 --> 00:18:55,020
‐To get the right consistency.
‐Correct.

you're going to just go
walk down and say,

"Hey, by the way you taking

544

yourself?

‐Roasted chicken bones.

‐Carrot. Ginger.

Tamari.
Bonito fish flakes.

551
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,493
So this is going to cook down
for how long now?

552

Hour and a half.

00:19:24,926 --> 00:19:26,793
And that's the foundation
of the ramen broth.

554
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:28,726
‐Correct.
‐Okay, drop the noodle,

555
00:19:28,726 --> 00:19:30,593
then we'll put it together.
‐Okay.
