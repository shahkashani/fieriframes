00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,401
         Hey, everybody.        
         I'm Guy Fieri.         

2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:04,336
 And we're rolling out, looking 
 for America's greatest diners, 

3
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:05,737
      drive-ins, and dives.

00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:06,605
         [music playing]        

5
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:09,274
This trip-- wow, how you doin'--

6
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:12,210
      it's hearty helpings      
       and an unhinged jaw      

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,078
     to be able to eat this.    

8
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:14,680
    It'll stick to your ribs.   

9
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:17,349
  I have no clue exactly where  
    this is going to end up.    

10
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:21,019
 We've got off-the-chain chops, 
  and mega-meatloaf in Alaska.  

11
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:24,890
  When you go up to Fairbanks,  
  this is a place to check out. 

12
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,225
     A clean take on comfort    
        in South Dakota--       

13
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:28,093
            It good.            

14
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:28,894
              Yeah.             

15
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:30,029
          Make yum now.         

16
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:31,896
  And in Moorhead, Minnesota--  

17
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:35,567
      dude, outstanding-- a     
    Midwest global mash-up--    

18
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,102
    this is a monster meal--    

19
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,904
  with a fried chicken chaser.  

20
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:41,372
 That is super crunch-a-taceous.

21
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:44,043
     That's all right here,     
     right now, on "Diners,     

22
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:45,643

24
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,991
     Triple D hanging out in    
   Sioux Falls, South Dakota,   

25
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,127
     with the one-and-only,     
       Chef Justin Warner.      

26
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,329
       Now Justin, you are      
    from around these parts.    

27
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:05,731
      Tell me what kind of      
       food can we expect?      

28
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,333
      Ah, you know, pizza,      
    burgers, mac and cheese--   

29
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,667
       All-American stuff.      
            - Great.            

30
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:11,470
   So if I tell you I'm going   
  to take you to a joint that's 

31
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:13,138
        doing all of that       
        food, but they're       

32
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:15,941
    doing it locally-sourced,   
  organic, a lot of the options 

33
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,143
    are vegan, and it's just    
     all about clean eating,    

34
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:19,544
      what would you think?     
     - What, in Sioux Falls?    

35
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,746
         That's awesome.        
          - Fantastic.

         [music playing]        

38
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,218
        Bison burger up.        

39
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,420
       This place is about      
        good, clean food.       

40
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:29,955
          Spaghetti and         
      meatballs, order up.      

41
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:32,624
    All the staples, but with   
   those healthy ingredients.   

42
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,426
        GUY FIERI: Which        
        was a recipe that       

43
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,762
    cooked up big changes for   
  chef and owner, Shaley Bolks. 

44
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:40,765
 I lost 160 pounds in one year. 

45
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,968
     Just from clean eating     
  and taking care of yourself?  

46
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,904
    I basically taught myself   
  how to eat, how to exercise.  

47
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:48,239
      I didn't just want to     
      be skinny on salads.      

48
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,374
       I wanted to, like--      

49
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,308
         Eat real food.         

50
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,376
      Eat real food, yeah.      

51
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,378
      So I wanted to bring      
      that to Sioux Falls.      

52
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,247
      I have the Mightiest      
          Mac for you.          

53
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:58,450
       Mightiest Mac is a       
  grain-free, gluten-free item. 

54
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,718
   The noodles are chickpeas.   

55
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,854
    It's so good with, like,    
   the creamy mac and cheese,   

56
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:05,057
   the buffalo meatballs, and   
   then the spicy chimichurri   

57
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,391
          sauce on top.         

58
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,460
    The number one seller is    
 definitely the bison meatballs.

59
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,862
       Ground bison, lean       
        and very healthy.       

60
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:13,064
      We throw some turkey      
     in it to moisten it up.    

61
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,866
 And I'm sneaking some kale in. 

62
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:15,801
     Don't have to sneak it.    

63
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:16,602
           Red onion.           

64
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:17,468
         Is that nooch?         

65
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:18,269
              Yes.              

66
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,604
          What's nooch?         

67
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,006
    Saccharomyces cerevisiae,   
 the same stuff that makes beer.

68
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:21,873
               Oh!              

69
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,275
 "Sacramenative simenyvichmeh." 

70
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,344
   This is nutritional yeast.   

71
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,478
      Awesome to work with.     

72
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,747
     Gluten-free oat flour,     
      some scrambled eggs.      

73
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:29,815
      They're super orange.     

74
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,551
       Minced garlic, red       
     pepper flakes, oregano.    

75
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:33,685
            Love it.            

76
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,621
         Fennel seed and        
       a little salt. Roll      

77
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,489
           it up into           
   ounce-and-a-half meatballs.  

78
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:38,890
             Got it.            

79
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:42,494
    Roast them in the oven at   
   425 degrees for 15 minutes.  

80
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:43,295
            Next up.            

81
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:44,229
        The chimichurri.        

82
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:45,496
       Some lemon juice--       

83
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:46,431
           Some, huh?           

84
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,432
          Avocado oil.          

85
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,567
     I like the avocado oil.    

86
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,235
        I saw a poster in       
      the lobby that talks      

87
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,436
      about all the things      
         that are local         

88
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,571
       and all the things       
        that are organic.       

89
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,439
   It is a billboard this big.  

90
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:57,309
         Fresh parsley,         
       cilantro, oregano.       

91
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,510
        Are you serious,        
      that much red pepper?     

92
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:01,847
      We like it spicy and      
      we like it garlicky.      

93
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,248
     Is it to remove paint?     

94
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:05,450
       Chop it down, maybe      
       a couple of pulses.      

95
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:07,919
              Wow!              

96
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:09,054
      That'll wake you up.      

97
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:09,921
         How you doin'!         

98
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:11,256
              Woo!              

99
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:14,593
    All right, we are making    
  the roux for our Mighty Mac-- 

100
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,862
     butternut squash, some     
  whole milk, vegetable broth.  

101
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:19,598
You can't do mac without butter.

102
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,466
     Salt, dash of nutmeg--     

103
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,068
  Nutmeg with dairy-- classic.  

104
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,271
  We stew it down for 15 to 20  
 minutes just to kind of get it 

105
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,606
      a little bit thicker.     

106
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,941
      As we continue on the     
 journey, I have no clue exactly

107
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:30,876
 where this is going to end up. 

108
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,877
   Throw it in the processor.   

109
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,413
   Heat it up pretty lightly.   

110
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:36,415
        And then we throw       
       our cheddar cheese.      

111
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,084
 And we melt it down so that it 
  turns into a nice, thick goo. 

112
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,485
       And chickpea pasta.      

113
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:41,819
     Keeping it gluten-free.    

114
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:42,954
        These are great.        

115
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:43,888
     Mix this all together.     

116
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,023
    See the texture on that?    

117
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,825
        A nice little bed       
       for our meatballs.       

118
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,493
      Picking out the best      
       three just for you.      

119
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,629
   Now the chimichurri 9,000.   

120
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:51,630
       Stay on your side.       

121
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:52,430
           I promise.           

122
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,566
         [music playing]        

123
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:58,503
     What you are referring     
        to as chimichurri       

124
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,173
      is the most [thwack]      
   chimichurri I've ever had.   

125
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:07,179
      But in this dish, the     
 richness of that squash cheese 

126
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,847
 sauce and the meatball cuts it.

127
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,650
        I mean, it is the       
     perfect [thwack] hi-ya.    

128
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,452
    Yeah, these three things,   
      I feel like their sum     

129
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,321
      is greater than their     
        individual parts.       

130
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,255
       And it's delicious.      

131
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,156
            It good.            

132
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:18,990
              Yeah.             

133
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:19,991
          Make yum now.         

134
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,727
     Two Mightiest Macs, up.    

135
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:25,130
         Every bite was         
      really, really good.      

136
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,398
         And you'd never        
      know all the veggies      

137
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:27,332
    that are hidden in there.   

138
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,867
          Scoop of the          
     Moroccan chicken salad.    

139
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,536
   There's some kind of stigma  
 if you go to a place like this.

140
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,138
       It's just going to       
      be really expensive.      

141
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:34,005
    You're only eating salad.   

142
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,006
 You're not going to feel full. 

143
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,875
      Where this, I think,      
        breaks that mold.       

144
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,409
        So a big thing is       
       the accessibility.       

145
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,545
        It makes it very        
   approachable for everybody.  

146
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:42,414
         Anything on the        
        menu is awesome.        

147
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:43,882
          Jeb's No Bull         
        Burger, order up.       

148
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,950
       If you didn't know       
     it was a vegan burger,     

149
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,753
      you probably wouldn't     
    have been able to guess.    

150
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,088
  The spice in it-- incredible. 

151
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,423
     What's on the menu now?    

152
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:54,092
      Jeb's No Bull Burger,     
       named after one of       

153
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,560
  the original founding owners. 

154
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,561
         [music playing]        

155
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:58,830
         Some olive oil,        
      garlic, green olive.      

156
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,598
        I like the little       
       kick of the olives.      

157
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,168
      Jalapeno, artichoke,      
     mushrooms, red onion--     

158
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,570
       And some red bells.      

159
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,639
       Let it go till the       
      vegetables are soft.      

160
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:11,976
      Add gluten-free oats,     
  garbanzo beans, black beans.  

161
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:13,511
        Flax seed blended       
       up with some water,      

162
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,046
     and then we refrigerate    
      it for a little bit--     

163
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:16,181
  makes it a little gelatinous. 

164
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,983
    A vegan Worcestershire--    
      shire--shire--shire--     

165
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,184
      Worcestershire sauce      
     without the fish in it.    

166
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,186
       A little more flax.      

167
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:21,987
         Just the flax--        

168
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:22,854
       Just the flax, man.      

169
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,188
             Ha ha!             

170
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:27,859
  Oat flour, red pepper flakes, 
    salt, dried sage, cumin.    

171
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:28,660
             Great.             

172
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,728
          Celery salt.          

173
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:30,995
          Kitchen sink.         

174
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:35,000
    Cayenne, smoked paprika,    
     black pepper, oregano.     

175
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:35,801
          Patty 'em up.         

176
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,001
     Make it into a burger.     

177
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,337
    We are going to make our    
    vegan mayo coconut milk.    

178
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,605
             Thick.             

179
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:44,876
   Mustard powder, apple cider  
    vinegar, garlic granules,   

180
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,679
        salt. Slowly add        
        the avocado oil.        

181
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,281
          Take this now         
       and combine it with      

182
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,283
  the sriracha, yellow mustard. 

183
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:55,553
     Slather it on our bun,     
     and toast the bun off.     

184
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:56,488
          Some greens.          

185
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:57,889
 Set our burger on top of that. 

186
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:01,426
  Tomato, onion, pickles, and-- 

187
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:04,228
         [music playing]        

188
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:05,097
               Mm.              

189
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,499
 It's a good veggie patty, man. 

190
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,501
       And the bun itself       
         is outstanding.        

191
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,837
      Cooking the mayo onto     
    the bun adds another one    

192
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,104
    of those textural points.   

193
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:15,706
         It, like, makes        
      the burger eat in 3D.     

194
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:18,042
        The olive, which        
     actually contains fat,     

195
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,712
    that's what really sells    
   it and makes it craveable.   

196
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,848
       As soon as you put       
      all the accoutrements     

197
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,449
         of the pickles,        
       onions, and tomato,      

198
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,517
        you start to sing       
       the song of burger.      

199
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,186
         It's delicious.        

200
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,988
     Can I have another one?    

201
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,856
        I have the Jeb's        
         No Bull Burger.        

202
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,858
       Unbelievably juicy.      

203
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,593
       More flavor than a       
      regular beef burger.      

204
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,062
        Moroccan chicken        
        salad, order up.        

205
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,930
    I think Daily just really   
   knocked it out of the park.  

206
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,999
       You taking control       
          of your life,         

207
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,801
        and then you take       
      that same philosophy      

208
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,335
         and apply that         
       into a restaurant,       

209
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:45,737
 can be nothing but successful. 

210
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:46,671
           Well done.           

211
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,206
       You've got to come       
         meet this girl.        

212
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,508
      She'll change the way     
       you look at things.      

213
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,878
 Up next in Fairbanks, Alaska-- 

214
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:54,946
    make it happen, captain--   

215
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:57,148
their dishes may sound familiar.

216
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,017
    This is definitely a pork   
    chop I would order again.   

217
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,084
    But what they're adding--   

218
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:01,820
  22 ingredients so far, folks. 

219
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,890
 Everybody keeping up at home-- 
 takes it to a whole new world. 

220
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:06,458
      You got your own jam      
    band going on right here.   

221
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:10,195
         [music playing]        

222
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,032
     So I'm here in downtown    
       Fairbanks, Alaska,       

223
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,300
    right on the Chena River.   

224
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:17,102
      And I gotta tell ya,      
    this is just about where    

225
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,570
   Fairbanks was established.   

226
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,839
     You gotta look it up--     
    so much awesome history.    

227
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,373
        Anyhow, speaking        
       of history, there's      

228
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,442
     two local restaurateurs    
     who are doing business     

229
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:25,843
  in this town for a long time. 

230
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,312
         And then a big         
      hotel chain came in.      

231
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,581
    And they said, we want to   
   open up a restaurant inside  

232
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,516
       of our hotel that's      
      got that local flair,     

233
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,117
 that local attitude and energy.

234
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:34,519
   Well, it actually happened.  

235
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:35,787
    This is Lavelle's Bistro.   

236
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,923
         [music playing]        

237
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,857
         I got a lobster        
       cake kickin' fast.       

238
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,060
         Lavelle's is a         
     treasure in Fairbanks.     

239
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,062
 Potato-crusted sockeye salmon. 

240
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,196
    What makes it so special?   

241
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,731
      Just the atmosphere.      

242
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,066
   Everything's from scratch.   

243
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,600
   It's family-owned and run.   

244
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:53,070
 GUY FIERI: By Kathy Lavelle and
 Frank Eagle, who opened up shop

245
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:56,207
        inside a hotel in       
        2001, then teamed       

246
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,809
 up with Chef Cleveland Kenney. 

247
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,744
       We had been in the       
      restaurant business.      

248
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,745
    Then we started catering.   

249
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:01,947
    People started coming in.   

250
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,481
      It was turning into a     
    little pop-up restaurant,   

251
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:05,217
   and that attracted somebody  
      from the hotel group?     

252
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:06,351
     KATHY LAVELLE: Exactly.    
      FRANK EAGLE: Exactly.     

253
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,685
          What kind of          
       food are we doing?       

254
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,487
         It's more of a         
      French dining place,      

255
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:12,290
 but pineapple to the Big Apple,
  that's how I like to see it.  

256
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,825
          Firing three          
      lollipop pork chops.      

257
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:16,161
     This is the first time     
    I've had this pork chop.    

258
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:17,295
        It's really good.       

259
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,764
       It's always just a       
     beautiful presentation.    

260
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,233
     First dish, we're going    
   to do a lollipop pork chop.  

261
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,969
    We're going to start off    
     with making the brine.     

262
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,036
      I add my water first.     

263
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:26,837
        Now, when you say       
       lollipop pork chop,      

264
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,506
       it's because you're      
      pulling all the meat      

265
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:29,373
    off the bone of the chop.   

266
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:30,508
            Yes, sir.           

267
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,111
     Orange peel, salt, bay     
      leaves, brown sugar,      

268
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,846
 coriander, peppercorn mélange. 

269
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,114
       Can you spell that?      

270
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:36,915
             Mélan--            

271
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,182
          M-E-L-lange--         

272
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:39,384
     That's how I spell it.     

273
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,318
    That's how you spell it?    

274
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,720
     That's how I spell it.     

275
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,521
  Get ice to it, let it chill,  
 and then we'll brine the chops.

276
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:44,322
            Yes, sir.           

277
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,256
   Let me see these beauties.   

278
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,591
        All of our meats        
         come in fresh.         

279
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,393
       Which is a big deal      
     all the way in Alaska.     

280
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:50,328
    So they come in trimmed,    
       boom, ready to go.       

281
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,797
     You're not sitting here    
   with a little paring knife   

282
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:53,598
      skinning back those--     

283
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:54,532
      No, I don't got time.     

284
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:55,333
      We put thyme in here?     

285
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,736
       [drum roll, cymbal]      

286
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,004
      How long are we going     
       to brine the chops?      

287
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,672
           - Two days.          
 - What's going with the chops? 

288
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:04,275
      Horseradish, apricot      
     marmalade, oil, garlic,    

289
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,743
   deglaze it with triple sec.  

290
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,145
         A little orange        
        liqueur, got it.        

291
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,015
   Horseradish, Dijon mustard,  
    brown sugar, apricot jam.   

292
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,550
    Apricot, not "aypricot."    

293
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,152
   Apricot, that's what I say.  

294
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,086
         I say apricot.         

295
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,421
     I don't say "aypricot."    

296
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,823
   Stir it up and let it steep  
   for about 10 to 12 minutes.  

297
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,225
   - Make it happen, captain.   
          - All right.          

298
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,225
          Oil my pan--          

299
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:22,694
        GUY FIERI: Black        
      pepper, kosher salt.      

300
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,763
         It has a lot of        
       salt in it already.      

301
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,097
  We don't want to oversalt it. 

302
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,432
        So it's just like       
      (high-pitched) oo oo.     

303
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,367
       That's the noise of      
       it doing its thing.      

304
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,102
     Sear one side, flip it.    

305
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,837
        Put a little cube       
       of butter on there.      

306
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,439
    Into the oven at 450 for    
      six to eight minutes.     

307
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:36,641
       When it comes out--      

308
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,110
          We put fresh          
       brie cheese on top.      

309
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,311
       Let this melt down.      

310
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:42,513
       Mashed potatoes on       
       the plate, like so.      

311
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,582
       Lollipop pork chop       
      with the melted brie.     

312
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,051
   Put our marm down on there.  

313
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,385
       What's the zucchini      
      being finished with?      

314
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:48,519
      Just salt and pepper.     

315
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:49,588
          There we go.          

316
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,389
     Well, any time you put     
      the brie on anything,     

317
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,323
         I'm good to go.        

318
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,659
         [music playing]        

319
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:55,860
      Cleveland, I'll tell      
        you what, buddy.        

320
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:58,329
     I don't typically order    
   pork chops in restaurants.   

321
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:00,198
         One of the main        
       reasons is, I don't      

322
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,465
  think people cook them right. 

323
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:04,802
  The pork chop, in particular, 
     the way we raise pork,     

324
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:06,804
 it needs fat, it needs flavor. 

325
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,872
      The brine is perfect.     

326
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,407
      So there's flavor all     
      the way through this.     

327
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,142
        You get into that       
      salt and that sweet,      

328
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,478
    and you counterbalance it   
    with the funk of the brie   

329
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,480
       and the tang of the      
    horseradish and the tang    

330
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,815
      of the Dijon mustard.     

331
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,884
      That marmalade's just     
       packed with flavor.      

332
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,022
  And the mashed potato is the  
  definition of mashed potato.  

333
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,357
     I mean, it's delicious.    

334
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,092
       It's balanced, this      
      is definitely a pork      

335
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,226
    chop I would order again.   

336
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,428
          Lollipop pork         
       chop up top, ready.      

337
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,896
   The pork chop is wonderful.  

338
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:34,032
       Nice glaze on top.       

339
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,233
        Very tender pork.       

340
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,168
   Restaurants like Lavelle's,  
    are there a lot of them?    

341
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:38,369
               No.              

342
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:40,972
     For special occasions,     
     this is where we come.     

343
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,441
  Kathy and Frank, they've got  
  an amazing collection of wine 

344
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,110
      that they've gathered     
    from all over the world.    

345
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,111
        The selection is        
        the best in town.       

346
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,448
But a glass of milk is what they
  recommend with the meatloaf.  

347
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,117
  And it is delicious with it.  

348
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,585
          What else you         
       got up your sleeve?      

349
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:54,919
     25-ingredient meatloaf.    

350
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,587
         Not 24, not 26.        

351
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:57,521
             Not 23.            

352
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,724
         The meatloaf is        
       delicious, hearty,       

353
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,792
  and it's a wonderful meal to  
 warm up with in the wintertime 

354
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:02,593
          in Fairbanks.         

355
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:03,861
    You go grab the meatloaf.   

356
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,129
               25.              

357
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,632
     And I'll be counting it    
   all down when we come back.

         [music playing]        

359
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,302
       Hey, Cleveland, why      
    did she get three pieces    

360
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,104
 of meatloaf and I only got two?

361
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,105
         She's special.         

362
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:14,906
         OK, good talk.         

363
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:15,674
         Thanks, buddy.

     Triple D is chillin' at    
     Lavelle's Bistro, which    

365
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,247
   has served up scratch-made,  
  elevated comfort to the folks 

366
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,949
   here in Fairbanks, Alaska.   

367
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,452
          It gets to 50         
      below here sometimes,     

368
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:30,187
        so having really        
       wholesome food just      

369
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,656
        makes you feel a        
        whole lot better        

370
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,458
       about being in the       
       cold and the dark.       

371

  About to flame up over here.  

372
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,061
         Watch yourself.

00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,129
  This is where you want to go  
 on a Friday or Saturday night. 

374
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,396
         Or every night.        
        - Or every night.       

375
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:40,465
     I was going to say, if     
      they've got meatloaf      

376
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,533
 on the menu, then every night. 

377
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,201
        Three meatloaves,       
         coming at you.         

378
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,436
        The 25-ingredient       
      meatloaf is the best      

379
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,738
    meatloaf you've ever had.   

380
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:47,872
        So many flavors.        

381
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,007
   It's got vegetables in it.   

382
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,075
       And the demi-glace       
       sauce tops it off.       

383
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,677
   So 25-ingredient meatloaf.   

384
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:53,878
            Yes, sir.           

385
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,879
      First, we're going to     
      sweat the vegetables.     

386
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,747
      One-- one ingredient.     

387
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,215
       That's hamachi oil.      

388
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,083
             Onions.            

389
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:00,818
  Two ingredients, heh heh heh. 

390
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:01,619
             Celery.            

391
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:02,954
             Three.             

392
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:06,558
  Carrots, red peppers, yellow  
    peppers, orange peppers,    

393
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,759
      garlic, green onion.      

394
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,960
   All right, so 9 of the 25.   

395
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,229
         Next step is--         

396
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,965
      The wet mix, starting     
   with cumin, cayenne, thyme,  

397
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,901
      white pepper, garlic,     
      sugar, black pepper,      

398
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:22,040
 salt, paprika, cilantro, whole 
  eggs, ketchup, half-and-half. 

399
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,707
  22 ingredients so far, folks. 

400
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:24,775
  Everybody keeping up at home? 

401
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,111
       Now we're going to       
       make our meatloaf.       

402
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,980
   We're going to add Italian   
 sausage, certified Angus beef, 

403
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,181
          sweated veg.          

404
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,649
       Now we're going to       
        add our wet mix.        

405
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:32,650
             Panko.             
          [ding, ding]          

406
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:34,119
          Now, are you          
       free-forming this,       

407
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,453
   or are we going into pans?   

408
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,454
      I'm free-forming it.      

409
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,122
  I got to beat this thing up.  

410
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,591
     You want to get all the    
     air pockets out of it.     

411
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,325
         Cover with foil        
        in the oven, 350.       

412
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,126
            How long?           

413
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,595
        18 to 22 minutes.       

414
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,530
     And then we're going to    
   remove that aluminum foil.   

415
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:46,964
     And we're going to let     
      it sit-in there again     

416
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,466
  for another 12 minutes or so. 

417
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:49,733
        What do we serve        
         with this dish?        

418
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,668
   We're making a demi-glace.   

419
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:52,003
     Let's start with that.     

420
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,004
 We're making a veal stock with 
  these dinosaur bones in here. 

421
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,939
           I like it.           
        The veal bones--        

422
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:55,940
          - Absolutely.         
            - Got it.           

423
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,942
         Carrot, celery,        
       and onion mix here.      

424
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,243
 Kind of just dump it on there. 

425
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,078
           Here we go.          

426
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,878
       I'm ready for you.       

427
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:01,946
          In the oven--         

428
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,147
        Hour 15 minutes.        

429
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,482
   When you get into something  
      like the demi-glace,      

430
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,552
      to make it yourself,      
      the flavor difference     

431
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:08,419
     is just unquestionable.    

432
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:09,354
          Astronomical.         

433
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,022
          So go in with         
        some water first.       

434
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,623
       Peppercorn, thyme,       
        and my bay leaf.        

435
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:13,691
             Got it.            

436
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,360
        I want to dilute        
       this tomato paste.       

437
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,695
   This is when the splash is   
    going to start happening.   

438
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:18,496
          And lastly--          

439
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:19,497
           The bones.           

440
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,132
       Boil for six hours.      

441
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:22,634
        Final step, Chef.       

442
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,235
 This is reduced significantly. 

443
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,038
  So now I'm going to actually  
  add a demi-glace base to it.  

444
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,439
  - You're going to fortify it. 
      - Fortify it, right.      

445
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:29,240
            I gotcha.           

446
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,775
    So our meatloaf is done.    

447
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:33,444
     Plate mashed potatoes,     
      loaves right on top,      

448
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:34,512
      sides of vegetables.      

449
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:35,580
  GUY FIERI: A splash of demi-- 

450
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:36,581
    And it's ready to serve.    

451
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:39,250
         [music playing]        

452
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:41,252
          Cleveland, on         
        Triple D, I think       

453
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:45,789
     one of the things that     
      people expect to see      

454
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,058
    are dishes like meatloaf.   

455
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,193
    For something so simple,    
      there's a lot of ways     

456
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:50,795
        that people could       
        take wrong turns.       

457
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:56,066
       What you have here       
        is a very tender,       

458
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,469
         well-seasoned,         
       fortified meatloaf.      

459
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,872
 I love the Italian sausage and 
 the ground beef going together.

460
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,207
    I could see the veggies.    

461
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,342
      They've been sweated      
      down enough, but not      

462
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:05,610
  too much that they disappear. 

463
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,478
        You've got a good       
       ratio of nice crust      

464
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:11,282
      on the outside of the     
   meatloaf to juicy interior   

465
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,616
        of the meatloaf.        

466
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,887
   When you're going to say we  
  make 25-Ingredient Meatloaf,  

467
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,554
       it really better be      
       one of those dishes      

468
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:20,291
   that people say, hey, when   
     you go up to Fairbanks,    

469
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,359
  this is a place to check out. 

470
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,427
            - Sweet.            
          - Well done.          

471
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:23,494
           Thank you.           

472
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:24,895
    Two meatloaves, table 22.   

473
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:25,696
            Let's go.           

474
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:26,630
           Delicious.           

475
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,299
  Nice texture, great flavors.  

476
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:29,968
        The demi-glace is       
       icing on the cake.       

477
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,436
     And the mashed potatoes    
      are nice and creamy.      

478
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:32,837
         Wait a second,         
     there's cake in there?     

479
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,039
         Banana wontons         
      with créme anglaise.

       for about 20 years,      

481
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,644
    and they are very good at   
 making everybody feel welcome. 

482
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:41,179
   I love all your enthusiasm.  

483
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,447
        You love cooking.       

484
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:43,580
      You got your own jam      
    band going on right here.   

485
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:44,148
          - Thank you.          
       - Good job, buddy.       

486

      Midwestern bipimbop--     

489
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,327
   double it down on flavor--   

490
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:57,461
         chicken-fried,         
      chicken-fried-fried,      

491
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:58,263
     chicken-fried sandwich.

00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,274
    I have been to just about   
   every state in the country.  

496
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,676
    And finally, today, I hit   
    it here in North Dakota.    

497
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,143
           Uh, sorry.           

498
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,946
 I don't mean to interrupt, but 
  you're actually in Minnesota. 

499
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,280
       - I'm in Minnesota?      
           - You are.           

500
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,615
         Wait a second,         
      where's North Dakota?     

501
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,016
         Um, you'll just        
         go a little bit        

502
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,018
 more down the way and you'll-- 
   you'll be in North Dakota.   

503
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:21,819
              Aww.              

504
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,753
       You almost made it.      

505
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:23,888
   You missed it by that much.  

506
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:25,222
          By that much.         

507
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:28,092
I'm here in Moorhead, Minnesota,
   to check out a joint where   

508
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,828
        the chef is doing       
  farm-to-table, Midwest style, 

509
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,762
     like you've never seen.    

510
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,163
    This is Sol Ave. Kitchen.   

511
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,898
         [music playing]        

512
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,234
     Platin' up two Cubanos.    

513
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:39,504
 Sol Ave. Is global street food 
 with a Midwest interpretation. 

514
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:40,838
        Potatoes Bravas.        

515
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:43,508
    What they brought to the    
 community is not your standard,

516
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,375
     run-of-the-mill stuff.     

517
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,643
           Put out by           
     not-your-average cook.     

518
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,446
     Ryan Nitschke snagged a    
     James Beard nomination     

519
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:52,984
 for Best Midwestern Chef before
 pairing up with co-owner, Nikki

520
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,719
  Berglund, to open this spot.  

521
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:55,853
   Where'd you learn to cook?   

522
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:56,920
 Tech program here in Moorhead. 

523
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,456
        This is, like, a        
       grassroots program.      

524
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,257
         Yeah, big-time.        

525
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,258
         I dig it, man.         

526
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,795
         He's just got a        
     great way with flavors     

527
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,330
 and putting unique combinations
   together, like a bibimbap,   

528
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,131
      but a Midwest style.      

529
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,266
       Plating bipimbaps.       

530
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,800
    The bibimbap is amazing.    

531
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,270
   They're using pickles with   
 mushrooms, with the pork belly.

532
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:15,139
  Every single bite just keeps  
   getting better and better.   

533
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,007
       What are we making?      

534
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,141
        Midwest Bibimbap.       

535
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,477
       Come down here for       
    the Midwestern bibimbap.    

536
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,879
       We're going to cure      
       up some pork belly.      

537
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,749
    Salt, brown sugar, black    
     pepper, smoked paprika,    

538
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,884
  guajillo, ancho, bay leaves.  

539
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,085
  GUY FIERI: Put a rub on this. 

540
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:28,952
         RYAN NITSCHKE:         
       We're going to let       

541
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:29,954
 this sit overnight to cure up. 

542
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:30,955
    GUY FIERI: Into the oven.   

543
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,423
       RYAN NITSCHKE: 275,      
      for about four hours.     

544
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:33,257
            Next up?            

545
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,492
        - Ssamjang sauce.       
           - Ssamjang?          

546
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:35,560
              Yep.              

547
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:37,161
         Kind of like a         
     variation on gochujang.    

548
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,563
      We're going to start      
       with the gochujang.      

549
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,364
         Toasted sesame         
       seeds, some honey,       

550
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:43,434
   sesame oil, garlic, ginger.  

551
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,835
        That's some jang.       

552
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,703
    That's what the gochujang   
    has needed all its life.    

553
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,306
    RYAN NITSCHKE: Now we're    
    going to do our pickles--   

554
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,908
      white vinegar, water,     
   sugar, black peppercorns--   

555
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,909
    GUY FIERI: And bay leaf.    

556
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,444
     Let that sit there and     
       steep a little bit.      

557
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,513
 RYAN NITSCHKE: Once it's cool, 
 add it to the sliced cucumbers 

558
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:56,447
           and onion.           

559
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:57,648
        How long is this        
        going to pickle?        

560
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,249
    RYAN NITSCHKE: Overnight,   
       and ready to rock.       

561
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:00,184
     What's the final step?     

562
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,119
  Gonna slice up a pork belly.  

563
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,189
   Sear it off on the flat top  
  with the clamshell mushrooms. 

564
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:08,125
  Rice in the bowl, throw some  
    of the ssamjang, pickles,   

565
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,128
  radish, mushrooms over here.  

566
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,529
       Pretty generous on       
      the pork there, pal.      

567
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:12,330
           Heck yeah.           

568
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,197
        You need to eat.        

569
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:14,565
        The microgreens.        

570
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:17,068
  GUY FIERI: And then last but  
 not least, look at those gems. 

571
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,202
So what's the story on the eggs?

572
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,604
         RYAN NITSCHKE:         
       We're going to add       

573
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:23,207
    soy, water, mirin, sesame   
  oil, maple, garlic, chilies.  

574
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,142
       And then pour over       
      our soft-boiled eggs.     

575
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:26,677
       That's a nice umami      
         bomb in there.         

576
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:27,745
   But you're holding my egg.   

577
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:28,546
       I appreciate that.       

578
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:31,149
         [music playing]        

579
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,751
    Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.    

580
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,086
       Did you want me to       
        comment on this?        

581
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:35,953
             Right.             

582
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:37,822
 The ingredients are delicious. 

583
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,695
      The fresh pickle, the     
 treatment of this pork belly-- 

584
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:47,498
     perfect amount of sear     
     and crunch and render--    

585
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,567
       your ssamjang, bro.      

586
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:50,635
A little pepper from the radish.

587
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,703
        A little clean-up       
       from the cucumber.       

588
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,038
        Umami mushrooms.        

589
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,906
     This is a monster meal.    

590
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,241
               Mm.              

591
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,709
    Pork belly bibimbap, up.    

592
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,845
       The ssamjang sauce       
        is kind of spicy,       

593
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,380
     but those pickles help     
       break up the heat.       

594
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,915
      The pork belly, it's      
       crispy on the top,       

595
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,518
   but then it has that really  
     juicy layer underneath.    

596
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,654
        It's hard to kind       
     of load your chopstick     

597
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:12,389
 up enough with all the pieces, 
   which is what I want to do.  

598
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,591
           Hummus, up.          

599
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,460
      Chef Ryan works very      
 closely with the local farmers 

600
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,462
      on bringing in fresh      
 ingredients that are seasonal. 

601
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,263
      People have gotta be      
     flipping out for this.     

602
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,197
         Yeah, exactly.         

603
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,799
 They offer this little escape. 

604
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:23,267
         Getting new and        
       interesting things.      

605
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:26,003
     Things like kimchi on a    
 double-fried chicken sandwich. 

606
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,271
    Dropping chicken sammies.   

607
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,606
      This is absolutely my     
     favorite fried chicken     

608
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:30,741
     sandwich I've ever had.    

609
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:31,542
          It's massive.         

610
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,210
  I think I used four napkins.  

611
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,545
       We're going to make      
       the chicken-fried,       

612
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:36,013
      chicken-fried-fried,      
     chicken-fried sandwich.    

613
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:37,548
      I'm going to make the     
      batter to go on them.     

614
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,416
    Boneless chicken thighs--   

615
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:39,217
           Calm down.           

616
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:40,084
       What's the batter?       

617
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,485
         [music playing]        

618
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,354
         Start out with         
       an egg, buttermilk,      

619
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,023
 flour, pepper, salt, hot sauce.

620
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,158
          It's going to         
       marinate overnight.      

621
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:48,158
             Dig it.            

622
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,493
         And we're going        
      to make our dredge--      

623
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:52,229
       flour, salt, black       
      pepper, white pepper,     

624
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,899
         cayenne, smoked        
     paprika, onion powder,     

625
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,433
  garlic powder, baking powder. 

626
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,237
           Out of the           
      marinated buttermilk      

627
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:00,704
      batter, into the dry.     

628
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,574
    Drop it in the fryer for    
 the first time at 300 degrees. 

629
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,975
  Bring it up and let it rest.  

630
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:07,044
   And then we're going to fry  
 it again to finish the cooking 

631
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,112
          and make it a         
      little more crunchy.      

632
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,713
      All right, what else      
       is going with this?      

633
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:10,714
         We're going to         
       do some lime aioli.      

634
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,983
             Hit it.            

635
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:15,319
      Mayo, lime juice and      
  zest, roasted garlic, sugar,  

636
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,387
 white pepper, salt, and blend. 

637
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:18,855
   - Let's build the sandwich?  
             - Yeah.            

638
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:19,923
     GUY FIERI: Toasted bun.    

639
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,058
       RYAN NITSCHKE: Lime      
      aioli on the bottom.      

640
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,925
        Kimchi on there.        

641
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:22,726
        That's generous.        

642
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:23,528
       Place our chicken.       

643
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,861
         Well, somebody         
        evidently didn't        

644
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:25,863
  make the bun the right size.  

645
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,131
       Get some ssamjang.       

646
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,800
    Boy, you are not light on   
   the portions of the sauces.  

647
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,202
    It's all about the sauce.   

648
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:34,605
 House pickles, and an unhinged 
   jaw to be able to eat this.  

649
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,406
           Here we go.          

650
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,209
         [music playing]        

651
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,879
     My friend, that is some    
    excellent fried chicken.    

652
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:44,382
 That is super crunch-a-taceous.

653
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,019
     I have a chicken joint     
       called Chicken Guy.      

654
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,556
         And I say that         
       sauce is the boss.       

655
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:57,895
    When I watched you put on   
  all that ssamjang, I'm like,  

656
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,563
        just call it the        
       ssamjang sandwich.       

657
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,700
   But it's this balance that   
     goes on between the fat    

658
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,903
     of that lime aioli with    
     the acid of the pickle.    

659
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,172
         And it's, like,        
      clashing right there      

660
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,107
      in the middle of the      
   chicken sandwich, ba-boom.   

661
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:11,642
       Dude, outstanding.       

662
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,110
          Double-fried          
      chicken sandwich, up.     

663
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:16,314
        The cilantro lime       
      aioli is to die for.      

664
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,115
        And then a hit of       
     spice from the kimchi.     

665
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:20,451
  The chicken is just so juicy. 

666
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,520
     The breading adds this     
       nice crunch to it.       

667
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,854
   He's not lying, by the way.  

668
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:24,922
     Dressing up dumplings.     

669
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,791
     You can't find anything    
      like it in this area.     

670
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,459
      Everything just pairs     
    so beautifully together.    

671
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:30,928
      It really makes your      
   palate go on an experience.  

672
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,931
    You have two dishes with    
  the pickles and the ssamjang, 

673
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,165
    yet they're worlds apart.   

674
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:35,933
          Outstanding.          
          - Thank you.          

675
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:36,734
               OK.              

676
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,002
            12 to go.           

677
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,537
   So that's it for this trip.  

678
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,872
        But don't worry.        

679
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,341
  There's plenty more Triple D  
  joints all over the country.  

680
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,677
     I'll be looking for you    
      next week on "Diners,     

681
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:47,744
      Drive-Ins and Dives."

         [music playing]        

683
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,748
   And you got to really calm   
 down on having a bad attitude, 

684
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,282
      because this negative     
         energy of yours        

685
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:55,152
   and not smiling or-- whoa,   
    aren't you the chameleon.   

686
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:56,220
         Uh, not at all.        

687
