1
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:02,334
         Hey, everybody!        

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:03,802
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:06,605
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:07,939
          This trip...          

5
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,607
 Get ready. Get your jaws going.
                  It's on.      

6
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:12,277
        ...it's the spicy       
      New Mexican combo...      

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,213
              All of your mouth 
                 lights up.     

8
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:16,215
   ...of sandwiches and stew.   

9
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:17,615
           It's kind of oddball.
                   I know.      

10
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:18,550
        Yes.                    

11
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:20,619
     In sunny Albuquerque...    

12
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,354
    My mouth is already starting
                  to water.     

13
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,090
       ...the seven-table       
       warehouse spot...        

14
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,225
When I say funky joint,         
 I mean funky joint.            

15
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,961
          ...plating up         
   chili-inspired creations...  

16
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,963
I couldn't shovel that          
in my face fast enough, could I?

17
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,032
   ...for the whole dang town.  

18
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,368
             YNIGUEZ:           
    So, I feed a thousand kids  
   before 10:00 in the morning. 

19
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,503
    A thousand?!                

20
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:38,637
    And north in Santa Fe...    

21
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,105
              Ready to do this, 
                    man?        

22
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:41,440
     ...the African joint...    

23
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:43,175
     No matter what he's making,
               it sounds good.  

24
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:45,243
 ...serving up savory keepers...

25
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,045
                 ♪ Row, row,    
               row your goat ♪  

26
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,647
    ...straight out of Kenya.   

27
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:49,648
         If that's the only dish
                  you sold,     

28
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,916
       I'd come back every week.

29
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:53,051
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

30
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,654
     on "Diners, Drive-Ins,     
           and Dives"!          

33
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,470
 So, I'm here in the older part 
   of Albuquerque, New Mexico,  

34
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:12,737
     known as North Valley.     

35
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,939
         Now, out here,         
     you'll find everything     

36
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,208
       from horse ranches       
       to organic farms,        

37
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,277
      but more importantly,     
  got a cool, little restaurant 

38
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,279
  where the chef owner started  
       by selling burritos      

39
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,814
   out of the back of her car.  

40
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,683
          Now she's got         
  a little take-out restaurant  

41
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,418
      where she's making --     
           get this --          

42
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,555
   over a thousand meals a day  
       for local schools.       

43
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:31,756
       This is Bocadillos.      

44
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,492
     How long on a T&A, sir?    

45
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,296
        It's real people        
        making real food        

46
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:38,564
  that real people want to eat. 

47
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:39,765
            YNIGUEZ:            
      After that, a Philly.     

48
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:40,765
      It's fresh. Love it.      

49
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,568
 They're good people, friendly. 

50
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,103
      Gonna be a busy day.      

51
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:47,439
  FIERI: And for owner and chef 
Marie Yniguez, that's every day.

52
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,908
           Since '09,           
     this Albuquerque native    

53
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,711
  has been delivering the goods 
    on what the locals crave.   

54
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,379
  We love chili in New Mexico.  

55
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,914
    We put it on everything.    

56
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,983
   FIERI: And they're a staple  
   of Bocadillos' sandwiches.   

57
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,318
  Not only does it taste good,  

58
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,588
     but it makes the whole     
    neighborhood smell good.    

59
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,589
   FIERI: So, I'm gonna follow  
     my nose down the road,     

60
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:08,393
 where Marie's cousin Charlie is
 rockin' his Hatch-chili stand. 

61
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,462
             FIERI: So, let me  
             get this straight. 

62
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,797
             This right here is 
              the Hatch chili?  

63
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,332
Yes, it comes from Hatch,       
     absolutely.                

64
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:14,600
            So Hatch is a place?

65
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:16,067
 Yes, chili capital             
    of the world.               

66
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,335
             Let's turn her on. 

67
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,937
 Now, that's my kind of machine.

68
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,606
    Only takes eight minutes    

69
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:22,941
      to roast these babies     
         to perfection.         

70
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,676
  My mouth is already starting  
            to water.           

71
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,010
      It smells so killer.      

72
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,147
         I've never seen        
     a chili-roasting stand.    

73
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:29,214
          Welcome to New Mexico.

74
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,549
              Yeah,             
     welcome to New Mexico.     

75
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:33,352
                There we are.   

76
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:35,353
          Look at that!         

77
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,289
And we're gonna cook with this? 
                       Yes, sir.

78
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,624
            In fact,            
   they're the crowning glory   

79
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,493
on one of Marie's top sellers...

80
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,961
          T&A on wheat.         

81
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:45,297
  FIERI: ...a New Mexican spin  
     on the turkey sandwich.    

82
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,698
    It's extremely flavorful.   

83
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,833
           It's legit.          

84
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,834
              We're gonna start 
              with the dry rub  

85
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,103
               for the turkey   
           for the T&A sandwich.

86
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,372
      The T&A?                  
                        T&A.    

87
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:54,572
    What does T&A               
     stand for?                 

88
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,707
             Turkey and avocado.

89
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:00,312
        We got crushed peppers, 
         garlic, salt, pepper,  

90
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,848
                a little bit    
               of brown sugar.  

91
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,249
               Mix all this up  
                  together.     

92
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,383
  Dry rub goes on?              

93
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,318
              Dry rub goes on.  

94
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,452
 Not on the inside?             

95
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:08,486
                No, I like it   
                to fall apart   

96
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,988
            as soon as I pull it
              out of the oven.  

97
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,323
     And what is                
  this concoction?              

98
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,458
        So, that right there is 
   our house-made honey mustard.

99
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,859
                Just go ahead   
               and toss it on.  

100
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,261
                 Good to go.    
                   Pretty.      

101
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:17,262
             Wrap it up in foil,

102
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:21,466
            stick it in the oven
            for 12 hours at 250.

103
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,940
                 All right,     
               roasted turkey.  

104
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:29,541
    Pretty much when you take it
              out of the oven,  

105
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,542
            it just falls apart.

106
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,277
That honey mustard...           

107
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,544
  rocks the house.              

108
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,147
          It's pretty sick, huh?

109
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:37,015
              We're gonna make  
  the green-chili apple chutney.

110
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:40,351
            So, this is typical 
    chili peeling in New Mexico.

111
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,686
But you're wearing gloves?      
                     Oh, yeah.  

112
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,021
  Because...                    
           'Cause you don't know

113
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,889
 if you're gonna touch your face
        or anything else later. 

114
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,757
                Ready to go.    

115
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,092
            And then, basically,
                    you just... 

116
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,761
Nice roasted flavor,            
  not super spicy,              

117
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,096
but those will all range        
   in heat, right?              

118
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,297
                    Yes.        

119
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,232
And this chili apple chutney's  
gonna go on the turkey?         

120
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,700
                    Yes.

       and the goat stew?       

348
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:08,827
 Oh, probably 'cause you haven't
 been to this joint, Jambo Café.

349
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:13,264
        Coming right up.        

350
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,799
          There you go.         

351
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,601
Jambo Café is cloud nine for me.

352
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,603
     One order of mahimahi.     

353
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:21,139
               Very authentic.  
       It's a very unique style.

354
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,273
    Goat stew with the roti.    

355
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:25,409
        MAN: It reminds me      
   of exactly what I would have 

356
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,878
     if I was back in Kenya.    

357
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,747
    FIERI: Flavors that owner   
    and chef Ahmed Obo missed   

358
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,282
 from the place he was raised --

359
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,351
       the island of Lamu       
      off the Kenyan coast.     

360
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:36,955
      After all these years     
    of me back home cooking,    

361
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:39,157
this town has nothing like this.

362
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,692
 FIERI: After working stateside 
      in other restaurants,     

363
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,362
    including "Triple D" alum   
          Zia Diner...          

364
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:45,629
            Bok choy.           
    I'm waiting for bok choy.   

365
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,565
  FIERI: ...he laid down roots  
       in his own joint...      

366
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,034
         Chicken curry.         
          There it is.          

367
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,970
     FIERI: ...with a focus     
  on fresher-than-fresh flavors 

368
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,840
       that come together       
   in this present of a dish.   

369
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:56,841
        Mahimahi's ready!       

370
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:59,844
         I get mahimahi         
    at a lot of restaurants,    

371
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,645
  but this one is different --  
   the texture and the taste.   

372
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:02,714
        I really love it.       

373
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:07,117
           Chef, what is a dude 
        in Santa Fe, New Mexico,

374
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,587
     doing with a big, gigantic,
                 fresh mahi?    

375
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,055
      You know,                 
I'm from the island,            

376
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,390
     so I need,                 
  you know, like...             

377
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,591
                   Fresh fish.  
...fresh fish.                  

378
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:14,993
           Let's make some fish.
        OBO: There we go.       

379
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,061
  Now you're in it.             
    There we go.                

380
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,265
So, we're gonna cook this       

381
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,400
  with the skin on              
  or the skin off?              

382
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,836
              We're gonna take  
                the skin off.   

383
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:32,277
  We're gonna rub it with spices
               from back home.  

384
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,277
             FIERI:             
   What are we starting with?   

385
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,414
So, we have fresh ginger.       

386
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,549
    Chili powder                
   and have thyme.              

387
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,284
                   FIERI:       
          Island food and thyme.

388
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,318
    There you go.               

389
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,223
Then we have coriander,         
get our spice.                  

390
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,491
             Another favorite --
                   garlic.      

391
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,759
   This is garlic.              

392
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:49,627
  And then we have              
     a cinnamon.                

393
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,229
This is jalapeño.               
                     Jalapeños? 

394
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,031
Yeah, we grow some chilies      
     back home.                 

395
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:56,033
  And black pepper.             
Some black pepper goes in there.

396
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,635
Put some bok choy in there.     
                          Okay. 

397
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:00,438
Paprika to give it, you know,   
the redness in there.           

398
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,040
                    Yeah.       
   Okay.                        

399
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:02,974
                The redness.    

400
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,042
    The redness.                

401
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,442
                    Yeah.       

402
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:06,911
Let's get this guy going.       

403
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:09,781
Got to combine together.        
      The oil.                  

404
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:11,716
            So, a nice, wet rub 
            almost like a baste.

405
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,122
                I'd put that    
               on a flip-flop.  

406
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,456
   I got the fish               
     right here.                

407
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,391
                    Okay.       

408
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:21,726
Then just put in there.         

409
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:22,794
                Look at that.   

410
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,395
       How long is it gonna stay
                  on there      

411
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:25,597
        before we cook the fish?

412
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:28,666
Overnight, so that way,         
it sinks right in, you know?    

413
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,067
               Okay, brother,   
          now what are we on to?

414
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,670
  Coconut tamarind              
    mango sauce.                

415
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,072
Right, so, we got yellow onions 
    right here --               

416
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,341
 goes into the pot.             

417
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:37,408
      Garlic.                   
                       Okay.    

418
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,077
    Curry powder.               

419
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,412
            Smells good already.

420
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,147
And a little bit of oil.        

421
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,549
 Cumin, got cayenne.            

422
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,617
                 Coriander.     

423
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:47,619
       Got it.                  

424
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:49,153
              Ginger and thyme. 

425
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,488
   And the thyme.               

426
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,024
               Feel the magic.  
               Feel the burn.   

427
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:55,492
Once the spice starts to stick  
   to the bottom,               

428
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,429
 that's when we want            
to throw in some mango.         

429
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:02,033
Island mango, fresh,            
you know, just out of the tree. 

430
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,434
           I actually picked it.

431
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:07,504
There you go. We're gonna pour  
this coconut milk in there.     

432
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,574
  And is this the tamarind paste
              already diluted?  

433
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,508
        Yes.                    

434
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,775
          Kind of got a sourness
                   to it.       

435
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,577
Pour it right in there.         

436
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,712
                  Awesome.      

437
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,047
    There you go.               

438
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,918
     [ Train horn whistles ]    

439
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,721
              All of your mouth 
                 lights up.     

440
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,723
 I can see the light            
 in your face, man.             

441
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,325
 So, we're gonna go             
    to the salt.                

442
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,526
You know what that is?          

443
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:29,927
                  Vinegar.      

444
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,928
    There you go.               

445
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,263
                  Okay, so,     
           now we got that done.

446
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,065
      You're gonna wrap the fish
            in the banana leaf. 

447
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,200
          This was kind of like 
         natural plastic wrap --

448
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,269
        retain the moisture and 
     add a little bit of flavor.

449
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,038
So, then I'm gonna go           
      this way.                 

450
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,275
Then I'm gonna go seal it.      

451
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,410
              Gonna do a strip? 
I love to do the strip          

452
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,678
'cause it reminds me            
    of back home.               

453
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,813
  So, there's my --             

454
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,347
             Like, you did this 
               700,000 times.   

455
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,350
Now you go to the steamer.      

456
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:53,484
                  How long?     

457
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,285
  About 15 minute.              

458
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,887
          Ready to do this, man?
Let's do it.                    

459
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,290
       And so,                  
there's your mahimahi.          

460
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,092
       Cut it.                  

461
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,295
 There's your fish.

00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,763
Have a black rice here.         

463
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,565
                    Okay.       

464
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,701
And then we're gonna go         
  and put the fish,             

465
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,837
then we sauté baby bok choy,    

466
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,772
then here's the sauce           
    that we made.               

467
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:17,574
   You just put it              
   right over it.               

468
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:18,642
               He's so mellow.  

469
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,111
  Sprinkle parsley.             

470
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,578
   Get one lemon.               

471
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,047
Put it right on the top.        

472
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,183
  The island spice              
  banana-leaf wrap.             

473
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,919
                    Okay,       
      the fresh-caught mahimahi.

474
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,656
                    Mmm.        
             Wow, that's tender.

475
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,524
              The fish can't be 
               any more fresh.  

476
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,460
  Serves it with the black rice,
             the fresh veggies. 

477
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,863
                    Mmm.        
       The tamarind mango sauce.

478
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:39,731
                Outstanding.    

479
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:41,132
     Thank you.                 
I'm glad you enjoyed it.        

480
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:42,800
             Very soulful dish. 

481
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:43,868
 Everything is good.            

482
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,136
    Thank you.                  
                     This guy.  

483
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,871
        Mahimahi's ready!       

484
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,674
  Really fresh, really tender,  
         nice and moist.        

485
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,275
    It's beautiful, as well.

      just as good-looking.

 The artwork actually moves you 
           to Africa.           

488
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,484
   It's like a little vacation  
        when you come in.       

489
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:00,885

00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,689

        the home of the chilies,

492
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,226
         but Chef Ahmed is gonna
                 make us...     

493
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:10,294
Some Caribbean goat stew.       

494
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:11,462
              See you in a bit. 

495
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,804
            FIERI: Welcome back.

496
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,140
         "Triple D" hanging out 
        in Santa Fe, New Mexico,

497
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,609
        and, no, we're not doing
                   a joint      

498
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,009
              that's serving up 
            the awesome chilies.

499
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,344
             We're doing a joint

500
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,414
   that's serving up the awesome
    African/Caribbean cuisine.  

501
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,949
                   So, now      
         what are we gonna make?

502
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:35,953
We have, you know, the goat,    
so we're gonna do goat stew.    

503
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,955
              If you're missing 
                   a goat,      

504
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:39,290
             might be right here
               in the bucket.   

505
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,624
Well, that's possible.          

506
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:41,892
         [ Both laugh ]         

507
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,228
So, anyway, we're gonna start   
by, you know, curry.            

508
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,896
                       Okay.    
    Curry powder.               

509
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,233
Then I'm gonna do cayenne,      
    all spice in.               

510
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,300
                 Coriander.     

511
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,369
 This is coriander.             

512
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:52,836
   Then our cumin,              

513
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,772
and I use a lot of the spice    
   all over again.              

514
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,907
                     Ginger?    
Ginger, ginger powder.          

515
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,443
              A lot of dry rub. 

516
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,177
And then get cinnamon.          

517
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,312
                  That much?    
     Yeah.                      

518
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:04,314
Salt now, so I'm gonna sprinkle 
    all over.                   

519
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,450
Then I want to mix it up        
a little bit here, yeah.        

520
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,252
           Underneath. Come on. 
        Dig deep. You can do it.

521
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,653
Yeah, man. Yeah, man.           

522
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,255
                 Yeah, man.     

523
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,990
      Now, how long will it stay
        with the dry rub on it? 

524
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:15,860
     A few days,                
all the spices sinking in.      

525
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:16,794
            You should smell it.

526
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:17,928
        It's like a spice market
                 right now.     

527
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,932
                      Next up?  
I got a blended olive oil.      

528
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,533
 It's not too thick.            

529
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,268
 So, there it goes.             

530
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,870
And then from there --          

531
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:27,404
                 So, this is    
               one whole goat?  

532
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,472
This is one whole goat.         

533
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,141
              So we're talking  
                 goat front,    

534
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,209
                 goat back,     
               goat middle...

00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,342
Goat back, goat middle.         

536
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,611
             ...goat tenderloin,
                 goat rib...

     Everything.                

539
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,549
Just grab this paddle           
       again.                   

540
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:42,019
     So, now, everybody at home,
            together with me...

544
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,960
       So, we're gonna sit there
              and stir that up. 

545
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,028
     Gonna sit.                 

546
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,362
        Let it sear a little bit
               on both sides.

              Now what goes in? 

549
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:55,966
   We're gonna put              
     the onions.                

550
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,834
     Add garlic.                

551
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,771
Now we need to dump in          
  the tomato paste              

552
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,107
 a little at a time,            
        man.                    

553
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:07,378
We're gonna add a little bit    
of beef stock first.            

554
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,180
                  And then      
          what's this other one?

555
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,315
That one is chicken.            

556
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,450
                A little fat    
              on top of there.  

557
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:13,651
 That's why we need             
   to add the fat               

558
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,785
  'cause, you know,             
    the goat's...

...a little lean.               

560
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:18,455
So, we bring it to a boil,      
 and then from here,            

561
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:23,327
we're gonna slide it into       
the oven for about 2 1/2 hours. 

562
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:27,264
      All right, so, now you put
      the carrots in, potatoes. 

563
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,599
And then from there,            
we just mix it up together.     

564
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:29,667
                   Got it.

568
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:35,006
  Then on the roti,             
a little bit of oil.            

569

       You got to be kidding me.

571
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,886
                That goat is    
                so tender...    

572
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,957
               and so...rich.   

573
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,559
           And you get the roti.

574
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:55,626
        Yeah.                   

575
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,962
    There you go.               

576
00:19:57,964 --> 00:19:59,030
                    Huh?        

577
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,831
        Yeah.                   

578
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,833
               This right here  
        is about as real deal --

579
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:03,968
         If that's the only dish
                  you sold,     

580
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:04,902
       I'd come back every week.

581
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,070
              It's outstanding. 

582
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:09,039
                The goat stew   
                 with roti.     

583
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,574
       WOMAN: It's unlike       
    anything I've had before,   

584
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,577
        as if the spices        
    are really of the earth.    

585
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,845
              MAN:              
    The goat stew reminds me    

586
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:17,581
  of exactly what they prepare  
            in Kenya.           

587
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,717
  Lamb burger with cumin fries. 

588
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,851
     I love the Jambo Café.     

589
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:22,386
        MAN: It gives me        
      a homemade feel to it     

590
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,521
     every time I come here.    

591
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:24,789
         It's the best.         

592
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:31,328
          You'll love Santa Fe, 
and you'll really love this guy.

593
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,496
              This is the bomb.

     you're saying it right now.

601
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,548
