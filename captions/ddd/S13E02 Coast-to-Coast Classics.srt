               IN 20-SOME YEARS.

136
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,787
             IT'S ALL IN        
    THE HOMEMADE MASHED POTATOES

137
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,589
     WITH THE YORKSHIRE PUDDING,

138
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,057

           IT'S VERY TENDER.

         AND NOT TIGHTEN IT UP  
       WITH ANY FLOUR, ANY ROUX.
NOTHING.

THE GOOD STUFF HERE.            

176

               NINE LADLES      
         TO FILL THE LITTLE CUP.

177
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,783
         SEE WHERE THE MEAT     
    IS STARTING TO GET TOGETHER?

      A LITTLE PARTY RIGHT HERE?

179
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,487
     CHEESE IS STILL NOT FEELING
          PART OF THE PARTY     

180
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,756
           TILL YOU WARM 'EM UP.

181
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,693
         THERE'S SO MANY THINGS 
        THAT MAKE THIS SO RIGHT.

182
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:12,564
                THE BREAD--     
          PERFECT, GREAT CRUNCH,

183
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:15,634
             THE GARLIC BUTTER--
               OH, PRIME TIME.  

184
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,636
                 WHAT I THINK   
             THE REAL KICKER IS,

185
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,638
       THE MEAT WAS ROASTED WITH
       THAT WHOLE-GRAIN MUSTARD,

186
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,974
 BUT YOU REALLY TASTE THE MEAT--
     WHAT'S THAT OVER THERE?    

187
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:26,311
                    I GUESS     
              I'LL WIPE MY FACE.

188
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:27,912
                       BEEF DIP.

189
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,449
 THE MEAT IS EXTREMELY TENDER,  
  AND THE GRAVY IS DELICIOUS.   

190
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,852
                       BEEF DIP.
  (woman) THERE'S A LITTLE BIT  
        OF GARLIC IN IT,        

191
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,854
 WHICH GIVES IT A NICE FLAVOR.  

192
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,856
IT'S MY CLASSIC AT A RESTAURANT.

193
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,058
            (Guy) I THINK THAT  
         PRETTY MUCH SUMS IT UP.

          AND IT WILL INVOLVE...
STEAK AND MUSHROOM PIE.         

198
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,236
                 I'M A DEAD MAN.

199
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,477
      ALL RIGHT, TRIPLE "D" HERE
          IN NORTH VANCOUVER,

               AT THE TOMAHAWK. 

202
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,684
       THIS KIND YOUNG LADY HERE
        HAS BEEN FEEDING ME BEEF

203
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:06,885
             SIX WAYS TO SUNDAY.

204
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:09,487
                WE HAVE HAD     
          THE YORKSHIRE PUDDING.

          WE'VE HAD THE BEEF DIP
             WITH BEEF AU JUS.  

206
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:16,361
            AND NOW GUESS WHAT  
          WE'RE GONNA HAVE, HMM?
STEAK AND MUSHROOM PIE          
      WITH GRAVY.               

207
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,895
              ABSOLUTELY WE ARE.

208
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,365
      AND I'M GONNA PUSH THE CAR
       BACK OVER THE BIG BRIDGE 

209
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,100
             THAT I GOT HERE ON.

210
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,901
           HOW DO WE START THIS?
    THE PIE DOUGH               
FOR THE POTPIE SHELL.           

211
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:27,638
                   START IT OFF.
 THE ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR          
GOES INTO OUR BIG MIXER,        

212
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,108
SALT AND BAKING POWDER,         

213
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,578
SHORTENING--ALL VEGETABLE.      
       NOTHING SHORT ABOUT THAT.

214
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,913
WE PUT ON THE MACHINE.          

215
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:37,782
       NOW, UH, I DON'T WANT    
  TO GET A CALL FROM PAULA DEEN.

216
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,650
          THAT SHOULD BE BUTTER.

217
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:42,387
          YEAH, NO,             
THIS IS A 100-YEAR-OLD RECIPE.  

218
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,722
NO.                             
                     OKAY, THEN.

219
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,591
         PAULA, HANDS OFF.      
  THIS IS A 100-YEAR-OLD RECIPE.

220
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,593
                     NOT MY GIG.
AND WE'RE GONNA MIX IT.         

221
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,861
           THAT'S, LIKE,        
   AN EXTRA 14 HOURS AT THE GYM.

222
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,931
WE'RE GONNA SPEED IT UP         
     A LITTLE BIT.              
             MAKING SOME GRAVEL.

223
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,800
WE'RE MAKING GRAVEL.            
   THAT'S RIGHT.                

224
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,603
        AND YOU SAID THIS RECIPE
               IS HOW OLD?      
OVER 100 YEARS.                 

225
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,672
CHUCK IS THE OWNER,             

226
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,207
AND HIS MOM AND DAD             
STARTED THE TOMAHAWK            

227
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,143
IN 1926.                        

228
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,947
NOW WE ADD WATER.               

229
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:12,550
AND WE BRING IT TOGETHER,       
  AND THERE, IT'S DONE.         
                           OKAY.

230
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,086
IT COMES OUT OF THE BOWL        
  TO REST FOR AN HOUR.          

231
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:18,223
                 WE ROLL IT OUT,
                     FORM IT.   
ROLL IT OUT.                    

232
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,227
WE BLIND-BAKE IT                

233
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,430
     WITH AN EGG WASH           
SO THEY'RE NICE AND GOLDEN.     

234
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,399
THEN WE BLIND-BAKE THE LIDS     
        SEPARATELY.             

235
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,437
THIS A BOAT GOING TO FLAVOR TOWN
          RIGHT THERE.          

236
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:33,971
             (imitates chugging)

237
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,774
 THEN WE MAKE THE STEAK         
AND MUSHROOM PIE FILLING.       

238
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,911
WE'VE GOT THE BUTTER MELTING    
   WITH THE GARLIC IN IT.       

239
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,580
      WE'VE GOT                 
THE NICE HAPPY STEAK.           

240
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,850
WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE STEAK    
  INTO THE GARLIC BUTTER.       

241
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,986
        A LITTLE                
CRACKED BL--BLACK PEPPER.       

242
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,722
                    IT'S EASY   
                 FOR YOU TO SAY.
YEAH, NOT REALLY.               

243
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:53,391
A LITTLE SALT.                  
                  ALL THAT'S    
              GONNA GO IN THERE?

244
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:54,526
MORE OR LESS.                   

245
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:56,194
         WELL, IT'S EITHER MORE,
              OR IT'S LESS.     

246
00:09:56,196 --> 00:10:00,532
DEFINITELY MORE, BECAUSE IT'S   
  GONNA FLOW OVER THE SIDE.     

247
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:04,268
MUSHROOMS.                      

248
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,270
     AND OF COURSE, YOU'RE GONNA
        TAKE US TO GRAVY TOWN.  

249
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,939
GRAVY TOWN.                     

250
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,608
                    OH, SEE,    
                THIS IS AWESOME.

251
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,478
SO WE COAT ALL THE STEAK,       
   ALL THE MUSHROOMS.           

252
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,880

253
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,348

           PRAYER MEDITATION    

254

255

258
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,630
OKAY, AND THEN THIS             
IS READY TO SERVE.              

259
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,566

    THERE WE GO.                

261
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:39,971
 THAT'S HOW                     
IT COMES OUT.                   

262
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,440
             IT LOOKS TOO PRETTY
                TO BREAK INTO.  

263

            AND THE TENDER BEEF.

        IT'S VERY GOOD.         

275
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,602
   IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF BREAD   
       THAT COMES ON TOP.       

276
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,872
   IT WORKS PERFECTLY AS YOU    
CRUMBLE IT INTO THE MEAT ITSELF.

277

             DOESN'T MEAN       
        YOU CAN CALL IT BLUBBER.
OKAY, IT'S PORK FAT,            
    EXCUSE ME.                  

413
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,988
          THERE YOU GO.         
AND HOW LONG IS THIS GONNA COOK?

414
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,990
THAT'S A LOW-AND-SLOW           
   FOR TEN HOURS.               

415
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,794
          TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.  
        COOKED DOWN, NICE CRUST.

416
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,796
              DAN, I'M JUST     
         DOING THIS FOR SCIENCE.

417
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,998
                     I REALLY   
                  DON'T PICK IT.
OH, NO PROBLEM.                 

418
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,600
             SUPER JUICY.       
      HOW DO WE BREAK INTO THIS?
WE'RE JUST GONNA                
TEAR IT UP, BUDDY.              

419
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,737
PEOPLE LIKE A LITTLE BLUBBER    
     ON THEIR SANDWICH,         

420
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:47,405
A LITTLE CRUNCHY TEXTURE.       
               A LITTLE BLUBBER.

421
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,140
A LITTLE BLUBBER.               
           AND THEN WE'LL MAKE  
         THE SANDWICH FROM THIS.

422
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,676
WE'LL MAKE THE CUBAN            
  RIGHT FROM HERE.              
                  WE BETTER MAKE
                   THE SANDWICH,

423
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,611
            BECAUSE I'M GONNA   
        EAT ALL THIS RIGHT HERE.
LET'S DO IT.                    

424
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,680
ALL RIGHT, I GOT                
THE CUBAN BREAD.                

425
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,081
    WE'RE GONNA GO WITH         
SOME MUSTARD AND SOME MAYO.     

426
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,484
 NOW I'M GONNA ADD THE PORK.    
THEN I GOT VIRGINIA-BAKED HAM,  

427
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:00,885
                      CAPOCOLLA,

428
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,887
 WHICH IS PART OF THE DIFFERENCE
      THAT WE DO AT DANNY'S,    

429
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,889
         SOME GOOD GENOA SALAMI,
              SWISS CHEESE,     

430
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,291
              THEN SOME GOOD    
          NEW YORK DILL PICKLES.

431
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,893
     NOW I CUT IT IN QUARTERS.  
   WRAP IT, PUT IT ON THE PRESS.

432
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:11,162
HOW LONG IS THIS                
GONNA GO DOWN FOR?              
                  I'D SAY       
            ABOUT THREE MINUTES.

433
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,698
         OH, YEAH, YOU CAN FEEL 
        THE CRUNCH IN THE TOAST.

434
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,234
               IT'S READY TO GO.
LOOK AT THAT.                   

435
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,702
WHOO, WHOO.                     

436
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,970
OH, WHAT YOU GET                

437
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,174
IS CUBAN THANKSGIVING           
   IN A SANDWICH.               
                      THAT'S IT.

438
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,042
OH.                             

439
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,913
THE BREAD IS SO NICE AND LIGHT  
BUT BUILDS SUCH A GREAT CRUNCH, 

440
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:31,382
TANG OF THE PICKLE,             
TANG OF THE MUSTARD,            

441
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,716
SWEETNESS OF THE HAM,           

442
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,852
SPICINESS, A LITTLE BIT         
  OF THAT CAPOCOLLA,            

443
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,720
AND THEN YOU GET                
 THE MOJO PORK.                 

444
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,856
I MEAN, EVERYBODY'S             
AT THE PARTY, MAN.

446
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,394
AND I'D BE SET.                 

447
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,396

HE HAS IT.

00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,865
   I'VE HAD A LOT               
OF CUBAN SANDWICHES.            

449
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,467

452
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,807
 THE JUICES ALL FLOW TOGETHER.  

453
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,809

ADDS AN EXTRA BITE.

        I'D GIVE IT             
THE STATE OF MIAMI APPROVAL.    

457
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,951
   THAT'S, LIKE, THE STATE BIRD 
 IN MIAMI IS THE CUBAN SANDWICH.

                      BEAUTIFUL.

511
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:10,941
   (woman) IT'S REALLY GOOD.    

512
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,277
       YOU GET THE FLAVOR       
    OF THE DIFFERENT MEATS,     

513
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,212
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE JALAPEÑOS 
FOR A LITTLE BIT OF SPICE TO IT.

514
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,815
WHAT ARE YOU HAVING             
    OVER THERE?                 
                   IT'S CALLED  
                 THE TRIPLE "D."

515
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,818
ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE           
 TO GET IT ALL DOWN?            

516
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,553
                   I'M DOING    
                THE BEST I CAN. 
(laughs)                        

517
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,088
  (man) REALLY GOOD SANDWICH.   

518
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,023
 A LITTLE MESSY, BUT THAT COMES 
  WITH A GOOD PLACE LIKE THIS.  

519
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:29,159
 IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES 
            TO EAT.             
    IT HAS THE ALL-AMERICAN FEEL

520
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,494
               WITH THE BASEBALL
                AND EVERYTHING. 

521
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,096
       THE MENU'S VERY ECLECTIC.
           YOU CAN'T BEAT IT.   

522
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,632
     GOOD TIME, DANNY.          
THANKS FOR LETTING ME HANG.     
               THANK YOU, BUDDY.

523
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:37,901
YOU GOTTA COME MEET THIS GUY.   
   YOU'RE GONNA LOVE HIM.       

524
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,639
SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS ROAD TRIP,
        BUT DON'T WORRY,        

525
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:44,642
   WE GOT PLENTY MORE JOINTS    
 TO FIND ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY. 

526
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,644
    I'LL BE LOOKING FOR YOU     
           NEXT TIME            

527
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:49,714
               ON               
 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

528
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,649
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO         
    WITH THIS NOW?              

529
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:55,319
                   I DON'T KNOW.
                   JUST GO, MAN.

530
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,088
           (laughter)
