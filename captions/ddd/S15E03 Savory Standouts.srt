   YOU'RE GOING BACK IN TIME    

108
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
   AND YOU'RE GOING TO CUBA,    
AND I FEEL LIKE MY GRANDPARENTS,

109
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:51,323
        HOW THEY GREW UP

     "TASTE THE FORBIDDEN"      

111
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,929
 BECAUSE I THINK IF YOU'RE NOT  
 FROM CUBA, YOU CAN'T GO THERE. 

112
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:01,933
YOU CAN'T EXPERIENCE THEIR FOOD,
  THEIR FLAVORS, THEIR SPICES.

ARE YOU READY TO TASTE          
    THE FORBIDDEN?              
            YOU'RE GONNA LOOK   
         THE TASTE OF FORBIDDEN.

114
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:09,007
ARE YOU READY TO TASTE--        
ARE--ARE YOU YOU READY?         
         YOU'RE GONNA LOOK THE--

118
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,751
     AND WE GIVE IT             
A REAL NICE SWEET TASTE.

ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE HAD 

124
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,098
IN THE BACKYARD OF MY HOUSE,    
   WHICH IS A GUAVA TREE.       

125
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,969
THIS IS THE BEST PART--I LOVE   
  THE FIZZLE OF THE MALTA.      

126
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:42,373
 THE MALTA IS THE MALT. IT'S    
SORT OF LIKE A GUINNESS BEER,   

127
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,841
BUT WITH NO ALCOHOL.            

128
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,578

142

WE DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH,    
 'CAUSE WE WANT THE JUICES      

143
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,011

WE GET THE SOUR ORANGE JUST TO  
BALANCE OUT ALL THE SWEETNESS.  
                 SOUR ORANGE IS 
               ACTUALLY A FRUIT,

150
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,298
          AND IF YOU CAN'T GET  
        SOUR ORANGE, YOU CAN MIX

151
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,102

WE GOT THE WHITE RICE.          
WE GOT THE PLANTAINS.

MY GRANDMOTHER'S RECIPE.        

169
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:27,112
  A VERY RICH DISH. A LITTLE BIT
      MORE ON THE SWEET SIDE.   

170
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,815
          BUT BETWEEN THE PRUNES
             AND ALL THE SUGAR  

171
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:34,419
 AND THE CARAMELIZED ONIONS, YOU
NEED THIS BALANCE OF THE RICE...

172
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,490
        AND THE BEANS TO KIND OF
         PARLAY IT ALL TOGETHER.

173
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,425
           THAT'S WHEN IT REALLY
              STARTS WORKING.   

174
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,493
WELL, THAT'S BASICALLY          
THE KEY TO CUBAN FOOD.          

175
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,963
     YOU HAVE                   
TO MIX EVERYTHING.              

176
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,965
YOU GOT TO BRING IT TOGETHER    
 TO FUSE ALL THOSE FLAVORS.

    SO MANY COMPLEX FLAVORS.    

180
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,841
     YOU COULD BUILD FLAVOR     
          UPON FLAVOR.          

181
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,776
       I HAVE ONE WORD--        
        "TASTY-LICIOUS."        

182
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,979
      THIS MAKES YOU FEEL

       OF FLAVORS IN IT.        

304
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,945

     WITH SOME FLOUR, THE SUGAR.

322
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,584

                 OUR CORNSTARCH,

324
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:17,655
         AN EGG, AND WE'RE GONNA
              ADD OUR MILK,     

325
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:20,524
                AND WE HAVE SOME
                LEMON-LIME SODA.

326
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,926
FOR THE CARBONATION,            
   THE AIRINESS.                
                RIGHT, SO WE'RE 
                AIRING THIS OUT.

327
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:24,462
        WE WANT TO SWEETEN IT UP
              A LITTLE BIT.     
OKAY.                           

328
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,930
        WHISK ALL THIS TOGETHER,
         AND THERE'S OUR BATTER.
NICE AND CREAMY.                

329
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,866
                           YEAH.
TEMPURA, PANCAKE BATTER-ISH     
       CONSISTENCY.             

330
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,803
          OUR NEXT STEP WOULD BE
         TO DO OUR LOBSTER MEAT.

331
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:33,871
                    FIVE OF 'EM.
  OKAY, LITTLE                  
SLIPPER LOBSTERS.               

332
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,007
THERE YOU GO--ONE, TWO,         
  THREE, FOUR, FIVE.            
          ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

333
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,010
      TAKE THIS, SPLIT IT ALL   
  THE WAY DOWN, REMOVE THE MEAT.

334
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:42,680
        IT CURLS UP PRETTY GOOD 
      WHEN IT--WHEN IT BLANCHES.

335
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,616
  YOU BLANCHE                   
THE MEAT FIRST?                 

336
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:46,885
SO THEY'RE GONNA BE             
A LITTLE PARCOOKED.             
              NOW WE'VE GOT     
         OUR BOILING WATER HERE.

337
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,019
  YOU'RE GONNA SEASON           
THE WATER A LITTLE BIT.         
                 A LITTLE LEMON.

338
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,355
SALT AND PEPPER,                
   YOU WANT?                    
                       YES, SIR.

339
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:55,626
             WE'LL ADD THE MEAT.
              NOW DROP 'EM IN.  
THIS IS JUST GONNA GO           
    HOT AND FAST.               

340
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,962
           ALL IT NEEDS IS ABOUT
           TWO TO THREE MINUTES.

341
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:01,298
       ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE GONNA
          REMOVE THE LOBSTER.   

342
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,033
   KIND OF LIKE                 
BOBBING FOR APPLES.             
                      ALL RIGHT.

343
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,770
AND THEN ICE BATH.              
      GONNA REST IN HERE, JUST  
   ABSORB SOME OF THAT MOISTURE.

344
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,772
    SO NOW WE'RE GONNA SKEWER   
 THIS MEAT, RUN IT THROUGH HERE.

345
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,974
I WANT TO GET THROUGH THE MIDDLE
 OF IT TO GET IT NICE AND TIGHT.

346
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,510
THIS ISN'T ANY JOKE HERE.       
 THIS IS THE REAL DEAL.         

347
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,045
I MEAN, YOU'RE                  
LOADING IT UP.                  

348
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,581
     SO NOW WE'RE GONNA BATTER  
  THE LOBSTER PRONTO PUP TO FRY.

349
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,449
NICE LITTLE COATING.            

350
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:19,984
OHH, THAT'S GOOD.               

351
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,787
       WHEN THEY'RE FLOATING,   
   I GIVE 'EM ANOTHER, YOU KNOW,

352
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,789
                 30, 40 SECONDS.
     ALL YOU REALLY             
HAVE TO WAIT FOR ON THIS        

353
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,925
    IS FOR THAT BATTER          
TO BROWN UP ON THE OUTSIDE,     

354
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,862
 BECAUSE THAT SLIPPER LOBSTER   
IS COOKED ALL THE WAY THROUGH.  
                            YES.

355
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:32,863
HOW ARE WE LOOKING?

                ONLY IN MEMPHIS.

357
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:38,069
            NOW WE'RE GONNA TAKE
              A LITTLE ARUGULA, 

358
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,537

  OF SWEETNESS TO IT,           

369
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,230
