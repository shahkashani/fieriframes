79
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,954

  my mom and dad, Jim and Pene, 

80
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:38,623
  I said, "I went to this place

 All right, Don Juan, Double-D. 

87
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,039
    Okay, so now we're clams?   

88
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,574
    [Don] Clams and linguini    
        in a white sauce.       

89
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:56,642
   Give me the tour, brother.   

90
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:57,976
       -[Don] Big garlic.

91
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,844
    -[Don] Baby whole clams.    
          -All of 'em?          

92
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:00,979

00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,581
              [Guy]             
   Is this a platter for nine?  

94
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:03,915
          Fresh clams.          

95
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:05,984
       So, the baby wholes      
         with the juice         
       is the big flavor.       

96
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,119
      -These are kinda like

97
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,655
  Then we add some white wine.  

98
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,056
         Half and half.         

99
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,857
           Then we add          
       some butter, okay?       

100
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:13,858
              [Guy]             
    It's better with butter.    

101
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:15,994
         Pepper, basil.         

102
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,395
   We let this bad boy reduce.  

103
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:18,930
    [Guy] The great technique   
           on the clam          

104
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,665
    before it's been cooked,    
     we tap it on the shell.    

105
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,000
       It should close up       
          a little bit          

106
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,402
    -'cause it's still alive.   
      -Right. That's true.      

107
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,270
   [Guy] But then, when you do  
         cook the clams,        

108
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,005
        if the clam shell       
        doesn't open up,        

109
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,807
     well, then you probably    
     shouldn't eat that one.    

110
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,609
    -And they're popping open   
           as you see.          
        -[Guy] They are.        

111
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,011
   They look-- Wow. It's like,  
      "Take a look at me."      

112
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,112
         They're on cue.        

113
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,682
   Clams go around the plate.   

114
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:38,349
     Our sauce right on top.    

115
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,619
        Parmesan cheese,        
      little parsley on it.     

116
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:42,821
              Mmm.              

117
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,690
        Look at the ratio       
       of clams to pasta.       

118
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,025
    Shovel that in my pocket.

      -[Don] There you go.      
              -Huh?             

120
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,028
        I could do that.        

121
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,430
        I will, for sure,       
       steal that recipe.       

122
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:53,698
        You can have it.        

123
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,902
   And that was the beginning   
        of the Triple-D,

       things been since?       

126
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,707
 Everything's been great since. 

127

    You know, it's just been    
  taking off and it's been fun.

   something delicious to eat?  

131
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:11,850
     [Don] Chicken marsala.     

132
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,718
        I have a weakness       
      for chicken marsala.      

133
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,986
  I'll be very honest with you. 

134
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,922
           Any thyme?           
      I'm a big thyme guy.      

135
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,723
      No, there is no thyme     
       in there actually.       

136
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,058
    I don't put thyme in it.    

137

           my secret.           

141
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,333
        Here's my opinion       
       of chicken marsala.      

142
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,468
         Okay, we're not        
       gonna tell anybody.      

143
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,469
      We're gonna keep this     
       between us. Right.       

144
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,605
        I don't flour it.       
   I put Italian bread crumbs.  

145
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,673
            -Really?            
              -Yes.             

146
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,275
         I'm not getting        
          a graininess          

147
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,676
       that you would get       
       from a bread crumb.      

148
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,878
       [Don]<i> What you want</i>

     <i> with the Marsala wine.</i>    

158
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,268
     I make chicken marsala     
    all the time with thyme.    

159
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,836
       But I don't use any      
         half and half.         

160
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:06,838
     I mount it with butter     
         when I'm done.         

161
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,640
  -There's no butter in there-- 
           -No butter.          

162
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,907
           No butter,           
     but the half and half,     

163
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,977
       it's just to bring       
     the richness together.     

164
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,779
    What it does, it makes it   
         nice and silky.

      the update on Rocco's     

225
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,893
       since we were there      
          11 years ago.

229
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,432
      But this is the thing     
      that I love about it      

230
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,167
          is that it's          
      a neighborhood joint.     

231
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,703
      Still, traditionally,     
   is it Italian base, still?   

232
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,505
      [Don]<i> The whole thing</i>

235

242

         That's killer.         

243

        a fresh eggplant.       

256
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,548
  That's the number one thing.

       Bread crumb, flour?      

262

            No flour,

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,126
            -An egg.            
          -Just an egg.

      -Rocco. Where is he?

267
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,399
          Rocco, I want         
       to introduce you--       

268
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:24,436
   I figure if I'm gonna have   
     Double-D from Rocco's,     

269
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:27,105
      I should have Rocco's     
         from Triple-D.

00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,242
           -No flour?           
   -Flour, eggs, bread crumbs.  

272
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,844
     Have you ever heard it     
         with just egg?         

273
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:33,845
         Just egg? Sure.        

274
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,780
    Yeah, that's a different    
     style of breading, yup.    

275
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,850
     [Don] This is the style    
         my family cooks        
       where they're from.      

276
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,051
      We lightly brown it.      

277
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,920
      We add fresh garlic,      
      fresh chopped basil.      

278
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,556
          Pour the wine         
        over the garlic.        

279
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,660
         Now we add our         
         marinara sauce         

280
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,462
      and we turn 'em over      

281
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:53,464
    and add our fresh-sliced    
        provolone cheese,       

282
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,735
         grated Parmesan        
       and fresh parsley.       

283
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,537
        We let it simmer.       
        We will cover it.       

284
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:02,006
      Little fresh Parmesan     
          right on top.         

285
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,541
         So get a little

        I first came here

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,539
  been coming here ever since.

338
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:46,344
       I enjoy coming here      
       and talking to 'em.

342
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,689
        Well, I just say        
     financing's available.     

343
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,091
            The deer,           
     that was a food trade.     
    Think it was a breakfast.   

344
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,760
           The marlin,

       Let's make a deal.

349

      I've bought many cars

        and food credits.       

350
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:16,707

351
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:17,909
        How much is that?       

352
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,513
         Uh, let's see.         
         You got money.         
      Probably three bucks.

355

357
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,321
        I have a Chicago        
         hot dog joint,         

358
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,857
       <i> and Guy of course</i>

       <i> Chicago hot dogs.</i>       

359
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,191
     Let's do a Chicago Dog.    

360
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,860
           All right,           
      we got the dogs hot.      

361
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,729
         Don't want them        
    sitting and boiling away.   

362
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:38,796
         That's a no-no.        

363
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,264
          I'm gonna get         
   your ingredients together.   

364
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,599
           And you cut          
      everything to order?      

365
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,268
     I'm game on everything.    

366
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:46,671
        Get that hot dog        
        in a steamed bun,       
          tomato wedge.         

367
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,209
         Onions go next.        
      Some of that special      
      unique green relish.      

368
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:52,610
           [Guy] Now,           
     what's that all about?     

369
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:53,878
    That's a Chicago product.   

370
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,946
     It's got to be that way    
   if you want a Chicago Dog.   

371
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,615
    Couple of sport peppers,    

372
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:01,352
     -celery salt, mustard,     
     that is a Chicago Dog.     
          -[Fieri] Mmm.         

373
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:05,689
      Great dog. Nice snap.     
     The veggies are fresh.     
          They're good!         

374
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,158
  -[Fieri] Where are you from?  
         -[man] Chicago.        

375
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:09,761
     -How did this stack up     
  in the world of Chicago Dogs? 
           -Very good.          

376
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,232
  I have, of course, my Vienna  
   beef dogs, my Chicago-style  
       poppy seed buns...       

377
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,634
   but one of the great things  
        from Chicago food       

378
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,371
      is their giardiniera.     
      So, we have a hot dog     
         that's made...         

379
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,373
    just to kind of showcase    
     the giardiniera flavor.    

380
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,175
    [Starr] Mr. Sunshine up!    

381
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,978
  I ordered up the Mr. Sunshine 
 dog -- giardiniera and cheese. 

382
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,546
             Simple.            
       That's what I love.      

383
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:33,451
    A Vienna Beef Dog is just   
   boiled, and it's delicious   
            that way.           

384
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,052
    For the poppy seed buns,    
     you want to steam them.    

385
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,322
        We have a steamer       
    right here on the grill.    

386
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,657
 Let that sit for a little bit. 

387
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,460
         One of the keys        
   to the Sunshine is getting   
    the cheese on right away.   

388
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,129
      So, you use the heat      
        from the hot dog        
       to melt the cheese.      

389
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:47,498
 If you like spicy giardiniera, 
     this hot dog's for you.    

390
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,466
     Shredded up vegetables     
          in oil base.          

391
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:52,403
    -[Fieri] Now, do you make   
  that yourself or does that--  
       -No. From Chicago.       

392
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,472
      [Fieri] From Chicago.     

393
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,141
   [man] I got a Mr. Sunshine.  

394
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,277
    It's a good quality dog,    
     does have a nice snap,     
       and the peppers had      

395
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,613
      a good spice to them,     
       and all the flavors      
       went together well.      

396
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:04,349
   It's just nice and simple,   
     tastes good and fresh.     

397
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,283
        You feeling dogs,       
         they got dogs.         

398
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,751
        Feeling burgers,        
        they got burgers.       

399
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,487
      -Let's do the Selamu.     
    -[Starr] Yeah. All right!   

400
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,355
       We put a little bit      
     of garlic, a little bit    
          of habaneros.         

401
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,024
       [Fieri] And again,       
   we're gonna cut everything   
            to order?           

402
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,894
       [Starr] Absolutely,      
       and all burgers are      
          hand-formed.          

403
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,364
   Get it all mixed in there.   
        Angus beef, about       
  a third of a pound, usually.  

404
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,966
         Nice and flat.         
    I like it flat, get nice    
     and done in the middle.    

405
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,634
          -[Fieri] Ah!          
    -[Starr] Now, do you want   
         cheese on here?        

406
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,504
    -[Fieri] Oh, yes, please!   
  -[Starr] All right. Think you 
    want lettuce and tomato?    

407
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:27,972
  -Let's do lettuce and tomato. 
             -Yeah.             

408
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,707
        Voila! Le burger.       

409
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,978
         Got the garlic.        
      Didn't get much heat.     

410
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,980
   Mmm, there's a little heat.  
              Ooh.              

411
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,582
       Sure you didn't get      
       the Scotch Bonnets?      

412
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:38,849
          Good burger!          

413
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,384
       [woman] The Selamu       
         Burger's great.        

414
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:43,654
  It's got a lot of heat to it, 
   but now they're serving it   
         with coleslaw,         

415
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,056
         and it's called        
      the West Bank Burger.     

416
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,259
       It's got the garlic      
  and the hot peppers, same as  
        a Selamu burger.        

417
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:51,128
      We got the meat done,     
       and now we're ready      
     for our homemade slaw.     

418
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,731
     The key to the coleslaw    
        is the texture...       

419
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,400
     real fine, really makes    
          a difference.         

420
00:13:56,469 --> 00:14:00,671
  Put this in a bowl with some  
  onions, a little celery salt, 
          black pepper.         

421
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,106
     One of my big secrets!     

422
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,542
       Shake it. [laughs]       

423
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,213
   And our last ingredient...   
           mayonnaise.          

424
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,215
       Our burger's ready!      
  Here's our West Bank Burger.  

425
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:12,750
  I got a West Bank Burger up!  

426
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:16,754
        I love the onions       
    and the spiciness of it,    

427
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,157
  and the coleslaw really cools 
         off everything.        

428
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:25,696
     Coleslaw at The Wienery    
  is like your mom's coleslaw,  
       except even better.      

429
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,398
  [man] One thing I love about  
     The Wienery is that...     

430
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,566
         you're driving         
    down the street, you see    
 this beautiful walk-up window, 

431
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:30,902
  it's like, "Ooh! What's going 
           on there?"           

432
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,603
    You know what I'm doing?    
  I'm hooking up all my friends 

433
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,174
      with delicious meals      
 every day, and I keep it cheap 
    'cause they're all broke.   

434
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,976
   -[Fieri] You definitely are  
      a culinary gangster.      
     -I'm a hot dog hustler.    

435
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,279
    You're a hot dog hustler.   
          I like that.          

436
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,782
   [narrator]<i> And coming up...</i>  

437
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,051

00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,741
     The walnut cream cheese    
     filling, it has almost     
  a buttery type flavor to it.  

548
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,076
    <i> And it goes really well</i>    
    <i> with cinnamon and sugar.</i>   

549
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,712
 So it just reminds me of home. 

550
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,616
    -It's like a second home,   
            isn't it?           
     -That's exactly right.     

551
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,751
      <i> It was a lot of fun</i>      
     <i> to be able to show Guy</i>    

552
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,353
   <i> the things that, you know,</i>  
       <i> you can get here,</i>       

553
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,821
     in Philly you can't get    
         anywhere else.         

554
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:19,156
          -What's that?         
       -That is Scrapple.       

555
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,492
        What is the main        
          basis of it?          

556
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,561
             Well...            

557
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,632
        I don't like when       
       anybody starts with      
            "Well..."           

558
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:31,769
   It's all different parts of  
     the pig, and he thought    
     that was kind of crazy.    

559
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:32,770
         Do you eat it?         

560
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,505
           -I love it.          
             -Yeah.             

561
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,840
   So bad for you, but tastes   
          so, so good.          

562
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,041
          Chipped beef.         

563
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:40,511
     My dad talked about it     
        when I was a kid        

564
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,847
         About having it        
        in the military,        
       having it in Navy.       

565
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,849
     It's gotten a bad rap,     
  but not when it's made right. 

566
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,450
    Not when it's made here.    

567
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:47,651
   [Larry] Chicken Croquettes.  

568
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,653
           [chuckles]           

569
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,454
   Bro, that is rich and big.   

570
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,390
 Since Guy, Chicken Croquettes, 

571
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,192
      <i> it is our number one</i>     
         <i> selling dish.</i>         

572
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,260
     The Chicken Croquettes     
    are one of my favorites.    

573
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,596
       They have all your       
    regular Philly favorites.   

574
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,264
  [man] Cheesesteak going down. 

575
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,333
          They also do          
     your usual diner fare.     

576
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,003
      You don't get better      
          than the Car.         

577
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,672
            Honestly.           
     If you want down-home,     

578
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,741
          home cooking,         
      you come to the Car.      

579
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,410
   You proud of your daughters  
          and you son?          

580
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:13,477
             -Oh...             
  -You happy how they're doing? 

581
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,679
         -They're doing         
           a good job?          
         -They're great.        

582
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,415
   [Nancy]<i> My dad always said</i>   
      <i> he was proud of us.</i>      

583
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,883
            You know,           
     he had a little diner,     

584
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,218
         and we grew it         
      into the Dining Car.      

585
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:23,087
          <i> We also have</i>         
     <i> the Apple Walnut Cafe.</i>    

586
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:25,155
            You know,           
  we couldn't be more thrilled. 

587
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:27,291
        Why did they name       
   the street after you then?   

588
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:28,392
    I like the way you think.   

589
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:33,030
            Pick up,            
   Linguini Prawns gamberoni.   

590
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,299
      [Guy]<i> These guys put</i>      
     <i> so much of themselves</i>     
       <i> into their joints.</i>      

591
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,635
  I'm just glad that the nation 
        is taking notice.       

592
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,569
   This place is off the hook.  

593
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,438
   Zachtacular Mexican style.   

594
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,307
         [Guy]<i> But those</i>        
     <i> aren't the only ones.</i>     

595
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,643
     We'll check in on more     
   diners, drive-ins and dives  

596
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:47,178
  next time on<i> Triple D Nation.</i> 

597
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:49,647

599
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,788
           [laughing]           
     You know where they're     
    going in that, don't you?   

600
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,190
  They're going to Flavortown.
