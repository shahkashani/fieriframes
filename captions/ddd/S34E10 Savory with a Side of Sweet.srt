00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:03,135
    Hey there, I'm Guy Fieri,   
     and we're rolling out,     

2
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:07,005
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

3
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:09,874
          This trip...          
It's everything you want.       

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,944
    ...which is all kinds of    
            savory...           

5
00:00:11,946 --> 00:00:14,613
         One small bite for man.

6
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,348
         ...served with         
       a side of sweet...       

7
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,216
         Someone's going to have
 a little bit of a sugar problem

8
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,684
              here in a second. 

9
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:22,754
      ...like funky cheese      
and a cinnamon chaser in Utah...

10
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:24,490
       Things are getting weird.

11
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:26,091
      ...loaded lasagna...      

12
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,225
                    Whoa!       

13
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:29,762
   ...and cream puff mountains  
         in Colorado...         

14
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:31,163
           How do you attack it?

15
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,031
    ...plus Vermont vegan...    

16
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:35,567
It's "Get on a plane and come   
to Vermont" remarkable.         

17
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,902
      ...wrapped, crunched,     
           and puffed.          

18
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,438
Outstanding experience.         

19
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,641
     That's all right here,     
          right now on          

20
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,976
  "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

23
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,991
  So, I'm here in Wheat Ridge,  
 just west of Denver, Colorado. 

24
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:00,859
   Now, let me just tell you,   
        back in the day,        

25
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,461
         I first started        
       working at the fair      

26
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,730
       selling my pretzels      
  at The Awesome Pretzel cart,  

27
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,265
       and then when I got      
         my restaurants,        

28
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:07,665
     well, I started selling    
          what I'd sell         

29
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,067
 at the restaurant at the fair. 

30
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,335
  But I heard about this family 

31
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:12,471
        that started off        
      in the fair business,     

32
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,272
       and then they went       
    and opened a restaurant.    

33
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,041
    This is Grammy's Goodies.   

34
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,744
         Chicken Alfredo        
     and a sausage cannoli.     

35
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:21,413
 Best Italian food in the city. 

36
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,482
Giant ravioli for Mackenzie.    

37
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:25,617
  Coming to this place is like  
 going to your grandma's house. 

38
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,820
             FIERI:             
  Because Grammy's is actually  
 filled with grandma's recipes, 

39
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:30,956
      which Vickie Corder,      
        her husband Jeff,       

40
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:34,093
  and their kids first started  
      selling at festivals.     

41
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:35,427
    And when business boomed,   

42
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:38,096
       they expanded into       
   a full-fledged restaurant.   

43
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:39,631
       -What's the story?       
     -I needed a commissary     

44
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,234
  for our concession business.  

45
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:45,504
     We do 50 events a year     
       all over Colorado.       

46
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:49,041
There's no way you are not      
     from Long Island.          

47
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,442
          -Every day...         
           -Every day.          

48
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:51,643
     ...people tell me that.    

49
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,978
     New York looks like me.    
See, that's it.                 

50
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,313
    Jeff's original cannoli.    

51
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,316
  I feel like all the food here 
      is larger than life.      

52
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,917
             Sauce and lasagna. 

53
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,251
             FIERI:             
 Have you seen lasagna that big?

54
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,586
   Not before, no.              

55
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,922
   It's the cheesiest lasagna   
        you'll ever eat.        

56
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,257
          What do we start with?

57
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:06,992
 -My grandmother's Sunday sauce.
          -Okay. Okay.          

58
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,928
Olive oil, pork ribs,           
   and neck bones.              

59
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,330
         -Any prosciut'?        
              -No.              

60
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,397
              How did you know  
               what that was?   

61
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:13,732
Because I'm Italian.            

62
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,200
           You call it prosciut'
                in Denver?      

63
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,269
I call it prosciutto because    
         I'm not...             

64
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:19,071
     BOTH: ...from New York.    

65
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,006
          -Garlic salt.         
        -What's up next?        

66
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,208
She made us put everything      
in the sauce in threes          

67
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:24,876
because it blessed the sauce.   

68
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,144
           -Father...           
        -So, one garlic.        

69
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,546
 ...Son, Holy Ghost.            

70
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:28,947
         That's a lot of garlic.

71
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,482
That's the perfect amount       
       of garlic.               

72
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:33,484
         I thought so, too.     
     That's what I meant to say.

73
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:35,153
   Onion. Parsley.              

74
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,488
           What about the Father
               and the Son?     

75
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,756
I'm saying it to myself.        

76
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,291
      Oh! I want to be in on it.

77
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,161
     Crushed tomatoes.          
Fresh basil. Black pepper.      

78
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:44,630
                    And salt.   
      And salt.                 
Tomato paste goes in.           

79
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:45,630
       And a lot of water.      

80
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,998
          And how long          
     is this going to cook?     

81
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,233
             About three hours. 

82
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:50,102
        -What's up next?        
       -Nana's meatballs.       

83
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:51,369
   Is Nana different the Grammy?

84
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,704
No, I called her Grammy.        

85
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,239
My kids called her Nana.        
                      Nana.     

86
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:57,709
It's half pork, half ground     
beef, mix it together.          

87
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,244
             Now, she taught you
                these recipes   

88
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,445
    by you standing next to her,

89
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:01,980
       or did she just throw you
           right in the mix?    

90
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,782
She had horrible arthritis.     

91
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,250
          -Oh, really?          
      -So, I was her hands.     

92
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:07,986
   Chopped onions,              
 soft bread crumbs.             

93
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,387
   Basil, garlic.               

94
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,256
      You guys love your garlic.

95
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,191
Parsley, Romano cheese...       

96
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,259
           BOTH: Salt.          

97
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:15,860
Black pepper and eggs.          

98
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,262
             How many meatballs 
               will this make?  

99
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:19,197
About that tray's worth.        
                  Okay, good.   

100
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,732
They're about a third           
     of a pound.                

101
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,867
            Ooh, you really coat
              the pan up, huh?  

102
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,203
         We're not just going to
      bake 'em, we're gonna also

103
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:25,470
                  give 'em      
              a little pan fry. 

104
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:26,738
          350 degrees. How long?

105
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:28,473
          -15 minutes.          
            -Next up?           

106
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,141
Whole milk, ricotta cheese.     
                      Okay.     

107
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:31,944
 Black pepper, eggs,            

108
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,012
fresh parsley, mozzarella,      

109
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,348
  provolone blend,              
 and Romano cheese.             

110
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,483
  -How many layers you making?  
         -Probably six.         

111
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,419
         Okay. Just shout it out
       when you know the answer.

112
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,820
You make me so nervous.         

113
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,489
I'm just standing there talking.
     Granted, I'm questioning...

114
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,158
The place of my origin.         

115
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,227
          Well, that we know    
       is just a gigantic farce.

116
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,229
       Did you see her just try 
       to kick me on "Triple D"?

117
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,564
     [ Laughs ]                 

118
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,898
               All right, Vic.  
                Let's see it.   

119
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,168
      Olive oil.                
We line our noodles up.         

120
