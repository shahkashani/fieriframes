1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,201
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,669
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:06,805
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,073
          This trip...          

5
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,942
            You want to get in  
             on some of this?   
    Absolutely.                 

6
00:00:09,944 --> 00:00:12,144
    Things are getting meaty    
        in Flavortown...        

7
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:14,012
There's nothing about that      
    I don't love.               

8
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,416
 ...on the grill, in the smoker,
        and all 'cued up.       

9
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:18,417
             Have you had this? 

10
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:20,585
  In Los Angeles, California... 

11
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,021
  ♪ Oh, whee, oh ♪              

12
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:24,823
   ...a little spot firing up   
          big flavor...         

13
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,091
    Off the hook.               

14
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:28,360
       ...with specialties      
   straight from the Yucatán.   

15
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,362
You learn something new         
  every day, baby.              

16
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,563
     In Las Vegas, Nevada...    

17
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:33,165
This is pizza Picasso.          

18
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,500
           ...a legit           
     east-coast pizzeria...     

19
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,436
 Throw it in there!             

20
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:39,037
       ...mixing barbecue       
       into the bada bing.      

21
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,005
                    Who says?   
       I say.                   

22
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:42,307
    And if we're in Vegas...    

23
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,109
                    Ouch!       

24
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,177
 ...you know we got to check out
           my joint...          

25
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,112
       You guys got to come meet
                  this cat.     

26
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:48,981
   ...and some smoking secrets  

27
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:50,582
   stacked into the sandwich.   

28
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,184
  It's got to have              
the Motley Cue attitude.        

29
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,186
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

30
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:56,688
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

31
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:12,204
    I'm here in Los Angeles,    
   just a few blocks from USC,  

32
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,073
          to check out          
      a funky, little joint     

33
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,474
       that's housed here       
    in the Mercado La Paloma.   

34
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,343
  It's an economic-development  
            building.           

35
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:21,012
    Now, they've got a family   
    in here from the Yucatán    

36
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,949
    that is serving up legit,   
     real-deal Mexican food     

37
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,283
        that you probably       
      haven't seen before.      

38
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,618
      This is Chichén Itza.     

39
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,223
        CETINA: Order up.       
  Chochinita Pibil, table four. 

40
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:32,758
 Chichén Itza's food is amazing.

41
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,758
    Pollo asado.                

42
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,826
                    MAN:        
            Out of control, man.

43
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,229
    Outrageous?                 
       Full-on flavor explosion.

44
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,364
       We got an order up       
         for table six.         

45
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,366
   They have taken the Yucatán  

46
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,902
      and brought the food,     
           the spices,          

47
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,970
  the taste, the texture here.  

48
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,173
             FIERI:             
  That's exactly the tradition  

49
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:51,576
    Chef Gilberto Cetina Jr.    
       wanted to preserve.      

50
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,911
              This is the food  
            that I grew up with.

51
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,446
         This is what my grandma
                used to cook.   

52
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,916
This is what my mom used to cook
          growing up in Yucatán.

53
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,651
 I love it, man.                
     And so do his customers    

54
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:03,522
       ever since his dad       
    opened the joint in 2001.   

55
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,457
          This is very          
      labor-intensive food.     

56
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,925
        You can taste it.       

57
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:08,060
        Longaniza asada.        

58
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:09,460
    So, the longaniza is like   

59
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,797
     a chorizo sausage link.    

60
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:12,731
      It's full of flavor.      

61
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,332
What are we gonna make?         

62
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,734
            The longaniza asada.

63
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,002
  Longaniza asada.              

64
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:18,803
              Very traditional  
               Yucatán style.   

65
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,605
              We're gonna start 
             with pork shoulder,

66
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,808
                 ground fat,    
              and ground beef.  

67
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,809
        Next?                   
                     Oregano.   

68
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,810
               Garlic powder.   

69
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,480
                   Clove.       

70
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,682
                   Onion.       

71
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,417
            Then we're gonna add
                some vinegar.   

72
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,486
     Salt and...                
                        Cumin.  

73
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,620
       Got it.                  

74
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,556
Mix this all by hand.           

75
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,024
        And then we're gonna add
             the achiote paste. 

76
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,960
   Oh, ho-ho, hey.              
   Not going light              
   with that, huh?              

77
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:42,961
               About 4 ounces.  

78
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,896
 This is what gives             
   the great color              

79
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,498
to a lot of Latin food.         

80
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,233
   All right, so,               
 the casing goes on.            

81
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:49,301
           Natural sheep casing.

82
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,304
                Anchor down.    

83
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,573
 Oh, nice and thin.             
                          Yeah. 

84
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,708
  ♪ Oh, whee, oh ♪              

85
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,377
     ♪ Ohh, oh ♪                

86
00:02:58,379 --> 00:02:59,711
                  Perfect.      

87
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:02,181
       Now we're gonna link 'em.

88
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:04,583
        Now,                    
how are we gonna smoke 'em?     

89
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,384
            We're gonna hang 'em
      on a stainless-steel dowel

90
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,119
                over embers.    

91
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,520
         They're gonna sit there
                 overnight.     

92
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,789
A little bit of heat,           
little bit of smoke.            

93
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,591
              Then we're gonna  
                grill these.    

94
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,527
             Here is the sausage
 after being smoked and grilled.

95
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,728
   Serve it with some tortillas,

96
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,731
            fire-roasted onions,
    and then fire-roasted salsa.

97
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,532
          So, everything on here
  was cooked on that same grill.

98
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,902
There is nothing about that     
    I don't love.               

99
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,809
It's a Yucatán hot dog.         

100
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,877
                   [ Chuckles ] 
        Mmm.                    

101
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,013
A little bit of salt,           
   touch of spice,              

102
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,281
great meat-to-fat ratio.        

103
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,051
Definitely get the wood         
   and the smoke.               

104
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,688
 That's fantastic.              
                      Thank you.

105
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,690
  Longaniza asada.              

106
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:45,924
       This is excellent.       

107
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,960
              MAN:              
     Just intense flavor --     

108
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,628
       something different      
   like I've never had before.  

109
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,563
      Panuchos.                 

110
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,966
        Super authentic,        
        really authentic.       

111
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:55,233
We're half Hispanic,            

112
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,968
so this tastes just like        
  my grandma makes.             

113
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,437
                 I love it.     

114
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,106
          This is also          
    a great community space.    

115
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,709
      There's other small,      
    locally owned businesses.   

116
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:06,845
             FIERI:             
   All centered around a main   
    eating and hangout space.   

117
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,513
        MAN: I come here        
  to be able to spend my dollar 

118
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,716
       with really awesome      
      mom-and-pop shops --      

119
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,851
         a lot of really        
       indigenous recipes.      

120
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:13,852
So, what's the next dish?       

121
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:14,986
                  Panucho.      

122
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,255
  WOMAN: Panuchos.              

123
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,257
    It's one of my favorites,   
    and I always order them.    

124
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:19,857
 FIERI: And I'm sticking around 
           to try 'em.          

125
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,193
    Wow!                        
         Coming up next.        

126
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:22,227
    Oh, my gosh!                

127
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,400
   All right, so,               
     we're back                 

128
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,270
   at Chichén Itza              
here in Los Angeles,            

129
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:32,737
    and I got to                
 tell you something.            

130
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,006
    It's taken me               
that much time to recover       

131
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:38,476
 from the fantastic             
  longaniza asada.              

132
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,578
             FIERI:             
     Which is just the start    

133
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,414
         of a long list         
       of real-deal dishes      

134
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,116
   straight from the Yucatán.   

135
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:47,085
        It's very unique.       

136
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,754
  I mean, it's not your typical 
    Mexican-food restaurant.    

137
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,623
FIERI: Have you ever had        
    Yucatán food?               
                        No.     

138
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,558
    This is like                
a free plane ticket.            
                    Absolutely. 

139
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,760
    It's a very different twist.

140
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,428
          I wouldn't necessarily
          call that Mexican food

141
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,896
         if you just sat it down
               in front of me.  

142
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,965
                 Say it has     
            its own personality.

143
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,367
       Order up, table 12!      

144
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:05,904
        The combinations        
       are so delightful.       

145
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,906
       MAN: And they have       
  a really awesome modern spin  

146
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,709
 on some really ancient dishes. 

147
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,044
            Panuchos.           
  It's kind of like a tostada.  

148
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,713
        But it's infused        
     with black-bean paste.     

149
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,382
       And it's delicious.      

150
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,784
     All right,                 
what do we do with this turkey? 

151
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,986
      We're gonna boil the legs,

152
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,320
       and we're gonna sous-vide
                 the breast.    

153
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,722
'Cause that's what you see      
      every day                 

154
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:26,657
in a little kiosk Yucatán joint 
here in Los Angeles.            

155
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,661
To cook the legs in a stock pot,
               we put water...  

156
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,996
                    salt,       
              garlic, oregano.  

157
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:32,997
        Okay.                   
                   Bay leaves...

158
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,866
      black pepper...cilantro...

159
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,336
                  wings...      
              legs and thighs.  

160
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,604
    Like a little               
   court bouillon.              
                      Exactly.  

161
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,472
         Now we're gonna prepare
              the turkey breast 

162
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,074
      for its sous-vide cooking.

163
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,744
Let's get into this.            
     Kosher salt, both sides.   

164
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,214
           Take a sous-vide bag.

165
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,615
        A little bit of cilantro
                  in there.     

166
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,350
   And this is it               
 for the seasoning.             
                   That's it.   

167
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,752
We're gonna vacuum this?        
                      We are.   

168
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,087
        Okay.                   

169
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,021
    150 degrees?                
                        Yeah.   

170
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,890
      How long?                 
                    2 1/2 hours.

171
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,625
       Got it.                  
This is not boiling.            

172
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,627
 This is simmering,             
  but it's precise.             

173
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,496
   Now, the beauty              
 about sous-vide is,            

174
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,031
     you can go                 
for long periods of time --     

175
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,099
and we're talking days --       
to where it's so tender         

176
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,033
that when you open it           
   out of the bag,              

177
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,035
it'll just fall apart.          

178
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,170
            So, we're gonna make
              the tortillas now 

179
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,905
               for the panuchos.

     Tortillas.                 

180
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,440
            So, we're gonna make
           little balls of masa.

181
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:16,441
                 In it goes.    

182
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,914
[ Normal voice ] So, why is this
going to puff up open?          

183
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,583
Mine don't often puff up.       

184
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:27,251
              Once both layers  
             are cooked evenly, 

185
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,920
               you press down   
              on the tortilla.  

186
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,589
             It generates steam 
                and puffs up.   

187
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:32,657
              And there it is.  

188
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,859
You learn something new         
  every day, baby.              

189
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,261
        Okay.                   
                   Open it up.  

190
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:39,364
          Some black-bean puree.
  Okay.                         

191
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,999
               Cover the hole.  
             You spread it out. 

192

      Love it.                  

193
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,534
        Now we're gonna fry 'em.

194
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,404
         Double-cooked tortilla.

195
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:46,805
     All right,                 
 here we are, Chef.             

196
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,607
 All right, so, we're gonna make
            the achiote marinade

And put 'em on the grill.       

199
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,146
All right, so, we're gonna start
         with some achiote paste

200
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,081
               and then fresh,  
                sour oranges.   

201
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,149
     I love it.                 

202
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,817
                 Some salt.     

203
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,486
           Now we're gonna paint
                 the turkey.

   going in here,               

205
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,624
and they're gonna go            
    on the grill.               
                       Yeah.    

206
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,628
Then we're gonna shred          
the meat off of the turkey?     

207
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,962
                   Right.       

208
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,531
Which part is the panucho?      

209
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,566
            This is the panucho.
   That's the panucho.          

210
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,501
                   This is      
        the traditional panucho.

211
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:17,969
      This is what you would get

212
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,771
       if you go eat at a market
          or mercado in Yucatán.

213
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,440
          Little bit of lettuce.

214
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,778
        Some of the shredded leg
           and sous-vide breast.

215
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,048
        Some pickled red onions,
                   tomato.      

216
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,182
         And a slice of avocado.

And that's all she wrote?       

218
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,752
            That is the panucho.

219
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:40,492
        Man!                    
It's so tender, delicious.      

220
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,997
   Really simple,               
 but done correctly.            

221
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:48,934
I've had a lot of tacos.        

222
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:50,802
 I really appreciate            
    Mexican food.               

223
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,604
    It's subtle.                
   It's authentic.              

224
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,139
That's a nostalgic dish.        

225
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,209
    Oh, my gosh!                

226
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,478
            Panuchos.           

227
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,614
    This is a very delightful   
        and complex dish.       

228
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,017
     What is your favorite thing
             about these tacos? 

229
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,553
 Well, I really like            
  how it's crunchy,             

230
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:13,158
but the avocado gives it        
a wet texture at the same time. 

231

          [ Laughter ]          

232
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,695
      Order up, table four!     

233
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:19,030
   WOMAN: I know I will never   
        be disappointed.        

234
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,031
       I love their food.       

235
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,035
  Authentic, baby.              
     Real deal.                 

236
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,403
                  Thank you.    
 Off the hook.

        FIERI: Coming up        
     in Las Vegas, Nevada...    

238
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,710
 It's gorgeous pie.             

239
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,512
       A pizzeria betting       
      on their barbecue...      

240
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,446
          You're a pizza joint. 
Yeah, but we got                
to be different.                

241
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,916
  ...and winning big on Philly. 
                I've eaten      
          a lot of cheesesteaks.

242
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,317
               I've never seen  
      this pepper game going on.

243
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,027
         So, here I am,         

244
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,895
about 15 miles west of the Strip
      in Las Vegas, Nevada,     

245
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,230
 in an area known as The Lakes, 

246
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,898
  and what do you get up here?  

247
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,434
 Well, you get really nice cars,
   you get really nice houses,  

248
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,970
  and, of course, you'd expect  
  to find two dudes from Jersey 

249
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,372
  and one from California that  
   are serving up great pizza.  

250
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,675
    This is Those Guys Pies.    

251
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,312
 Italian white up in the window!

252
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:10,315
      The best pizza by far     
          in Las Vegas.         

253
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:11,916
      All right, your Greek pie.

254
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,585
 It stands up there with some of
   the best pizza in New York.  

255
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,922
             FIERI:             
  That's because behind the pie 
   are two Jersey transplants,  

256
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,525
   Roy Bass and Colin O'Leary,  

257
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:23,595
 who wanted to bring a big taste
  of their childhood out west.  

258
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:27,065
  I found somebody as passionate
             about pizza as me, 

259
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,133
               and we decided   
            to start a business.

260
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:32,337
           Top it off           
  with co-owner Chris Builder,  

261
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,874
          and in 2012,          
      Vegas got Those Guys.     

262
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,676
18-inch cheese up in the window!

263
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:40,345
How close is this to real-deal, 
old-school, east-coast pizza?   

264
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:41,812
               Off the charts.  

265
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:45,149
  But Roy's not afraid to break 
   tradition on his toppings.   

266
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,085
       Barbecue maui wowi       
         in the window!         

267
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,754
   Pork, jalapeños, pineapple,  
         barbecue sauce.        

268
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,690
        Every ingredient        
     complements each other.    

269

                   FIERI:       
            Let's get into this.

270
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,493
We're gonna start making        
  our barbecue rub.             

271
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:56,561
   Brown sugar...               

272
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,096
  smoked paprika...             
    kosher salt.                

273
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,163
                    Okay.       

274
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,498
A little bit of cinnamon...     

275
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,633
  cayenne pepper...             

276
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:02,834
      garlic...                 

277
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,169
crushed red pepper...           

278
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,236
 granulated onion...            

279
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,105
and coarse ground pepper.       

280
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,507
       Mix this all up together.
   Yeah.                        

281
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,776
             Rub the pork butt. 

282
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,378
 Put it in a walk-in            
 for about 24 hours.            

283
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,047
       Okay, then to the smoker.
  Yeah.                         

284
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,982
        How many hours was that?
    16.                         

285
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,584
   We're gonna do               
a little shred on it.           

286
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,120
Now we're gonna season          
      our pork.                 

287
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,722
       We make                  
a house-pickled jalapeño.       

288
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:24,922
  We're gonna take              

289
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,057
 some of that juice             
from our pickling jalapeño      

290
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,460
and put that on there.          

291
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,395
        What are we making now? 
House-made barbecue sauce.      

292
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,463
           You're a pizza joint.
  Yeah, but we got              
  to be different.              

293
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,464
                 All right.     

294
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,665
  We're gonna start             
    with bacon...               

295
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,868
   some garlic...               
       onions.                  

296
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,135
      Okay, so, it renders down.

297
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,938
So, then we're gonna use        
a little bit of liquid smoke,   

298
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,606
      vinegar.                  

299
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,875
 Some brown sugar...            
little bit of Dijon mustard.    

300
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:44,943
                "Little bit"?   

301
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:47,078
  We got the honey,             
 and then molasses.             

302
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,412
                     Molasses.  
        Yes.                    

303
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,282
    Chili sauce...              
a little bit of ketchup.        
                    Busy guy.   

304
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,017
And then, boom, black pepper.   

305
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,020
          So, this cooks down...
For about 35 minutes.           

306
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:59,090
     All right,                 
gonna make the maui wowi.       

307
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,558
 I got to wear this             
 to the prom later.             

308
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,093
          I won't get you dirty,
              I promise, okay?  

309
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,562
That's big skin, man.           
What size pie is this?          

310
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:05,764
              This is gonna be  
               an 18-inch pie.  

311
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,865
   Barbecue sauce               
mixed with pizza sauce.         

312
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,100
                 Yes, 50/50.    

313
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,701
This is pizza Picasso.          

314
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,570
          Whole-milk mozzarella.

315
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,305
      Pulled pork that we smoke.

316
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,174
             Now we're gonna do 
                house bacon.    

317
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,976
     So you cure                
   your own bacon?              
                       Yes, sir.

318
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,844
      Never can be too much pork
               in a pizzeria.   

319
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,379
         We got fresh pineapple.

320
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:24,049
 You get caught from            
your friends on the east coast  

321
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,717
  putting pineapple             
    on a pizza...               

322
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,452
               We're gonna get  
              a couple e-mails. 

323
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:30,187
         Then our own jalapeños.

324
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,457
           We're gonna finish it
                   just...      

325
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,058
          with a little sprinkle
                 of cheese.     

326
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,327
  What temperature              
   is the oven at?              
                       550.     

327
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,661
    Can we throw it in the oven?
Throw it in there!              

328
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,798
    That's right!               

329
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,399
               9, 10 minutes.   
    [ Whistles ]                

330
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,468
    We're gonna add a little bit
             of cilantro to it. 

331
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,237
It's a gorgeous pie.            

332
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,277
       This is legit pizza, man.

333
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,612
              It doesn't taste  
            like barbecue sauce.

334
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:55,814
             You don't get lost 
                  in that.      

335
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:58,883
              It's like smoky,  
           bacon-y tomato sauce.

336
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,418
      The jalapeños are spot-on.

337
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,820
         The crust is fantastic.

338
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,221
              Just get a couple 

339
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,756
     of those little sweet bites
           out of the pineapple.

340
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,424
            Smoking in the pork,
    making your own ingredients,

341
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,692
       making your own sauces --

342
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:09,694
   I would drive up to The Lakes
              just to get this. 

343
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,296
  Appreciate that.              
     Thank you.                 

344
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,564
     All right,                 
we got your barbecue maui wowi. 

345
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:17,334
   Has the perfect combination  
   of salty, sweet, and spicy.  

346
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:20,905
One of my ways to find out      
if you've got really good pizza 

347
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,774
is to talk to one of            
my ATO fraternity brothers.     

348
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,309
We've had some bad pizza        
     in our day.                

349
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,243
                  Horrible.     

350
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,578
How would this have done?       

351
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,579
             This is fantastic. 

352
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,047
              A pie like this,  

353
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,048
              you got to drive  
                across town.    

354
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,385
       It's a small place       
   that's off the beaten path,  

355
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,254
      kind of hard to find.     

356
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,057
     It's one of those          
     places you hear about,     
     word gets around.          

357
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,658
      It's just this little     
           hidden gem.          

358
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,060
What else do you like           
    on the menu?                

359
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:43,060
        Best cheesesteak around.

360
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,196
        Works cheesesteak       
        up in the window!       

361
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,598
      It's like                 
going back to Philly.           
                  Absolutely.   

362
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,201
   We're gonna do               
a pickled green pepper          

363
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,468
for our steak sandwich          

364
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,238
because the green pepper        
can't just be a green pepper.   

365
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,607
                  Who says?     
    I say.                      

366
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,408
                       Okay.    
   Those Guys say.              

367
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,546
So, we got rice wine vinegar,   
   cider vinegar.               

368
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:03,281
               Sugar and salt.  

369
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,282
    Brown sugar.                

370
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:08,152
   Garlic, onion,               
and 3 gallons of water.         

371
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,554
                 I've eaten     
          a lot of cheesesteaks.

372
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:10,821
               I've never seen  
      this pepper game going on.

373
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,757
That's why our cheesesteaks     
are a unique cheesesteak.       

374
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,558
 And we're gonna put            
the peppers inside here         

375
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,362
and pour everything in there    
and put it in the walk-in.      

376
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:18,629
             Okay, let's do it. 

377
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,899
We're gonna start with          
a nice little handful of onions,

378
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,500
and we got green peppers.       

379
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:23,701
And then a little bit           
    of mushroom.                

380
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:26,036
              This is rib-eye?  
This is rib-eye.                

381
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,572
We're gonna do a little         
seasoning on this meat.         

382
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:28,973
              We're only making 
                one sandwich.   

383
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,307
 I don't like people            
to leave my store hungry.       

384
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,777
Chop it up nice and fine.       

385
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,178
        Do you see the technique

386
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,847
  where he's holding the one out
     and bringing this one down?

387
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,582
               It's gangster.   

388
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:38,850
     All right.                 
 We're almost there.            

389
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,318
White American cheese.          

390
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,053
              White American -- 
          nice, four big slices.

391
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:43,321
 You ready for this?            

392
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,390
I'm gonna fold that cheese      
inside of the sandwich.         

393
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:47,191
                    Yeah.       

394
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,460
This is -- Whoa, I don't want   
to take you out, Guy.           

395
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,128
        Boom.                   

396
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,665
              I do like that -- 
         the cheese tucked away.

397
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,003
             You want to get in 
              on some of this?  

398
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,005
Oh, absolutely, sir.            
     Absolutely.                

399
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,607
       Ready?                   

400
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,142
        Mmm.                    

401
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,945
           I like how you tucked
             the cheese into bed

402
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,613
              and that meat --  
              nice medium-rare. 

403
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,951
    That's one of the most legit
            I've had in a while,

404
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,018
                but you know    
             what the kicker is?

405
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,154
                It's the acid   
      of that green bell pepper.

406
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,789
             It's what takes it 
             to the next level. 

407
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,827
 Had a lot of other cheesesteaks
          here in town,         

408
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:25,096
       but nobody compares      
   to what they put out here.   

409
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,631
             WOMAN:             
     Your works cheesesteak.    

410
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,098
              MAN:              
    You just close your eyes.   

411
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,367
    You'll think you're back    
      on the Jersey Shore.      

412
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,634
  I got a meatball coming out!  

413
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,370
       Probably my favorite     
    place to eat here in Vegas. 

414
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,571
       FIERI:                   
This is the kind of joint       

415
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:34,972
that when people watch          
"Triple D," they go,            

416
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,574
 "I don't even know             
how to get to The Lakes,        

417
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:39,510
but get me a cab off the Strip. 
I want to go see that joint."   

418
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:40,979
   Nice job, guys.              
  Congratulations.              

419
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,984
         FIERI: Up next,        
  we're headed to the Strip...  

420
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:47,051
                 All right.     
     I like where this is going.

421
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,453
       ...for a crazy look      
         at my joint...         

422
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,921
Take us down the road,          
        Chef.                   
    ...back in the kitchen...   

423
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,091
We've taken the Vegas fries     
  to another level.             

424
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,926
     ...and behind the bar.     

425
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,394
   This is exactly what you need
   after a rough night in Vegas.

426
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,870
Welcome back, Mr. Fieri.        
           Thank you.           

427
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,205
             Listen,            
  if you would've ever told me  

428
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,473
       that I was gonna be      
      on the Food Network,      

429
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:09,540
      I'd say you're crazy.     

430
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,541
     And if you ever told me    

431
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:11,609
      I was gonna come back     
          to Las Vegas          

432
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,211
    and open my own restaurant  
           on the Strip,        

433
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,611
I'd say you're out of your mind,

434
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,948
    so I guess that makes you   
   crazy<i> and</i> out of your mind?  

435
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,349
         'Cause I'm here        
   at The Linq Hotel & Casino   

436
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:19,483
     to check out my joint.     

437
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,552
             This is            
   Guy's Vegas Kitchen + Bar.   

438
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,691
 Pick it up, sashimi won tacos! 

439
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:28,025
       It's unbelievable.       

440
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,960
        WOMAN: All right,       
  bacon mac-and-cheese burger.  

441
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,964
     It reminds me of Guy --    
 a lot of energy going on here. 

442
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,499
       WOMAN: Kind of goes      
    with the flow of Vegas --   

443
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,167
      super-good vibe, fun.     

444
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,701
        So, now it's time       
         to meet the cat        

445
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,771
        that came up with       
      all the crazy ideas.      

446
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,506
    Chef, come on in, please.   

447
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:42,573
             So, Chef, tell me, 

448
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,641
        what was the inspiration
             behind Guy's Vegas?

449
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:45,976
  Going to college              
    in Las Vegas,               

450
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,312
 always coming down             
    to the Strip,               

451
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,514
I always just thought about     
having a cool, little,          

452
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:51,983
funky joint that served         
just righteous food.            

453
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:54,986
You felt comfortable            
coming back multiple times.     

454
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,521
That's what we made here.       

455
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,255
      But with all my time      
          on the road,          

456
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:01,259
  you know I need a solid team  
         to back me up,         

457
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:04,395
         and I got that,        
    led by Chef Tony Leitera.   

458
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,996
Number-one-selling item         
  on the menu is...             

459
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,331
          Mac-and-cheese burger.

460
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,068
   The number-two               
best-selling sandwich?          
                  Motley Cue.   

461
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,002
          Here, we have         
    the Motley Cue sandwich.    

462
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,805
    Watching this pulled-pork   
       sandwich come out,       

463
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,539
     my mouth was watering.     

464
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,741
Take us down the road, Chef.    

465
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,342
        We got our Danish collar
                 pork butt.     

466
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:19,811
              We're gonna make  
       the rub for it right now.

467
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,679
      This is our brown sugar...

468
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,148
                kosher salt,    
              garlic, cayenne.  

469
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,283
      Paprika.                  

470
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,351
              We got our chili, 
                brown cloves,   

471
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,020
                black pepper,   
         a little bit of nutmeg.

472
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,422
When you name it after          
your barbecue team, Motley Cue, 

473
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:32,824
  it's got to have              
the Motley Cue attitude.        

474
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:35,026
   All right, so,               
we're gonna dry-rub this.       

475
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:36,693
 Now, when you walk             
into this restaurant,           

476
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:37,895
you're thinking, "Okay,         
where's the big smoker?         

477
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:39,730
Why don't I smell it?"          
Because it's in the basement.   

478
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,231
So, we're gonna let this go     
    for 12 hours.               

479
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,166
      Set 220.                  
                     Yeah.      

480
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,302
The pork butt's done.           
                          Yeah. 

481
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:46,703
        Okay,                   
you look at all that bark,      

482
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,306
all that great smoked flavor,   
and it's super tender.          

483
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,976
Drop it in a little bit         
of that pan dripping.           

484
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:52,977
   Now, the other               
   great thing is,              

485
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,245
we have this pretzel roll       
    made for us.                

486
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:55,713
            We're gonna cut this
                  in half.      

487
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:56,981
  It's got to have              
a little garlic butter          

488
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,916
     just to add                
that extra bit of flavor,       

489
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:00,518
but you got to put              
a little crust                  
on the outside of this.         

490
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,320
  So, you're gonna              
   toast that off?              
                        Yeah.   

491
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,854
  Next up.                      
                   We got       
           our toasted bun here.

492
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,125
              We're gonna start 
          with our donkey sauce.

493
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,993
 It's a combination             
of a little mustard,            

494
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,061
a little mayonnaise,            
a little Worcestershire,        

495
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:11,996
a little black pepper,          
  a little garlic.              

496
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,331
                  So, next,     
    we're gonna melt the cheese.

497
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,332
      Cheddar.                  
        Okay.                   

498
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,801
          First thing's first --
                  pickles.      

499
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:19,203
         We got our citrus slaw.

500
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,471
       And then we got our pork.

501
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:21,605
  Then we're gonna              
    garnish it up               

502
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,739
  with a little bit             
of my barbecue sauce.           

503
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,142
             Bourbon/brown sugar
               barbecue sauce,  

504
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,476
     and a touch of the Carolina

505
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,345
        just to add a little bit
         of that vinegar flavor.

506
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,413
 The two together --            
      perfect.                  

507
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,617
     We don't do                
just one kind of fry.           

508
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:35,086
This is how the fries           
get served up every time.       

509
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,088
Shoestring, crinkle cut,        
     sidewinder,                

510
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,357
 and everybody loves            
  a waffle, right?              

511
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,693
   Chef, go ahead               
and jump in on that.            

512
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,163
        Mmm!                    

513
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,497
    Great smoke,                

514
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,132
a little bit of the sweet,      
a little bit of the vinegar.    

515
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,569
The crunch of the slaw,         

516
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,036
    a little bit                
of that acid coming through,    

517
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,705
     pickles --                 
you got to have the pickles --  

518
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,040
and then this nice pretzel bun  

519
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,642
with the little leathery skin   
on the outside -- very nice.    

520
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,444
             WOMAN:             
  And your Motley Cue sandwich. 

521
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,046
Absolutely tender and delicious.

522
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,515
    You get the sweet           
    and the salty with it.      
    It's really good.           

523
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,717
This is Dan Geraldo, one        
of my roommates from college.   

524
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,985
               This is typical  
               Guy Fieri food.  

525
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:10,654
     This is what you used to do
               when we roomed,  

526
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:11,989
     and I would just be amazed.

527
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,390
  This is Professor             
  John Stefanelli.              

528
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,859
He's a professor at UNLV.       

529
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,527
      I had him                 
for all kinds of classes.       

530
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,595
How do you think we're doing?   

531
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,464
        The food is great       
        because it's you.       

532
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,200
      It's definitely you.      

533
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:23,267
    FIERI: Which means I put    

534
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,403
       plenty on the menu       
        "Triple D"-style        

535
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,805
   that you don't need a fork   
     and knife to dig into.     

536
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,807
   The fireball whiskey wings.  

537
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:30,875
  What do you think             
    of the wings?               

538
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:31,875
    They're just incredible.    

539
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,011
Good crunch in the wing?        
        Yeah, definitely.       

540
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:35,680
          Here, we have         
    the Vegas fries for you.    

541
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:37,014
  Bleu cheese crumbled on top,  

542
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,283
     and then you can spread    
 a little buffalo sauce over it.

543
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,751
    Best fries I've ever had.   

544
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,486
We've taken the Vegas fries     
  to another level.             

545
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,555
          So, what we have here,
     they're sidewinder fries...

546
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:47,024
       Frank's hot sauce powder.

547
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:50,294
Now we just give them a little  
spritz of the wing sauce.       

548
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,564
 Okay, a little bit             
   of bleu cheese.              

549
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,132
                    Yeah.       

550
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,901
   Just top it off with a little
             carrots and celery.

551
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:59,837
  This is our Frank's and butter
            and bleu-sabi sauce.

552
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,707
Give this a nice little bath    
 of the wing sauce.             

553
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,041
Nice butter, vinegar,           
   cayenne pepper.              

554
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:05,743
     Little dip                 
in the bleu-sabi bleu.          

555
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:07,845
        Mmm!                    

556
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:10,114
    It's crunchy.               
     It's tangy.                

557
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:11,315
It's totally buffalo.           

558
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,583
   Well done, man.              

559
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,919
 Here, we have the Vegas fries. 

560
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,387
            Love it.            
      The sauces are good.      

561
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:17,654
        The one is spicy,       

562
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,855
     and then the other one     
   cools it down a little bit,  

563
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,724
     so if you mix them up,     
      they're just perfect.
