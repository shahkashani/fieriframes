        A SEAFOOD BUFFET FOR 90.

 ADD A LITTLE GARLIC,           
FRESH TOMATO, BASIL...          

210
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,470

           THAT GETS SERVED UP, 

214
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,147
         THAT CALAMARI WILL COOK
              IN THAT SAUCE.    
RIGHT.                          

215
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,415

             TO EAT WAS SEAFOOD,

219
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:20,025
       I DON'T THINK I WOULD GET
          THAT MUCH SEAFOOD.    

220
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:24,195
       LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT    
   THE JUICE. LOOK AT THE SAUCE.

221
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:30,301
      THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD  
     HAVE DONE THIS ANY BETTER. 

222
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,836
          THE PASTA'S AL DENTE. 

223

00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,832
        WHY WE COME HERE        
       IS FOR THE SALMON.       
WE HAVE A SALMON RUB--

LIBERAL AMOUNT.

KIND OF OFFSET IT AND LET IT    
 COOK FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES.     

394
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:56,914
GIVE IT A LITTLE DIRECT HEAT    
 AND THEN PULL IT BACK OFF.     

395
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,916
      SO OVERALL, YOU'RE TAKING 
      ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF? 

396
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,853

00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,805
               IF SHE BLEACHES  
             HER HAIR, I'M DONE.

481
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,473
   SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP,  

482
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,075
        BUT WE GOT PLENTY       
      MORE JOINTS TO FIND.      

483
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,611
     I'LL BE LOOKING FOR YOU    
     NEXT TIME ON TRIPLE D.     

484
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,615
TELL ME ABOUT THE OMELET-INFUSED
    VODKA YOU'VE BEEN DOING.    

485
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:53,817
          I WANT TO HAVE SOME   
      OF THAT LIVER-INFUSED GIN.

486
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:57,989
     I THINK I FEEL LIKE A FRIED
      CHICKEN MOJITO COMING ON. 
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.
