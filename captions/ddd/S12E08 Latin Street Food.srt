      SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS,       

190
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:45,864
       ABOUT TEN MINUTES        
       FROM THE AIRPORT.        

191
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,999
      NOW WE'VE SHOT A LOT      
   OF GREAT JOINTS DOWN HERE,   

192
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,935
 AND PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY IT'S ALL 
 ABOUT THE TEX-MEX FOOD, RIGHT? 

193
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,671
        WELL, THE PLACE         
      I'M ABOUT TO VISIT--      

194
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,272
 PEOPLE MAY THINK IT'S TEX-MEX, 

195
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,875
   BUT I HEAR IT'S ALL ABOUT    
  LATIN AMERICAN STREET FOOD.   

196
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:59,945
        THIS IS BETO'S.         
  (man) ALL RIGHT,              
I GOT A FISH TACO UP.           

197
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:02,480
               THE FOOD IS      
         CONSISTENTLY DELICIOUS.

198
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,149
I LOVE THIS PLACE.              
     THIS IS A UNIQUE RESTAURANT
           FOR SAN ANTONIO.

 NOT ANY WAY                    
LIKE TEX-MEX.                   

200
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:11,756
      I USUALLY JUST GO STRAIGHT
          FOR THE EMPANADAS.    
NOBODY DOES EMPANADAS           
  LIKE BETO'S DOES.

A SUPEREXPENSIVE TOMATO         

211
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,648

    THIS IS WHERE THE OOEY-GOOEY
         COMES--OUR CHEESE.     

242

CONTEMPORARY ATTITUDE           

256
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,280
   TOWARDS WHAT I THINK         
PEOPLE THINK LATIN FOOD IS,     

257
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,948
      AND YOU TAKE TIME

        COOKING THIS PUPPY UP.  

278
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,066

290
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,695
LET IT SIT HERE AND STEW        
  TWO TO THREE HOURS?           
                        EXACTLY.

              THE SKINS OFF.

                       HOT.     

378
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,908
 NOW THAT THE MASA'S GROUND,    
I HAVE TO PUT IT IN THE MIXER   

379
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,042
TO MAKE A DOUGH BALL            

380
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,312
                AND TRANSFER IT 
               INTO THE MACHINE.
THIS THING IS SMOKIN'-HOT.      

381
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,714

CORN NUGGETS                    

466
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:35,079
ARE WHAT KEEPS ME               
  COMING BACK.                  
     <i> THAT'D BE NIXTAMAL--</i>      

467
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:37,815
      <i> CORN THAT'S COOKED</i>       
          <i> AND RINSED.</i>          

468
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,884
     SO ONCE THE SKIN COMES OFF,
          IT'S POZOLE TIME.     

469
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:43,354
POZOLE, YES.                    
               (inhales sharply)
                 I LOVE POZOLE. 

470
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:46,157
     MY JOWLS ARE JUST FLOODING.
          IT'S LIKE NIAGARA.    

471
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:49,693
             LET'S GET IT GOING.
        ALL RIGHT.              
SEAR OUR MEAT IN OLIVE OIL.     

472
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,229
             WHAT PART OF<i> LE</i> PIG
                   IS THAT?     
SHOULDER.                       

473
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,232
       SKIN ON, THE WHOLE THING.
      THEN I ADD                
SOME SALT AND PEPPER.           

474
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:57,301
          SEAR BOTH SIDES. OKAY.
RIGHT. ADD WATER.               

475
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,370
  AND YOU'RE GONNA LET THIS COOK
    LOW AND SLOW FOR HOW LONG?  

476
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:02,306
ABOUT AN HOUR UNTIL THE MEAT    
   IS SOFT, AND CUBE IT.        
                           OKAY.

477
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,374
                 AND AFTER THAT?
MAKE THE SEASONING              
  FOR THE BROTH.                

478
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,044
GARLIC--<i> AJO--</i>                  
AND THE ONION.                  
                       <i> CEBOLLA.</i>

479
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,579
           DO YOU SPEAK SPANISH?
<i> Sí, UN POCO.</i>                   

480
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,314
               YEAH, I KNOW     
         ABOUT "PINOCCHIO," TOO,

481
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,850
         BUT I THINK IT'S--     
   I THINK IT'S AN ITALIAN BOOK.

482
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:16,053
 OREGANO, SALT, AND THEN        
WE'RE GONNA ADD SOME BROTH      

483
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:18,789
  FROM THE ALREADY              
COOKED PORK.<i> GRACIAS.</i>           

484
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:22,059
                      <i> DE NADA.</i> 
THEN WE'RE JUST GONNA           
     MIX IT UP.                 

485
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,595
                DROP THE HAMMER!

486
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,397
THAT'S GOOD.                    
                           OKAY.

487
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:29,066
  NOW LET'S PUT THE NIXTAMAL    
INTO THE HOT WATER. IT'LL BOIL. 

488
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,802
                  ABOUT AN HOUR?
YES, UNTIL THE CORN             
    PLUMPS UP.                  

489
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,938
                     COOLS DOWN.
ADD IT TO OUR BROTH             

490
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,940
WITH THE WATER.                 
           'CAUSE THAT'S FLAVOR.

491
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:37,942
                    GO. GO.     
              (whispering) YEAH.

492
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:40,411
 ADD OUR SEASONING              
THAT WE BLENDED UP.             

493
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:43,347
 ADD OUR MEAT                   
THAT WE CUBED.                  
                  (normal voice)
                  AND THE BONES?

494
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,149
AND THE BONES. THE BONE'S       
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART.        
           TONS OF FLAVOR THERE.

495
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,219
            SO EVERYTHING--     
      THAT ENTIRE PORK SHOULDER.

496
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:50,554
       LET THIS ALL COME BACK UP
              TO A SIMMER.      
45 MINUTES TO AN HOUR.          

497
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:54,025
             DIDN'T YOU MAKE ANY
                FOR YOURSELF?   
I MADE SOME FOR YOU.            

498
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,193
THE POZOLE'S READY.             
                   LOOK AT THAT.

499
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,962
             THE GREAT THING    
         ABOUT POZOLE IS YOU CAN

500
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:00,231
                KINDA SEASON IT 
               THE WAY YOU WANT.

   LETTUCE, OREGANO.

          EVERYBODY IN THE POOL.

503
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:07,038
I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST TIME   
  I'VE SEEN THAT TECHNIQUE.     

504
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,573
                (laughs) WELL...
