00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,851
The pork is about               
as ridiculously tender          
as you can imagine.             

236
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,187
It's not over seasoned.         

237
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,121
        Mmm.                    

238
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,323
You added liquid smoke          

239
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,458
 because typically,             
this is cooked in a pit,        

240
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,394
so you're getting a little bit  
of that smoke imparted into it. 

241
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:43,929
    But it's not                
    super smokey.               

242
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,799
   It's not fishy,              
but it is definitely island.    

243
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:50,936
It reminds me of Hawaii.        

244
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,672
Nice job.                       
            Thank you very much.

245
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,339
             Laulau.            

246
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,676
This is about as good           
as any Laulau I've ever had.    

247
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:59,010
                   WOMAN:       
     It's such an amazing taste.

248
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,211
It's a little unique.           
                         It is. 

249
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,881
Once you get that appreciation  
   for it, it's...              

250
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:03,882
                   It's good.   
...rock star.                   

251
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,617
           Here's your          
     fried Hawaiian Royale.     

252
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:08,553
This is the closest thing to    
like the way my family cooks it.

253
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,255
        Yeah.                   

254
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,092
No wonder Gene Simmons          
     comes here.                

255
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,693
  The guy could eat             
anywhere in the world he wants, 

256
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:16,761
 and he comes here.             

257
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:19,497
  The appreciation              
  and the respect               

258
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,100
and the desire you have         
to do this authentic --         

259
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,034
  Impressive, man.              
                     Thank you. 

260
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,169
      Nice job.                 
                     Thank you. 

261
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,374
  FIERI: Coming up, I'm headed  
     down to Garden Grove...    

262
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,508
Today is my lucky day.          

263
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,043
   ...to a family-run joint...  

264
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,578
I followed the rainbow.         

265
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,348
      ...that's serving up      
        the mad Mexican.        
You're my pot of gold.          

266
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,524
          So, I'm here          
  in Garden Grove, California,  

267
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,926
    right off the 22 freeway    
      on Harbor Boulevard,      

268
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,329
 about 3½ miles from Disneyland.

269
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:54,332
  I'm here to check out a joint 
where I hear this Mexican family

270
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:58,536
 put it all on the line to open 
  and own their own restaurant  

271
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,939
          and serve up          
     real-deal Mexican food.    

272
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,741
        This is Sabroso!        

273
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,545
         MAN: One torta.        

274
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,381
       I can't say enough       
  about how good everything is. 

275
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,817
      Chamorro ready to go.     

276
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,153
  Every bite is a magical bite. 

277
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,487
          It's perfect.         

278
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,557
Really has the sazón of         
the family, and you really --   

279
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,025
                 The sazón.     
  Sazón.                        

280
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:21,927
The flavor of the family.       

281
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,696
             FIERI:             
 That would be the Muñoz family,

282
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:27,498
   with veteran chef papa Tito  
       leading the charge.      

283
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,034
           Have you always been 
         this close of a family?

284
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:30,468
                All the time.   

285
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,571
                We always did   
       a lot of things together.

286
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:36,374
     Like taking the plunge     
 and opening this joint in 2012 

287
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,044
           with a menu          
     based on Mom's recipes.    

288
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,980
 WOMAN: This food is delicious, 
   it's fresh, it's flavorful.  

289
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,781
     You just can't go wrong    
         with anything.         

290
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,584
      What's your favorite thing
                 on the menu?   
           The tamale.          

291
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,587
       Pork tamale ready.       

292
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,588
         It's the best.         

293
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,523
       We're gonna make tamales.

294
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:52,657
      Tamales.                  

295
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,659
          I'm gonna do the pork.
   Pork tamale.                 

296
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,594
     So, we're gonna put in a --

297
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,796
      Pork butt                 
that's been just cut up.        

298
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,533
            Cook it in the water
               with some salt,  

299
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:04,535
                some onions,    
              Mexican oregano.  

300
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,471
                   garlic,      
               and bay leaves.  

301
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,939
And we're just gonna            
    cook it down?               

302
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,207
                Cook it down.   

303
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,076
  The rest of this              
   goes in there?               
                           Yes. 

304
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,743
                Mexican oregano.
  Okay.                         

305
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,813
                   Black pepper.
 Black peppercorns.             
       Got it.                  

306
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,948
  The onion.                    
                 Onions. Garlic.

307
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,550
                          Cumin.
Cumin seeds. Got it.            

308
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:20,952
                  Allspice.     
Then we're gonna put some water.

309
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,087
                Where's my --   

310
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:23,355
Well, why don't we put the water
  from the peppers?             

311
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,492
What does "Sabroso" mean?       

312
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:28,627
                 Delicious.     

313
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,295
      Sabroso.                  

314
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,233
               We're gonna add  
                the peppers.    

315
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,635
             That's the guajillo
               and California.  

316
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,371
   Chile de arbol.              

317
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,440
        Okay.                   

318
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,375
      Now we go                 
   to the hot oil?              
                          Yes.  

319
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,511
Got to strain it a little bit   
'cause there's some solid.      

320
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,446
          [ Sizzling ]          
                This is what    
             you want to hear.  

321
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,315
   Oh, that sauce.              

322
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,251
 My mouth is just --            
the flavor jets are turning on. 

323
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,586
How long is that gonna cook,    
        chef?                   

324
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:55,854
                 20 minutes.    

325
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:56,988
And then we'll be ready to take 
and add it to the pork.         

326
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,657
                There you go.   

327
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,663
So, now we have the masa.       

328
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,665
                    Yes.        

329
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,266
             Gonna put the salt.

330
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,734
 Little baking soda.            
                          Yes.  

331
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,069
To puff it a little bit.        

332
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,738
       Add some more shortening.

333
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,208
 Now we're gonna put            
the pork stock into the masa.   

334
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,877
         Then we're gonna start 
      mixing it up all together.

335
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,279
 So, I got the pork.            

336
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,214
        Mmm!                    

337
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,016
      Oh, yeah.                 

338
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,284
      Sabroso.                  

339
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,087
       Skins.                   
                  The masa.     

340
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,354
        Okay.                   

341
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,223
You soften them in the water    
 so they're pliable.            

342
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,291
                There you go.   

343
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:36,094
        Okay.                   

344
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:37,295
        Over?                   
                   Just roll it.

345
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,430
                There you go.   

346
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,699
                  You know      
            how to make tamales.

347
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,500
I've made a few tamales         
     in my day.                 

348
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:45,036
This is a tamale pot.           

349
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,405
See how that sits above         
the water as they cook?         

350
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:52,677
  All right, chef.              
      We ready?                 

351
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,914
        Whoa!                   

352
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,817
                Look at that.   

353
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,590
 They're delicious.             
The masa has great texture.     

354
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:06,791
The pork is delicious.          

355
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,259
   Not too spicy.               

356
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,727
And you got a good ratio.       

357
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,397
It's not a bunch of masa        
and a little bit of pork inside.

358
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,365
 This is like a nice            
       50/50.                   

359
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,135
 Just the right amount of sauce.

360
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:18,269
             WOMAN:             
      Hot but not too hot.      

361
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,004
 It leaves a nice little bite   
        in your mouth.          

362
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,272
   WOMAN: Everything you order  
        is gonna be good,       

363
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,741
       so it's really fun       
    to try different things.    

364
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,276
         Chamorro plate.        
            It's hot.           

365
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,879
This is the Chamorro plate.     
  It's super yummy.             

366
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,614
     It has meat                
 with the red sauce.            

367
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,816
          It's magical.         

368
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,351
                  Chamorro.     
       Yeah.                    

369
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,086
              What does it mean 
                 in English?    
 The shank.                     

370
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,354
              That's the shank? 
   Uh-huh.                      

371
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,689
                 Big shank.     
       Go ahead. Get me started.

372
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,758
                    Okay.       
      We're gonna salt it first.

373
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,959
                     So,        
            I have to sear them.

374
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,229
FIERI: Oh, we're gonna          
sear them off on the flattop.   

375
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,630
                    Yeah.       

376
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:46,831
While those are searing?        

377
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,700
      We're gonna make the salsa
              for the Chamorro. 

378
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,368
     We have all the ingredients
                 over here.     

379
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,636
               We have cloves,  
                 bay leaves.    

380
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,238
   Some coriander.              

381
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,775
  Mexican oregano.              
             Mexican oregano.   

382
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,376
                         Cumin. 
Cumin seeds. Got it.            

383
00:12:58,378 --> 00:12:59,978
                  Allspice.     

384
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,713
                 Peppercorn.    
  Garlic.

386
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:04,249
              And then ginger.  

387
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:07,118
  Ginger? Come on.              
     In Mexico?                 

388
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,385
              That one is mine.

389
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,454
     I have to find something --

390
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,055
I'm gonna tell your mom.

                [ Chuckles ]    

392
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,659
         So then we're gonna put
               some of the --   

393
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,727
     Super spicy                
with the chili de arbol.        

394
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,664
We got kind of spicy and smokey 
 with the guajillo,             

395
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,465
   and pretty mild              
with the California.            

396
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,001
                 Some water.    

397
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,068
        Okay.                   

398
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,370
                Put the lid.    

399
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,076
Gonna drop them in the pot      
with a little bit of water,     

400
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,945
and this is when we're          
gonna cook them low and slow.   

401
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,314
  Hang on a second.             
I want to taste that.           

402
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,151
    Oh, it's good               
 except the ginger.             

403
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,154
    I'm kidding.                
     [ Laughs ]                 

404
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,156
Now we're gonna cook all        
the mixture off a little bit.   

405
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,157
                   Right.       

406
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,226
   Once it's done,              
we put the sauce on there,      

407
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,428
and then this all goes          
for an hour and a half.         

408
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,230
             All together. Yeah.

409
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:53,431
               We're gonna put  
                some peppers.   

410
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:54,565
Which peppers are these?        

411
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,368
         California and guajillo
               and the arbol.   

412
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,437
          So now we're gonna put
                  the salt.     

413
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:00,772
We're gonna cover it?           

414
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:02,974
                    Yeah,       
          we're gonna cover now.

415
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,575
      This is the peruano beans.

416

       Herano?

                 ready here.    

418

                Queso fresco.

It's delicious, Chef.           

421
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,469
It's got great texture,         
   not too spicy.               

422
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:34,538
This has a lot of depth.        

423
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,807
 Not over seasoned.

The meat's super tender.

So, I'm here on Del Monte Avenue
    in Monterey, California.    

442
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,991
    Now, back in the heyday,    

443
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,327
         this right here        
   was the major thoroughfare,  

444
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:30,795
     and the joint I'm here     
          to check out,         

445
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:33,464
    it was the company store    
  for the Del Monte train line. 

446
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,933
     Now it's the go-to spot

00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,279
        Medium rare tuna.       
   Pick it up. Let's go, guys.  

451
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,883
Monterey Bay has a very generous
          ocean for us,         

452
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:53,885
    so it's always giving us    
 an abundance of fresh seafood. 

453
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:55,353
    We're off the hook here.

00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,837
      FIERI: That's because     
  they're grilled over oak wood 

460
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,740
       that David harvests      
     from his own backyard.     

461
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,843
         What are we gonna make?
 The grilled oysters.           

462
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,112
These are Pacific oysters       

463
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,848
 from the Hood Canal            
   in Washington.               

464
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,716
          Do you shuck to order 
          or do you shuck ahead?

465
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,118
 We shuck to order.             

466
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,319
           Shuck the front door.

467
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,054
    [ Chuckles ]                

468
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,725
    And then just               
a little clarified butter       

469
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:35,859
  and fresh garlic.             

470
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,996
    Real simple.                
That's all we put on them.      

471
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:39,998
                Now it's time   
             to go to the grill?

472
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,332
    That's right.               

473
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,734
Two or three minutes,           
they'll start to boil,          

474
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:44,802
and another two or three        
minutes, they're done.          

475
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,404
                   Got it.      

476
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:48,072
                 All right,     
             so cocktail sauce. 

477
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,740
          It's a little ketchup.
   Little ketchup.              

478
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,676
    Horseradish.                
    Lemon juice.                

479
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,945
     So, we are like in the race
                  right now     

480
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,047
             because the oysters
              are almost done,  

481
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,017
               so can he make   
             the cocktail sauce?

482
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,353
              How about I dump  
                 the garlic?    
Go ahead.                       

483
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:04,822
        How much Worcestershire?

484
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,423
    It's probably               
 just a few ounces,             

485
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,959
  but I've done it              
  so many times --              

486
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:09,560
       I like how you just do it
                so technical.   
I can tell, yeah.               

487
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,028
        Tell me when I hot sauce
                 this thing.    

488
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,296
Go ahead, 'cause we like it     
   a little spicy.              

489
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,697
  Add a little salt             
     and pepper.                

490
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,299
                  We good.      
That's good.                    

491
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,367
             I'll continue that.
             You want to grab   
             the oysters, here? 

492
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,969
I'll grab the oysters.          

493
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,838
          We're oyster tag team.

494
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,677
                    Wow!        

495
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,652
                    Mmm.        

496
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:35,987
     That's good cocktail sauce.

497
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:37,321
        Yeah.                   
Got a little kick to it.        

498
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:38,856
                    Phew!       

499
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:42,059
These have got just such a nice,
 salty brininess to themselves, 

500
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,594
              then a little bit 
               of the garlic,   

501
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,662
  and that garlic's just kind of
              lightly poached,  

502
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,131
             and the smokiness. 

503
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,399
        Yeah,                   
it really comes through.        

504
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,002
               Delicious, man.  
                Outstanding.    

505
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:55,072
 WOMAN: I tried the oak-grilled 
oysters here for the first time.

506
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,208
It was the most incredible thing
           I ever had.          

507
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,678
   WOMAN: That oak flavor gets  
    engulfed into the oyster.   

508
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,746
           Oh, my God.          

509
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,947
             WOMAN:             
 This place gets the fresh fish 

510
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,517
  because they fish a lot of it 
         for themselves.        

511
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,753
My family goes back generations 
    as fishermen.               

512
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:09,887
                   Really?      

513
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,355
Yeah, I fish commercial salmon  
     every year.                

514
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:12,423
                     No.        
     Yeah.                      

515
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,158
       MAN: Most of the fish    
        you see right here      

516
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,427
       was probably caught      
   within the last day or so.   

517
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,629
   It's as fresh as they come.  

518
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,497
  Sicilian holiday pasta, guys. 

519
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:23,501
  The Sicilian holiday pasta's  
            the best.           

520
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:26,704
    It's got mussels, clams,    
    scallops, baby octopus,     

521
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,774
     calamari, and anything     
 that's fresh out of the ocean. 

522
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,043
                 All right,     
        what are we making next?

523
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:33,443
  We're gonna make              
    the marinara.               

524
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,045
That's one of the ingredients   
in the Sicilian holiday pasta.  

525
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,247
                    Okay.       

526
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:39,217
I'm gonna put some olive oil    
in the bottom of the pan.       

527
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,785
    White onion.                
   Little garlic.               

528
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:41,853
               Little garlic?   

529
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:43,921
               That's my level  
             of a little garlic.

530
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:46,657
        Kind of a chunky tomato.

531
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:47,791
      Bay leaf.                 

532
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,594
                    How about   
        I assist you, doctor?   
You got it.                     

533
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,596
A little granulated garlic.     

534
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:53,997
              Oregano, doctor?  
Yes, sir.                       

535
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:57,201
                   Basil.       
  Little bit of salt and pepper.

536
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:59,203
    Doctor, I feel the surgery's
          coming on quite nice. 

537
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,871
                There you go.   

538
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,407
    So, everybody's in the pool.
      How long's this gonna go? 

539
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,810
Maybe 15, 20 minutes.           

540
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,411
So, the marinara's done.        
   Now we make...?              

541
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,347
                Put together    
     the Sicilian holiday pasta.

542
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,081
          Ladle of the marinara.

543
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,816
                 Clam juice.    

544
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,418
             You make your own? 
   We do.                       

545
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,620
Green-lipped mussel.            

546
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:17,288
       Clams.                   

547
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,423
 Swordfish, salmon,             
    and raw cod.                

548
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,162
            What a bounty, dude.

549
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,964
          Baby octopus, scallop,
              and some shrimp?  

550
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:27,899
        Yes.                    

551
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:30,033
                   Butter.      
      Butter.                   

552
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,103
And a little bit of pesto.      

553
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:33,704
               Now, how long's  
               that gonna go?   

554
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:34,772
Just to where they open.        

555
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:35,706
                And the fish    
               is just opaque?  

556
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,041
     Yes.                       
                And boom, we go.

557
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:38,009
The fresh-made linguini.        

558
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,212
     What a beautiful dish, man.

559
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,249
                Look at that!   
                    Unh!        

560
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,517
 And I would garnish            

561
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,986
with just a little bit          
of that fresh pesto right there.

562
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,957
             Everything's fresh.

563
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,927
                    Mmm!        

564
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,129
                 Nice broth.    

565
00:19:58,131 --> 00:19:59,330
  Doesn't overpower the seafood.

566
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:00,798
             Like how you nested
                 everything.    

567
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,267
            Salmon tastes great,
            swordfish is great. 

568
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,269
          The calamari is cooked
               just perfectly.  

569
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,273
                  Awesome.      

570
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,274
   Hey, thank you.              
                       Good job.
