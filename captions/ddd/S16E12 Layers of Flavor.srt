3
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:07,639
          This trip...          

4
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:09,875
       Badass.                  
 Can I say "badass"?            

5
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:11,276
                    Yes,        
           you can say "badass."

6
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:12,544
      ...we're stacking on      
          the flavor...         

7
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,813
                What are you    
               talking about?   

8

is what you get, baby.          

13
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,288
     ...putting on the pork     

14
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,424
   and going big on burgers...  

15
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:26,358
That's a fatty patty.           

16
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,760
    ...with a holiday twist.

              Christmas burger. 

18
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:31,830
       Then in Nags Head,       
       North Carolina...        

19
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,498
                Welcome back    
              to "Jungle Hour." 

20

 ...the Caribbean seaside shack 

21
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:39,037
        bringing the heat       
         with the meat.         

22
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,305
        I'm gonna tell you what,
                  brother.      

23
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:42,107
             That chop's legit. 

24
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:46,111
     That's all right here,     
    right now, on "Triple D."   

27
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,493
          So, I'm here          
      on Highway 12 South,

       in the Outer Banks.      

30
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,333
  Now, right past those houses  
       and over the dunes,      

31
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,868
   that's the Atlantic Ocean.   

32
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,736
         I mean, this is        
    one of<i> the</i> "go to" spots    

33
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,205
 for vacation on the east coast.

34
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:14,406
    So, what can you expect?

      of Caribbean flavors.

       They're delicious.       
   Fun to try and fun to eat.

              that beach feel.  

44
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:36,428
             FIERI:             
  Just what owners Bob Sanders  
and Richard Welch were going for

45
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,363
   when they opened the joint   
            in '89 --           

46

    complete with surfboards,   
      funky license plates,     

47
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:45,437
      and a name guaranteed     
   to stir up a conversation.

                 Wha-- wha--    

49
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,175
Just after the Caribbean islands
   and, you know,               

50
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,978
it's where the turtles lie,     
where they come tell stories    

51
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,313
    or they drink               
too many Cayman cripplers.      

52
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,249
                What are you    
               talking about?   

53

Exactly.

 Emphasis on great local seafood

         Nice and juicy.        

61
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,401
  You get a little bit of heat  
           out of it,           

62
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:19,238

         What are we gonna make?

64
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,941
Dry jerk seasoning that's gonna 
go on our pork chops.           

65
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,209
                 All right.     
               Hit it up, man.

72
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,157
                 Should have    
    a little cinnamon coming in.
Cinnamon.                       

73
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,759
Little more Cayenne,            
little more heat there.         

74

76
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:49,500
We're gonna put a little bit    
of the dry rub on it.           

77
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,836

79
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,440
       So, we're gonna let those
                  sit there     

80
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,043
     and just take a little bit 
 of a marinade from the dry rub,

81
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,845
                just let that   
     kind of soak in the flavor.

         Can't go wrong         
      coming to this place.     

229
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,260
   Always, always good meals.   

230
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,796
 FIERI: Are we gonna get bigger?
                This is tiny.   

231
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,265
    I have a feeling I'll be    
    making more jerk chicken.   

232
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,199
       You know what? You better
        buy a green onion farm. 

233
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,902
          [ Laughter ]          

234
00:08:58,805 --> 00:08:59,871
       FIERI: Coming up...      

235
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,072
    What you see                
is what you get, baby.          

236
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,074
         ...we're headed        
      to Toronto, Canada...     

237
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,209
       Getting                  
 all medieval on it.            

238
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,277
       ...where a restored      
           retro diner          

239
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,080
     is holding all the aces    
         with the menu.         

240
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,649
I just shove it all in          
    at one time.                

241
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,657
            You know,           
    one of my favorite things   

242
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,125
    about "Diners, Drive-ins,   
           and Dives"           

243
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,860
 is the history of these joints,

244
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:25,063
   so I'm in Toronto, Canada,   
  on the west side of Parkdale  

245
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,397
   in an area known as Roncy,   

246
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,733
      to check out a joint      
    that started as a diner.    

247
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,268
         Then it became         
      a Chinese restaurant,     

248
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,003
     and then it was closed     
          for 30 years          

249
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,204
   until two friends found it.  

250
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,873
       They kept the name       
        and reopened it.        

251
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,274
        This is The Ace.        

252
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:43,014
               Got two burgers  
                on the grill.   

253
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,950
 It's comfort food.             
   It's delicious.              

254
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,885
    Picking up one steak frites,
                   please.      

255
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,153
          MAN: Very simple food,

256
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,690
         but it's prepared with 
     a more sophisticated sense.

257
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,559
     You're gonna walk away     
          pretty happy.         

258
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,293
        FIERI: And full.        

259
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,829
      Because, since 2011,      

260
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,699
       owners Maggie Ruhl       
         and Greg Boggs         

261
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:04,169
   have been aiming to please   
           in spades.           

262
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:07,905
                  How'd you     
               find the place?  

263
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,307
Walked around the corner        
      one day,                  

264
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,307
  and the curtains              
     were open,                 

265
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,243
     and it was                 
an old, beautiful diner.        

266
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,379
We wanted to sort of just have  
something a bit more upscale.   

267
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:16,247
         So, they hired         
       Chef Peter McKnight      

268
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:20,785
   to combine the greasy spoon  
       with a silver one.       

269
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,720
    Tell me about               
  your food style.              

270
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,321
             It's well-executed 
                comfort food.   

271
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:24,456
    What you see                
is what you get, baby.          

272
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,023
                  Exactly.      

273
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,593
     That all comes together    
             in this            

274
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:31,463
     "nothing up my sleeve,"    
       classic pork dish.       

275
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,463
   The pork belly.              

276
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,500
        Tender and juicy.       
    It's a meaty pork belly.    

277
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,470
   So, what are we              
    making first?               

278
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,804
               It's a roasted   
                 pork belly.    
    Work it.                    

279
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,407
             So, I'm gonna just 
          score this pork belly.

280
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,409
Now, is this farm to table?     
We got anything local?          

281
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,944
      We use Ontario pork, yeah.
              It's good stuff.  

282
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,681
             So, we season with 
             an equal amount of 
             salt and sugar.    

283
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,750
      We're gonna do both sides,
      and then we're gonna just 

284
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,150
          go right into the oven
                  on a rack     

285
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,552
           for 90 minutes or so.

286
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,688
Okay, just gonna roast it off,  
   render it down.              

287
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,789
                 Absolutely.    

288
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,025
So, the pork belly's            
       in now.                  

289
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,960
       The pork belly comes with
           a warm potato salad. 

290
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,029
   This is the rendered pork fat
               from our belly.  

291
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,032
                  This just     
       brings the dish together.

292
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,566
  So, pork fat.                 
                   Red onions.  

293
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,367
       We're gonna just season. 
A little bit of salt and pepper.

294
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,836
                 We're gonna    
            add in our potatoes.

295
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,704
     So, this is                
a German-style potato salad.    

296
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,440
         It's just a take on -- 
        I mean, just warm it up.

297
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,441
               We're gonna add  
         grainy mustard in here.

298
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,577
                A little bit    
            of red wine vinegar.

299
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,383
And then a little bit of chive  
for some beautiful green.       

300
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,385
               And we're good.  

301
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:32,590
                 So, we got     
   our finished pork belly here.

302
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,125
                    We do       
       a pretty healthy portion.

303
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,531
Now you're gonna take it,       

304
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,066
hit it in the deep fryer        
and really crisp it up.         

305
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,135
    And how long                
    will that go?               

306
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,204
            2 1/2 minutes or so.

307
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,672
        Okay, so, we're starting
          with the potato salad 

308
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,474
        just in the corner here.

309
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:50,875
               We're gonna add  
     our celery and radish salad

310
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,409
             to the other side. 

311
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,345
            A little pork belly 
         that's just crisped up.

312
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,481
 I'm gonna dip it here, and then
     we're gonna just slice it. 

313
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:57,615
   And this is...?              

314
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,216
               Sriracha, soy,   
                and vinegar.    

315
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,085
       Got it.                  

316
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:07,525
     Very nice.                 

317
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,163
        Mmm.                    

318
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,031
I just shove it all in          
    at one time.                

319
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,633
This is the kind of food        
   I want to find               

320
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:16,967
in funky, little joints.        

321
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,435
   You almost have              
a couple different styles       

322
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,037
 of food going on --            
  the German style,             

323
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,173
a little bit of Asian influence 
 'cause of the soy.             

324
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,642
  You got the acid              
with the salt with the sugar    

325
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:25,910
with the caramelization         

326
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,646
along with this rich,           
unctuous pork belly.            

327
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,381
    Outstanding.                

328
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:31,649
     Excellent.                 

329
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:36,453
     The best hunk of bacon     
    I've ever had in my life.   

330
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,722
   FIERI: Served up at a joint  

331
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,458
       that prides itself       
      on being a throwback.     

332
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,059
It's got the best ambience,     
       right?                   

333
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,195
             Chinese restaurant.
 Badass.                        

334
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,231
Can I say "badass"?             
                  Yes, you can  
                  say "badass." 

335
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:48,466
              This opened what? 

336
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:49,533
   1955.                        
              '55.              

337
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,535
                    1955.       
        Is the counter original?

338
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,736
You can see the elbows...       

339
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:53,538
              Where the elbows  
               are rubbed in.   

340
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,606
    For 50 years.               

341
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,440
                 I love it.     

342
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,811
             FIERI:             
   With this kind of history,   

343
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:02,280
      old-school favorites      
      like mac and cheese       

344
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,615
         fit right in...        

345
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,618
        ...in their own,        
        so twisted way.         

346
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,621
            McKNIGHT: Pickup -- 
      one mac and cheese burger.

347
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,756
    Cheesy, rich, delicious.    

348
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:13,691
           It's great.          

349
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,494
 What are we making?            
          Well, we're gonna do  
      our mac and cheese burger.

350
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,162
With mac and cheese?            

351
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,564
                  Absolutely.   
     Okay.                      

352
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,966
                We start with   
     a very good Béchamel sauce.

353
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,033
               Generous amount  
                 of butter.     

354
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,569
  A little shallot.             

355
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:25,770
                Seasoned with   
              salt and pepper.  

356
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:28,772
                  And then      
       we're gonna build a roux.

357
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,643
    We're going to add in flour,
           some whipping cream. 

358
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:32,910
              We're just gonna  
            whisk that together.

359
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,646
     And then we'll just simmer 
    that out for a little while.

360
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,048
               Finish it with   
   a little bit of aged cheddar.

361
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:39,917
    Checking it.                

362
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,252
        Mmm.                    

363
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,254
               We're gonna add  
    our cooked pasta in the mix.

364
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,256
             And then we add in 
  a good amount of cheese curds.

365
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,591
           Like, we're gonna get
            those cheese pulls. 

366
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,059
               We're gonna get  
   that stretchy mac and cheese.

367
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,330
                 We're gonna    
             move to our patty. 

368
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,199
               This is ground   
             Black Angus chuck. 

369
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,869
  I do a puree of Dijon mustard,
            rosemary, and onion 

370
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,470
            to flavor this beef.
Okay.                           

371
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:00,872
               We're gonna do   
          a couple eggs in here.

372
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:05,643
                   Season       
           with salt and pepper.

373
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,347
        And then just bind with 
   a little bit of bread crumbs,

374
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,582
             just to hold these 
                  together.     

375
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,451
Getting all medieval            
       on it.                   

376
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:18,356
    I'm just gonna form a patty.
            6 1/2 ounces or so. 

377
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,225
                I like a good   
          baseball-sized burger.

378
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,495
  So, we're just gonna cook this
          for about 12 minutes, 

379
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:27,098
            put some nice lines 
   on this burger, flip it over,

380
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,299
           and then we'll build.

381
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:29,500
         We got our toasted bun.

382
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,269
We're gonna start mac and cheese
            on the bottom here. 

383
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,107
                Spicy ketchup   
               on the top bun.  

384
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:39,377
                 75% ketchup    
    and then like 25% hot sauce.

385
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,778
Sriracha?                       
                           Yeah.

386
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,648
         Add our patty on there.

387
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,049
That's a fatty patty.           

388
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:48,252
              Tomato, lettuce,  
               crispy onions.   

389
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,722
  House-cut fries.              

390
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,857
              Finish the burger 
           with the steak knife.

391
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,526
     Just gonna build that plate
                right there.    

392
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,261
 It's a big burger.             

393
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,296
     All right.                 

394
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,206
    Do I have any               
     right here?                

395
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,609
       Where's                  
  that beach towel?             

396
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,144
                 [ Laughs ]     

397
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,580
 The mac and cheese             
  is super-creamy.              

398
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:20,151
 This is creaminess             
with a little more texture      

399
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,752
because of the macaroni.        
                     Absolutely.

400
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,354
My favorite part about it --    
believe it or not --            

401
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,822
 that spicy ketchup.            

402
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,624
    Got the salt.               
You got the creamy/buttery.     

403
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,026
You got the richness            
    of the beef.                

404
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,560
And what cuts it all,           
  that little kick,             

405
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,161
that little acid kick           
that's coming through.          

406
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,363
    Really nice.                

407
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:33,430
 If you're gonna do             
      a burger                  

408
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,565
and you're gonna put            
  signature to it,              

409
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:35,499
that's the way to go.           

410
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,633
Good job, Peter.                
            Thank you very much.

411
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,970
     All right,                 
so, the mac and cheese burger.  

412
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:41,171
  We had the bacon.             

413
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,974
You've got to have something    
secret up your sleeve.          

414
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:43,975
     Do you have                
   another burger?              

415
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,109
              Yeah, absolutely. 
                    Yeah.       

416
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,377
     Okay, well,                
don't tell me what it is.       

417
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:47,779
 When we come back,             

418
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,046
we're hanging out at The Ace    
 in Toronto, Canada.            

419
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,848
  See you in a bit.             

420
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,492
   Welcome back --              
"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives"  

421
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,628
hanging out in Toronto, Canada, 
     at The Ace.                

422
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,229
Now, this is my buddy Peter     
     over here.                 

423
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,031
     We have had                
some fantastic bacon.           

424
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,166
    We had a bomb               
mac and cheese burger.          

425
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,434
      And now?                  

426
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,568
              Christmas burger. 

427
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,437
              A stuffing center 
             in a turkey burger.

428
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,472
     All right.                 
   Get us started.              

429
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,708
           So, we got a mixture 
        of olive oil and butter.

430
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,177
             And we're gonna do 
              some mirepoix --  

431
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,112
   just carrots, celery, onions,
               finely chopped.  

432
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:25,516
              We're gonna add   
              some dried sage.  

433
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,785
              Salt and pepper.  

434
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,187
         And we got some chopped
             whole-wheat bread. 

435
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,323
          So, we're gonna add in
               our fresh sage.  

436
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,458
And you got to love sage        
    in stuffing.                

437
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,526
                  Oh, yeah.     

438
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:36,660
                 So, we have    
            a turkey stock here.

439
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,463
    So, you make                
   your own stock.              

440
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,331
And short of making the ketchup,
 you do it yourself.            

441
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,133
                Pretty much.    

442
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:44,936
        We're gonna simmer it up
            for a little while, 

443
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:46,204
            let all that liquid 
          sort of come together.

444
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:47,472
             We're gonna cool it
               out on a tray,   

445
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,940
        and we'll begin to build
                 our burger.    

446
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,808
'Cause we can't put             
hot stuffing into...            

447
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,210
              The raw poultry.  

448
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,579
No turkey seviche.              
                         No way.

449
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,215
Now?                            
              We're gonna build 
          our cranberry compote.

450
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,751
               We're gonna use  
         some fresh cranberries.

451
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,987
   We're gonna do cinnamon stick
              and vanilla bean. 

452
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:05,889
                Brown sugar.    

453
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,158
          Fresh, chopped orange.

454
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,095
                Orange zest.    

455
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,630
                 Orange juice.  

456
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,698
             And then we're just
              gonna kick it up  

457
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,033
        with some Jack Daniel's.

458

00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:21,572
         So,                    
that just simmers down.         

460
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:22,640
                 Absolutely.

462
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,781
All right, so, we're gonna build
          our Christmas burger. 

463
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,718
          We got ground turkey. 
     This is a 50/50 split of...

464
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,919
Thigh and breast?               
                     Absolutely.

465
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,054
Very nice.                      
               Good fat mixture.

466
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,923
      We're gonna go three eggs.

467
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,528
              Salt and pepper.  

468
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:47,398
Once again, our puree of onions,
   rosemary, and Dijon mustard. 

469
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,735
    And do a generous amount of 
 bread crumbs just to bind this.

470
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,737
Get medieval.                   
               Absolutely, yeah.

471
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,873
               Get in there,    
               mix it all up.   

472
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,010
         Form a patty from here.

473
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,679
             So, we're gonna go 
             into a ring form.  

474
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,347
              And what I do is, 
     I'm gonna take out a piece,

475
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,682
        because this is gonna be
                 our cover.     

476
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,884
       And we're gonna build up 
     the sides, create a bottom.

477
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,553
             And we have a ball 
              of this stuffing  

478
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,154
             that we've already 
              previously done.  

479
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,423
       We're gonna pack that in.

480
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,025
       And we're gonna turn this
             into a flat piece, 

481
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:15,293
              a cover for that. 

482
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,495
  So, this is like              
a very technical form           

483
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,696
of making a Juicy Lucy.         

484
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,299
No cheese inside of it,         
but it does have stuffing.

   they would dig.              

488

Ted, Mike, you see this?        
 What do you think?

             A little seasoning 
               on the outside.  

493
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,051
                A little bit    
                of olive oil.   

494
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,386
           And this gets roasted
                 in the oven    

495
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:43,987
         just to keep with that 
  Christmas burger sort of feel.

496
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,790
                Roast turkey,

             with a toasted bun.

500

            We're gonna go mayo.

501
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,401
               We're gonna do   
             lettuce and tomato.

       a couple rosemary sprigs 

506
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:09,881
       just to keep it together.

  And I'm gonna split it in half
  so you can reveal the center.
