         Hey, everybody.

00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,669
         I'm Guy Fieri,

 ...we're heating up the meat...

7
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:11,944
This should seriously           
     be illegal.

that's a big sandwich, man.

    In Oakland, California...   

17
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:26,691
             That's how I roll.

to borrow this recipe.          

28

     That's all right here,

   when you're traveling south  

32
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,665

        through the Keys,       

33
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,735
   you'll come through a chain  
 of islands known as Islamorada.

34
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,870
     And you'll see a bunch     
         of restaurants.

           Let's see,           
   you got seafood restaurant,

    I love what they do here.

 It's very different and unique.

00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,954
  These guys are just amazing.

             FIERI:             
   That'd be restaurant lifers  
  George Patti and Thomas Smith 

44
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:37,562
 who partnered up on this rogue 
   Florida Keys joint in 2012.  

45
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:40,031
People told us we were insane   
for doing this concept.         

46
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,834
            They did.           
You can't eat seafood every day.

47
00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:43,635
             FIERI:             
  So, George puts his chef cred 

48
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:46,171
      on display with food

50
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:51,576
      He does great things      
  with smoking meats and wings. 

51
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,711
  Chicken wings in the window.  

52
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,513
        The chicken wings       
         just rock here.        

53
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:55,647
      MAN: They're smoked.      

54
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:56,782
  They have a dry rub on them.  

55
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,251
        You can taste all       
      of that in the wing.      

56
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:00,652
 Into making wings.             
Give me the rundown.            

57
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:04,990
         Okay, we got our water,
  bay leaf, salt, sugar, garlic.

58
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,860
          Boil it, add the wings
     to a big plastic container,

59
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:09,127
              dump it over hot, 

60
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,996
              let it sit on it  
          for about a half-hour,

61
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,264
        and then hit ice on top.

62
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,799
         Cover it, in the cooler
   overnight for about 12 hours.

63
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,536
 So you mildly poach            
     your wings                 

64
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,539
    to brine them               
and partially cook them.        

65
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,739
            -Correct.           
         -That is weird.        

66
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,441
        -This is M.E.A.T.       
             -Okay.             

67
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,544
                  Okay, now     
       we're gonna make the rub.

68
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,812
                Kosher salt,    
             sugar, brown sugar.

69
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:28,947
        Okay.                   

70
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:33,218
            Cumin, chili powder,
          black pepper, paprika,

71
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,486
                and Cayenne.    

72
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,288
The dry rub onto the wings.     

73
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,692
             Go into the smoker 
     for 4 hours at 200 degrees.

74
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:41,760
And now what are we into?       

75
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,228
               Our house-made   
           Worcestershire sauce.

76
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,297
And you make the Worcestershire 
to go in the barbecue sauce?    

77
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,299
            -Correct.           
       -Of course you do.       

78
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,768
         Oil, onions, jalapeños,

79
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,570
           garlic, black pepper,

80
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:52,838
           anchovies.           
              -Ho!              

81
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,506
          They look like snails,
      but that's just anchovies.

82
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,506
                   Cloves.      

83
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,775
       Salt, lemons, corn syrup.

84
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:58,844
            -Really?            
            -Mm-hmm.            

85
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,980
             Rice wine vinegar, 
            ginger, horseradish.

86
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,848
              -Wow.             
             -Cumin.            

87
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,250
   I might have to              
 borrow this recipe.            

88
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:08,787
          A little bit of water,
                  molasses.     

89
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,255
               We're gonna let  
          that come up to a boil

90
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,856
             and then let it go 
               about 4 hours.   

91
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,191
    That's crazy.               

92
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,193
              Then we puree it, 
                 strain it.     

93
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,395
          It keeps in the cooler
              for up to a year. 

94
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,398
      This is the honey-chipotle
               barbecue sauce.  

95
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,533
     The molasses-beer barbecue.

96
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,201
    And that has                
the Worcestershire in it.       

97
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,805
                  Correct.      
   Chipotle peppers, lime juice.

98
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,341
 Sweet chili sauce.             

99
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:30,942
    Honey, and then a little bit
                  of salt.      

100
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,946
        Okay.                   

101
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:35,047
            This should be good.

102
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,883
        Mmm.                    

103
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,084
   That'd be great              
    on anything.                

104
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,685
       You can put it on a shoe.
             You know the deal. 

105
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,086
          -A flip-flop.         
    -I heard that somewhere.    

106
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,288
        Yeah.                   

107
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,423
Wings are out of the smoker.    

108
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:45,757
          A little bit of water.

109
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,092
 Not gonna fry them.            

110
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,294
 Nope, and then we'll glaze them
        with the barbecue sauce,

111
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:50,962
             and we'll cook them
   until they're basically soft.

112
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,564
       The idea is to have them,
    like, fall apart like a rib.

113
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,766
These better be good,           
       George.                  

114
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:55,901
  I'm trusting you.             

115
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:02,040
           Blue cheese crumbles,
               and that's it.   

116
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:05,644
That's a good wing, man.        

117
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,045
           -Thank you.          
   -That's a really good wing.  

118
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:08,914
So soft and so tender.          

119
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,515
The seasoning is great.

00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,635
            -Got it.            
     -All right, olive oil.     

236
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:24,903
Onions first. All right.        

237
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,904
 Now we have our red            
and green bell pepper.          

238
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,773
  When you put that many peppers
           and onions in a dish,

239
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,442
            you had me at hello.

240
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:32,511
      Sea salt,                 
coarse black pepper.            

241
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,580
       -Of course you do.       
         -Cayenne, okra.        

242
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:36,981
             -Okay.             
             -Corn.             

243
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,184
             -Okay.             
      -Seaweed, love spice.     

244
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,452
                 Love spice.    

245
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:43,922
  Stewed tomatoes.              

246
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,990
                 Oh, so now     
      we're putting in the pork.

247
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,627
No, this is marinated,          
   seasoned tofu.               

248
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,463
     Now, how long is this gonna
                 cook down?     

249
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:53,098
  30 to 45 minutes.             

250
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,066
     -We serve that with...     
         -Basmati rice.         

251
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,268
        And a big sheet of nori.

252
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,904
             That's how I roll. 

253
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,675
     There's a tremendous amount
                 of flavor,     

254
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:08,413
            and your spice love,
              that whole piece. 

255
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:09,881
                 The okra's     
              been cooked down. 

256
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,284
             Love the little pop
                of the corn.    

257
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,952
         The tofu is the kicker.

258
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,687
     I'm not missing the chicken
               in that at all.  

259
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,290
      I'm not missing the shrimp
               or the sausage.  

260
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,759
         That just reminds me of
       what you can do with tofu

261
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,894
        and how well it takes on
               other flavors.   

262
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,765
             All day long, girl.

263
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,701
   -Here's the gumbo for you.   
            -Awesome.           

264
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,302
   Man, it just gave me a ray   

265
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,438
           of flavors           
    that I can really enjoy.    

266
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,707
People that I know usually      
   like soul food,              

267
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,776
  and to give them              
another variation of it,        

268
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,243
that really impresses them.     

269
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,446
    FIERI: But it wasn't easy   
     getting to this point.     

270
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,114
      Tamearra came through     
        a tough childhood       

271
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,316
      with a determination      
      to follow her dream,      

272
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:49,053
         but that meant         
 putting everything on the line.

273
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,989
             You're a single mom
                at the time.    
      Yeah.                     

274
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:55,126
       To quit a really good job
            in the medical field

275
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,928
               to go sell food  
              at an open market 

276
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,932
              to come and take  
an abandoned restaurant building

277
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,067
              and to do it all  
            at a very young age.

278
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,937
I want people to feel good.     

279
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,273
   MAN: I'm not even a vegan.   
 I just really like coming here.

280
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,408
        When I eat here,        
 I feel healthier when I leave. 

281
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,143
 Here's your po' boy and fries. 

282
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,811
           This is one          
   of my favorite sandwiches.   

283
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,814
Just the seitan and the way     
it's cooked and prepared        

284
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,050
      brings in                 
a lot of the flavor.            

285
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,351
        Take me to po' boy town.

286
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,686
Okay, so first we're gonna make 

287
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,821
the seitan vital wheat          
    gluten flour.               

288
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,223
  It's the protein              
   of whole wheat.              

289
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,491
                 That's what    
              I thought it was. 

290
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,492
     [ Laughs ]                 

291
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,229
 Liquid amino acid,             
  blended seaweed.              

292
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,697
             -Okay.             
         -Fresh garlic,         

293
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,032
and I have my love spice.       

294
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,300
      Form this                 
  into a ball here.             

295
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,102
             Now, does this need
                 to set up,     

296
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:40,705
               cure, marinate,  
                 amalgamate?    
    Yes.                        

297
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,573
It boils for about 45 minutes   
     to an hour.                

298
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,175
   We're gonna cut              
  these into cubes.             

299
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,310
            There's some texture
                   there.       

300
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,112
Then we're gonna dredge it.     
  Wet batter first.             

301
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:48,113
       What's in the wet batter?

302
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:50,982
  Unbleached flour,             
 love spice, water.             

303
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,853
And then we have the dry batter,
which is flour and cornmeal.    

304
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:55,987
       We're gonna fry this off?

305
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,255
    That's right.               

306
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,524
  -Now what are we gonna make?  
       -Our "vegan mayo."       

307
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:03,728
                          Great.
So, we're starting              
 with silken tofu,              

308
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,797
  and I'm gonna add             
some coarse black pepper,       

309
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,998
a little yellow mustard         

310
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,200
and granulated garlic,          
      sea salt.                 

311
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,803
    Mix together                
and put it in the refrigerator  

312
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,204
      overnight                 
   for it to set.               

313
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,739
                    Okay.       
                Po' boy time.   

314
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,275
All right, so I have my Dutch   
crunch bread that I toasted,    

315
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:20,345
   and then I have              
my vegan mayo, mustard,         

316
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,213
      tomatoes,                 
  shredded lettuce.             

317
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,414
              Okay. I like it.  

318
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,683
And then I have my seitan.      

319
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,285
A little bit more mayo,         

320
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:30,154
squeeze a little lemon juice.   

321
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:33,058
     It weighs about ten pounds,
              just so you know. 
[ Laughs ]                      

322
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,765
       I don't know exactly what
             po' boy I'm having,

323
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,233
        but there's no question,
              that's a po' boy. 

324
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,301
     All right.                 

325
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:44,836
              The Dutch crunch  
            is a perfect choice.

326
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,037
       The lettuce is cut right.

327
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,106
    The tomato's great on there.

328
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,709
               The vegan mayo,  
             that's lights out. 

329
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,178
     I mean, we got to get a tub
           of that for my house.

            with that little bit
                of the nori.

            I'm not kidding you.
             It's the real deal.

    to be a really good po' boy.

00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,277
             DYSON:             
Black bean and quinoa burger up.

347
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,880
     You feel very satisfied    
        after eating it.        

348
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,682
     This girl can get it going.
        See you in a little bit.

349
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:32,283
           -All right.          
  -I got to finish the po' boy. 

350
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,691
                Welcome back.   
              Hanging out here  

351
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,960
         in Oakland, California,
              at Souley Vegan.  

352
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,161
     [ Laughs ]                 

353
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,363
         Now, my sister, Morgan,
         was a vegetarian/vegan.

354
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,565
 And so this is something that's
      near and dear to my heart.

355
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,900
              I know everybody  
          sees me on "Triple D,"

356
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:51,368
     and they say, "Oh, that guy
        eats a bunch of nachos."

357
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,503
              I like my nachos. 

358
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,373
                But this food   
            makes you feel good.

359
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,908
          Here you are.         

360
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,309
There's actually a lot of things

361
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,577
        that you can make       
        with vegan food,        

362
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,647
  and I feel like Souley Vegan  
      really takes that on.     

363
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,316
     The things that they do    
        are done so well,       

364
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:06,717
 you don't miss the meat at all.

365
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,453
      We had the black bean     
       and quinoa burger.       

366
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,855
      The quinoa black bean     
 veggie burger tastes different 

367
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:12,857
  than any other veggie burger  
            I've had.           

368
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:14,525
         A great burger         
     if it's your first time    

369
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,928
   eating a vegetarian burger.  

370
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,863
                Quinoa is one of
                 the superfoods.
       Mm-hmm.                  

371
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,265
     If you haven't done quinoa,
               give it a shot.  

372
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,201
So, we're gonna start           
with our olive oil, onions.     

373
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,203
  We're just gonna              
let those caramelize,           

374
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:27,071
  put a little bit              
of the love spice in here.      

375
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,407
            Add in the cilantro,
                   basil.       

376
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,942
And then we have our parsley,   

377
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,611
and then I have my black beans  
   and my quinoa.               

378
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:34,746
              It's a good look  
                right there.    

379
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:36,214
         Now we're gonna make it
             into some patties. 

380
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,548
   Yep. All right.              

381
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,818
Add some brown rice flour.      

382
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,654
Just add a little bit           
more of my love seasoning.      

383
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:45,890
          -To a patty?          
            -Mm-hmm.            

384
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,157
         How we gonna cook them?

385
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,026
           -Bake them.          
     -We're gonna bake them?    

386
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,561
            -Mm-hmm.            
          -Here we go.          

387
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,163
   Now we're gonna              
  dress the burger.             

388
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,831
   I have my mayo,              

389
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,234
  a little ketchup              
on the bottom there,            

390
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,235
  burger on there,              

391
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,838
a little bit more sauce on top, 
   ketchup there.               

392
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,442
   Alfalfa sprouts              
and a slice of tomato,          

393
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:07,111
and that is how we serve the    
black bean and quinoa burger.   

394
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,383
           We got all the things
        you love about a burger.

395
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,784
          You got meaty texture.

396
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,520
                  It's big,     
          it's thick, it's rich.

397
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:19,590
      Nice bun, a little tomato,
              a little ketchup. 

398
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,326
               The quinoa mix   
     to the black bean is great.

399
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,994
        Definitely get that mayo
       component coming through.

400
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,065
            It's a great burger.

401
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,866
Black bean and quinoa burger up.

402
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,268
 It's full of different flavors.

403
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,669
       It's really hearty.      

404
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,071
   The po' boy here with fry.   

405
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:36,474
      I'm always confident      
  that Souley Vegan can deliver 

406
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,743
    on a culinary experience    
    that's worth remembering.   

407
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,211
                 The profile    
            of what you're doing

408
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,814
               for vegan food,  
           you're the real deal.

409
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,215
Right on. Thank you.            

410
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,552
              Well done, girl.  

411
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:51,221
             FIERI:             
    Up next, we're rolling to   
the central valley to Modesto...

412
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,289
  It doesn't stop.              

413
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,625
    ...for some international   
         inspiration...         

414
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,028
If you talk about a really      
traditional Portuguese dish,    

415
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,562
this is right up there.         

416
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,765
     ...traveling full-speed    
         to Flavortown.         

417
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,233
       -The Lamburgerini.       
     -Sports car of burgers.    

418
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:13,110
        So, the next time       
 you're in Modesto, California, 

419
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,712
        getting your hair       
     tightened up over here     

420
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:18,916
       at the Barber Salon      
   at McHenry Village at 66A,   

421
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,651
 and you say to yourself, "Self,

422
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,453
     I'd really like to have    
        some Portuguese,        

423
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:23,854
      German-inspired food.     

424
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:24,922
      Where should I eat?"      

425
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,124
  Oh, you step right next door  

426
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:29,260
        to Bauer's 66 1/2       
       Skillet and Grill.       

427
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,997
        Two UFBs, medium.       

428
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,732
    It's one of those places    
     where you kind of want     

429
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,334
     to keep it to yourself.    

430
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:37,935
  I get cravings all the time.  

431
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,870
           All right,           
     here's that Lamburgini.    

432
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,072
      If you have a passion     
          for burgers,          

433
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,407
     definitely a good spot.    

434
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,743
       FIERI: Or a passion      
 for some global-infused grub...

435
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,145
          Gorg burger.          

436
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,546
  FIERI: ...thanks to chef and  
  owner Tye Bauer's background. 

437
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:50,815
                  My dad's      
          a full-blooded German.

438
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,283
                 My mom was     
        full-blooded Portuguese.

439
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,751
     ...and his adventures.     

440
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,353
              I traveled a lot, 
     so I just take a little bit

441
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:58,222
  of a hodgepodge of my heritage
        and things that I liked.

442
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:01,125
     Which led him to create    
    this Portuguese-inspired,   

443
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,227
  three-meat monster sandwich.  

444
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,361
            Octavian.           

445
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,831
      You get the linguica.     
      You get the alcatra.      

446
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,701
    You get the pulled pork.    
       -What are we into?       

447
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:13,371
         We're into a Portuguese
    braised beef called alcatra.

448
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:15,506
             The alcatra is part
              of our Octavian.  

449
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,975
If you talk about a really      
traditional Portuguese dish,    

450
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,311
     this is right up there?    
         -That's right.         

451
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,779
             -Okay.             
    -I'm gonna season it up.    

452
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,114
                    First       
      a little red wine vinegar.

453
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,782
    Next we have white wine.    
             -Okay.             

454
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,250
             All right, and then
         we're gonna do red wine

455
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:27,651
            to just about cover.

456
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,853
                 Beef stock.    

457
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:32,590
           Organic tomato sauce,
              some brown sugar. 

458
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,659
Now a virtual cornucopia        

459
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,394
  of all the spices             
 we have available.             

460
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:37,795
                    Yes.        

461
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:41,399
      Chopped garlic, coriander,
        granulated onion, cumin,

462
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:44,802
                black pepper,   
        smoked paprika, paprika.

463
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,470
            Then we're gonna add
           all our sweet spices.

464
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,739
                Nutmeg first,   
   a little Vietnamese cinnamon.

465
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,341
          It's a little sweeter.
                  Allspice.     

466
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,743
         And last but not least,
                   clove.       

467
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:54,612
             One cinnamon stick 
             and some bay leaf. 

468
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,014
Alcatra goes in the refrigerator
                  24 hours.     

469
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,549
Then we're gonna braise it      
in the oven for how long?       

470
00:16:58,551 --> 00:16:59,683
           For about five hours.

471
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,219
                300 degrees.    

472
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,553
  All right, so now             
  what are we into?             

473
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,088
                  Linguica,     
             Portuguese sausage.

474
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,823
               Really simple,   
             but a long process.

475
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:06,891
And how does it get served?     

476
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,559
   -It's part of our Octavian.  
            -Got it.            

477
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,361
             A cubed pork butt, 
               some red wine,   

478
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,030
                chili paste,    
             garlic's going in. 

479
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,032
                    Salt.       

480
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,299
                Black pepper.   

481
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:18,302
             Allspice, paprika, 
             Hungarian paprika. 

482
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:19,771
So, a little hot paprika.       

483
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:20,838
             -Yeah.             
             -Okay.             

484
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,973
               Mix it all up.   

485
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:24,708
      24 hours,                 
  then we grind it.             

486
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,177
  Go to the casing.             

487
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,980
         I'm gonna smoke that up
             for about 12 hours.

488
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:30,982
Okay, all right, let's get      
into making the sandwich.       

489
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:33,383
    So, chopped up some linguica
              for our Octavian. 

490
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,152
    I'm gonna add some mushrooms
             and onions to that.

491
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:38,188
      Gonna bring that over here
             to the pulled pork.

492
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,656
      This, we do this in-house.

493
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,192
        Then we're gonna come in
              with the alcatra. 

494
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,594
  -How many people are eating?  
   -It's a big boy's sandwich.  

495
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,395
                 All right,     
      so now the cheese goes in.

496
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,332
                  And then      
          our sweet spicy sauce.

497
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,267
   Bring this all together here.

498
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,135
            We're gonna add that
                 to the bun.    

499
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,339
                 All right,     
           and there we have it.

500
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:57,075
        Boy,                    
that's a big sandwich, man.     

501
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,146
        Mmm.                    

502
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:03,781
   It's just a ton              
 of flavor going on.            
                          Yeah. 

503
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,015
Let me get a little bite        
  of the linguica,              

504
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,884
then and also get a little touch
  of that vinegar.              

505
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,957
I see the calorie meter         
going off right next to me,     

506
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,224
minutes on treadmill.           

507
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,160
        [ Bell dinging ]        
Ding, ding, ding, ding!         

508
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:17,361
      Great sandwich, man.      
           -Thank you.          

509
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,764
          -Nicely done.         
 -Here's that Octavian sandwich.

510
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,165
    It's a monster sandwich.    

511
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,100
 Three different types of meat. 
   You can't really go wrong.   

512
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,503
    FIERI: From the Octavian    
      to the UFB sandwich,      

513
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,505
      everything here's got     
      a clever little name,     

514
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:29,106
      including the one Tye     
           rolled with          

515
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,508
     when he opened in '09.     

516
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,110
             The 66 1/2 came in 
         because of the address.

517
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,446
          We're on the back side
           of a place that's 66.

518
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:39,183
     I could have been an E.    
          -66E or 66A.          

519
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,385
               I had a choice,  
          so I went with 66 1/2.

520
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,187
        But his best work       
        might be reserved       

521
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:46,256
   for the name he's bestowed   
   on this beast of a burger.   

522
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,457
          Lamburgerini.         

523
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,460
       -The Lamburgerini?       
     -Sports car of burgers.    

524
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,928
  He doesn't stop.              

525
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,797
        It's just moist,        
   and it melts in your mouth.  

526
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,265
             WOMAN:             
 You're going 100 miles an hour,

527
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,867
        but you still get       
       to enjoy the ride.       

528
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,668
All right, bring it.            
                 All right,     
          we're gonna start off.

529
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,004
                   We got       
          our Bauer salty spice.

530
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,006
          That's gonna be shaked
           into the ground lamb.

531
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,073
             -Okay.             
         -Start out with        

532
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,341
              some kosher salt, 

533
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:07,478
            coarse black pepper,
       granulated garlic, cumin.

534
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,946
        Granulated onion.       
           -Coriander.          

535
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:10,948
        -Smoked paprika.        
       -Hungarian paprika.      

536
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,083
         And this is New Mexican
   chili powder, a little spice.

537
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,687
Looks like the spice market     
     in Bahrain.                

538
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:19,223
Or it reminds me of sand castle 
making in third grade,          

539
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,891
but I'm gonna go with           
 the Bahrain thing.             

540
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,694
             I want to take this
           and just shake it up.

541
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:24,962
     All right,                 
now what are we into?           

542
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:27,098
       All right, so we cubed up
             our lamb shoulder. 

543
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,966
            -Got it.            
-Gonna add a pinch of the sumac.

544
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,501
    It's a Middle Eastern spice,

545
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,769
                got a little    
             orange peel to it. 

546
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:34,705
               Then we got our  
            salty spice we made.

547
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,240
   Was Salty Spice              
  one of the girls              

548
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,642
that was kicked out of          
  the Spice Girls?              

549
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:40,044
                  She was.      
                 Our garlic.    

550
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:41,245
    Add a little                
  lemon olive oil.              

551
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,313
              Lemon olive oil.  

552
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,914
    Grind it out,               
form it into patties.           

553
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,917
  We're gonna put it on the char
          griller here for about

554
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,718
        7 minutes a side.       
           -Fantastic.          

555
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,520
                So we got our   
            toasted brioche bun.

556
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,255
             Gonna be that spicy
              Thousand Island.  

557
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:52,523
                Lemon aioli.    

558
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,725
  Here comes the Lamburgerini.  
         -Lamburgerini?         

559
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:55,660
             -Yeah.             
             -Okay.             

560
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,328
       And we got our mushrooms,
                   bacon,       

561
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,330
     and gorgonzola that's gonna
             go on top of that. 

562
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,065
            Next thing coming up
                 is arugula.    

563
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,065
                 Olive oil.     

564
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,768
             There you have it. 

565
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,206
That's a great lamb burger.     

566
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,141
It's balanced, properly cooked, 
really moist, tons of flavor.   

567
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,077
     Toasted bun                
 holds it together.             

568
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,545
 The aioli's great.             

569
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:18,015
That's actually what a lot      
of lamb burgers want to be.     

570
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,350
           Thank you, man. Yeah.

00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:21,085
    Spot on, Tye.               
      Spot on.                  

572
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,754
    -Here's that Lamburgini.    
        -It's phenomenal.       

573
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,423
         When I eat it,         
   I don't care about my diet.  

574
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,358
        I just come here,       
    and I enjoy this burger.    

575
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,894
     -You just get after it.    
              -Yep.             

576
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,296
 WOMAN: It's just the best place
 around here that I've been to. 

577
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,232
  It's the best place in a lot  
     of places I've been to.    

578
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,300
  You take the time             
 to make everything.            

579
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,435
That's what makes this place    
      so cool.                  

580
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,238
    Nicely done.                

581
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,507
  Was that a road trip or what? 
        But don't worry.        

582
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,310
   There's plenty more joints   
  all over this great country.  

583
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:49,914
         I'll be looking        
for you next time on "Triple D."

584
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,782
   This is Becca.               
Becca's my assistant.           

585
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,117
             Ready?             
    -Oh, I'm ready for this.    

586
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,019
     [ Laughs ]                 

587
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:00,057
  Please make sure              
that makes the show.
