307
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,553
       AND THERE'S A FUNKY      
  LITTLE JOINT CALLED HAROLD'S  

308
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:11,021
WHERE YOU CAN GET A CHILI BURGER
    FOR A BUCK AND A QUARTER.   

309
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:14,692
        AND I'LL TELL YA,       
    THAT'S MY KIND OF JOINT.    

310
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:17,428
          MMM, AMAZING.

341
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,508

 CONTINUED ON DOING IT.         

342
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,844
                     SO HOW DO  
                  WE COOK THESE?

343
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,846

349
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,001
   THE PROCESS NOW              
IS TO MASH THESE UP.            

350
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:09,807
SO WHAT WE'LL DO IS TAKE        
OUR MASHED-UP MEATBALLS.        

351
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,943

352

    OVER HERE                   

353
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:17,081

  HAVE ALSO BEEN COOKED.

THAT GOES ON TOP.               

355
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:21,653

    OF MAKING THE SOUP.

00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:29,827
       A LITTLE GARLIC POWDER,  
     ONION POWDER, SALT, PEPPER?
EXACTLY.

360
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,233

MAKE A BURGER.

  IS MUSTARD, ONIONS AND CHILI.

              THE KILLER PART   

366
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
            IS THAT STEAMED BUN 
           AND THE FRESH ONIONS.

        HAMBURGERS HERE.        

375

  THE SAME?                     
        THEY TASTE
