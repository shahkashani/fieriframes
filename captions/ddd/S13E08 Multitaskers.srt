118
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,677
IN THE FRYER?                   
                            YEP.

119
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:35,080
           (sizzling)           

120
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,548
SO WE GOT THE CHICKEN DONE.     

121
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,949
NOW WE'RE INTO MAKING           
    THE WAFFLES.                

122
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,150
                  THAT'S RIGHT. 
                 I'M GONNA START

123
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,419
           WITH A LITTLE SALT,  
         A LITTLE BAKING POWDER,

124
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,486
          FRESH GROUND CINNAMON.

125
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,355
                UH, THAT'S      
          OUR ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR.

126
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:44,556
     MAKE SURE THAT             
THEY'RE THOROUGHLY MIXED.       

127
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,024
      MM-HMM. I'LL MAKE MY WET--

128
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,092
                   WHOLE MILK...
OKAY.                           

129
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,493
                   EGGS, BUTTER,

130
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:49,761
           AND JUST A LITTLE BIT
              OF MAPLE SYRUP.   

131
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,163
               I'M SLOWLY ADDING
                  MY DRY MIX.   

132
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:53,298
MAN, I GET THE CINNAMON         
  AND THE MAPLE SYRUP           

133
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,300
  RIGHT OFF THE BAT.            
IT'S WAFFLES GONE WILD.         

134
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:57,302
               IT IS. (chuckles)

135
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,971
               JUST ENOUGH      
        SO IT COVERS THE BOTTOM.

136
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,773
THAT MUCH? SERIOUSLY?           

137
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,375
         WELL, I MEAN, I WASTE  
       A LITTLE BIT ON THE SIDE,

138
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:04,309
               BUT I FEEL LIKE--
YOU'RE LIVING ON THE EDGE,      
        AREN'T YA?              

139
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,576
                   THAT'S RIGHT.

140
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,778
   SO IT COMES OUT, UH, NICE OUT
        OF THE WAFFLE MAKER,    

141
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,380
BUT WE LIKE IT TO BE REAL CRISPY
      ON THE OUTSIDE, SO--      

142
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:09,781
SO YOU DRY IT OUT               
A LITTLE BIT MORE.              
                           YEAH.

143
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,317
         WE'RE JUST GONNA TOAST 
        THE WAFFLE A LITTLE BIT.

144
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:16,721
           ALL RIGHT. WE START  
         WITH OUR HONEY MUSTARD,

145
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,857
               AND IT'S JUST    
          A SPICY BROWN MUSTARD,

146
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,124
                 A LITTLE SYRUP.

147
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:23,261
                WAFFLE ON THERE.
                  THEN CHICKEN. 

148
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,130
           A LITTLE BIT OF      
     EXTRA HONEY MUSTARD ON TOP.

149
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,297
               A LITTLE BIT MORE
                 ON THE WAFFLE. 

150
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,600
YOU GET THE SAVORY CHICKEN      
   AND THE SWEET WAFFLE         

151
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,869
AND EAT 'EM TOGETHER?           

152
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,537
           WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE    
      MAKE SANDWICHES OUT OF IT.

153
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,673
 CHICKEN'S SUPER TENDER,        
A LITTLE BIT OF BREADING.       

154
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:35,941
         THERE'S                
A NICE LITTLE BIT OF HEAT       

155
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,008
   COMING OFF                   
FROM THE MUSTARD.               

156
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,745
GET SOME OF THE SWEETNESS       
      OF THE SYRUP.             

157
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,079
     (mouth full)               
THE SAVORY, THE SWEET,          

158
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,748
THE CRUNCHY, THE SALTY--        
  I MEAN, YOU JUST GOT          

159
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,416
ALL KINDS OF THINGS             
  GOING ON HERE.                

160
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,684
THAT IS GONNA SCREW UP          
PEOPLE'S BREAKFASTS...          
                      (chuckles)

161
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,552
THE REST OF THEIR LIFE.         
      (chuckles)                
                        (laughs)

162
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:48,486
AWESOME.                        

163
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,554
                    THANKS, MAN.
OHH.                            

164
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:50,956
   (indistinct conversations)   

165
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,024
              CHICKEN & WAFFLES.
OOH, WOW.                       

166
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,359
                (Guy) HOW IS IT?

167
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,427
  EXCELLENT. YOU WANT A TASTE?  

168
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,228
          OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? I--
             AS YOU CAN TELL,

170
00:04:58,698 --> 00:04:59,931
(both laugh)                    
                     TWO ORDERS.

171
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,433
  UM, THE HONEY MUSTARD SAUCE   
          IS AMAZING.           

172
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:04,035
     THAT MIXED WITH MAPLE SYRUP
        IS THE BOMB, ISN'T IT?  

173
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:04,970
          IT SURE IS.           

174
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,438
 ORDER UP. MESS FOR TABLE ONE.  

175
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,174
  HOW'D YOU GUYS FINALLY COME   
TO THE IDEA OF OPENING A DINER? 

176
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,441
     YOU KNOW, WE WANTED TO HAVE
      A PLACE WHERE WE COULD DO 

177
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,710
               WHATEVER WE WANT.

178
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,112
       WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE
        SIMPLE FOOD REALLY WELL.

179
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,714

       <i> SHRIMP AND GRITS,</i>       

181

 <i> BLACKENED GREEN TOMATO MELT,</i>  

182

              FOR THE PORK CHOP.

AND WHAT DO WE GET              
THE PECTIN OUT OF?              

190
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:35,934
           IT COMES FROM APPLES.

191
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,803
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT JELLY,       
WHAT'S GONNA<i> JELLIFY</i> IT--       

192
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,204

PEPPER VINEGAR?

     WE CHOP UP, UH, HOT CHILIES
         AND PUT IT IN THERE.   

198
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,815
             OVER TIME, IT GETS 
            SPICIER AND SPICIER.

199
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:50,882
SHOW-OFF.

      FIRE-ROASTED BELL PEPPERS.

201
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,686
             NOW I'M GONNA PUREE
                 THE PEPPERS.   

202
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,288
            (whirs)             

203
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,090
        I'M GONNA ADD MY PECTIN.

204
00:05:58,092 --> 00:05:59,290
  THERE WE GO.                  
SO STIR THAT IN.                

205
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,625
               NOW I'M GONNA ADD
              MY FROZEN PEPPERS.

206
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:03,027
 THESE ARE GONNA BE WHAT ARE    
GONNA ACTUALLY COOL THIS DOWN?  

207
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,629
                           YEAH.
       LOOKS LIKE               
A BUNCH OF BELL PEPPERS--       

208
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:05,696
RED, YELLOW.                    

209
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,299
           AND, UH, A LITTLE BIT
                OF JALAPEÑO.    

210
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:09,768
      THIS SHOULD GIVE US       
A NICE, SPICY RED PEPPER JELLY. 

211
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,470
                MM-HMM.         
      IT'S GOTTA COOL OVERNIGHT.

212
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,906
 ALL RIGHT. THIS IS, UH, THIS IS
   WHAT MY PORK CHOPS LOOK LIKE 

213
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:15,973
             WHEN THEY GET HERE.

214
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,442
THE CHINE BONE HAS NOT BEEN     
        TAKEN OUT?              

215
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,444
           NO. I ACTUALLY LIKE  
         THE EXTRA BONE ON THERE

216
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,079
                'CAUSE WE MAKE  
             OUR OWN PORK STOCK.

217
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,247
SO IF YOU'RE GONNA BUY IT,      
   BUY IT WITH THE BONE         

218
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,782
BECAUSE THE FLAVOR'S            
    IN THE BONE.                

219
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:24,916
YOU WON'T SEE THAT              
    EVERY DAY.                  

220
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:25,851
       LET'S TAKE THE CHINE OFF.

221
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,921
                      ALL RIGHT.

222
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,590
YOU'RE GONNA POUND THIS DOWN,   
      TENDERIZE IT UP.          

223
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,460
                 SORRY. (laughs)

224

00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,079
YOU GOT IT. YOURS IS A JUMBO,   
    BUT YOU'RE A NATURAL.       

336
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,347
             WHEN YOU WERE A KID
               AND YOU WOULD GO 

337
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,415
        TO YOUR YIA YIA'S HOUSE,
          SHE WOULD MAKE THESE? 

338
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,950
SHE WOULD,                      

339
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,018
AND NOW EVERYBODY IN MY FAMILY  
 GETS ME TO MAKE 'EM FOR 'EM.   

340
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,153
           SO YOU'RE THE--YOU'RE
               THE ONE THAT--   

341
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,154
I AM THE<i> DOLMADES</i> MAN.          

342
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,490
       OKAY. NOW THIS INTO HERE?

343
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:26,625
 YES, BUT FIRST                 
WE'RE GONNA LINE                

344
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,359
   THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN        
WITH SOME GRAPE LEAVES ALSO.    

345
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,627
                           OKAY.

346
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,297
AN OLD GREEK TRICK, I GUESS,    
   SO THAT WE DON'T BURN        

347
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,432
 THE BOTTOM PORTION             
OF THE GRAPE LEAVES.            

348
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,234
       SO YOU CAN JUST STACK 'EM
         ON TOP OF EACH OTHER?  

349
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,302
WE'RE GONNA STACK 'EM NEATLY.   
WE'RE JUST GONNA GO THIS WAY.   

350
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,437
                  SO THEY'RE IN.

351
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,373
 NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD            
SOME OLIVE OIL FIRST,           

352
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,575
AND WE'RE GONNA ADD             
   LEMON JUICE,                 

353
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:45,643
AND USUALLY WE USE              
 A WHOLE BOTTLE,                

354
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,846
JUST BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE      
ALL THE FLAVOR COMES FROM.      

355
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,247
 IT GETS SATURATED              
INTO THE GRAPE LEAF,            

356
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,514
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.       

357
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,849
AND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER.      
          A LITTLE BIT OF WATER.

358
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,585
     AND WE'RE GONNA COVER THIS?
           WHERE'S THE LID?     

359
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:56,054
 (makes beeping sound)          
    WHERE'S THE LID?            
       HE JUST WENT INTO ROBOT. 

360
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,789
SO WE PUT THE PIE PAN DOWN,     
   AND THEN WE PUT THIS         

361
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,125
TO WEIGH IT DOWN...             

362
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,659
                      SO THAT...
AND THEN--                      

363
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,794
                 KEEPS PRESSURE 
               ON THE WHOLE MIX?
KEEPS THE PRESSURE ON IT        

364
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,262
SO EVERYTHING DOESN'T           
  BLOW UP IN THERE,             

365
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,396
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA PUT        
        OUR LID.                

366
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,598
           KEEPING ALL THE STEAM
                  INSIDE.       

367
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,466
THAT'S IT.                      
            WOW. THAT FITS SNUG.

368
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,601
OH, YES.                        

369
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:11,536

370
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:12,871
I USE IT AS A SHIELD.           

371
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,006
            (laughs)            

372
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,741
THEY'LL SIMMER PROBABLY         
  FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.            

373
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,142
THEY ARE DONE.                  

374
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,078
WE USUALLY PUT FIVE OUT.        

375
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,479
WE ALSO HAVE A SAUCE            
   WITH IT, TOO.                

376
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,614
    WE'RE GONNA PUT             
OUR CHICKEN STOCK DOWN.         

377
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:25,149
WE'RE GONNA LET THAT GO,        
      RUE TO THAT               

378
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,551
AND, UH, RAW EGGS               

379
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,086

                           OKAY.

380
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:29,487
   AND THAT'S GONNA BE THE SAUCE
       THAT WE'RE GONNA PUT--   

381
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,422
THAT'S GONNA BE THE SAUCE       
 WE'RE GONNA PUT ON TOP         

382
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:31,489

00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:32,557

384
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,891

 WRAPS AROUND IT NICE AND TIGHT.

388
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,503
       I THINK PEOPLE LOOK AT IT
       AND GO, "OOH, GRAPE LEAF.

389

IT WAS OUTSTANDING.             
            (laughs)            

624
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,310

                 FLIP IT AROUND.

        WRAP IT UP. READY TO GO.

632
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:20,391
       THE BURGER'S HAD A CHANCE

633
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:21,392

       THIS HELPS TIGHTEN IT UP.

640
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,802
AND ALSO KEEPS MORE             
 OF THE JUICE IN,               

641
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,003

     TO THE CHAR GRILL.         

642
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,739

OUR HOMEMADE BUN.               

644
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:36,840
         YOU MAKE THE BREAD HERE
                 AS WELL?       

645
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,209
YEP.                            
         YOU BAKE IT HERE FRESH?

646
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,276

        WITH SOME               
ROASTED RED PEPPER RELISH.      

650
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,017
         THIS IS HOW YOU'RE GOOD
            TO GO RIGHT HERE?   

651
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,552
THIS IS HOW WE'RE               
   GOOD TO GO.                  

652
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:51,022
          (mouth full) MMM. MMM!
            THIS IS RIGHTEOUS.  

653
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,690
      SO THE BEEF CUTS IT.      
A GREAT BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO.

654
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,293
             REALLY LIKE GETTING
                THE MINT. MMM.  

655
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,029
           BUT WHAT TIES IT ALL 
         TOGETHER IS THE RELISH.

656
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,429
       YOU GET SOME OF THE SWEET
         FROM THAT BROWN SUGAR, 

657
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,965
          THE CARAMELIZED ONIONS

658
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,500
          AND THE BELL PEPPER,  
       A LITTLE BIT OF THAT ACID

659
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:04,435
    FROM THE APPLE CIDER VINEGAR
             COMING IN,         

660
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,704

                  MMM.          

661
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,572

                 IS THE BUN.    

662
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,040
ALL RIGHT.                      
       YOU KNOCKED THAT ONE OUT.

663

(chuckles)                      

664
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,242
