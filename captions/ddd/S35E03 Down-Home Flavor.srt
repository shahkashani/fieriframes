304
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,160

   While that's finishing up,   

646
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:46,817
        this is our final       
    pork-green chili product.   

647
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,020
          Cheddar Whiz,         
         the scallions,         

648
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,621
            cilantro,           
       and the jalapeños.       

649
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:51,956
        And you are ready       
           to go, sir.          

650
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,892
                     ♪♪         

651
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:57,161
      Wow. Tons of flavor.      

652
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:58,362
           So creamy.           

653
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,697
          The highlight         
       of this whole meal       

654
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,367
   is the tortilla that tears   
      and looks like that.      

655
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,835
  You'd be pretty hard pressed  
        to tell somebody        

656
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,503
  that's not a flour tortilla.  
                  Exactly.      

657
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:09,173
    That's pretty outrageous.   

658
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,108
            So. good!           

659
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,310
                Wholehearted    
             pork green chilies 
               in the window.   

660
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,779
      The pork is amazing.      
   The broth is really hearty.  

661
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,314
       It has a little bit      
        of a kick to it.        

662
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:20,251
The tortilla is the best        
tortilla I've ever eaten.       

663
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:21,918
         I have a couple        
     of autoimmune diseases.    

664
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,920
  I couldn't eat out anywhere.  
            -Exactly.           

665
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,589
    So, when Just Be Kitchen    
          came around,          

666
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,191
 it was really, really special. 

667
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:28,826
              Biscuits & gravy. 

668
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,329
       So we're not going       
  for "Good, for gluten-free."  

669
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,330
  We're going for just "Good."  

670
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,399
That's such the attitude,       
my friend. Well done.           

671
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:38,068
            -Cheers.            
    -Watch out for this guy.    

672
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,337
      So, was this a great      
       road trip, or what?      

673
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,605
      But don't you worry.      

674
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,475
    I got plenty more joints    
 to find all over this country. 

675
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,077
         I'll be looking        
       for you next time,       

676
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,012
 on "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

677
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,349
        Please do share.        
      -Okay. You gotta rip.     

678
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,551
            -Uh-huh.            
            -And dip.           

679
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:56,620
        -Shake and bake.        
             -Yeah.             

680
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,355
    I should've got up early    
         for this group.        

681
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,423
      This table's on fire.
