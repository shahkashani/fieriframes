1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,133
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,601
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:07,072
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:09,074
          This trip...          
             Performing nightly.

5
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:11,009
       ...we're hitting up      
        family joints...        

6
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,278
            If I do eat it all, 
can I just sleep in the walk-in?

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,880
 ...rocking international eats. 

8
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:15,948
                  I dig it.     

9
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,416
   In Salt Lake City, Utah...   

10
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,084
                 Outrageous.    

11
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:21,820
   ...generations of Greek...   
          Courageous outrageous.

12
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:24,222
          ...served up          
    with a side of Brooklyn.    

13
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:27,292
Any good chef tastes first      
before he lets his subjects.    

14
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:29,360
    Then, in nearby Holladay,   
             Utah...            

15
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,963
     It's an Asian Philly steak.

16
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:32,564
              It<i> is</i>             
     an Asian Philly steak.     

17
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:35,968
      ...a husband-and-wife     
       Vietnamese joint...      
Don't "pho-get" it.             

18
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,837
   ...dishing out the goodness  
     that just doesn't quit.    

19
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,839
  You got sweet, you got spicy, 
         you got salty,         

20
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,174
         you got fatty,         
        you got crunchy.        

21
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:44,042
  And on the island of Oahu...  

22
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,245
      I'm not gonna get invited 
    to the luau like this, am I?

23
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,648
  ...two brothers giving props  
         to their family        

24
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,583
    with real-deal Hawaiian.    

25
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,318
      It's like a meat waterfall
               in Flavortown.   

26
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,454
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

27
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:57,189
         on "Triple D."         

30
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,737
   I'm here in Salt Lake City,  
Utah, in the University District

31
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,005
  to check out a joint that --  

32
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,741
     well, let me be honest     
           with you --          

33
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:18,210
 looks a little fancy-schmancy, 
    you know what I'm saying?   

34
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,812
         But my rule is,        
never judge a book by its cover,

35
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,681
  'cause I hear this joint has  
  the off-the-hook Greek food.  

36
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,918
        This is Aristo's.       

37
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,420
             WOMAN:             
           Lamb shank.          

38
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,755
     I'm never disappointed     
          in the dish.          

39
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,358
 [ Speaking Greek ]             

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,160
   Real, authentic Greek food.  

41
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,029
        It's phenomenal.        

42
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:39,731
    And Aristo is what makes    
           this place.          

43
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,299
             FIERI:             
        But chef, owner,        

44
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,902
       and Brooklyn native      
       Aristo Boustikakis       

45
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:46,305
        was ready to quit       
     before he even started.    

46
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:48,774
2003, I was like, "I'm done.    
I want to go back to New York.  

47
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,442
The only way I'm staying        
is if I open my own place."     

48
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,578
That's when the family back home
            kicked in           

49
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,313
   to help him open the joint.  

50
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:55,713
      Now, 10 years later,      

51
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:59,251
 he's armed with Mom's recipes, 
    and the rest is history.    

52
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,319
   You have now brought the food
               to the people.   

53
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,588
10 years of I want to call      
education -- I mean, octopus?   

54
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,858
If I would've tried putting     
octopus on 10 years ago,        

55
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,059
we would've been shut down.     

56
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:09,394
          But now it's          
    a whole different story.    

57
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:12,364
     MAN: Love the octopus.     
It's delicate. It finishes well.

58
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,666
          It's amazing.         
   Octopus up.                  

59
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:18,336
      It is probably one of     
 my favorite items on the menu. 

60
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,338
             Talk about octopus.

61
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,475
This batch actually came in,    
believe it or not, Tunisia.     

62
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,076
              Look at that guy. 
 Beautiful, right?              

63
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,277
               I love octopus.  

64
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,615
We boil these for three hours   
in some salted water.           

65
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:32,884
We add the red wine to the      
octopus for the last 20 minutes.

66
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,821
  Octopus is done.              
Time to get these guys out.     

67
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,089
We'll let this cool down        
 and make our sauce.            

68
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:41,159
We start off with the prized    
extra-virgin olive oil          

69
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,361
  from my village.              

70
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,830
They've got olive trees         
that are 4,600 years old.       

71
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,899
You could drink that.           
              Whoa. I just did. 

72
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,301
              Wow, that's good. 

73
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,836
And we got fresh-squeezed       
    lemon juice.                

74
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:54,806
We got our salt, we got our     
pepper, and we got our oregano. 

75
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,844
 That's it, brother.            
  Nice and simple.              

76
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,713
               Mmm! All right.  
       Let's grill some octopus.

77
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,649
    Now it's time               
to portion this guy out.        

78
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,317
   Look how tender              
    that is, man.               

79
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,885
                Look at that.   

80
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,520
  We got to oil up              
      our grill                 

81
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,924
so the tentacles don't stick,   
       right?                   

82
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:14,859
                    Whoo.       
             Performing nightly.

83
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,862
           That's a big portion,
                    dude.       

84
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,197
 Go big or go home.             

85
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,132
   We hit this up               
 with a little oil.             

86
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:21,733
You want to get that char going,
       right?                   

87
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,868
You don't want to cook it       
for more than like three minutes

88
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,003
       a side.                  

89
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,805
   I like the way this is going.
                  Gorgeous.     

90
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,941
   Take this over,              
place it in our bath.           

91
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:30,909
                   Really?      

92
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,878
Look at this guy right here,    
        bro.                    

93
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,213
Look at that tentacle.          

94
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,415
 Look at what you're            
   about to have.               

95
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,883
Got to get some more            
of that special sauce.          

96
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,851
                 All right.     

97
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,824
             That's ridiculous. 

98
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,093
                It's tender.    
   It still tastes like octopus.

99
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,763
            All you did was use 
          awesome ingredients --

100
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:52,798
            quality ingredients.

101
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,099
      This is really outrageous.

102
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,835
             If you don't think 
             you like octopus,  

103
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,837
               come down here   
               and try this.    

104
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,505
  I'll put that up              
  against anybody.              

105
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,774
      When you do, they're gonna
            smell like octopus.

          [ Laughter ]

        Grilled octopus.        

108
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,580
    MAN: It's always tender.    
       It's always fresh.       

109
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,383
It's the only thing I ever order
        when I come here.       

110

               of "Iron Chef."  

113
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:19,458
What Aristo does to this,       
 it's super-tender.             

114
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,726
That char sets it over the top. 
    It's perfect.               

115
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,595
      A cross between old-school
              and modern Greek. 

116
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,730
           Absolutely.          

117
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,532
  FIERI: And it doesn't get any 
         more old-school        

118
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:30,268
   at a Greek joint than lamb.  

119

   The gyro lamb threw me off

120
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,206
     I became a meat eater.     

121
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,474
        FIERI: And Aristo       
  likes to mix it up a little.  

122
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,010
    BOUSTIKAKIS:                
   Lamb tacos up.               

123
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:39,811
    Lamb tacos at a Greek joint.
                   Dig it.      

124
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,479
We use New Zealand lamb.        

125
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,881
It's similar terrains --        
rolly, grassy hills.            

126
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,084
                  Rolly, grassy?
Rolly, grassy hills.            

127
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,220
You want to get the oil         
      on there,                 

128
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:49,354
  so you make sure              
 your spices stick.             

129
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:52,357
So we go with salt, pepper,     
 granulated garlic.             

130
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,624
           And a little oregano.

131
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,794
 We get a little oil            
     in the pan.                

132
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,397
   Fat side down.               

133
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,433
              Sear both sides.  

134
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,307
We got our onions, right?       

135
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:11,777
We got our carrots, bay leaves, 
 we got some water.             

136
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,445
Help that take a bath.          

137
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,715
That's why we got to wear       
    aprons, man.                

138
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,650
       I thought that was, like,
               a dance dress.   

139
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,453
        Okay.                   
A little bit more salt.         

140
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:25,657
Granulated garlic here, pepper, 
and some more Greek oregano.    

141
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,459
        Cover it with some foil.
Aluminum foil.                  

142
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:30,729
Slap it in the oven --          
  375, four hours.              

143
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,398
We making a pico that goes      
with our lamb tacos, right?     

144
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,134
     I'm a freak-o for the pico.
There's our chopped tomatoes.   

145
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,203
We got some diced cucumbers,    
       right?                   

146
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:43,007
 We got our peppers,            
chopped red onions, fresh mint. 

147
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,344
      In place of the cilantro. 
 I'm liking where this is going.

148
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,481
A little bit of lime juice,     
a little lemon juice.           

149
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:50,481
  Got some pepper.              

150
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:54,485
  We got our salt,              
 granulated garlic.             

151
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,756
Any good chef tastes first      
before he lets his subjects.    

152
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:00,325
  Let me make sure              
 this is all right.             

153
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,365
              The key, really,  
                 about that     

154
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,967
           is how fresh, crisp, 
         and how small it's cut.

155
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,502
                  Awesome.      
           Let's cook some lamb.

156
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,437
We had our lamb legs            
 that I cooked off.             

157
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,172
We remove that au jus.          

158
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,907
We let them cool down           
    a little bit.               

159
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,110
   Now we're gonna              
     shred them.                

160
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,579
 No oil or anything             
     in the pan.                

161
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,382
You ladle some of that au jus,  
 and we strained it.            

162
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,184
                Look at that.   

163
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,786
    How many tortillas you want,
                    boss?       

164
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,987
We're doing four tortillas.     
    There you go.               

165
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,591
 Let's plate it up.             
Got a nice little fennel salad. 

166
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,760
  Tzatziki, right?              
    100% yogurt.                

167
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,330
Smells like it's been roasted   
     on a spit.                 

168
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:40,398
                Really does.    

169
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,667
     Pico.                      
                      Okay.     

170
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:43,734
     All right.                 

171
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,804
 Then we top it off.            
    Feta, right?                

172
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,272
 Nice and crumbled.             

173
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,307
    There you go.               

174
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:59,050
              Dude, outrageous. 

175
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:02,353
          Courageous outrageous.

176
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,156
  The lamb's perfect, tortillas 
are great, the feta's fantastic,

177
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,026
        the pico is outstanding 
    with that cucumber in there.

178
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,561
            If I do eat it all, 
can I just sleep in the walk-in?

179
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,764
I got a couch in the office     
      for you.                  

180
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,268
  Heard about that couch, but I 
don't want to sleep on that one.

181
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,841
 It's just a great mix of fresh 
  with the lamb and the sauce.  

182
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,909
  Everything kind of just works 
      really well together.     

183
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,778
  This is the only place I eat  
           Greek food.          

184
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,914
       You can't beat it.       

185
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,982
  Man, nothing but props to you.
              Congratulations.  

186
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,517
     Your mom and dad have to be
                super-proud.    

187
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,153
     I don't know what happened 
to him, but you got to be proud.

188
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,926
 FIERI: Coming up, I'm bringing 
some backup to Holladay, Utah...

189
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,727
         I had to bring         
  the sandwich man himself in.  

190
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,796
     ...for an off-the-hook     
     Vietnamese bahn mi...      

191
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,065
    This is one of the best hot 
 sandwiches I've had in my life.

192
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,867
  ...that's got me speechless.  

193
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,168
  Whoa, whoa, whoa,             
     whoa, whoa.                

194
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:00,612
 So I'm here in Holladay, Utah, 

195
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:03,615
  about 10 minutes southeast of 
 Salt Lake, to check out a joint

196
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:06,151
      that I hear is doing      
  the rockin' bahn mi sandwich. 

197
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,487
 And to make sure it's rocking, 
       I brought this cat,      

198
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:11,289
  my buddy Jimmy John Liautaud  
  from Jimmy John's Sandwiches, 

199
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,691
         to qualify it.         

200
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:13,959
         This is Oh Mai.        

201
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,227
       Oh Mai.                  

202
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,699
    Brisket pho ready to go.    

203
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,767
     This place is amazing.     

204
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,969
        Layers of flavor.       

205
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:28,039
   It's almost like traveling   
           to Vietnam.          

206
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,109
  WOMAN: The food at this place 
  is just as good as the people 

207
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,244
      that own this place.      

208
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:33,578
             FIERI:             
 That would be a Vietnamese-born

209
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,914
  husband-and-wife team of Long 
         and Anna Tram,         

210
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,584
         two veterans of        
 the Salt Lake restaurant scene 

211
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:42,587
 looking to switch it up a bit. 

212
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,523
  We finally decided to retire, 

213
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,992
     so that's why we bought    
       this little space.       

214
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:48,994
       You retired and did this?
[ Laughing ] Yes.               

215
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,930
             FIERI:             
    I guess retirement means    

216
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:55,133
           serving up           
    righteous family recipes.   

217
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,535
  Everything here is fantastic. 

218
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:59,137
    FIERI: Since I got my boy   
   Jimmy John rolling with me,  

219
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,273
   you know I got to start off  
    with a standout sandwich.   

220
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,808
            Bahn mi.            

221
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,543
  The sandwich is just amazing. 

222
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,013
     FIERI: Let's talk about    
     what we're gonna make.     

223
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:09,881
              We're gonna make  
 the pickled carrots and daikon.

224
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,816
     That go on the sandwich    
   to give it all the crunch?   

225
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,686
  Everything sound good with you
                   so far?      
Sounds good.                    

226
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:17,822
      Wow. What a machine.      

227
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,958
              Okay.             
        Now we're ready?        

228
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,428
                  Carrots.      
                  Daikon.       

229
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,497
   And you want them longways?  
         Yeah, long way, please.

230
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:27,465
           Fire it up.          

231
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:31,703
              So now we have to 
               marinate them.   

232
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:34,306
           First vinegar, sugar.

233
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:36,774
             And...             
                       ...water.

234
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,110
      How long will it take     
       until these pickle?      

235
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,845
               About two days.  

236
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,513
  This is the rib eye that goes 
        to the sandwich.        

237
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,116
                  Correct.      
 And then you put in the butter.

238
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,918
       Let it melt a little bit.

239
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,520
               And then onions  
                 and garlic.    

240
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:49,721
              Okay.             

241
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,057
             And just sauté it  
             just a little bit. 

242
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,192
       And then you start adding
                the rib eye.    

243
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,961
   Oh, that looks               
     delicious.                 

244
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,864
 Now, do you do this            
for every sandwich fresh?       

245
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,066
          Yes. We cook to order.
   It's beautiful.              

246
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:06,671
              Soy sauce, sugar, 
          and then black pepper.

247
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:09,140
          So our meat's         
       about medium-rare?       

248
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,476
                 Medium-rare    
              to medium-cooked. 

249
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,413
   Now we're ready to go make   
          the sandwich.         

250
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:18,215
             So what I would do 
             is just cut it out.

251
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,084
         With scissors?         
 Yes. [ Laughs ]                

252
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,753
     And then we                
  hollow this out.              

253
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:24,822
                 Who taught you 
                 how to do that?
Me. [ Laughs ]                  

254
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,024
         It's critical.         
     We call it "canoeing."     

255
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:30,428
Just the garlic butter          
    and then mayo               

256
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,565
and then romaine lettuce        
and then the rib-eye meat       

257
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,767
and then black vinaigrette      
    house sauce,                

258
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,437
    black pepper,               
     cucumber...                

259
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,105
          [ Whistles ]          
  ...tomato...                  

260
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,508
                That looks good.
...red onion,                   

261
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,575
 jalapeño pepper...             

262
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,311
        Oh, I like the jalapeño.

263
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,247
...carrots and daikon           
    and cilantro.               

264
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,782
     It's an Asian Philly steak.

265
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,450
              It<i> is</i>             
     an Asian Philly steak.     

266
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,388
    And that's all she wrote.   

267
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,457
     Here we go.                

268
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,660
           That is unbelievable.

269
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,729
  Whoa, whoa, whoa,             
     whoa, whoa.                

270
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,265
     [ Laughs ]                 

271
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,400
What do you get, Jimmy?         
What are your flavors?          

272
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:11,002
    I'm getting the fresh-cooked
               rib-eye steak,   

273
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,536
          the sweet vinaigrette.

274
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:13,872
            I love the cilantro,

275
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:17,008
         and the jalapeño kicker
         is just off the chart. 

276
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,743
  You got sweet, you got spicy, 
         you got salty,         

277
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,745
         you got fatty,         
        you got crunchy.        

278
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:23,481
       I mean, you've got       
the whole umami going on, and...

279
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,152
      But my favorite part,     
        without question,       

280
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,088
         is the carrot          
         and the daikon.        

281
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,490
    This is one of the best hot 
 sandwiches I've had in my life.

282
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:33,692
              It's incredible.  

283
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,762
     It's like an explosion     
           of flavors.          

284
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:40,164
        Crunchy, crusty.        
          Just awesome.         

285
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,234
I know you got to bounce.       
Happy skiing to you.            

286
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,702
Thank you very much.            

287
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,438
         I had to bring         
  the sandwich man himself in.  

288
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,839
   Yeah.                        
              Okay?             

289
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,774
           So nice to meet you. 
   What a treat this was for me.

00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,142
        You're the best.        
        Thank you, Jimmy.       

291
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,780
   Now that Jimmy rolled out,   
      I can get Anna's take     

292
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:59,117
   on one of my all-time faves  
        all to myself...        

293
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,019
       Here is                  
  your brisket pho.             

294
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:03,120
 In my world of pho,            
this is one of the best.        

295
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,189
      ...when we come back.     

296
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,191
I wish I could get in it.

  at Oh Mai in Holladay, Utah,

  for some legit Vietnamese...  

299
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,604
    I love the food so much,    
    I can eat it every day.

   I can never get enough of.

           Brisket pho is ready.

302
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:27,478
Spelled P-H-O with an accent    
across the top of it.           

303
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,881
But it<i> is</i> pronounced "fuh."     
                   Yes. Correct.

So don't "pho-get" it.

               Don't pho-get it.
                    [ Laughs ]  
Sorry. I had to.                

306
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,954
 This is beef bones.            

307
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,488
                Yes. Correct.   
                 Beef bone.     

308
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,624
We're gonna cook off            
the beef bones first.           

309
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,025
        Here.                   
 You want some help?            

310
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:44,229
                Yes, please.    
         Thank you. Strong hand.

311
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:47,632
          Next, we're gonna put 
       the brisket into the pot.

312
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,968
               This will cook   
          for about three hours.

313
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,504
You'll see, like, a little bit  
of a foam coming to the top,    

314
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,373
and we'll skim that off         
     as it goes                 

315
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,309
  to get the broth              
to be as clear as possible.     

316
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,377
                Yes. Correct.   

317
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,179
     While that is being cooked,

318
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:03,715
      then we can start roasting
                 the spices.    

319
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,183
 A little cinnamon.             

320
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,584
                 Star anise.    

321
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,052
                      Amomum.   
    Amomum?                     

322
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,321
                         Yes.   
   I got to see                 
   what this is.                

323
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:13,124
    It comes from               
the cardamom family.            

324
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,461
Okay. So we're gonna toast these
 about five minutes.            

325
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,630
      Take out                  
 the cooked brisket.            

326
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,332
     Now we add                 
    the spice in?               

327
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,200
                    Yes.        

328
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:23,334
    Look at that.               

329
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:27,005
I've made some satchels before, 
but that's ridiculous.          

330
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,139
    [ Whistles ]                

331
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,074
How long are we gonna           
steep that in there?            

332
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,142
       For about six more hours.
Wow.                            

333
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,945
       And I'm gonna put this in
                  while --      

334
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:35,480
While that's simmering?         
                          Yes.  

335
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:39,150
So we've got the roasted ginger 
     and onions.                

336
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,218
                I like this.    

337
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,953
        Crystallized rock sugar?
Yes.                            

338
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,689
                Am I doing good?
You're doing perfectly.         

339
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,624
       And a little bit of salt?
And salt. Yep.                  

340
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:49,560
           So after we get done 
 simmering this for six hours --

341
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,029
We're gonna take out the bone   
and whatever's in there,        

342
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,698
and then the broth is ready     
       to go.                   

343
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,867
           I want to taste this.

344
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,172
    Oh, my gosh.                
         Oh!                    

345
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,307
                 [ Laughs ]     

346
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,176
             So now we're ready 
               for the noodle.  

347
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,315
               You just pour    
               the noodle in.   

348
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,850
So that rice noodle went        
    really fast.                

349
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,653
And then you put in the brisket.
              Put in the broth. 

350
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:18,322
         Oh.                    

351
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:23,594
       Then you just garnish it 
     with green onion, cilantro,

352
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,663
               and red onions,  

353
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:27,865
        and, last but not least,
              the black pepper. 

354
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,935
Little Thai basil in mine.      

355
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:32,270
See, I have my method.          

356
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:36,674
I'm Thai basil, jalapeños,      
bean sprouts for sure,          

357
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:41,278
a little bit of lime,           
and a touch of Sriracha.        

358
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,413
    There we go.                

359
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,215
        Now!                    

360
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,290
        Mmm!                    

361
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,958
The broth is outrageous.        

362
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,527
The brisket's sliced            
   nice and thin.               

363
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,897
        Mmm.                    

364
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,034
 In my world of pho,            
this is one of the best.        

365
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,669
                 Thank you.     

366
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,573
I wish I could get in it.       

367
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:13,644
       Just so much flavor      
       and so much depth.       

368
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,380
              MAN:              
     It tastes super-fresh.     

369
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,582
      You can taste all the     
  ingredients that go into it.  

370
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,316
I love squeezing the lime in it.

371
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,718
    That's kind of the icing    
          on the cake.          

372
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,654
   Out of bounds.               

373
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:23,854
I'll finish the soup.           

374
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,523
           You can go.          
       You can leave now.       

375
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:29,260
            Up next,            
   we're flying out to Oahu...  

376
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,195
              That's real-deal, 
           local-style Hawaiian.

377
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,197
 ...for island family recipes...

378
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,732
                That's a big,   
           hearty plate of ribs.

379
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,235
   ...that locals are calling   
             legit.             
That's how we do it here.       

380
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,245
 I'm here on the island of Oahu.

381
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,913
When I roll to places like this,

382
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:50,915
        I like to get off       
         the beaten path        

383
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,449
  and eat where the locals eat. 

384
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,251
    So I'm about a half-mile    
       from Kailua Beach,       

385
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,387
   one of the greatest beaches  
         in the islands,        

386
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,256
    and I'm here to check out   
             a joint            

387
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:00,458
  that is loved by the tourists 
        <i> and</i> the locals.        

388
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,993
     This is Boots & Kimo's.    

389
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,130
             JESSIE:            
         Pulehu ribs up.        

390
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,566
   The way that they cook it,   
       it's just perfect.       

391
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:13,137
 Very local Hawaiian-style food.

392
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,740
 FIERI: Something Boots Kiakona 
      found hard to come by     

393
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:18,342
     in the local food scene    
          20 years ago.         

394
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,345
    He had a dream of putting   
     a restaurant together,     

395
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:22,280
        'cause it Kailua,       
    it didn't have anything.    

396
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:25,416
   FIERI: Until his boys, Rick  
 and Jessie, honored that dream 

397
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,018
        by partnering up        
      with their uncle Kimo     

398
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,487
   to open this joint in '94.   

399
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,590
And it is what it is today --   
   Boots & Kimo's.              

400
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,893
    The food is really 'ono.    

401
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:38,829
   'Ono means "very delicious"  
          in Hawaiian.          

402
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,299
         Local favorites        
       like short ribs...       

403
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:48,106
   Chicken and always garlic,   
     katsu, Korean, mochiko.    

404
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,507
            The mochiko chicken.

405
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,041
WOMAN: Thank you.               
                         Enjoy. 

406
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,043
                    Mochiko?    
     Yeah.                      

407
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,177
Mochiko is a sweet flour.       

408
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,245
              What do you got?  
               Give it to me.   

409
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,246
Some chicken thighs here.       

410
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,782
      Boneless chicken thighs --
                  skin on.      

411
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:58,916
         So you run the kitchen,

412
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:00,051
              your brother runs 
         the front of the house?

413
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:01,119
        Yes.                    
    Pretty much.                

414
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,653
         Where'd all the recipes
                come from?      

415
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,722
From my mother, my father,      
 and my Uncle Kimo.             

416
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,125
                    Okay.       
So everybody had a hand in this.

417
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,525
            Now we're gonna make
                the marinade?   

418
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,794
        Yes.                    

419
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,395
 We have some sugar.            

420
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,331
This is the mochiko flour.      

421
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,798
It's rice -- sweet flour.       

422
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,533
     Cornstarch.                

423
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,669
  Sea salt.                     
                 So now in here?

424
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:21,205
     I can't believe you already
               got me working.  
I know.                         

425
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,740
                       Next up. 
 Okay. Some garlic.             

426
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:23,941
                There you go.   

427
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,877
Some water.                     
            A little soy sauce? 

428
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:29,013
And a little soy sauce.         

429
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,547
   And that's it.               

430
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,483
             Did you want to put
               the pepper in?   

431
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,017
        Yes.                    
I did miss the pepper.          

432
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,286
  Pour in the bowl.             

433
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,154
Add the green onion.            

434
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,357
   My egg mixture.              

435
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,961
              So now the chicken
                    in here?    
  The chicken.                  

436
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,899
              Let it marinate,  
             then we'll fry it. 

437
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,067
        Yeah.                   
    There you go.               

438
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,838
               How many pieces  
             are you giving me? 

439
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,440
  You look a little             
  on the thin side.             

440
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,643
      I'm not gonna get invited 
    to the luau like this, am I?

441
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,879
              And what does it  
              get served with?  

442
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,115
        Rice                    
and macaroni potato salad.      

443
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:05,516
                The staples.    

444
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,987
                    Mmm.        

445
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:12,456
That little bit of marinade made
   that much of a difference -- 

446
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,924
        really worked the flavor
                  in there.     

447
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,593
                    Mmm.        
             It's great, buddy. 

448
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,796
           I mean, it's simple. 
           It's straightforward.

449
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,465
                    Mmm.        
           It's got great taste.

450
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:21,799
      A little bit of sweetness.

451
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:23,868
                 Excellent.     

452
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,203
                  I dig it.     

453
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:27,004
 Mochiko chicken up.            

454
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,473
      It's very flavorful.      

455
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:32,610
   It's crispy on the outside,  
  soft and moist on the inside, 

456
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,779
        and it goes well        
    with the macaroni salad.    

457
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,014
One of the best mochiko chickens
         I've ever had.         

458
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,282
       WOMAN:                   
   Chicken katsu.               

459
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:42,019
     Everybody comes here --    
   Korea, Japan, Philippines.   

460
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:45,222
  FIERI: And especially welcome 
     are Denver Bronco fans.    

461
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,891
    Another John Elway pic--    

462
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,426
          I mean John,          
      you got to come here.     

463
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:49,627
    John watches "Triple D."    

464
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:50,828
       Hey, listen, Elway.      

465
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,230
   This is like the clubhouse   
        away from Denver.       

466
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,233
But the greatest fans here begin
      and end at the menu.      

467
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,635
        MAN:                    
   Kalbi ribs up.               

468
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:01,706
    Kalbi ribs -- That's high   
on the list here for must-order.

469
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:05,910
 It's like a sweet soy marinade,
        and it's grilled.       

470
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:08,445
             What are we making?
Hawaiian-style kalbi ribs.      

471
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:12,049
  Need some sugar,              
 some black pepper,             

472
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,585
 some sesame seeds,             
Hawaiian chili pepper,          

473
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:16,119
    some garlic.                

474
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,922
                   Sesame oil?  
 Sesame oil.                    

475
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:22,993
  Hawaiian papaya,              
some green onion, soy sauce.    

476
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,195
               And some water.  

477
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:25,730
     How long will this marinate
                on the ribs?    

478
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:28,665
   I marinate this              
    for two days.               

479
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,601
      It's like a meat waterfall
               in Flavortown.   

480
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,537
                We ready to go  
                on the grill?   
 Ready to go.                   

481
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,812
    Here you go.                

482
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:44,348
                That's a big,   
           hearty plate of ribs.

483
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,685
                    Mmm.        
       The flavor is outrageous.

484
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,620
                    Mmm.        

485
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:52,155
                 Big. Rich.     

486
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,824
           A little spice to it,
               a little sweet.  

487
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,293
             Just look at that. 

488
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,229
           Great hot char on it.

489
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:59,430
            It's not just sweet.

490
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,765
          There's a little touch
          of some heat in there.

491
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,768
            It is really tender.
                    Mmm.        

492
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,770
              That's real-deal, 
           local-style Hawaiian.

493
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:08,239
That's how we do it here.       
       No wonder you do so well.

494
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,373
   Kalbi ribs up.               

495
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,575
             WOMAN:             
     Super tasty and juicy.     

496
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,111
   They have a lot of good fat  
       and flavor in them.      

497
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:15,980
 It's like if you were to do it 
            at home,            

498
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:17,982
 but it's even better than that.

499
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:20,952
 Really 'ono, and we like that. 

500
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,657
  Amazing tribute that you did  
  for your dad and your uncle.  

501
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,993
 I think that's what makes this 
         really happen.         

502
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,261
        Food's delicious,       

503
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,930
    and it's just really good   
    old-school Hawaiian, man.   

504
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,065
Thank you.                      
            Thanks.             
                      Thank you.

505
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,199
              Nice.             

506
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:36,267
          Go, Raiders.          

507
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:38,802
                     [ Laughs ] 
  [ Laughs ]                    

508
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:42,273
So that's it for this road trip,
        but don't worry.        

509
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:45,276
    We got plenty more joints   
 to find all over this country! 

510
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:47,010
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

511
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,680
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

512
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,549
              MAN:              
   We're done with the scene.   

513
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,284
          We can, uh...         
          [ Laughter ]          

514
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,619
Do you really like that?        
                It's phenomenal.

515
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,354
I thought he was just acting.   
     [ Laughs ]                 

516
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,457
           No. No. No.
