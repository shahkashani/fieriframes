       IT'S KIND OF LIKE        
 SOUTHWEST CUISINE MEETS HELL.  

130
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,996
             WHAT ARE WE MAKING?
WE'RE GONNA DO OUR HOT PEPPER

A LITTLE BIT OF SALT. GLAZE WITH

WHICH IS LOUKANIKO,

00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,772
THAT ONE IS CASED.

              TWO OF THE THREE. 

252

YOU KNOW, NICE FAT CONTENT.

        SALT, CUMIN.            

258
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,252
          THE ONLY THING THAT'S 
         REALLY SURPRISING TO ME

259
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,456
              IS THE, UH, CUMIN.
A MAJORITY OF THE DIFFERENT     
 SAUSAGES AND CHARCUTERIE,

  THAT WORD OUT. THAT'S AWESOME.
CHARCUTERIE.

SAVORY OR BULGARIAN OREGANO,    
        ESSENTIALLY.

263
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,067
                 VERY LIGHT     
           IN THE OREGANO FIELD.
YEAH.                           

264
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,736
FRESH GROUND PEPPER.            
              AND WHO TAUGHT YOU
               TO DO ALL THIS?  

265
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:14,005
    IT'S BEEN PASSED DOWN       
FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION,  

266
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,541
UM, WHICH TAUGHT

   THE KYUFTE IS THE ONE        
THAT'S SHAPED LIKE A PATTY.

 JUST GROUND CORIANDER.         

274
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,160
  SO WE'RE GONNA                
COVER EVERYTHING UP             

275
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:39,564
    AND PUT IT IN               
THE COOLER OVERNIGHT.           
       LET'S GRIND SOME SAUSAGE.

276
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,500
             AND JUST ONE GRIND?

277

                 THROUGH HERE.  

278
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,404
             THEN WE PUT IT     
        IN THE MIXER AFTER THAT?
CORRECT.                        

279
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,773
        GOT TO SMEAR IT TOGETHER
         TO GET IT MORE CONTACT.

280
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,443
  YEAH, AND IT GETS IT TO       
A REALLY STICKY CONSISTENCY.    

281
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:54,312
  IT MAKES IT                   
EASIER TO SHAPE.                
                           OKAY.

282
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,781

                       KUEF-TAY.
YEAH.                           

285
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,254
WE'RE GOING TO ADD              

286
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:06,257
OUR GREEN ONION,                
    PARSLEY.                    

287
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,593
 THEN WE JUST MIX               
EVERYTHING TOGETHER             

288
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,862
 TO FORM IT                     
INTO A PATTY.                   

289
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,397
                DOES IT GO ON   
            THE GRILL NOW, OR...
YEP.                            

290
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,534
       OKAY, SO WHILE THAT ONE'S
           COOKING, NEXT UP?    
THE KEBAPCHE.                   

291
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,970
OKAY, THIS IS GONNA             
 BE THE FUN PART.               

292
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,341
SO THIS ONE WE FORM             
  INTO A SAUSAGE,               

293
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,210
AND THAT'S IT.                  
                           OKAY.

00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,284
    IT'S CURED                  
FOR ABOUT SIX DAYS.             

298
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,887
IT HAS RED WINE, NUTMEG,        
   THE OREGANO IN IT.           

299
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,022
THIS ACTUALLY DATES             
BACK TO ROMAN TIMES.            

300
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,891
AND THE ALLSPICE.               
  AND THIS IS MADE TO YOUR SPEC,
          TO YOUR RECIPE.       

301
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,625
ABSOLUTELY.                     
                 SO YOU SCORE IT
                  A LITTLE BIT. 

302
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,495
 TURN IT OVER,                  
FLATTEN IT OUT.                 

303
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:45,230
                   WE'RE ALMOST 
                 A SALAMI THERE.

304
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,965
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE             
A FLATTER PRODUCT.              
                           OKAY.

305
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,434
            AND WHAT'S ALL THIS 
           GONNA BE SERVED WITH?

306
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:53,037
LYUTENITSA, WHICH IS A ROASTED  
RED PEPPER AND TOMATO SPREAD.   

307
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,640

 AND PARSLEY.                   

309
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:01,445
    THAT IS A PLATTER. GOT TO BE
      CLOSE TO A POUND OF MEAT. 

310
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,581
DIP IT IN THE LYUTENITSA.       
THIS IS A TRADITIONAL WAY.      

311
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,983
YOU CAN EVEN PICK UP            
THE ONIONS WITH IT.             

312
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,451
                   GREAT FLAVOR.

313
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,454
               WHERE'S THIS BEEN
                  ALL MY DIET?  
(laughs)                        

314
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,189
 THE RIGHT BLEND OF SEASONINGS--
            VERY RICH.          
MM-HMM.                         

315
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,859
         EACH ONE HAS ITS OWN   
     RESPECTIVE DIFFERENT TASTE,

316
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:18,196
           AND THEN YOU DIP     
     A LITTLE BIT OF THIS, UH...
LYUTENITSA.                     

317
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:20,732
              WHAT'S IN THE MIX?
TOMATO AND ROASTED PEPPER       
         SPREAD.

    REALLY REPRESENTS NINA.

    THE ARTWORK, EVERYTHING     
      SHE'S DONE HERSELF.       

323
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,814
  IT'S VERY ECLECTIC, SO IT'S   
     COLORFUL, IT'S BRIGHT.

        YOU EAT THE WHOLE THING,

329
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,093
                 YOU GET TO KEEP

337
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:14,151
    I REALLY WANTED TO BRING    
SOMETHING TO THE VEGAS COMMUNITY

338
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,820
THAT I THOUGHT                  
 WAS LACKING.                   

339

JUST EASTERN EUROPEAN.          

340
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,758
IT GOES FROM SPAIN              
   TO BULGARIA                  

341
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,494

343
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,966
THE THRACIANS WERE THE PEOPLE   
   WHO PRETTY MUCH CREATED      

344
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:30,034
 THE BUILDING BLOCKS            
OF BULGARIAN CULTURE.           
                           OKAY.

345
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,470
   THIS ORIGINATED AROUND       
THE FOURTH AND FIFTH CENTURY.   

346
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,541
   (Nina) THRACIAN CLAY POTS

347
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,943
WE START WITH TOMATO.           

348
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,648
AND NEXT, WE ADD OUR            
ROASTED BELL PEPPERS.           
       ANY TYPE OF PEPPER, OR...

349
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,384
 I LIKE USING, YOU KNOW,        
THE RED OR THE YELLOW ONES      

350
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,385

351
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,656
                 AND THIS IS    
             THE BULGARIAN FETA?
YES.                            

352
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:53,725
AND THEN WE ADD                 
THE GREEN ONION,                

353
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,993
       AND THEN                 
WE ADD THE FETA CHEESE.         

354
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:59,130
 NEXT, WE ADD JUST A LITTLE BIT 
OF THE SAVORY BULGARIAN OREGANO,

355
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:03,067
AND JUST TOP IT OFF             
  WITH OLIVE OIL.               
                   GREEK FEELING
                    TO IT HERE. 

356
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,002
A LOT OF GREEK INFLUENCE        
   IN BULGARIAN FOOD.           

357
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:08,806
                  ANOTHER TOMATO

PUSH IT DOWN.

00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:11,275

    25 MINUTES.                 

359
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,478
                 AND NOW WE POT.

360
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,081
YEAH, DON'T TOUCH IT.           
  IT'S REALLY HOT.              

361
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,749
THIS IS OUR LUKANKA.

THIS IS THE BULGARIAN           
DRY-CURED CHARCUTERIE.

OF THE FLAVOR'S JUST COMPACTED, 

364
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,626
AND WE CUT THIS                 
EXTREMELY THIN.                 

365
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,561
                 THAT IS KILLER.
LIKE IT? GOOD.                  

366

MAJORITY OF IT.

369
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,903
SO I JUST KEPT CUTTING.         
         YEAH. I WOULD HAVE BEEN
        WORRIED ABOUT THAT, TOO.

370
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:42,640
JUST STACK EVERYTHING.          
             HEALTHY LITTLE POT.

371
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:46,711
PUT OUR EGG, AND WE JUST        
TAKE OUR SERRANO PEPPER.        

372
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:49,313
WE DON'T TAKE THE SEEDS OUT     
  OR ANYTHING. THAT'S IT.       

373
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:52,317
THIS NEEDS TO GO IN THE OVEN    
 FOR ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES.      

374
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,652
THE MEAT CAN COOK AND THE PEPPER
     CAN COOK AND THE EGG.      

375
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,587
         I DON'T KNOW WHEN      
   THE CLAY POT'S GONNA BE DONE,

376
00:15:56,589 --> 00:16:00,257
   BUT I'VE EATEN ABOUT 4 POUNDS
         OF THIS KILLER...      
LUKANKA.                        

377
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,460
             EXACTLY. ALL RIGHT,
                LET'S GET IT.   

378
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,096
                    IT'S REALLY,
                     REALLY HOT.

CORRECT.                        

380
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:14,005
TRADITIONALLY, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE 
   MIX EVERYTHING TOGETHER.     

381
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:15,540
  IT'S VERY GOOD

EASTERN EUROPEAN BREAD          

384
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,879

    IN-HOUSE.                   

385
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,818
                            WOW.
IT'S A VERY HEARTY DISH.

YEP.                            

387
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:31,021
          THERE'S FAR MORE THERE
         THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON

388
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,690
               CAN PROBABLY EAT.

389
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,293
   WHEN I HEARD THAT THERE WAS  
 A PLACE SERVING BULGARIAN FOOD,

390
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:39,296
          I HAD TO TRY IT.      
   FOOD'S GREAT. YOU'RE AMAZING.
THANK YOU.

                 REALLY.        

392
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:45,636
  IN VEGAS? I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL
   STROMBOLI AND CHICKEN WINGS. 

393
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:49,107
   YOU KNOW, COMING TO VEGAS,   
       EATING GREAT FOOD        

394
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,708
  MAKES ME A LITTLE HOMESICK--  

395

     AND BACK OF THE HOUSE

  NICE, YOU JUST LET ME KNOW,

     SOME PICTURES OF HIM.      

433

      A LITTLE THAI SHRIMP SAUTé

                 IN THE MIDDLE. 

435
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,646
             WHAT WE HAVE HERE  
           IS A U/10 P&D SHRIMP.

436
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,248
                   P&D IS PEELED
                   AND DEVEINED.

437
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,050
    I DO A LITTLE BIT OF A CROSS
       OF A DRY AND A WET RUB.  
            HIT IT.             

438
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,652
          OKAY. WE HAVE A LITTLE
              LAS CRUCES RUB.   

439
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,721
     WE GOT A CHILI PEPPER      
            MEDLEY.             
                   YEAH, MEDLEY,
                     EXACTLY.   

440
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,522
             OKAY.              
                     YEAH, IT'S 
                    REALLY GOOD.

00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,591
     THEN RIGHT HERE, I JUST GOT
    A LITTLE BIT OF FLORIDA BAY,

              CELERY SALT THERE,

443
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,797
        CHIVE, A LITTLE PARSLEY,
         A LITTLE BIT OF GARLIC,

444
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,066
                    A LITTLE BIT
                     OF SHALLOTS

445
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:57,134
               WITH A LITTLE BIT
                 OF OLIVE OIL.  

446
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,470

447
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,139
          AND HOW LONG          
       IS THIS GONNA GO?        
                    NOT MORE    
               THAN A HALF-HOUR.

448
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,408
                    SAUTé IT UP.
           PAN'S HOT?           

449
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,877
           PAN'S HOT. I ADD     
     A LITTLE "CANOLER" ON THIS,

450
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,480
               BECAUSE OLIVE OIL
                    TENDS--     
  DOES "CANOLA"                 
HAVE AN "R" IN IT?              

451
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,948
                         CANOLA.
"CANOLER"?                      

452
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,016
           (laughing)           

453
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,085
 OKAY, WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS JUST

454
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,154

           THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE   
        LOOKING FOR--THE SIZZLE.

455
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,291
TOUCH OF WHITE WINE JUST TO GIVE
  IT A LITTLE SWEETNESS, OKAY?

            GONNA PLATE IT UP-- 
           STICKY RICE AND SLAW.

459
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:35,840
                  A LITTLE SAUCE
                     ON EACH.   

460
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,776
 PUT JUST A LITTLE CHIVE ON TOP,
      A LITTLE GREEN ONION,     

461
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,511

              TO TOP IT OFF.    

462

00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,586
            OH, CHEF, NONE

                OH, NONE FOR ME.

465
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,121
                IT'S OKAY.      
                           YEAH.

466
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:52,557
 GET A LITTLE BIT OF THAT SLAW, 
   A LITTLE BIT OF THAT RICE.   

467
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,793

       FLOATING IN THE SAUCE.   

468
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,262
              THE SHRIMP        
         IS COOKED PERFECTLY.   

469
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,264

    BIT WHEN YOU BITE ON IT.

      VINEGAR COMING THROUGH,

473
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:08,538
  AND THAT GARLIC--THIS WHOLE

479
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,219
        CHEF, IT'S A PLEASURE.  
             ALL RIGHT, BROTHER.
                 THANK YOU.     

480
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,954
        I LOVE TO SEE WHAT'S    
        GOING ON AT U.N.L.V.

                    THANKS, GUY.

485
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:32,563
     CERTAIN STUDENTS HAVE      
  AN "X" FACTOR--THAT WAS GUY.  

486
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:36,534
   I'M SO PROUD OF HIM. HARD    
TO BELIEVE, BUT HE HAS MATURED. 

487
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,104
  SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP,
