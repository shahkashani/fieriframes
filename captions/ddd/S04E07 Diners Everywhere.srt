  I TRIED IT ONE TIME.

THAT'S ALL I GET NOW.           
                  LAMB ON A ROD.

 MAKE LAMB ON THE ROD.

207
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,990
           SO HOW DO WE MAKE IT?
FIRST WE TAKE                   
A LEG OF LAMB.                  

208
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,392
           BONE ROLLED AND TIED.
AND THEN WE CUBE IT UP.         

209
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:17,195
               HOW DID YOU LEARN
               HOW TO MAKE THIS?
I LEARNED HOW TO CUBE IT FROM-- 
   MY FATHER WAS A BUTCHER.     

210

              ON THE COUNTER    

213
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,203
        AND THEN RUN IT THROUGH.
  I LIKE TO LOOK                
LIKE I'M DANGEROUS.             

214
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,806

                  ALL THE WAY.  

217
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,346
      I WAS TRYING TO GIVE YOU  
    A VALUE-CONSCIOUS MEAL, SO--
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

NEXT IS OIL, CHOPPED GARLIC.    

224

       TO LET THIS MARINATE FOR?
OVERNIGHT.                      

225
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:53,365

PUT IT ON THE GRILL HERE,       
  A LITTLE BIT OF OIL.          

226
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,233
    NICE SQUIRT BOTTLE THING.

          AND GARLIC IN HERE,   

228
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,306
         A LITTLE BIT OF BUTTER.

       ON THOSE.                

229
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,108
WHEN DO THESE                   
 GO ON, NOW?                    
          YEAH. IN THE MEANTIME,
               THAT'S DONE.     

230
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,110

SHOW ME THE MAGIC.              
              I HAVE A DELICIOUS
                 GARLIC SAUCE.  

233
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,717
                IS THAT NORMAL  
               IN LEBANESE FOOD,

234
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,719
              THAT YOU GET THIS 
             LITTLE ACCOUTREMENT

235
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,588
                      EACH TIME?
EVERYTHING GETS THE PEPPERS     
      AND THE GARLIC.           

236
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,657
               IT LOOKS GREAT.  
            MY MOUTH'S WATERING.
IS IT?                          

237
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,259
  WE'LL ADD SOME PITA BREAD,    
A LITTLE BIT OF PARSLEY FLAKES, 

238
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,261
MAKE IT LOOK PRETTY.            
              YOU GET THE SAUCE,
                GRILLED PEPPER. 

239
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,997
         AT LEAST THAT SKEWER'S 
            NOT SMOKING HOT.    

240
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:29,467
     SO YOU HOLD THE END        
OF THE SKEWER WITH THE BREAD.   
                             AH!

241
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:32,803
THEN YOU REMOVE IT              
 WITH THE BREAD.                
                         MM-HMM!

       LAMB'S GOT GREAT FLAVOR. 

244
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:39,210
        SO IS IT OKAY TO MAKE   
    LITTLE SANDWICHES OUT OF IT?
YES.

00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:49,260
              SO WE'RE GONNA ADD
                  FIRST AJO.    
SO A LITTLE GARLIC.             

470
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,929
                  ONION, PEPPER.
 ONION. IS THAT                 
MEXICAN OREGANO?                

471
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:55,399
                 YES. THYME,    
             MARJORAM, ALLSPICE.
ALLSPICE!                       

472
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,335
OKAY.                           
              CINNAMON, CAYENNE,
                   PAPRIKA.     

473
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,136
                THEN NEW MEXICO 
               RED CHILI POWDER.

474
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,205
 WHICH YOU SEE A LOT            
USED UP HERE IN UTAH.           
                    IT IS, YEAH.

475
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,074
             WE'RE ADDING SALT, 
               LAUREL LEAVES,   

476
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:06,543
                  VINEGAR. I'M--
 WELL, AT LEAST THIS ISN'T      
GONNA BE LACKING IN FLAVOR.     

477
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:10,548
                 NO, NOT AT ALL.
YOU COULD USE STYROFOAM PEANUTS,
   AND THIS WOULD TASTE GOOD.   

478
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:13,017
AND THEN SOME OIL.              
                            OIL.

479
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:16,420
 HEY, LOOK AT THAT.             
IT LOOKS LIKE PORK.             
            IT IS, COARSE GRIND.

480
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,623
OKAY.                           
                WE'LL LEAVE IT  
             IN THE REFRIGERATOR

481
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,291
                      FOR A DAY.
    THAT IS                     
A LOT OF SPICE.                 

482
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,359
         OKAY. TACOS DON RAMON. 

483
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,162
           WE'RE GONNA START    
      WITH SOME CHOPPED SIRLOIN,

484
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,164
      PUT IT RIGHT ON THE GRILL.
HOW MANY TACOS                  
 YOU MAKIN'?                    

485
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:27,965
                          THREE.
(whistles)                      

486
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,501
  YOU'RE GONNA EAT THREE OF 'EM.
    THIS IS NEW MEXICO POWDER.  
AND WHAT'S IN THAT?             

487
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,103
               GARLIC AND SALT. 

488
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:33,770
       I'M GONNA ADD THE CHORIZO
             RIGHT ON TOP.      

489
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,039
THIS IS MADE TO ORDER           
     EACH TIME?                 
                     YES, IT IS.

490
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:37,642
(whistles)                      
        I HAVE MY TORTILLAS HERE

491
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,577
                 THAT I DIPPED  
              IN A LITTLE OIL...
SURE.                           

492
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,646
    TO MAKE 'EM PLIABLE, RIGHT? 
   WE'LL JUST STICK THOSE THERE.

493
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,847
  YOU WANT TO GET A LITTLE BIT  
 OF THE CHORIZO JUICE ON THERE, 

494
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:45,983
      JUST TO KIND OF TURN THEM 
     A NICE REALLY PRETTY COLOR.
OKAY.                           

495
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,786
   A LITTLE BIT OF OIL          
WITH THE SEASONINGS IN IT.      
                            YES.

496
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,855
THAT SMELLS INCREDIBLE.         

497
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,590
WOW, THAT LOOKS GOOD.           

498
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,792
         A LITTLE BIT OF LETTUCE
              IN THE TACOS.     

499
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,527
                   QUESO COTIJA.
OH, YEAH.                       

500
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,595
 QUESO FRESCA,                  
QUESO ANYTHING.                 
                           OKAY.

501
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,931
 THIS IS A LITTLE AVOCADO SALSA 
         THAT WE SERVE.         

502
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,334
               I'M GONNA ADD    
          A LITTLE PICO DE GALLO

503
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,336
                    ON THE SIDE.
LOVE, PEACE                     

504
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,405
AND TACO GREASE.                

505
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,943
DELICIOUS.                      

506
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:16,213
    CHORIZO'S FANTASTIC.        
THE MEAT IS NICE AND TENDER.    

507
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:18,082
     THE CHEESE--               
I DON'T HAVE ANY ON ME.         

508
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,484
     THAT'S A MIRACLE.          
I HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM IT.     

509
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,953
MAYBE JUST ONE MORE BITE.       
                         PLEASE.

510
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,423
     IT'S GOT DEPTH, BUT IT     
  ALSO HAS A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT 

511
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,825
       BUT NOT TOO MUCH.        
IT ALMOST TASTES LIKE IT HAS    
A SEASONING ON THE TORTILLA     

512
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,227
AND THEN DEEP FRIED.            
     EXCELLENT.                 
              I COULD EAT, LIKE,
                 80 OF THOSE.   

513
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,296
      KILLER MEXICAN FOOD--     
    I MEAN, THAT SAYS IT ALL.   

514
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:35,633
      OH, THIS IS THE BEST PLACE
         IN TOWN, HANDS DOWN.   
NO QUESTION?                    

515
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:37,968
          SALUD, RAMON,         
         AND LUCY, TOO.         

516
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:41,505
                 WE'LL MAKE MOLE
                    ALL DAY!    

517
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:43,307
   SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP,  

518
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,109
           BUT WE GOT           
   PLENTY MORE JOINTS TO FIND.  

519
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:47,778
     I'LL BE LOOKIN' FOR YOU    
    NEXT TIME ON "TRIPLE-D."    

520
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,780
                          THYME.
IT'S, UH...                     

521
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,515
                   WE'RE ADDING 
                    THE THYME.  

522
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,384
WHOO!                           

523
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:56,921
       (making crackling sounds)
      DID THAT MAKE SENSE?      
        ARE YOU WITH ME?
