            Get in the pancetta.

436
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,581
 This is gonna take             
a second to crisp up.

Hit this with white wine.

     Take a nice

442
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,192
    And I'm just                
  gonna cover this.             

443
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:29,927
When those clams open up,       

444
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,330
   I'm gonna drop               
my fresh-made linguini.         

445
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,465

         the linguini every day?

446
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,534
  Yep.                          
                So this goes    
            in the pasta cooker.

447
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:39,203
I'm gonna finish it with a nice,
healthy piece of butter.        

448
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,205
  So, my clams are              
 all opened up here.            

449
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,807
  Add in my pasta.              

450
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,943
   Let it soak up               
some of those juices.           

451
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:47,344
               This is called   
           nesting of the pasta.

452
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,679
             So, pasta there... 

453
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,015
      stands it up so it doesn't
         get lost in the bottom.

454
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:54,485
               That broth just

00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,418
  I bought a smoker             
and was smoking fish.           

788
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,755
       Then 12 years ago,       
         he turned pro.         

789
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:39,289
  We started making             
all of our own deli meats,      

790
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,757
  and then we built             
  a sandwich menu.              

791
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,559
        Their sandwiches        
         are wonderful.         

792
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:45,029
         -Lynn, come get        
        your French Kiss!       
   -He makes everything fresh.  

793
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:46,830
        Yep. Everything.        

794
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,365
            Italien.            
       House-made salami.       

795
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:51,435
DeWitt Seitzer with a pork loin.
 Hot chorizo with pepperoncini. 

796
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:53,570
        -And get this...        
        -Bison pastrami.        

797
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:56,573
   -Two Pastrami Mommys to go.  
  -Really juice, really fresh.  

798
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:59,643
         Oh, I love it.         
     Bison pastrami.            
Now I'm making the brine.       

799
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:01,912
   Salt. Dextrose.              
  It's corn sugar.              

800
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,614
This is sodium nitrate --       
   the pink salt.               

801
00:28:03,616 --> 00:28:04,715
   Now we're gonna              
    stir this up.               

802
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:06,917
Get ready to inject it          
   into the bison.              

803
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,652
        -Like, inject it?       
           -Inject it.          

804
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:10,387
           -Seriously?          
           -Seriously.          

805
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:12,256
     Bison eye of the round.    
    -Eye of the round, right.   

806
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:14,458
   And this is --               
  It'll spray this.             
              This is awesome.  

807
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,193
It draws up the brine           
     as we pump.                

808
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,795
So it's gonna inject            
 the brine all over             

809
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:19,063
  inside the eye of the round.  

810
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:21,532
              -Wow.             
     -You see it expanding?     

811
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,667
                           Yeah.
Got to make sure that           
this brine gets everywhere.     

812
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:25,269
                    Ohh!        

813
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:27,004
Once we pump all of these       
   with the brine,              

814
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:28,806
put them in this bucket         
and pour the brine over them,   

815
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:30,474
  we'll add a bunch             
  of fresh garlic.              

816
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:32,542
      And how long will this sit
          with this brine in it?

817
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,278
        -For seven days.        
          -Seven days?          

818
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,746
               So you're just   
              rotating batches? 

819
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:38,148
 Yeah. Get this off.            
You see all the garlic on top?  

820
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,750
We give this a little rinse     
 and then we coat it            

821
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:42,285
with a combination of           
black pepper and coriander.     

822
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,954
  Lay it on thick.              
You kinda press it in.          

823
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:45,221
            And this is gonna go
           into the meat smoker.

824
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,490
This is gonna go right          
in the meat smoker, you bet.    

825
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:47,824
            And what temperature
           is this gonna run at?

826
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,159
It's gonna start at 130.        

827
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:50,693
 You gradually raise            
 the temperature up.            

828
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:51,962
                 So how long    
              is this gonna go? 

829
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:53,363
   Probably about               
  six, seven hours.             

830
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:54,431
               That's awesome.  

831
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,166
 And these are ready            
   for the smoker.              

832
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:57,768
         -We pop it in.         
           -In we go.           

833
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,369
               The wood chips   
                  go here?      

834
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:00,637
    This is maple               
  and hickory wood.             

835
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:02,305
 And this is called             
 a smoke generator.             

836
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:05,375
The hopper turns, drops saw dust
down on that hot plate,         

837
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:06,710
   under which is               
 a heating element,             

838
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:08,846
and the fans suck it in         
  to the smokehaus.             

839
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:10,046
 After seven hours,             

840
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,381
we take all of the racks        
out of the smokehaus            

841
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:13,049
and we put them in our          
walk-in cooler over night.      

842
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:16,253
                Look at that.   
             Look at the color. 

843
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,789
    Eye of the round is perfect,
               not real fatty.  

844
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:21,725
             Look, it's raining.

845
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:23,327
              Humongous flavor. 

846
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:26,462
            Dude, you should try
      doing this professionally.

847
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,599
All right, we're gonna          
make the Pastrami Mommy.        

848
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,734
                Little mayo.    
               Little mustard.  

849
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:34,004
              Lots of pastrami. 
  Pepperoncinis.                

850
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:35,672
                Couple slices   
                of Provolone.   

851
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:37,807
                  Lettuce.      
              There we have it. 

852
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,943
   I feel guilty.               

853
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:43,013
                     ♪♪         

854
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:45,349
   I was drooling.              

855
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:47,350
        Mmm.                    
  You killed that.              

856
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:50,620
Can you see the halo?           

857
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,923
 Right there? Look.             
Show them your wings.           

858
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:58,128
      Oh, man!                  

859
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,763
        -Pastrami Mommy.        
        -It's delicious.        

860
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:02,699
You just don't normally         
get bison in a lunch-meat form. 

861
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,635
          Everything is         
      really really fresh.      

862
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,303
   And as local as we can get.  

863
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,438
         -Like this one.        
   -Whitefish basket, please.   

864
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,639
     You got it.                

865
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,708
   Whitefish is quintessentially
               Lake Superior.   

866
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,845
   I've never had               
Lake Superior whitefish.        
               Well, you better.

867
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:16,847
This is the start of            
the smoked whitefish process.   

868
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:18,381
  We're gonna make              
a very simple brine.            

869
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,516
 10 pounds of salt.             
2 pound brown sugar.            

870
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,386
      So how long will this fish
              sit in the brine? 

871
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:23,921
     Two hours.                 

872
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:25,989
  And how many fish are you able
    to do in a smoker at a time?

873
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,724
Typically about 250 pounds.     

874
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:29,193
                [ Whistles ]    
             That's a big fish. 

875
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:30,794
   Because we made              
that really intense brine,      

876
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:32,863
    it's gonna be               
a short brining process,        

877
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:35,165
I score them so that brine has  
a chance to penetrate the fish. 

878
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,600
And then we dump the brine.     

879
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:37,935
                   I mean,      
       I don't have much to say.

880
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:40,003
           I'm just sitting here
      watching this just in awe.

881
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,005
                It's awesome.   
    Cool.                       

882
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,473
      So, after                 
 the two-hour soak,             

883
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:45,475
you rinse the excess            
 brine off of them.             

884
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:49,012
     We rack it                 
 for the smokehaus.             

885
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,481
         -Look at this.         
         -Slide them in.        

886
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:54,084
                 Seriously,     
           I want to drive this.

887
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:57,220
And it goes in the smokehaus    
for about six to seven hours.   

888
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,290
                The Vortron.    

889
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,624
I'm getting one of these.       

890
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,626
Lori's just gonna have to       
deal with it in the house.      

891
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,762
 GOERDT: Once it smokes, then we
take it into the walk-in cooler.

892
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:07,964
It cools?                       
              Yep. Over night.  
And then it's ready to be eaten.

893
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,699
      Awesome.                  
I eat the whole fish?           

894
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,835
     You can eat the whole fish.
             Peel the skin back,

895
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:13,636
    and then my favorite cracker
             in the whole world.

896
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,105
      All we need's a cold beer.

897
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:16,572
        Mmm!                    
You got to be kidding.          

898
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,642
       -What do you think?      
     -It's rich, it's flaky.    

899
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:20,243
 It is outstanding.             

900
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,045
             Yeah, whitefish has
          a really clean flavor.

901
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,580
  Mmm. So balanced.             

902
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:26,516
It's not sweet, it's not salty, 
it's not over-smoked.           

903
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:31,254
It's just got this really nice, 
 easy-going flavor.             

904
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,789
 Right on. Awesome.             

905
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:34,591
    -Smoked whitefish basket.   
          -It's great.          

906
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:36,927
    He just does a great job.   
 -It's the only place to buy it.

907
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:39,463
Brother, you don't need         
to make anything else.          

908
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:41,331
          Then again...         
        -Salamini basket.       

909
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,134
          Ah. Salamini.         
        It's like heaven.       

910
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:46,003
    -I'll have the salaminis.   
         -The salaminis.        

911
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:47,738
 That's my passion.             

912
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,072
              By far the best.  

913
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,141
    We are making our house-made
             dry-cured salamini.

914
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:54,010
                 Which means    
          small-diameter salami.

915
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,947
      -Let's rock and roll.     
     -Ground Berkshire pork.    

916
00:31:56,949 --> 00:31:58,148
   Berkshire pork.              

917
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,816
         The bomb pork.         
        -Plain old salt.        

918
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:01,417
             -Okay.             
   -Then we have fennel seeds.  

919
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,619
              -Mmm.             
     -Cracked black pepper.     

920
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,621
              Dry milk powder.  
           Dextrose. Corn sugar.

921
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:06,223
   And this is sodium nitrate --
                curing salt.    

922
00:32:06,225 --> 00:32:09,492
So we have a bacterial inhibitor
   throughout the whole process.

923
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:12,095
Okay.                           
           And then this is just
   garlic pureed with olive oil.

924
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,297
               So, we mix this  
                really well.    

925
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:14,631
             And we're gonna add
            the starter culture.

926
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,433
   And the starter              
 culture is for...?             

927
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,701
                   There's      
            a fermentation stage

928
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:19,703
   which is gonna take about two
               to three days.   
Okay.                           

929
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:22,973
   And what that does it is eats
 the sugars that we put in there

930
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:24,640
               and it creates   
                lactic acid.    

931
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:27,310
            And that lactic acid
             will lower the PH. 

932
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,746
These are all preservation      
methods, and not taste methods. 

933
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,448
         But oddly enough, these
    are all contributing factors

934
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,182
          to the flavor profile.
Okay.                           

935
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,385
              So, we pack it in 
  to this sausage cylinder here.

936
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:37,186
             We put it up here. 
               Crank it down.   

937
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:39,589
        -That is awesome.       
   -These are beef intestines.  

938
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:41,725
    And do they have a porosity,
                or a breathe?   

939
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:44,127
They definitely do, and that    
becomes really important,       

940
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,995
  because it allows             
 moisture to escape.            

941
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:49,198
I'm just gonna cut it,          
twist it in two links here      

942
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,335
    so it doesn't come apart.   
 -So it's gonna hang from there.

943
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:53,202
 And at this point,             
  we take a weight.             

944
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,604
               How much weight  
             will have been lost

945
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:56,273
             before you declare 
               that it's done?  

946
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:59,276
Most times, we'll pull it out   
when it's 25% or 30%,           

947
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,145
 but I think 40% --             
for my taste buds -- is perfect.

948
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,414
So now we're gonna dip them     
in a penicillin solution.       

949
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:06,282
It's almost like the penicillin 
on the outside of brie cheese.  

950
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,084
It keeps the outside            
 of the salami moist            

951
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,086
     in the drying process.     
        -This is awesome!       

952
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:12,022
 We're gonna put it             
in our fermentation cabinet.    

953
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:13,890
  And that's gonna              
    lower the pH                

954
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:16,026
      over this                 
two-to-three-day period.        

955
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:18,294
                        Whoa.   
   As you can see,              
 that mold has grown            

956
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,696
  and you can smell             
  the lactic acid.              

957
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:21,731
Pull these out of here and      
take them into our curing room. 

958
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,967
Now they're gonna dry           
 for about 30 days.             

959
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:25,635
                Oh, my gosh!    

960
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:27,304
 So now we're gonna             
   hang these up.               

961
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:29,706
        This is so cool!        

962
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:32,242
Once we get close to 30 days,   
we'll begin to weigh them.      

963
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:33,510
    That's where                
  the 40% comes in.             

964
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,045
 And then they'll be            
    ready to eat.               

965
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:36,513
            Love it.            

966
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:37,781
Throw this up on the scale      
just to make sure it's ready.   

967
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:39,182
And you want to slice           
  this really thin              

968
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,851

00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:06,936
I like what you got --          
real food, real people.         

1006
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,404
          Okay, folks.          

1007
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,673
   And with a little help from  
 his dad, who's hard to miss... 

1008
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:13,543
         -New customers.        
     -Papa D is just Papa D.    

1009
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:16,413
We got some natives here,       
and some West Coast             
people over here.               

1010
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:17,680
     Sit back and enjoy him.    

1011
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,482
    This is what you're gonna   
       grow up to be like.      

1012
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:22,018
                     Hopefully. 
         So that's your         
     dad's design out front?    

1013
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,554
    -That's Papa D's design.    
    -And this is your domain?   

1014
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:26,689
          He started in         
       the food biz at 15       

1015
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,692
        and then did some       
    moonlighting in his 20s.    

1016
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:30,393
                    I was       
        a professional wrestler.

1017
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:31,695
            -Hold on.           
        -That's it, baby.       

1018
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:33,163
I mean, did they throw you?     
 I mean, what was...            

1019
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:35,298
        Yeah, they did all kinds
   of stuff, but my dad told me,

1020
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,234
         he said, "Son, you need
          to get out of the ring

1021
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:38,434
                and get back    
              in the kitchen."  

1022
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,170
 To focus on what he does best. 

1023
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:42,638
        I was trained by some of
 the highest chefs in this area,

1024
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,908
           on how to put it out,
  and how to make it taste good.

1025
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,910
        And nothing says        
       Gulf shore cooking       

1026
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:48,111
    like their shrimp Creole.   

1027
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:50,046
      This Creole gives me      
     a good burst of flavor.    

1028
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:52,515
    -Who made up this recipe?   
 -This is my recipe. Here we go.

1029
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,650
              Celery sautéed in 
          a 1/4 pound of butter.

1030
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,252
 Why did you blanch             
  the bell pepper?              

1031
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,520
                So it'll cook   
              a little faster.  

1032
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,389
               Sautéed onion.   
     They've been blanched also.

1033
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:01,791
          Sauté your vegetables.
   Till they're nice and tender.

1034
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:03,660
              Creole seasoning. 
             Old bay seasoning. 

1035
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,729
               Old bay accents  
        the seafood really well.

1036
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:07,664
                 Bay leaves.    
             And minced garlic. 

1037
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,532
     Ah, you see how the flavors
             are coming together

1038
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,134
       and everything's starting
             to marry in there? 

1039
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,803
   Well, we've got one important
    step that we've got to make.

1040
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:16,273
   The smoked sausages. This has
   got to go in with the butter.

1041
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:17,741
 Bring that fat out             
  of that sausage.              

1042
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:20,010
  You want to render that down. 
      Flour is going down.      

1043
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:22,144
        Yep, gonna make the roux
             right inside there.

1044
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:24,147
                 Now, I need    
              the shrimp stock. 

1045
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:26,683
You know, I don't sous chef     
for many, all right?            

1046
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,618
Now, did you make this shrimp   
  stock yourself?               
                     Yes. I did.

1047
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,088
      About 200 pounds of shrimp
boils down to be about a gallon.

1048
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,957
                Tomato sauce.   

1049
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:36,626
       We're gonna let this cook
for about 45 minutes to an hour.

1050
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:38,160
    -We're all tightened up?    
      -We're looking great.     

1051
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:39,895
               I actually heat  
            the shrimp to order.

1052
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,965
If I preach one thing,          
  that'll be it --              

1053
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:44,301
       is that                  
 seafood overcooks.             

1054
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:47,570
People go and make this         
big vats of gumbos or stews,    

1055
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:48,971
   then they leave              
everything in there.            

1056
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,173
All it does is just...          
                       Mush.    

1057
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:52,041
Either it turns into mush       
or turns into beebees.          

1058
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,643
    That's the way to do it.    
    -That's the way to do it.   

1059
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:56,046
       It's served over a white,
       long-grain, basmati rice.

1060
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:57,113
                [ Whistling ]   

1061
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:59,983
                   This is      
        Southern Creole cooking,

1062
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:02,319
         with a little influence
              of basmati rice?  

1063
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:04,120
 It holds the sauces            
 and it really makes            

1064
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:06,523
for a nice presentation.        

1065
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:08,391
                    Mmm.        
             This is fantastic. 

1066
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,327
The shrimp is really            
  nice and tender.              

1067
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:12,128
            Everything is fresh.

1068
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,530
One of the best things          
about this is the basmati rice. 

1069
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:18,068
It's a nice flavorful rice.     
     It's light.                

1070
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:22,338
  Ah, that's great.             
That sausage is dynamite.       

1071
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,939
   We eat over in New Orleans   
          quite a bit.          

1072
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,141
      This is just as good.     

1073
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,810
    And the shrimp are really   
      fresh and very tasty.     

1074
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,679
   FIERI: And they're serving   
      them blackened, too.      

1075
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:32,148
          When you bite         
     into it, you just know     
  you're having something good. 

1076
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,685
  FIERI: Like Darwell's take on 
 a Louisiana favorite, etouffee,

1077
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:38,154
     that starts with their     
      own blackening spice.     

1078
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:40,089
        -We got paprika.        
 -Which is the predominant one. 

1079
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,891
    Three-to-one for everything.
         You got cayenne pepper.

1080
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,826
     That's the super spice.    
        -That's the heat?       

1081
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,562
              You got oregano.  
               You got thyme.   

1082
00:37:45,564 --> 00:37:46,896
                Black pepper.   
              Garlic powder --  

1083
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:49,733
         the holy favorite spice
         of all Southern people.

1084
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:51,634
         -Of all spices.        
  -That's right. Blend that up. 

1085
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,903
You can make your own           
  blackening spice.             

1086
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,438
              And you can also  
              adjust the spice  

1087
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,574
              to taste the way  
           you like it to taste.

1088
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:58,841
         And I've kept the spice

1089
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,510
      backed out of the etouffee
                a little bit.   

1090
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:02,846
    -Let the shrimp carry it.   
         -There you go.         

1091
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:04,381
  Mmm. Really nice.             

1092
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:06,049
   I don't believe              
the blackening has to be        

1093
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:08,385
    so spicy hot                
that you can't enjoy it.        

1094
00:38:08,387 --> 00:38:10,987
   -Blackened means flavorful.  
       -It's a great one.       

1095
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:13,123
                   Thank you.   
That's awesome.                 

1096
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,390
    All of his food is great.   

1097
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,526
        New Orleans style       
        cooking flavors,        

1098
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:18,128
  barbecue that's unbelievable. 

1099
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,662
        Last pan of ribs!       

1100
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,063
            What are you having,
           a little pulled pork?
Pulled pork.                    

1101
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,666
         It's real good.        
   -Just one of 18 sandwiches,  

1102
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:26,202
       from smoked sausage      
       to serious burgers.      

1103
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:27,804
        -It's super good.       
        -What do you get?       

1104
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:31,007
I get the prime-rib sandwich.   
       Mm-hmm.                  

1105
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:32,275
             -Prime?            
             -Prime.            

1106
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:33,676
            -Come on.           
        -Daddy taught me,       

1107
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,545
if you can't go top of the line,
  don't go at all.              

1108
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:36,946
   So, we're gonna              
completely drench the rib       

1109
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:38,081
 with the soy sauce.            

1110
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,883
Now we're gonna rub her down    
 with some good old             

1111
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:41,017
   minced garlic.               

1112
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:44,554
       We got                   
the Creole seasoning.           

1113
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:45,955
A little black pepper.          

1114
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,824
    -Pop the onions in there.   
   -It's gonna go in the oven.  

1115
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,293
     350 degrees                
for about 2 1/2 hours.          

1116
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:52,362
              So, look at that. 
      We're gonna let this rest,

1117
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:53,830
         and then we're gonna go
             ahead and slice it.

1118
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,364
'Cause you can't slice it hot.  
What is that over there?        

1119
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,566
     Is that an extra spoon?    
        -Ah, what is it?        

1120
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,435
 I want to just look            
at how thin that is.            

1121
00:38:58,437 --> 00:39:00,170
              So thin it's hard 
             to keep it together

1122
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:01,704
             after it comes off 
                 the slicer.    

1123
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,373
You don't need to do            
  anything to this.             

1124
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,908
        -But he's gonna.        
      -I'm gonna start off      

1125
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,110
     by letting it start getting
   the juices knocked out of it.

1126
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:08,577
              I got the onions  
             and mushrooms here.

1127
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,980
          We're gonna sauté them
    with a little bit of au jus.

1128
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:13,249
          Darwell's magic au jus
           that we got going on.

1129
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:14,918
              That baby's gonna 
         come out butter tender.

1130
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,720
You're killing me right now     
'cause I want it medium rare.   

1131
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:17,987
               Here it comes.   

1132
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,589
            Got a prime-rib home
       set up for me right here.

1133
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:21,124
             Got to get the dip 
                  in there.     

1134
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:23,125
              Mmm.              

1135
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:27,063
I'd like to have a birthday cake
              made out of that. 

1136
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:29,599
      Big 16-layer birthday cake
              made out of this. 

1137
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:31,601
          That is awesome, dude.

1138
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:33,402
              -Mmm.             
       -It's one of these       
          that you eat          

1139
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:34,737
         and everything         
      runs down your hands.     

1140
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,740
    It's just messy and good.   
     -The food is fantastic.    

1141
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:39,209
   Just a great Southern feel   
  with a little bit of a twist. 

1142
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,810
             FIERI:             
   Like this Southern classic.  

1143
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:42,678
MAN: This can be served any time
     of the day you want it.    

1144
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,348
       -Grits with tasso.       
     -Tasso is a spicy ham.     

1145
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:48,551
              Spicy smoked ham. 
   Start with hot boiling water.

1146
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,687
             Little salt added. 
              We got the grits. 

1147
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:52,354
             Dump them right in,
         give them a quick stir,

1148
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,691
     and we're gonna go to about
              a 20 to 30 minute 

1149
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:56,025
            simmer time on this.

1150
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:58,428
       Got it to the consistency
  that I like to serve my grits.

1151
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,762
           Some people like them
              a little thicker, 

1152
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,163
           some people like them
              a little thinner. 

1153
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,165
Well, I like them to have       
a little bit of run to them.    

1154
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,901
I don't necessarily want        
to stand my spoon up in it.     

1155
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,369
                     No.        
              It'll fall over.  

1156
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:08,370
     Over in this other skillet,
     that I've got preheating...

1157
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:09,772
             Some whole butter. 

1158
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,508
Well, the dairy business does   
good around your restaurant.    

1159
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,376
           We're gonna have this
       butter melting down here.

1160
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:15,511
               And now we need  
           that wonderful tasso.

1161
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:18,181
  You can't "passo"             
    on the tasso.               

1162
00:40:18,183 --> 00:40:19,516
                   And now      
              here's the thing. 

1163
00:40:19,518 --> 00:40:21,384
           There's no set amount
              we're using here. 

1164
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:24,187
      If you like a lot of tasso
     in your grits, sauté a lot.

1165
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:26,255
          We're gonna put a nice
       little 1/2 pound in here.

1166
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,723
                Get that nice   
               and sautéed in   

1167
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,525
            so we get the flavor
              out of the tasso. 

1168
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,260
                Fresh chopped   
                green onions.   

1169
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,729
              And nice, sharp,  
        shredded cheddar cheese.

1170
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,665
               Into the grits.  
          Give this a good stir.

1171
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,133
        We got the grits, we got
       the cheddar cheese going,

1172
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,469
                   we got       
         the nice sauté mixture,

1173
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:41,271
       and we're just gonna dump
            that right in there.

1174
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,606
   Now, you see how everything's
 starting to come together here?

1175
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,609
         Good stuff. Good stuff.
     I'm telling you, just wait.

1176
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:50,346
               Get ready, Guy.  
                 Get ready.     

1177
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:52,882
        Mmm.                    

1178
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:54,684
        Mmm!                    
  Wow, that's nice.             

1179
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:57,019
    A glass of sweet tea and you
       got it all together, man.

1180
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,755
     Not salty.                 
Little spicy out of the tasso.  

1181
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,024
That cheddar cheese?            
  Not overpowering.             

1182
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:03,560
The right consistency.          

1183
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:05,228
       I could                  
 put that pot away.             

1184
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,563
       Easily.                  

1185
00:41:06,565 --> 00:41:08,698
     It's got a real smooth     
        Southern flavor.        

1186
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,634
And the tasso is nice and spicy,
    which is a nice contrast    

1187
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,236
 to the creaminess of the grits.

1188
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:16,239
You go to Darwell's, you're     
gonna have a good meal.         
 Consistently good.
