        IF I KNEW THIS WAS HERE.
      IT'S GOT SOME SPICE       
             TO IT.             

174
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,325
IT TAKES A TEX-MEX BASIC        

175
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,861
     AND MAKES IT               
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.            
     <i> DIFFERENT? YOU THINK?</i>     

176
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,463

 YOU WANT TO BRING YOUR FRIENDS

          AND SO CRAZY.         

178
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:43,335
          MOROCCAN POTATO SALAD?
   KIND OF A SECRET GEM PLACE   
   THAT WE HAVE IN OUR CITY.    

179
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,869
          SHRIMP TACO?

                 COME TOGETHER. 

181
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,406
         WHEN YOU HAVE A PASSION
              FOR SOMETHING     

182
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:50,809
        AND YOU WORK HARD AT IT,
          IT KIND OF WORKS OUT. 

183
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,411
           THE ONLY THING THAT  
         I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS

184
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:54,813
                     IS THAT... 

185
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,347
                 IT'S ALL GONE. 

186

ANOTHER ONE.                    

187
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,951
                     ALL RIGHT. 
                     I'M HAPPY.

  DID YOU JUST SAY              
"NICE AND SIZZLE-Y"?            
               YEAH, I SURE DID.

193
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,702
        WHEN I WAS A KID        
     AND MY PARENTS TOLD ME     

194

195
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,706
      I WAS TOTALLY STOKED,     
       BUT AS I GOT OLDER,      

196
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,175
  I DON'T THINK I WAS TOO DOWN  
    WITH BOWLING ALLEY FOOD,    

197
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,177

199
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:31,849
      I WOULD NEVER EXPECT      
TO FIND THIS AT A BOWLING ALLEY.
BISON HASH.                     

200
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:35,187
      THEY EVEN LET YOU EAT     
    NEAR THEIR BOWLING LANES.   

201
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,389
    THIS PLACE IS MONEY. MMM.   

202
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:39,724
             BUT I DIDN'T EXPECT

     (woman) THE AHI TUNA.      

203
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,127
         IT'S AMAZING.          
YOU THINK IT WOULD BE           
CHILI DOGS OR FRIES.

00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,729

          IT'S KIND OF          
       ECLECTIC CUISINE.

        ABOUT THE HASH?         
IT'S MADE WITH BISON.           

211
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,813
      INITIALLY IT STARTED      
     WITH CORNED BEEF HASH,     

212
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,549
 BUT THEN WE DECIDED IT WOULD BE
        REALLY WAY COOLER       

213
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,018

 YOU DON'T GET                  
THAT EVERY DAY.                 
             FIRST STEP,        
     YOU GOT TO FRY YOUR POTATO,

215
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,956
              AND A LITTLE SALT 
            AND PEPPER ON THOSE.

216
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:15,026
   OKAY, SO HOW                 
ARE THOSE LOOKING?              
               THESE ARE LOOKING
                  ABOUT DONE.   

217
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,829
     RIGHT ON THE TOP THERE,    
 FRESH PARLEY, CHIVES AND THYME.

218
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,265
   OKAY, SO THE POTATOES        
ARE DONE. NOW WHAT HAPPENS?     
          LET'S START OUR SAUTé.

219
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:21,766
      A LITTLE PURIFIED BUTTER,

                AS QUICKLY.     

221
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:26,738
THAT'S A LOT OF BUTTER          
     TO CLARIFY.                
          A LITTLE FRESH GARLIC,

222
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,707

         GREEN AND RED PEPPERS. 

223
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,309
     AND OF COURSE, A LITTLE BIT
        MORE SALT AND PEPPER.   

224
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:34,379
           GET THAT SAUTéING.   
       NOW WE CAN ADD OUR BISON.
OKAY.                           

225
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,381
     THIS IS A TOP ROUND PRODUCT
         SHAVED REALLY THIN.    

226
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,317
  THE BISON IS COOKED           
TO ORDER FOR EACH HASH?         
                 THAT'S CORRECT.

227
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,387
CAN'T BEAT THAT.                
         AND I LIKE TO HAVE THIS
           BE A LITTLE MEDIUM,  

228
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,855
     ESPECIALLY 'CAUSE I'M GONNA
     THROW IT IN THE PAN AGAIN. 

229
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:47,325
   THAT'S BISON'S ABOUT READY   
 TO COME OFF AND GET CHOPPED UP.

230
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,794
       WE'LL THROW OUR BISON IN,
         MIX IT UP REAL GOOD.   

231
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,796
          JUST TAKE A NICE CHUNK
             FULL OF POTATOES.  

232
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,865
             WE LIKE TO CHOP 'EM
              UP A LITTLE BIT,  

233
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,334
       SO THAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT
           MORE LIKE A HASH.    
GOT IT.                         

234
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,336

237

                   OF THAT ONE. 

238

00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,880
  NICE FRESHNESS                
OUT OF THE PEPPERS.             

240
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,882
 I COULD JUST PUT               
A POUNDING ON THIS.             
                           COOL.

241
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,351
     THIS HASH IS AWESOME.      
IT'S NOT HEAVY.                 
IT'S NOT GREASY.                

242

             A LITTLE PHAD THAI.

289
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,525
      VEGETARIAN VERSION--THROW 
      IN YOUR BROWN SUGAR HERE. 

290
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:04,529
          TAMARIND PASTE,       
   AND THAT'S A HOT CHILI PASTE.

291
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,531
          A LITTLE RICE VINEGAR.
SEASONED OR UNSEASONED?         

292
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,999
                    UNSEASONED. 

293
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:10,468
       AND HERE WE HAVE A LITTLE
       SWEET RICE WINE VINEGAR, 

294
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,470

           WE HAVE HERE TAMARI. 

295
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,872
  A LITTLE BIT MORE             
EARTHY FLAVOR OF SOY.           

296
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,142
OKAY, YOU WHISK                 
THAT TOGETHER.                  
       YEP. WHOMP, WHOMP, WHOMP.

297
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,611
 AND HOW LONG ARE YOU           
GONNA LET THAT REDUCE?          

298
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,613
              USUALLY ABOUT 15, 
              MAYBE 18 MINUTES. 

299
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:23,081
DIG IT. SO HOT PAN.             

300
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,550
WHAT ARE THE VEGGIES THAT       
WE'RE GONNA ADD IN THERE?       

301
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,552
           FRESH MINCED GARLIC, 
            JULIENNE RED ONION, 

302
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,155
    JULIENNE CARROTS, AS WELL.  
   WE LIKE THAT CRUNCH IN THERE.

303
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:32,157
               AND A LITTLE BIT 
               OF PEPPER, SALT. 

304
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,159
                 LET THAT FRY UP
                  FOR A SECOND. 

305
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,627
              NICE AND SIZZLE-Y.
  DID YOU JUST SAY              
"NICE AND SIZZLE-Y"?            

306
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,163
              YEAH, I SURE DID. 

307
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,165
             YOU WANT TO ADD    
        SOME RICE-STICK NOODLES.

308
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,099
BLANCH THOSE TO AL DENTE?       
                            YEP.

309
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,101
          GIVE THEM KIND OF     
     A LITTLE CRUNCHY FRY THERE.

310
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,171
           ONCE THAT'S HAPPENED,
             A LITTLE OF THAT   

311
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,105
              LOVELY PHAD THAI  
             SAUCE WE JUST MADE.

312
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,107
                 LET THAT SIMMER
                  FOR A SECOND. 
NOODLES ARE CONTINUING          

313
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,109
        TO COOK                 
AND ABSORB A LITTLE BIT.        
                        EXACTLY.

314
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,579
     CAN IT GET SERVED          
WITH CHICKEN IF PEOPLE WANT?    
                     ABSOLUTELY.

315
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:56,581
                 CHICKEN,       
           PORK IF THEY WANT IT.

316
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,984
                     GOOD TO GO.
     OKAY, WITH ALL             
THE COLD GARNISH ON TOP.        

317
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,587
                 THAT'S RIGHT-- 
                CHOPPED PEANUTS.
MUNG BEAN SPROUTS.              

318
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,923
           CILANTRO AND A LITTLE
                FRESH LIME.     

319
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,126
DYNAMITE. GREAT FLAVOR.         

320
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,728
THIS IS BETTER THAN SOME THAT   
I'VE HAD IN THAI RESTAURANTS.   

321
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,730
        THE ONLY QUESTION       
  IS CAN I GET SOME CHOPSTICKS? 

322
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,600
                  OH, YEAH.     
             WE HAVE THOSE HERE.
YOU HAVE THE CHOPSTICKS         
  AT A BOWLING ALLEY?           

323
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,135
         AND WE GOT CHOPSTICKS. 

324
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,270
I'D ORDER IT MANY TIMES.        
                      FANTASTIC.

325
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,272
        VERY GOOD. MY FIRST TIME
            HAVING PHAD THAI.   

326
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,741
        (woman) IT'S GOT        
     A LOT OF FLAVOR TO IT.     
IT'S REALLY CRISPY.             

327
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,277
    YOU HAVE OFFICIAL CHOPSTICKS
           AND EVERYTHING.      
I'M FANCY, THOUGH.              

328
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,812
              I ROLL LIKE THAT. 

329
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,882
  THAT'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD 
 ONE TO USE AT A BOWLING ALLEY. 

330
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,617
             THAT'S HOW I ROLL. 

331
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:34,619
             I THINK            
  IT'S A NICE COMBINATION HERE. 

332
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:36,588
         BETWEEN GAMES,         
  YOU CAN EAT A LITTLE DINNER.  

333
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,623
              THEY JUST KNOW HOW
                TO DO IT RIGHT. 

334
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:41,092
    IT'S REALLY GOOD,           
AND IT'S FRESH. I LOVE IT.      
                     GOOD TIMES.

335
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,094
          HAVE A LITTLE DINNER, 
         AND GO THROW SOME PINS.

336
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,096
       IT'S NOT LIKE            
GOING OUT ALMOST, YOU KNOW?     

337
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,098
 IT'S WHERE YOU GO              
WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY.             

338
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,167
          IT'S DINERS, DRIVE-INS
            AND BOWLING ALLEYS.

  AN OLD HISTORIC NEIGHBORHOOD  

345
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:07,986
      IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA,      
       CALLED CABBAGETOWN,      

346
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09,988
      WHERE THEY'VE KEPT UP     
          THE BUILDINGS

      HERE SINCE THE '20s.      

348
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,659
     OUTSIDE, IT LOOKS LIKE     
  A NEIGHBORHOOD GROCERY STORE. 

349
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,661
     INSIDE, IT'S SOMETHING     
       TOTALLY DIFFERENT.       

350
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,063
ALL RIGHTY.

00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,333
    TRYING THE FROGMORE STEW.

354
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,938
           FANTASTIC.           
          I THOUGHT THE MEATBALL
            SLIDERS WERE GREAT. 

355
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,940

00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,737
            AND THEN WE'LL THROW
              THE POTATOES IN.  
SO IT'S A LITTLE BOIL.          

386
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,739
JUST GRAB A POTATER             
 AND LOOK AT 'EM?               
                           YEAH.

387
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,741

   NOW WHAT GOES?               
                       THE CORN.

388
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:40,678
                 THE SAUSAGE    
              IS ALREADY COOKED.
  BUT YOU WANT IT               
TO COOK A LITTLE BIT            

389
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,714
  TO BRING OUT                  
SOME OF THE FAT.                
          SO IT SEEPS THE FLAVOR
              INTO THE BROTH.   

390
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,684
 WAIT TILL THAT COMES TO A BOIL.
  THEN GO BACK WITH THE SHRIMP. 

391
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,753
AS SOON AS THEY GO IN, YOU STIR 
   IT AROUND. THEY'RE DONE.     
    YEAH, PRETTY MUCH DONE.     

392
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:52,690

  LOOK AT THAT MIXTURE.

GOOD FLAVOR. GREAT.             

490

     AND ANTICIPATE             

491
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,444
THAT THE MEATBALL SANDWICH      
WAS GONNA BE THAT ON POINT.

               MADE IN ATLANTA  

495
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,188
         BY A GIRL THAT HAD ONE 
              IN BROOKLYN.      

496
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,723
             MAKES SENSE? GOOD. 

497
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,192
      OKAY, GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN.
    WE'LL START                 
WITH THE MAYONNAISE             

498
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,194
AND JUST GET THAT               
 OUT OF THE WAY.                
                           OKAY.

499
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,797
TAKE THIS CHOPPED CILANTRO,     
A LITTLE BIT OF HOT SAUCE.      

500
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,199
        MARRY SOME OF THOSE--

YEAH.                           

501
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,668
               DIG IT. LET'S GO.
YOU CAN PUT YOUR SHALLOTS       
  AND YOUR LEMONGRASS.          

502
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,271
        AND YOU TAKE THAT FIRST 
       2 INCHES OFF THE BOTTOM, 

503
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,273
         PEEL OFF THE OUTER CORE
            AND YOU PURéE IT.   

504
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:05,809
         YOU'RE IN IT TO WIN IT.
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU HAVE TO       
PUT SOME OLIVE OIL IN HERE      

505
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,945
AND SALT AND A LITTLE           
 BIT OF FISH SAUCE.             

506
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,348
        I LIKE TO GO LIKE THIS. 

507
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,416
                   OH! THE EYE. 

508
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:13,818

YEP.                            

509
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:16,020
MIX IT IN WITH THE PORK.        

510
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:18,488
    MAKE THEM PRETTY SMALL      
SO THEY'LL FIT ON THE BAGUETTE. 

511
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,490
                 LOOKS LIKE     
            A LITTLE MEATBALL...
EXACTLY.                        

512
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,492
           BUT FLAT AND MADE OUT
              OF PORK ONLY...   
MM-HMM.                         

513
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,494
                   AND ASIAN    
              AND NOT ITALIAN...
YES.                            

514
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:26,496
             BUT JUST THE SAME, 
               BUT DIFFERENT.   

515
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,432
THESE ARE GONNA                 
GO ON THE GRILL?                
                            YES.

516
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,501
  NOW THE BREAD                 
GOES IN THE OVEN?               
                            YES.

517
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,104
    I'M GONNA PUT THE MAYONNAISE
        ON IT WITH THE BUTTER   

518
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:35,106
     BEFORE IT GOES IN THE OVEN.
REALLY?                         

519
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,507
                           YEAH.
BECAUSE?                        

520
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,509
         BECAUSE IT TASTES GOOD.
      A LITTLE                  
FRESH CRACKED PEPPER.           

521
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,112
 IT'S THE ONLY TYPE OF PEPPER   
TO USE, I THINK--FRESH CRACKED. 
                         I KNOW.

522
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:43,580
           I'M ADDICTED TO IT.  
         I PUT IT ON EVERYTHING.
LOOK AT THAT!                   

523
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,017
      OKAY, AND THEN            
WE'RE GONNA PUT THIS SALAD.     

524
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,185
   CARROTS, THROW IN            
JUST REGULAR RADISHES,          

525
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,521
              AND THEN A LITTLE 
              RICE WINE VINEGAR?
A LITTLE BIT OF SUGAR.          

526
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,324
LOOK AT THAT.                   

527
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,326
     (mumbles indistinctly)     

528
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,662
        WOW. I'M GETTING        
      ALL KINDS OF FLAVORS.     

529
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,664
PICKLED VEGGIES                 

530
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,732
   ARE, WITHOUT                 
A DOUBT, FANTASTIC.             

531
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,734
     THE PORK                   
IS NICE AND JUICY.              

532
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,004
   THAT CRAZY PUTTING THE MAYO  
 ON IN THE OVEN THING IS GREAT. 

533
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,406
AND LOOK AT THAT.               

534
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,408
LOOK AT THAT PORK THERE         
WITH ALL THOSE FLAVORS.         

535
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,942
YOU WOULD SO LOVE THAT.         

536
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,944
        THAT WAS THE END        
    OF THE BANH MI SANDWICH?    

537
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,480
THAT'S THE END OF IT.           
       YEAH. HOW WAS IT?        

538
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,482
             IT WAS GREAT. YEAH.
REALLY GOOD.                    

539
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,017
WE'LL BE BACK,                  
  DEFINITELY.                   

540
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,986
THERE'S CLEARLY A LOT OF THOUGHT
  INTO THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD. 

541
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,022
   YOU'RE GONNA GET SOMETHING   
      DIFFERENT EVERY TIME.     

542
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,424
   IT FITS THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.   

543
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,426
  IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE HUB 
       FOR THE COMMUNITY,       

544
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,027
        AND IT STILL IS.        

545
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,496
   IT'S A NICE JUXTAPOSITION.   
  IT'S GOT A LOT OF SURPRISES.  

546
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,031
WE EXPERIMENT WITH STUFF,       

547
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,434
 AND IF PEOPLE KEEP ORDERING IT,
     WE KEEP IT ON THE MENU.    

548
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,436
   SO YOU'RE SAYING THE AVERAGE 
       PERSON THAT COMES IN     

549
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,438
                  IS SOMEWHAT   
              YOU'RE GUINEA PIG?
(laughs)                        

550
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,839
                        (laughs)
(laughs)                        

551
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,841
   SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP.  

552
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,843
     I'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME     
          ON TRIPLE D--         

553
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:48,379
 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

554
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:52,116
OKAY, IT'S NOT WORKING.         
              (imitates blender)

555
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:56,253
WHAT HAPPENED?                  
                 (making noises)

556
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,755
               THAT'S ALL DONE.
