 I EMBARK ON A UNIQUE FOOD ITEM.

106
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,634

109
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:05,310

      WE ARE PREPARING OURSELVES

110
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:09,247
     TO ENJOY THE THYMUS GLAND. 

111

114
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,596
IT'S ABOUT AS TENDER AS ANYTHING
       THAT I'VE EVER HAD.      

115
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,865

                  GONNA TRY 'EM,

116
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,200
                THIS IS THE WAY 
               TO GET AFTER 'EM.

117
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:30,669
 WE SHOULD ALWAYS TRY SOMETHING 
       NEW AND DIFFERENT.       
        ORDER OF RABBIT.        

118
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,070
  IT'S JUST A GOOD EXPERIENCE.  
   I MEAN, I'M EATING RABBIT.   

119
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,606
 YOU KNOW, I MEAN, YOU DON'T GET
    THAT IN EVERY RESTAURANT.   

120
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:35,741
                    RABBIT STEW.
RABBIT STEW.                    

121
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,875
     YES. WE NEED TO GET OUR PAN
            NICE AND HOT.       

122
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,612
THESE ARE THE KIND OF PANS      
I LIKE--LITTLE BLACK IRON.      

123
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,680
      START OFF WITH ABOUT A CUP
             OF OLIVE OIL.      

124
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,550
 AND WE'RE GONNA SEAR OUR RABBIT
       RIGHT IN THAT OIL.       

125
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,819
NOW THIS IS DOMESTIC            
FARM-RAISED RABBIT.             
                        CORRECT.

126
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:51,623
SO IT'S NOT QUITE AS GAMEY      
     AS WILD RABBIT.            
                        CORRECT.

127
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,625
SO YOU PUT A LITTLE BROWN       
        ON THIS.                

128
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,894
                  WE'RE GONNA   
              FLIP THESE AROUND.
IT SMELLS GREAT.                

129
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,563
              I'M GONNA ADD     
         A LITTLE GARLIC SALT...

  BROWN IT                      
ON THIS SIDE,                   

131
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,835
DO TWO OR THREE BATCHES         
       OF THIS.                 

132
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,504
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?               
                IN THE SAME OIL,

133
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:06,972
         WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD   
       AND BROWN SOME SHALLOTS. 

134
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:09,640
'CAUSE THERE'S ALL THE FLAVOR   
 IN THE BOTTOM OF THAT PAN.     
                        CORRECT.

135

LITTLE BUTTON MUSHROOMS.        

136
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:13,578
                            YES.
  SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA PUT      
A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT ON THIS    

137
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,981
AND JUST LET THESE MUSHROOMS    
TAKE ON SOME OF THAT FLAVOR     

138
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,449
OF THE ONIONS AND GARLIC?       
                        CORRECT.

139
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:20,719
          WE'LL THROW OUR RABBIT
               INTO THE PAN.    
I LIKE HOW HE SAYS              
   "OUR RABBIT."                

140
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,722
    THEN WE'LL THROW OUR MIXTURE
             IN IT, TOO.        

141
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:26,458
IT SMELLS GREAT.                
                  WE START OFF  
                 WITH OUR FLOUR.

142
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,726
AGAIN, THAT'LL HELP             
 BUILD THAT ROUX.               
                        CORRECT.

00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,267
       THEN WE'LL ADD RED WINE, 
              BEEF BROTH        

146
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:36,935
              AND TOMATO SAUCE. 

147
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,404
 OKAY, WE'RE GONNA STIR THIS UP,
     COVER IT UP WITH FOIL.     

148
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,606
SEAL IT OFF NICE AND TIGHT,     
     IN THE OVEN, 350.

           350 FOR ABOUT 3 HOURS
                  OR SO.        

150
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,611
            IS THE WABBIT WEADY?
IT'S READY.                     

151
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,613
     WOW, DID YOU SEE THE ACTION
           ON THAT CAMERA?

00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,482
          LET'S SEE THAT AGAIN. 

153
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,617

155
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,888
       LOOK AT HOW DEEP AND RICH
       AND BROWN THAT SAUCE IS. 

156

        UH, NORMAL PORTION HERE?

157
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:01,092

          RIGHT OFF THE BONE.   

159

             ALL DAY.           

160
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:10,635
            ARE YOU KIDDING ME? 

161

         THE GRAVY'S FANTASTIC. 

164
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,778

       GETTING THIS AS A CAREER.

167

00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,598
    A LITTLE PORK               
WITH A LOT OF FLAVOR.           

394
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,334
        NICE RECIPE.            
THEN I WANT TO TRY THE PEAR.    

395
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,336
THE SWEETNESS                   
OF THAT HONEY                   

396
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,205
AND THE FRUIT FLAVOR            
    OF THE PEAR--               

397
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,674
  AND HERE COMES THE FUNKY ONE, 
            THE DATE.           

398
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,610
DARN, THOSE DATES               
 ARE DELICIOUS.                 

399
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:14,678
DID I JUST GIVE                 
 A TRIPLE "D"?                  

400
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:17,715
BEING WARMED UP, HAVING A LITTLE
    BIT OF A CRUNCHY EXTERIOR   

401
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,884
AND HAVING SOME SPICE TO IT,    
  IT WORKS INCREDIBLY WELL.     

402
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,686
 THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE SHOW      
DEFINITELY IS THAT CHORIZO.     

403
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,689
       ALL RIGHT,               
FRESH CHORIZO AND PEARS.        
                OH.             

404
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,691
HOW'S THE CHORIZO?              
                 IT'S VERY GOOD.

405
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,628
 WHAT I LIKE IS THE COMBINATION 
 OF THE SWEET AND THE SPICINESS.

406
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,162
                       ENJOY.   

407
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:34,565
       IT'S ALWAYS GOOD.        
        I LOVE THE FOOD.        
(man) THERE YOU GO.             

408
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,567
        IT'S GOT A UNIQUE       
     CULINARY POINT OF VIEW.    

409
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,903
      IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE     
         AN EXPLORATION.        

410
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:42,373
   <i> IT GOES FROM COCONUT-MANGO</i>  
       <i> CURRIED CHICKEN...</i>      

411
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,841
            SO GREAT.           

412
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,176

      <i> TO THIS REALLY OLD,</i>      
    <i> OLD-WORLD FAVORITE...</i>      
              THE ROMAN GNOCCHI.

 <i> NOT YOUR GRANDMA'S DUMPLING.</i>  
                            MMM.

415
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,717
 THIS IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST     
DOCUMENTED STYLE OF GNOCCHI.    

416
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,719
             LET'S GET IT GOING.
ALL RIGHT.                      

417
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,721
  EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL.       
WE SLICE OUR GARLIC FRESH.      

418
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,723
                  EVERY TIME    
             YOU MAKE THIS DISH?
MM-HMM.                         

419
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,259
ADD YOUR MILK.                  
             ACTUALLY YOUR MILK.

420
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,526
                 THE WHOLE MILK?
YEP.                            

421
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,796
                 IS THAT MY SALT
                  OR YOUR SALT? 
THAT'S MY SALT.                 

422
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,798
  SLOWLY STIR IN                
THE SEMOLINA FLOUR.             

423
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,799
             AND THIS IS SO WE  
           DON'T GET "CLUMPAGE."
YEAH.                           

424
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:11,269
   SO WHEN WE START             
GETTING TOWARD THE END,         

425
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,870
THEN WE JUST DUMP IT            
       ALL IN.                  

426
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,806
       MY EFFORTS AT MAKING THIS
           UN-LUMPO-LICIOUS,    

427
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,341
 AND HE JUST GOES AND JUST DUMPS
     EVERYBODY IN THE POOL.     

428
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,677
       WE ADD                   
 OUR MELTED BUTTER.             
                  I LIKE HOW    
           IT JUST BECAME "OUR."

429
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,679
                   I'M DOING    
               ALL THE STIRRING.

430
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:25,483
I COULD'VE HAD YOU DO SOMETHING 
  THAT REQUIRED DE-BLINGING.    

431
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,819
WE'RE GONNA ADD IN              
  OUR EGG YOLK...               
         NICE COLOR OUT OF THAT.

432
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,355
    A WHOLE LOT                 
OF PARMESAN CHEESE.             
                      ALL RIGHT.

433
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,688
THAT'S IT.                      
                    YOU TAKE IT.

434
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,424
YEP.                            
             PUT IT ON THE TRAY,
               FLATTEN IT OUT.  

435
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:34,625
YEP.                            
                    OH, MY GOSH.

436
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,894
              HE EATS IT        
     RIGHT OFF THE COOKIE SHEET.
MMM. GOSH.                      

437
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,762
SO WE'LL COOL IT DOWN.          
                            YEP.

438
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,832
           CUT SOME SQUARES OUT,
           STACK IT THREE HIGH. 

439
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,766
         WE JUST CUT IT IN HALF 
          INTO OUR RECTANGLES,  

440
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,503
  SEPARATE 'EM AND WRAP 'EM IN  
 WAX PAPER AND THEN SARAN WRAP. 

441
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,305
              AND IN THE FRIDGE 

442
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,839
                AND HOLD IT     
          UNTIL IT GETS ORDERED.

443
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,309
                THEN HOW WILL WE
                  HEAT IT UP?   
WE HAVE PANS HERE.              

444
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:52,576
AND YOU GET THREE               
   PER ORDER.                   

445
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,578
   IT GETS COVERED              
IN A MUSHROOM SAUCE,            

446
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,113
  A LITTLE SALT, LOTS OF        
BLACK PEPPER, FRESH THYME.      
                           OKAY.

447
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:58,582
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA ADD      
     OUR BEEF STOCK.            
           YOU MAKE IT YOURSELF?

448
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,651
WE DO. SAUCE IS REDUCING.       
       ADD BUTTER.              

449
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS          
     IS BROWNING.               
              OOH, LOOK AT THAT.

450
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,788
SO GNOCCHI'S DONE. WE GOTTA GET 
  'EM OFF HERE ONTO A PLATE.    

451
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,658
 AND THEN POUR THIS OVER THE TOP
      OF THE ROMAN GNOCCHI.     

452
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,794
     FINISH IT OFF WITH A LITTLE
         ASIAGO, PROVOLONE,     

453
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,529
           ROMANO AND PARMESAN. 

454
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,665
                   THERE YOU GO.
(whistles)                      

455
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:18,402

SUPER CREAMY. MMM.              

457
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,406
BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAY          
   YOU CRISP IT UP,             

458
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,408
IT REMINDS ME OF POLENTA.       

459
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,009
       THE GRAVY                
THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT         

460
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,945
 IS SIMPLE, YET, WOW,

AND HOW LONG ARE WE             
GONNA LET THIS CURE?            
                       TWO DAYS.

490
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,818
      TWO DAYS                  
UNDER REFRIGERATION,            

491
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,287
IT'S GONNA START TO PULL OUT    
   SOME OF THAT MOISTURE.       

492
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:44,822
         YOU HAVE TO BABYSIT IT 
               BOTH DAYS.       

493
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,824
YOU HAVE TO DRAIN ALL THE FLUIDS
           OUT OF IT.           

494
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,360
   AFTER DRAINING IT, YOU WOULD 
  RE-MASSAGE THE SUGAR AND SALT.
THEN WHAT HAPPENS?              

495
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:50,961
                   RINSE IT     
               UNDER COLD WATER.

496
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:54,565
             PAT IT SO THAT     
        IT'S REALLY, REALLY DRY.
      YOU CAN SEE HOW           
IT BECOMES A LOT MORE DENSE.    

497
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,834
   IT ALMOST BECOMES            
A LITTLE BIT DRIED OUT.         

498
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,370
AND NOW IS GONNA COME           
 THE SPICE MIXTURE.             

499
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,372
       SO WE START WITH SUGAR...
WOW.                            

500
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,906
           THIS REALLY DRAWS OUT
                THE BALANCE     

501
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:05,842
        BETWEEN SUGAR AND SALT--
           PAPRIKA, CAYENNE...  

502
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:08,579
      A LITTLE                  
GRANULATED GARLIC...            
                 ONION POWDER...

503
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,780
ALLSPICE...                     
                   AND ALLSPICE.

504
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:13,117
      YEAH.                     
CRAZY COMBINATION.              
                  GET IT ALL    
              MIXED UP TOGETHER.

505
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,453
 NOW HOW LONG IS THIS           
GONNA STAY ON THE PORK?         
                     THREE DAYS.

506
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,588
 SO THAT GOES BACK              
INTO A PLASTIC BAG.             

507
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,723
     IT HANGS OUT               
FOR ANOTHER THREE DAYS.         

508
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,527
NOW WE TAKE IT OUT.             
                 AT THIS POINT, 
               YOU JUST WIPE IT.

509
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,529
JUST BRUSH IT OFF               
  A LITTLE BIT                  

510
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,531
SO IT'S NOT CAKEY               
AND FALLING OFF.                
                        EXACTLY.

511
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,599
AND WE'RE GONNA FINALLY         
  COOK THIS THING...            
                            YEP.

512
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,000
FIVE DAYS LATER?                
                FIVE DAYS LATER.

513
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,402
OH, THAT'S GOOD.                
           SO NOW WE JUST TAKE  
         SOME THIN SLICES OF IT.

514
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:33,871
        MMM.                    
YOU'RE A GOOD SLICER.           

515
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,406
BUT YOU CAN'T SLICE             
 THAT WHOLE THING.              
                  A QUICK SAUTé.

516
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,075
         GOTTA HEAR THE SIZZLE. 

517
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,010
       OKAY, SO THIS IS JUST    
   A LITTLE CRISP ON BOTH SIDES?
YEP.                            

518
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,479
         SO ALMOST TREATING THIS
        A LITTLE BIT LIKE BACON.
YEP.                            

519
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,481
      THIS IS A TYPICAL SERVING?
YEAH.                           

520
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,749
                   IT'S JUST... 

521
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,751
LIKE NIAGARA MOUTH              
    RIGHT NOW.                  

522
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:50,221
     (Howard) WE'RE GONNA PUT IT
       ON SOME PEASANT BREAD.   

523
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,755
       PUT IT IN A PANINI PRESS.
SO GIVE IT A LITTLE CRUST       
     ON BOTH SIDES.             

524
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:54,625
    YEAH, MAKE IT NICE AND WARM.
           ADD OUR TASSO.       
  AND THAT'S                    
ALL SHE WROTE.                  

525
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:57,094
                THAT'S IT, MAN. 

526
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:58,362
MMM.                            

527
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,165
IT'S PORK MEETS JERKY           

528
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,499
MEETS SALAMI                    

529
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,835
MEETS SMOKED SALMON.            

530
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,904
 THERE'S ENOUGH FAT THAT IT     
DOESN'T DRY OUT IN YOUR MOUTH   

531
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:10,308
   WHEN YOU BITE INTO IT,       
A LITTLE BIT OF CRUNCH ON IT,   

532
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,709
NOT OVERLY SALTY.               

533
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,711
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY THE BREAD   
  GOES SO GREAT WITH THIS?      

534
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,646
NICE CRUST, REAL NICE           
 FRESH FLAVOR TO IT.            

535
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:19,583
  THIS RIGHT HERE               
IS SIMPLE, BASIC...             

536
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,851
PORK-LICIOUSNESS.               

537
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,920
EXCELLENT JOB, MAN.             
WAY TO KNOCK IT OUT.            
           THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

538
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,789
                          TASSO.
     CRISPY ON THE EDGES--      
         I ENJOYED IT.          

539
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:28,659
  THE WAY THEY COOK THEIR MEAT  
    DOWN, IT'S JUST PERFECT.    

540
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,329
        IT'S DELICIOUS.         
IT'S MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT     
     IN JACKSONVILLE.           

541
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:32,462
    GNOCCHI'S READY TO FLIP.    

542
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:33,998
     IT'S A LOT OF WORK,        
BUT AS SOON AS SOMEONE SAYS,    

543
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,000
"MAN, THAT WAS DELICIOUS,"      
    IT'S ALL WORTH IT.          
                 THAT'S WHAT    
             YOU'RE IN THIS FOR.

544
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,669
THAT'S WHAT I'M IN HERE FOR,    
           YEAH.                
             I DIG IT. I DIG IT.

545
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,605
    WOW, WAS THAT A ROAD TRIP   
    OR WHAT? BUT DON'T WORRY.   

546
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,540
   THERE'S PLENTY MORE PLACES   
  TO FIND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. 

547
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,542
     I'LL BE LOOKING FOR YOU    
            NEXT TIME           

548
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,611
               ON               
 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

549
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,613
THAT'S A VERY GOOD FLAVOR,      

550
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,283
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU MIX IT      
        WITH THE...             

551
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:58,956
              THAT WASN'T NICE.
