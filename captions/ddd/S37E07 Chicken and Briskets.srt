595
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,833

596
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,168

   The next recipe              
   we're gonna do               

601
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,709
   is the barbecue              
  brisket tostada.              

602
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,511
We'll start with salt,          
    white sugar,                

603
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:35,779
    black pepper,               
brown sugar paprika,            

604
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,583
chipotle chili powder,          
cayenne pepper, garlic powder.  

605
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:40,251
               What is that?    
 The black magic.               

606
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,386
They're burnt onions            
for the final flavor.           

607
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,789
          These guys get weirder
            as the time goes on.

608
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,958
     And it goes                
  right in the rub.             

609
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,794
You tasted it by itself.        

610
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,795
Taste the rub, though,          
with the black magic in it.     

611
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,730
                  I dig it.     

612
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,131
               So, we're gonna  
                dry-rub this.   

613
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,666
Roast it at 500°.               

614
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,134
             Now we're gonna go 
             into the braising. 

615
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,338
Onions Scotch bonnet,           
carrots -- oranges, as well.    

616
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,873
             You're in Florida. 
      You should make it happen.

617
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,073
              Big fat brisket.  

618
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,942

    right in.                   
                  Beautiful.    

619
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,277
Now we're just gonna add        
the beer and the water.         

620
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,412
        12 hours, and what temp?
     250.                       

621
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,681
All right, we are gonna make    
 the rodicue sauce.             

622
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,282
    A little bit                
of olive oil, onions,           

623
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,684
garlic, Scotch bonnets.         

624
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,419
             These guys love the
     Scotch bonnets around here.

625
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,688
  Black magic -- also known as  
          burnt onions.         

626
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,690
Salt, and then a little bit     
 of the brisket rub.            

627
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:20,624
      Tomatoes.                 

628
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,759
  After the brisket             
     is braised,                

629
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,093
 we save the liquid.            

630
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,962
   We're gonna add              
 the guajillo glaze.            

631
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:27,298
                Lot going on

632
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,100
          What's our last piece?
    The pickled                 
 jalapeño relish.               

633
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,434
             You get a point up 
                  on Robby.     

634
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:31,769
               It is jalapeño.  

635
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,971
   White vinegar,               
 the jalapeño seeds.            

636
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:35,439
    Onions...

00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,107
      ...carrots, and then      
         salt and sugar.        

638
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,509
     After that,                
 we finish with ice.            

639
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,577
          Make it happen, Cap'n.

  brisket shredded,             

641
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:42,713

rodicue sauce inside.

    and not enjoying my food.

                   FIERI:       
               It's delicious,  

664
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,894

      and it's in a gas station.

              find this place.

00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,252
Wait, wait, wait, it's a        
clothing-optional place?
