LOTS OF FRESH BLUEBERRIES.      

397
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:29,767
                SO ABOUT 50-50  
              ON THE BLUEBERRIES

398
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:32,370
             TO EVERYTHING ELSE.
YEAH, AND THEN,                 

399
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,838
SOME TABASCO SAUCE.             

400
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,906
WE LET IT COOK DOWN...          
              ABOUT A HALF-HOUR.

401
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,909
AND THEN WE BLEND IT            
SO IT'S REAL SMOOTH,            

402
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,445
          AND WE'RE READY TO GO.
SO THE BARBECUE SAUCE           
     IS DONE.                   

403
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,914
NOW WHAT ARE WE ON TO?          
              WE'RE ON TO MAKING
               THE BISON BURGER.

404
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,916
5 OUNCES OF BURGER.             
         THEY GO ON THE GRIDDLE,

405
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,986
GET SEASONED A LITTLE BIT.      
           NOW IS THIS AN 80-20?

406
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,386
THIS IS 85-15.                  
            85--I WAS GONNA SAY,

407
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,990
       IT'S BISON, IT'S A LITTLE
             BIT MORE LEAN.     
YEAH.                           

408
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,591
               I LIKE THIS THING
                THAT YOU DO HERE

409
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:54,859
      WHERE YOU FLATTEN THIS OUT
             A LITTLE BIT       

410
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,727
            AND YOU BUILD CRUST.
             I LOVE THE CRUNCH. 
YEAH.                           

411
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,796
WE'RE TRYIN' TO LITERALLY       
   SCRAPE THE BURGER--          

412
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,798
            LOOK AT THAT.       
     IT'S CALLED CRUSTIFICATION.

413
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,634
               IT KIND OF LOOKS 
              LIKE SAUSAGE LINKS

414
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,537
                 AND BURGER.    
             LOOK AT THOSE, HUH?

415

416
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,675
GOAT.                           
                   PRACTICALLY

THE BLUEBERRY BARBECUE SAUCE,   

418
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,613
AND IT GETS TOPPED              
 WITH SOME ONIONS               

419
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,349
MARINATED IN VINEGAR.           

420
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,051
WE TOP IT.                      

421

      LET ME JUST TAKE A MOMENT.

423
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,025
         THIS IS MONSTER FLAVOR.

424
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:29,493
   IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD,         
BUT THEN IT COMES TOGETHER,     

425
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,495
'CAUSE THE VINEGAR              
AND THE ONIONS...               
                 AND THE ONIONS.

    SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE.     

435
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,649
    WHEN YOU STARTED            
DESIGNING A BURGER MENU,        

436
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,518

    A RESPONSIBILITY

    OF BUTTER DOWN,             

460

      WANT TO GET THAT,         

461
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:45,769

            OF THE LEMON JUICE, 

500
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,055
      AND THEN WE'RE GONNA START
        WITH VIRGIN OLIVE OIL.  

501
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:12,590
      SO HOW OFTEN              
ARE YOU DOIN' THE, UH...        

502
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,726
         WELL, WE DO A BIG BATCH
          ONCE EVERY THREE DAYS.

503
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:19,263
BY HAND?                        
             YEAH, BUT WE'VE GOT
                A LOT OF GUYS.  

504
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,798
            NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD 
          THE WHITE TRUFFLE OIL,

505
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,469
     AND YOU'LL SMELL IT AS SOON
         AS IT HITS THE BOWL.   

506
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:27,338
LOOK GOOD?                      
            THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE.

507
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,473
A LITTLE SALT?                  
                            YEP.

508
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,408
                     ADD PEPPER.

509
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,545
SOME LEMON IN THAT.             
             YEAH, A LITTLE BIT.

510
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,214
    AIOLI'S DONE,               
TIME TO DO THE FRIES.           

511
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:39,483
GIMME THE RUNDOWN.              
        WE'RE GONNA START WITH  
     SOME IDAHO RUSSET POTATOES,

512
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,619
           AND WE'LL HAVE 'EM   
        WELL-AGED BY OUR VENDOR.

513
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,287
INTERESTING.                    
      WE'RE LOOKIN' FOR A POTATO

514
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,556
    THAT'S BEEN AGED, YOU KNOW, 
  THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AT LEAST.

515
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:48,025
    'CAUSE WE KNOW,             
WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THAT,        

516
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,894
WE END UP GETTING FRIES         
  THAT COOK TOO FAST,           

517
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:52,430
BROWN UP TOO FAST, 'CAUSE       
YOU'RE BURNIN' THE SUGARS,      

518
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,097
AND THE FRY'S NOT REALLY COOKED 
     AND IT DOESN'T WORK.       

519
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,701
      WE PUT 'EM IN A FRENCH-FRY
         CUTTER, 3/8-INCH CUT,  

520
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:58,235
               AND WE WASH 'EM, 
              THEN WE DRAIN 'EM.

521
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,905
      SO THREE DIFFERENT FRYERS.
WE'RE BLANCHING 'EM             
    IN BEEF FAT.                

522
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,840
       DOWN AT 250, AND HOW LONG
             WILL THEY GO?      

523
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:05,309
 THEY'LL GO ABOUT               
FOUR MINUTES OR SO.             
         THE FRIES ARE BLANCHED.

524
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,779
                LET 'EM HANG OUT
                  ON THE TRAY.  
AND THEN THEY'RE FINISHED       
      IN BEEF FAT,              

525
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,581
THREE MINUTES OR SO.            
               BUT YOU GOTTA BE 
              DELICATE WITH 'EM,

526
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,716
            BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE
                 THIS SOFT,     

527
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,251
       THEY CAN BREAK INTO A LOT
          OF LITTLE PIECES...   
RIGHT.                          

528
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,520
          AND NO SITTIN' THERE  
        STIRRIN' 'EM WITH TONGS.
RIGHT.                          

529
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,988
TAKE 'EM TILL THEY'RE NICE      
    AND GOLDEN BROWN,           

530
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,658
   AND THEN AS SOON             
AS THEY GO IN THE BOWL,         

531
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,527
WHILE THEY'RE STILL             
 A LITTLE BIT WET,              

532
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,528
        WE WANT TO SEASON 'EM UP
               WITH SALT,       

533
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,531
                         PEPPER,

534
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,601
                A LITTLE BIT    
           OF PARMESAN CHEESE...
I LIKE IT.                      

535
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,870
         A LITTLE BIT OF PARSLEY
                FOR COLOR,      

536
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:34,071
                  AND THEY GO ON
                  A LARGE PLATE,

537
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,407
       THEY GET THEN SERVED WITH
           THE TRUFFLE CREAM.   

538
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,345
MMM. CRUNCHY EXTERIOR,          

539
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,947
TENDER--SUCH A RICHNESS.        

540
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:45,616
    AND MORE IMPORTANTLY        
TO ME THAN ANYTHING, SKIN ON.   

541
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,418
SEE, I LIKE PEPPER              
ON MY FRIES, TOO.               

542
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,153
THE AIOLI--NICE.                

543
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,821
      IT MELTS                  
RIGHT INTO THE FRIES.           

544
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,357
I MEAN, REAL DEAL, MAN.         
      REAL DEAL.                

545

A GOURMET BURGER JOINT,         

546
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:57,027
YOU BETTER SERVE UP             
  A GOURMET FRY.                

547
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,495
               THAT'S IT, RIGHT?
EXCELLENT.                      

548
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,697
TRUFFLE FRY UP.                 

549
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,632

            TRUFFLE CREAM FRIES.

551
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,836
  THEY'RE CRISPY, BUT THEY'RE   
      SOFT IN THE MIDDLE.       

552
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,571
       REAL POTATO TASTE.       
   THE TRUFFLE IS DELICIOUS.    

553
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,173
  THE CREAM IS KIND OF SWEET,   

554
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,908
 AND WITH THE CHEESE ON TOP OF  
 THE FRIES, IT'S KIND OF TANGY. 

555
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,111
  IT'S JUST A VERY RICH TASTE.  
           (man) IT'S DELICIOUS.
