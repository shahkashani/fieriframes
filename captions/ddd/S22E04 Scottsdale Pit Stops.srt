     for a year.                

111
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:48,560
                  Perfecto.     
      Okay.                     

112
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,694
    Now, this is                
the really cool part.           

113
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,762
To tell if they're done --      

114
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,631
This is the femur of the horse, 
      correct?                  

115
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:53,765
 They shave it down.            

116
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,300
        Okay?                   
  Now, watch this.              

117
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:58,770
        Okay?                   

118
00:03:58,772 --> 00:03:59,904
      Perfect.                  
                   Beautiful.   

119
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,074
 It smells just like            
fresh-cut prosciutto.           

120
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:03,975
     I like it.                 

121
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:04,976
            Then we can start...

122
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,111
     All right.

124
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,716
        Then we start from here.
   There we go.                 

125
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:13,085
  So it's so thin,              
and it's got one side.          

126
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,054
  That's fantastic.             

127
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,656
     All right,                 
let's make the sandwich.        

128
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,726
         I'm putting mozzarella.

129
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,260
  Roasted peppers.              

130
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,795
         And we'll go like this.

131
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,831
      And then boom, boom, boom.
               Buon appetito!   

132
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,469
  Mmm! Very simple.             

133
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,604
    Great bread.                
  Incredible meat.              

134
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:37,142
You don't mess it up            
 with other things.             

135
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,277
You get the experience          
    that Italians               

136
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,146
   that slow down               
   at lunchtime,

to enjoy the food, relax.       

138
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,350
That's what this sandwich is.   

139
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,752
What it's supposed to be.       

140
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,086
   It's dynamite.

         the Sempronio.         

142
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,623
           Prosciutto           
     is almost like butter.     

143
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,024
  It just melts in your mouth.  

144
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,360
      I think the best part     
   is the homemade mozzarella.  

145
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,696
 No matter what comes out of the
     kitchen, it's amazing.

        makes the food so great?

154
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,781
     So simple,                 
 but so fulfilling.             

155
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:19,217
    It was like having a dish   
    at your grandma's house.

Bollito di carne.               

166

     How long is                
 the meat gonna go?             

185

220
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,144
   We're gonna go               
 to the finish line.            

221
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,879
                Finish line.    

222
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,082
                     Easy!      
      Hey, hey!                 

223
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,288
                [ Whistles ]    
        Wow.                    

224
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,555
        Nice.                   

225
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,558
    You can put the salsa verde,

226
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,094
      which is Italian parsley, 
     garlic, peppers, anchovies,

227
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,896
           pickles, boiled eggs.

228
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:48,133
          Go like this, and then
          a piece of the bread. 

229
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:56,241
     So simple.                 

230
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,844
      So basic.                 

231
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,446
 But so fulfilling.             

232
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:04,849
It feeds not just your stomach. 
 It feeds your soul.            

233
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,719
You just dip a little bit       
of that homemade bread          

234
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,721
    in the broth.               

235
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,189
You get a little bit            
    of the thyme,               

236
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,323
a little bit of the celery,     

237
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,959
  a little touch of             
   the peppercorn.              

238
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,530
    This market,                
 this piece of Italy            

239
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,365
  would be a reason             
    to move here.               

240
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:21,132
      Amazing.                  

241
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,601
              Bravo. Thank you. 

242
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:23,868
          I'll have the bollito.

243
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,002
     Thank you.                 

244
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,938
      It's full of flavor.      
    The meat is super tender.   

245
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,140
       The broth is light,      
  and the potato was delicious. 

246
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,208
         Authentic Italian food.

247
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,277
         You miss Italy         
    very much when I'm here.    

248
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,280
      Nice job.                 
   The real deal.               
                    Thank you.

             FIERI:             
     Coming up in Phoenix...    

250
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,418
       Pew!                     
         Oh, that's how it goes?

251
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,287
        ...a burger chef        
      pushing the limits...     

252
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,423
   It takes the regular everyday
       burger to another level. 

253
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,959
     ...turning his passion     
        into an art form.       

254
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,227
               You've seen it   
              a million times.  

255
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,228
    He's putting it all together
                 right here.    

256
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,201
          So, I'm here          
      in Phoenix, Arizona,      

257
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,536
    right by Paradise Valley,   

258
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,005
      to check out a joint      

259
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,806
     where this guy's doing     
  some crazy things to burgers. 

260
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:04,008
           Let's see.           
  He's putting eggs on burgers. 

261
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,344
 He's cooking burgers in booze. 

262
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,745
 He's even deep-frying burgers. 

263
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,948
             This is            
   Paradise Valley Burger Co.   

264
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,354
   MAN: If you love burgers,    
   this is the place to come,   

265
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,022
           not just in          
      the state of Arizona,     

266
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,958
          but all over.         

267
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,359
         The Beach House Burger.

268
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,628
              MAN:              
The creativity and craftsmanship

269
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,630
         that goes into         
     making their burgers --    

270
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,899
  I couldn't even duplicate it  
   if my life depended on it.   

271
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,303
             FIERI:             
 And they're all the brain child

272
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,504
 of chef and owner Bret Shapiro,

273
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,041
 who opened this joint in 2011. 

274
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,975
         A good burger should...
When you're like, Bla-ow!       

275
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,411
                 That's what    
             a good burger does?
It should speak to you.         

276
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,913
   And speaking of burgers...   

277
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,648
            Country-Fried Burger
                  for you.      

278
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,917
    The Country-Fried Burger    
 is another one of my favorites.

279
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,588
 Green chili, bacon, cream sauce
 on top of deep-fried patties --

280
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,389
   That's America right there.  

281
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,190
             What's gonna be in 
       the Country-Fried Burger?

282
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,260
We're gonna start off           
with the country-fried gravy.   

283
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,661
   We're gonna add              
   some olive oil,              

284
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,996
  diced red onion,              

285
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:00,265
  sliced jalapeños,             
   sliced garlic.               

286
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,333
      Generous                  
on the salt and pepper.         

287
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,602
Shake up the pan a little bit.  
Get them nice and tender.       

288
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,738
         Would you like a towel?
   Monster hands.               

289
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,473
   Been doing this              
since I was 15 years old.       
                 There you go.  

290
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:09,407
                    Okay,       
           so the gravy's going.

291
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,475
    Gonna hit it                
with our heavy cream now.       

292
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,077
             Now, this is gonna 
                simmer down.    

293
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,080
  Simmer down, now!             
              Simmer down, now. 

294
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:16,347
  Cook it for about             
   15, 20 minutes,              

295
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,682
  got to reduce it              
      by half.                  
                    Okay.       

296
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,483
Add our fresh thyme.            

297
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,552
    Now we hit it               
with the immersion blender.     

298
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,955
        And then that's gonna go
          on top of the burger. 

299
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:24,823
              How many patties  
               in the burger?   

300
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:25,890
Each burger's 4 ounces,         

301
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,692
  so it's gonna get             
two 2-ounce patties.            

302
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,228
Boom. That's my sweet spot      
    right there.                
               There you go.    

303
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,563
     Why did you decide to do it
             in this fashion -- 

304
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:33,698
             two-ounce patties? 

305
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,634
I wanted to maximize            
the char for each burger.       

306
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:36,768
                  Awesome.      
              Let's see you go. 

307
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,969
   Tan it. Tan it.              
       Tan it.                  

308
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,304
      What is the sun-tan lotion
         you're spraying on it? 

309
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,940
    A little bit                
   of heavy cream.              

310
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,708
                 Heavy cream    
            in a mystery bottle.
   Exactly.                     

311
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,910
Flour, flour, flour.            

312
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,845
  Patties going in.             

313
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,180
       Pew!                     
         Oh, that's how it goes?

314
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,583
That's how we roll, man.        
We got to get crazy back here.  

315
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:54,652
               You got issues,  
               and I like it.   

316
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,320
                 Next up...     
So I square up my buns          

317
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,789
  so they stick to              
    the flat top.               

318
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:58,923
           Wait, wait. Time out.

319
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:00,458
      You get the buns in round.
    Yes, sir.                   

320
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,660
                Then you cut    
            all the buns square.
   Exactly right.               

321
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,729
              You want to toast 
                the whole --    
 The whole caboodle.            

322
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,132
Start with a little             
bit of lettuce to               
protect the brioche.            

323
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:09,200
  I'm gonna add our             
country-fried burger patties.   

324
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,602
            Double the patty up.
                I like this.    

325
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:12,737
 Now we're gonna add            
     our gravy.                 

326
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,005
Little bit of fresh thyme.      

327
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,339
    You're into your thyme, huh?

328
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,541
  No thyme! [time]              

329
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:17,909

00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:07,572
       So, to wrap up this      
    Arizona "Triple D" tour,    

436
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,240
      I'm at a gas station,     
  and not just any gas station. 

437
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,109
   They also have a car wash,   

438
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,177
     a phenomenal gift shop,    
         and restaurant.        

439
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,378
  And not just any restaurant.  

440
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,581
     One that is serving up,    
        from what I hear,       

441
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,916
   competition-style barbecue.  

442
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,451
      This is Tom's Thumb.      

443
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,523
   Pulled pork sandwich is up.  

444
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,258
              MAN:              
  I've eaten barbecue all over. 

445
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,793
    This is by far and above    
            the best.           

446
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,060
     Here's your barbecue tacos.

447
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,396
    I call it a hidden jewel.   

448
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,998
   WOMAN: We've known there's   
  a gas station-car wash here,  

449
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,199
     but we had no idea that    

450
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,068
  there was this thing going on 
         in the inside.         

451
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,004
  FIERI: This fuel-and-food biz 
          was launched          

452
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:43,474
   by chef and former E.R. doc  
     Kipp Lasseter in 2012.     

453
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,409
              Who designed this 
                  with you?     
 My son-in-law.                 

454
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,945
He's been in the restaurant     
business his whole life.        

455
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,348
Then we started to talk.        
"Well, let's put up             
a barbecue place.               

456
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,283
   Then let's sell              
  high-octane gas."             

457
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,218
And then, of course,            
the women like all the gifts,   

458
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,285
   so we put that               
      in there.                 

459
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,420
       But hang on a sec.       
           Back it up.          

460
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,222
         Let's get back         
        to that barbecue.       

461
00:15:58,224 --> 00:15:59,623
   The brisket sandwich is up.  

462
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,893
Very mouth-watering, very juicy,
  has its own original spices.  

463
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,029
         What are we gonna make?
Well, we're gonna make          
   the rub first.               

464
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,431
                 For the...?    
    Brisket.                    

465
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,699
And we're gonna start           
  with brown sugar.             

466
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,435
             Oh, my goodness.   
Then we add paprika,            
    kosher salt.                

467
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,705
                  That much     
              red chili flake?  
    Absolutely.                 

468
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:14,839
        I've made a lot of rubs.

469
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:15,906
         That's more chili flake

470
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,442
             than I've ever seen
                go in a rub.    

471
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:20,311
Cumin powder, garlic,           

472
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,381
   cayenne pepper,              
  and black pepper.             

473
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,116
We mix it all together.         

474
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,085
                  You done      
          weeding out the lumps?
   Yeah, yeah, we are.          

475
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,655
     All right,                 
so, we got some brisket.        

476
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,057
    Trim the fat.               
          Let me jump in here.  

477
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:34,325
  Okay, you do it.              

478
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,327
If you cut your fingers,        
I can help you there.           

479
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,196
                 [ Laughs ]     

480
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,263
      Now we'll rub the brisket.

481
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,467
You actually get some           
of the juices of that           
meat in the rub.                

482
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,735
           Are we gonna let this
                sit for a bit   

483
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,137
           before we drop it in 
      or go right to the smoker?

484
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,506
   No, we wrap it               
and let it sit overnight.       

485
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,875
         How long does it smoke?

486
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:52,877
   About 12 hours.              

487
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:57,615
All right, so we're gonna       
slice this brisket up.          

488
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:00,284
We go across the grain.         

489
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:03,154
              Look at that fat. 
                 Just juicy.    

490
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,222
                    Mmm.        

491
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,425
    Texas toast,                
toasted on both sides.          

492
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:10,027
      Aioli...                  

493
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,764
  Then we put some              
good, old brisket on this.      

494
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,767
Then we put some pickles,       
    a few onions,               

495
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,769
 and we just simply             
  put this on top,              

496
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,839
     wrap it up,                
mash it down so it all fits.

498
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,444
       And that's all she wrote.
   Absolutely.                  

499
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,316
     What I think is interesting
                is the aioli.   

500
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:35,052
 A little bit of that creaminess
               coming through.  

501
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,254
          Pickle is a must-have.

502
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,857
         And what barbecue sauce
                  is this?      

503
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:42,827
That is Kansas City.            
                        Okay.   

504
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:48,132
             Great smoke on it. 
         That pull-apart tender.

505

          Love the Texas toast. 
         Just holds it together.

              Nice job, doctor.

    Yes, sir.

  The pickle and onion together 
     just really complement     

512

    the flavor of the brisket   
             itself.

544
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,744
Worcestershire sauce.           
        Wor-shire-shire-shire.  

545
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,013
    Black pepper.               

546
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,281
    Chili powder.               

547
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:11,949
      Sea salt.                 

548
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:13,083
       And last but not least...

549
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,552
   Cayenne pepper.              

550
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:17,087
            And that's gonna get
              dumped in on top. 
     Yes, sir.                  

551
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,958
           How long are we gonna
            let this cook down? 
  About 10 minutes.             

552
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,693
             And the last step? 

553
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,629
     We put this                
  in a hotel pan...             
                      Okay.     

554
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,164
and then we put it in the smoker
 for about an hour.             

555
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,033
                  You smoke     
            your barbecue sauce?
    Absolutely.                 

556
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,768
     Now, that's a winning trick
                right there.    

557
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,903
       And now we're going to...

558
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,305
Deep-fry some good pork.        

559
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:35,907
     Just pulled                
 out of the smoker.             

560
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:38,509
So we're gonna put some         
beautiful grits there,          

561
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,577
beautiful crispy pork.          

562
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,246
               Nice and moist.  

563
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:46,184
  Then we put some              
Kansas City barbecue sauce,     

564
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,318
cheddar, mozzarella,            
      menonita                  

565
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,188
and then we put this            
 in the Salamander.             

566
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,592
 Let that cheese get            
good, little melt on it.        
                     Okay.      

567
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:59,063
We add jalapeño bacon bits,     
chopped chives here.            

568
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,865
       This is at a gas station,
          ladies and gentlemen, 

569
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,767
         just in case anybody's 
       just tuning in right now.

570
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:07,538
      Good texture on the grits.

571
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,875
             Nice little crunch 
               from the pork.   

572
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:14,611
          Got a little southern 
        grit soufflé going here.
    Yes, sir.                   

573
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:15,746
     Love that jalapeño bacon --

574
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,281
         Just the little touches
                  like that     

575
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:18,382
        make it go over the top.

576
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:20,884
               Well done, man.  

577
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,953
      Pigs and Grits here.      

578
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,288
      I've had grits a lot,     

579
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,023
         but never grits        
      that taste like this.     

580
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,358
      WOMAN: And the cheese     
     and the jalapeño bacon.    

581
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,360
                    Mmm!        
            Amazing.            

582
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:30,627
   We got Tom's Brisket Stack.  

583
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,563
 As many restaurants            
as I've eaten in my life,       

584
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,898
  this is up there              
     at the top.                

585
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:36,634
       Come fill up and get gas.

586
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:37,901
             Brother, nice job. 
 All right, thank you.          

587
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,570
              Really nice job.  

588
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,106
          So, that's it         
       for this road trip,      

589
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,441
        but don't worry.        

590
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,710
    We got plenty more joints   
  to find all over the country! 

591
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:47,511
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

592
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:50,180
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

593
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,183
   My inclination               
is just to look at the camera   

594
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:54,118
and make the most bizarre face  
   I possibly can.              

595
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,553
                Okay, ready?    
              In 5, 4, 3, 2...  

596
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,323
