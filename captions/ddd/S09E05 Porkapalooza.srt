OF A LOCAL FISH.                
              HALF A LOCAL FISH.

484
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:41,285
      GONNA GO AHEAD AND REMOVE 
     THE SKIN AND THE PIN BONES.
OKAY.                           

485
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,021
        TRYING TO FIND THE BONES
            WITH YOUR FINGER.   
VERSUS YOUR TOE?                

486
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,224

              AND CUT PORTIONS. 
BIG PORTIONS THERE.             

487
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,826
           WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY
              TO LEAVE HUNGRY.  
    NOW WHAT ARE                
WE GONNA DO WITH THIS?          

488
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,828

            AND WE MAKE A SAUCE 

489
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,563
      WITH THE LIME AND GINGER, 

490
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,165
  BUT IT'S LIKE A LOT OF OTHER  
 LITTLE CITRUSY THINGS IN THERE.

491
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,633
CITRUSY THINGS.

SALT AND PEPPER.                

495
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,442
 BROWN IT, THEN FLIP IT         
AND THROW IT IN THE OVEN.       
                  WAIT A SECOND.

496
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,710
 YOU'RE GONNA PUT IT IN THE PAN,
     BROWN IT ON BOTH SIDES,    

497
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,712
             PUT IT IN THE OVEN?
YEAH.                           

498
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,648
            TAKE A LOOK, FOLKS. 

499
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,916
    NOW I'LL GO AHEAD           
AND SHOOT IT IN THE OVEN.       

500
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,918
          THE NICE THING ABOUT  
         COOKING IT IN THE OVEN 

501
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,121
          IS IT'S A NICE,       
  ROUND, EVEN HEAT TO FINISH IT.

502
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,657
         I DO MY PORK CHOPS     
   A LOT THAT WAY AND SO DO YOU.
JUST GONNA SET IT ASIDE         
       FOR LATER.               

503
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,459
   JUST START ADDING            
THE OTHER INGREDIENTS.

        JULIENNE GINGER--       

505
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,797
     WHAT I DO IS I SOAK IT     
IN RED WINE JUST TO PRESERVE IT.

506
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:30,400
ALL OUR VARIED CITRUS ZEST

513
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,882
    BROTHER, I WANT             
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING,          

514
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,617
YOU GOT THE SMALLEST KITCHEN,   

515
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,418
ONE OF THE SMALLEST             
  I'VE EVER SEEN,               

516
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,955
BUT YOU CAN SURE CRANK OUT      
       SOME FLAVOR.             
                YEAH, THANK YOU.

IT'S SUPER FAST.                
IT'S SUPER FRESH.               

518
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:54,692
AND IT'S SUPER FLAVORFUL.       

519
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,227
    THE CITRUS                  
ISN'T OVERBEARING.              

520
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:57,761
THE GINGER GIVES                
A GREAT PERFUME.                

521
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,564
   CREAM IS GENTLE AND LIGHT.   
THE YELLOWTAIL'S PERFECT FOR IT.

522
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,032
AND IT'S A MONSTER PORTION.     

523
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,901
 I WOULDN'T CHANGE              
A THING ABOUT THIS.             

524
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,370
NICE JOB. WAY TO HAMMER

                      THANK YOU.

525
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,372
OKAY, SO WHO'S GOT              
  THE YELLOWTAIL?               

526
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,608
    PICK IT UP. IT'S READY.     
      THE SAUCE IS UNBELIEVABLE.

527
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:14,444
IT IS DELICIOUS.                
  (man) AT THE END OF THE DAY,  
   THAT'S WHY YOU COME BACK.    

528
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,515
     THE FOOD IS FABULOUS.      
             WE HAVE A MEAT LOAF
                  FOR YOU.

SO YOU'LL BE BACK?              
           OH, YEAH.            

530
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,118
  IT'S NOT ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE 
       OF EATING THE FOOD.      

531
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:23,120
       IT'S THE EXPERIENCE      
        OF WHERE YOU ARE,       

532
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:25,122
         WHO YOU'RE WITH        
  AND WHAT YOU WALK AWAY FROM.  

533
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,591
AND YOU SEEM LIKE YOU WALK AWAY 
    FROM A GREAT EXPERIENCE.    
                     ABSOLUTELY.

534
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,593
       THE PRICING              
     IS IMPORTANT...            
YES, IT IS.                     

535
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,595
   BUT EVEN IF IT WERE MORE--   

536
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,065
            OH, NO,             
       I WAS GONNA SAY...       
EVEN IF WAS MORE EXPENSIVE?     

537
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,268
  DON'T WORRY.                  
I WON'T TELL HIM.               
    NO, I DID NOT SAY THAT.     

538
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,002
     I DID NOT SAY THAT.        

539
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,205
   SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP,  
        BUT DON'T WORRY,        

540
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:43,874
   THERE'S PLENTY MORE PLACES   
  TO FIND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. 

541
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,676
     I'LL BE LOOKING FOR YOU    
            NEXT TIME           

542
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:48,012
               ON               
 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

543
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,047
           WHO BROUGHT          
       RYDER'S CHAIR HERE?      

544
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,818
       WHAT IN THE WORLD?       

545
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:57,888
          (man) IT'S A NEW GAME.
           (laughter)
