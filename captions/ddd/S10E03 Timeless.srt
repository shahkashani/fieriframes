        ARE THESE GONNA RUN FOR?

254
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,838
15 TO 20 MINUTES.               
THEN MY POTATOES.

00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,375
   SMOKED SAUSAGES              
AND CORN ON THE COB.            
           THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE.

256
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:12,243
    THEN CLOSE THE LID ON IT.   
 TURN THE HEAT UP A LITTLE BIT. 

257
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,446

WHENEVER YOU READY.

              FAST ENOUGH.

WE'RE MAKING FRIED CHICKEN.     

354
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:06,077
START WITH THE MARINADE.        
       BUTTERMILK.              

355
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,545
I ADD HOT SAUCE,                
CRUSHED GARLIC,                 
         IT HASN'T BEEN CHOPPED.

356
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,547
         THIS IS JUST GONNA GIVE
         AN OVERTONE OF GARLIC, 

357
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:12,083
      BUT NOT AN OVERWHELMING-- 

358
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,818
               THIS ISN'T       
       GARLIC-HOT-SAUCE CHICKEN.
NO.                             

359
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,621
 I'VE GOT MY PIECES OF CHICKEN, 
  BUT IT'S MARINATED 24 HOURS.  

360
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:18,756
             GIVE IT TO ME.     
         THEN WHEN WE COME BACK,

361
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:21,492
               WHAT'S THE DREDGE
                   GONNA BE?    
FLOUR, GOOD AMOUNT              
     OF SALT,                   

362
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,828
            FRESH GROUND PEPPER.
SO I'LL COAT IT REALLY WELL.    

363
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,830

364
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,865
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA NECESSARILY
      KNOCK EVERYTHING OFF.     
MNH-MNH.                        

365

  LITTLE MINI HOT TUB           

368
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,840
FOR THE KIDS.                   
         I'M GONNA ADD CORN OIL.
         HALF A POUND OF BUTTER.

369
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,910
REALLY?                         
              THAT'S WHAT MAKES 
             THAT CRUST SO GOOD.

370
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:41,779
      IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF BREAD
          WITH BUTTER ON IT.    
 WE FEEL GOOD                   
ABOUT THE TEMP?                 

371
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,982
ONE OF THE NUMBER-ONE-          
    SELLING ITEMS?              

372
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,984
           WHEN WE RUN OUT,     
     THERE'S REALLY HELL TO PAY.
REALLY?                         

373
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:47,986
           YEAH. IT TAKES EIGHT 
              TO TEN MINUTES    

374
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:50,254
       FOR THAT CRUST TO GET    
  REALLY, REALLY GOOD AND BROWN.

375
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,256
         IT TAKES ANOTHER, LIKE,
           FIVE TO TEN MINUTES  

376
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,258
        ON THE OTHER SIDE,      
   AND THEN WE GO INTO THE OVEN 

377
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,793
         FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES. 

378
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:57,728
       WITH THE FRIED CHICKEN,  
    WE MAKE CHICKEN AND WAFFLES.
MM-HMM.                         

379
00:14:57,831 --> 00:14:59,864
                AND INSTEAD OF  
               JUST MAPLE SYRUP,

380
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:02,667
          I MAKE A CHICKEN GRAVY
               MAPLE SYRUP.     
CHICKEN GRAVY                   

381
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,803
AND MAPLE SYRUP?                
                 WE CALL IT     
            CHICKEN MAPLE SYRUP.

382
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,872
           SO WE START WITH     
     CHICKEN STOCK, BROWN SUGAR.
  CHICKEN STOCK                 
WITH BROWN SUGAR.               

383
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:11,141
THAT IS THE ODDEST THING        
   I THINK I'VE SEEN.           

384
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,277
 YOU GOTTA COME ON DOWN FOR OUR 
     CARMEL CANDY MEATBALLS

386
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,681

THIS IS YOUR ROUX.              

387
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,485
  AND THEN YOU'RE JUST          
GONNA SLOWLY DAB THAT IN.       
               NOW I'M GONNA ADD
                 THE SYRUP.     

388
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,687
OF COURSE.                      
       A LITTLE SALT AND PEPPER.

389
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,156
SO DO WE TRY IT?                
   THAT WORKS.                  

390
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,025
 NOW IT'S TIME                  
TO MAKE WAFFLES.                
                MAKE OUR WAFFLES
                  FROM SCRATCH. 

391
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,827
ALL RIGHT, SO NOW WE'VE         
GOT THE FRIED CHICKEN.

00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,112
           THE CHICKEN IS COOKED
           ALL THE WAY THROUGH. 

400
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,248

        THE AMOUNT OF HOT SAUCE 
       YOU PUT IN THAT OWNS IT. 

403
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:58,256
           WAFFLE'S LIKE A BIG, 
         CRUNCHY FLOUR TORTILLA.

WE'RE GONNA ROAST A TURKEY,     
      AND WE'LL START           

418
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,889
  WITH THE MIREPOIX IN          
THE PAN--ONIONS, CARROTS,

CELERY.                         
          A LITTLE FRESH THYME. 
         A LITTLE 15-POUND BIRD.

420
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:38,362
                    IN THE OVEN.
  AT ABOUT 350,                 
375 FOR TWO HOURS.

                  ENOUGH, OKAY? 

422
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:42,166
I USE THE BREAST                
 AND THE THIGH,                 

423
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,435
A LITTLE BIT OF SKIN            
REAL FINE IN THERE.             

424
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,437
         SO THIS IS HOW WE MAKE 

425
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,506
              THE FILLING       
       FOR THE TURKEY TURNOVERS.

426
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:50,040

AND SOME SHALLOTS.              

427
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:51,976
                 A LITTLE THYME.
                 LET THAT WILT. 

428
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:54,245
         WE ADD SOME WHITE WINE,
             CHICKEN STOCK.     
WHICH YOU MAKE YOURSELF.        

429
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,781
              I DON'T MAKE THIS.
                 HEAVY CREAM.   
 BUT YOU DO                     
MILK THE COW.

           AND SOME TURKEY MEAT.

431

SO THIS'LL COOK DOWN?           
          COOL IT. SALT. PEPPER.

432
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:05,590
               NOW IT'S GONNA BE
                 THE STUFFING.  
I HAVE A SQUARE                 
OF PUFF PASTRY.                 

433
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,458
               ADD THAT IN.     
           A SLICE OF THE BRIE. 

434
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,460
AND I HAVE EGG WASH.            
  THIS IS MY GLUE.              

435
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,596
AND THEN I'M GONNA JUST         
 FORK THE EDGES DOWN.           

436
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,798

WE JUST BRUSH THEM              
  WITH EGG WASH,                

437
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,467
SO THAT THEY HAVE A NICE,       
GOLDEN COLOR WHEN THEY--        
              POKE A LITTLE HOLE
               IN THERE, TOO,   

438
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:19,470
                 SO THEY DON'T  
                STEAM UP ON US? 
YEAH. THERE WE GO.              
       350.

                 THE GLAZE?     
THE SALTY ORANGE GLAZE.         

441
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,809
      IT'S NOT SOMETHING        
WE WOULD PUT ON LIKE A DESSERT. 

442
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:28,078

ORANGE JUICE,
