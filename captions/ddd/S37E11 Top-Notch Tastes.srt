          disappointed.         

992
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:17,473
    The flavors made us feel    
           disjointed.          

993
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,409
   Cream cheese banana-stuffed  
          French Toast,         

994
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:21,544
 cinnaroll pancakes at the most.

995
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,879
    This chef must have been    
         God's anointed.        

996
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:26,016
     The eggs are gigantic.     
      The bacon just right.     

997
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:28,351
  The home fries are such that  
      I dream of at night.      

998
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,153
        Can we talk about       
   those waffles and chicken,   

999
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:32,022
          spicy syrup,          
     and strawberry butter?     

1000
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,823
   My arteries happily thicken  

1001
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,558
           with a mug           
     of snickerdoodle coffee    

1002
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,226
      to follow each bite.      

1003
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,962
      If it weren't for you     
       and your show, Guy,      

1004
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:40,363
     would we have continued    
            to go by?           

1005
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,931
          Metro Diner's         
         everywhere now.        

1006
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,967
      As a Jacksonvillian,      
       it makes me proud.       

1007
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:46,569
       And it's because of      
   "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives"  

1008
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,438
            Nice. That was good.
Awww. Well done.                

1009
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,039
           That was really cool.
Well done.                      

1010
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,108
I didn't know what we were      
getting when she started.       

1011
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,909
       Indeed, we were not      
          disappointed.         

1012
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,645
       The flavors made us      
        feel disjointed.        

1013
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:56,780
   Excellent job.               

1014
00:36:57,516 --> 00:36:58,581
             DAVOLI:            
   Pancakes, banana, granola.   

1015
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,582
    This is phenomenal food.    

1016
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:00,917
   They cook everything fresh   
             daily.             

1017
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,319
 Stuffed portabello sandwich up.

1018
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:04,187
   On our first time here, we   
 looked at each other and said, 

1019
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:05,522
         "This should be        
         on Guy's show."        

1020
00:37:05,524 --> 00:37:08,124
     So you wrote in and told me
                to come here.   
I did.                          

1021
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:09,525
 I wrote in because             
 I bring people here            

1022
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,995
every time they come into town. 
The food is awesome.            

1023
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:12,862
 Anything you order.            

1024
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:13,997
   Pittsburgh steak salad up.   

1025
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:15,332
   It's absolutely              
      amazing.                  

1026
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:18,067
   Real good food. He actually  
     cooks everything fresh.    

1027
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,602
      Pastrami sandwich up.     
         Runner, please.        

1028
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:20,736
       It's just a really       
          great diner.          

1029
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,272
          There you go.         
         You guys enjoy.        

1030
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:23,539
  DAVOLI: When I walked in here 
         the first time,        

1031
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:24,941
           I just fell          
     in love with the place.    

1032
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:26,676
             FIERI:             
    Sous Chef Mark Davoli...    
             Two eggs and grits.

1033
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:28,210
            FIERI:              
      ...bought the joint       
                I need a runner,
                         please.

1034
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:30,547
  Then talked his dad, John...  
                           Okay,
             here we go, fellas.

1035
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:32,682
 ...A corporate restaurant vet, 
        into joining him.       

1036
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:34,216
How is it?                      
               He handles promo.

1037
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,219
      He's the ambassador?      
DAVOLI: Yep, yep.               

1038
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:37,953
You manage the kitchen?         
         I do the kitchen, yeah.

1039
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:38,822
             Metro Melt, medium.

1040
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:39,689
       It's home cooking.       

1041
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:40,756
               Meat loaf, up.   

1042
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,758
          The meat loaf         
      is unbelievable here.     

1043
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,760
Now, is meat loaf a staple      
    on the menu?                

1044
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:45,828
It's definitely a staple.       

1045
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,430
                    Okay,       
           so you get it going. 
Alright.                        

1046
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,165
We'll start with the carrots.   
We're gonna blend them.         

1047
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:51,167
         This will break it down
                 to the size    

1048
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,103
           that it can be cooked
            all the way through,

1049
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:55,971
            but not being a big,
              intrusive chunk.  

1050
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,108
 Yeah. Yeah.                    
                Intrusive chunk.

1051
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,776
                           Okay.
    [ Chuckles ]                
  Without a doubt.              

1052
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,511
                   That's a term
                  you use often.
[ Chuckles ] Yeah.              

1053
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:04,581
 You know what? Come on down for
    our meat loaf here at Metro.

1054
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:06,049
            No intrusive chunks.

1055
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:08,918
      Celery.                   
We're gonna blend them.         
                        Alright.

1056
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,055
                get those to the
                   optimum size.
Yep. The mushrooms.             

1057
00:38:12,057 --> 00:38:14,057
                 Mushrooms,     
             very gingerly done.

1058
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:15,991
     Just mushrooms, not ginger,
      but you know what I meant.

1059
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:19,395
          Now you do the onions.
Yeah. Yeah,                     
we're gonna blend them.         

1060
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:22,665
   Alright. So this is all ready
 to go with this nice veggie mix

1061
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:25,401
        and this brand new bowl.

1062
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,603
That's been here all 20 years,  
at least. I wouldn't --         

1063
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:28,604
                      Yes, it --
                    [ Chuckles ]
[ Laughs ]                      

1064
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,674
                 Yeah. Yep,     
         it's carbon dated A.D..

1065
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:34,544
   Alright. Now we got some, uh,
               the meat trio.   

1066
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:35,678
 Yeah. Ground beef.             

1067
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,812
                    Pork?       
Add pork.                       

1068
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,414
                        Have to.
Then ground turkey.             

1069
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,816
                 That's a way to
            get healthy with it.
Mmm-hmm.                        

1070
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,818
        Okay, so you incorporate
               all the meats?   
Yeah.                           

1071
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,153
                   Ready?       
                There you go.   
Beautiful.                      

1072
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,222
                 Oh, I like     
             the veggie content.
Uh-huh.                         

1073
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:48,158
        Okay, so what are we got
               for seasonings?  

1074
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,426
    Pepper, salt,               
 and Worcestershire.            

1075
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,162
     I was gonna say there's got
      to be some Worcestershire.

1076
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:54,030
     Anything else incorporated?
            What about a binder?

1077
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:55,097
 Yeah, a little bit             
       of egg.                  

1078
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,966
             Okay. Breadcrumbs? 
Yeah, breadcrumbs.              

1079
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:58,167
            I think I like this.
Yeah.                           

1080
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,769
        So you form up the logs.
 Yep.                           

1081
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:03,973
            Three out on a tray.
             Bake it off at 350?
Yep.                            

1082
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:05,708
                    For?        
40 minutes.                     

1083
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,111
                Bring it out.   
      Let it cool. Look at that.

1084
00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:10,513
              Like a speed bump 
               in Flavortown.   
[ Chuckles ]                    

1085
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,314
             So two big slices. 
           Over to the flat top.
Yep.                            

1086
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,049
    Put a little                
   margarine down.              

1087
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:15,451
  The meat loaf on.             

1088
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,787
About two, three minutes        
     each side.                 

1089
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:19,856
               This is the art  
             of crustification. 
Uh-huh.                         

1090
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:20,857
                And then what   
            do we serve it with?

1091
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,059
  Mashed potatoes,              
zucchini and squash,            

1092
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:24,527
    and a little                
  French baguette.              

1093
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,595
           Things you would just
              expect in a diner.
[ Chuckles ]                    

1094
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,698
           That's a big portion.
Yeah.                           

1095
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,067
            Mmmm. I think diners
              across the world

                on this one.    

1097
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:36,205
               Tender, juicy,   
        good exterior crust. Mm!

1098
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,675
    But it's the crustification,
    the adding that extra layer,

1099
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,644
          all that little crunch
                on the side.    

1100

      The meat loaf plate?      

1101
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,883
 It was really good. The spices 
      and the gravy on top.     

1102
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,219
      MAN: It's very savory     
         and very moist.        

1103
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:50,153
     It melts in your mouth.    

1104
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:51,554
     Fill your stomach meal.    

1105
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,422
       The breakfasts here      
     are just so wonderful.

             Yohola.            

1111
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,698
Stuffed French toast. We call it
       the Yohola on the Square.

1112

Why do you hold your hands      
      like this                 

1113
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:05,235
  when you tell me              
      about it?                 

1114
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:06,836
              It's about as big 
                as your head.   
Okay.                           

1115
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:09,171
    A little bit of a margarine.
              We take bananas,  

1116
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:11,107
          throw them in the pot,
       add a little brown sugar.

1117
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:13,576
 [ Chuckles ] Okay.             
                  A little stir.

1118
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,712
            Hit it with a little
                 Frangelico.    
Nice.                           

1119
00:40:15,714 --> 00:40:17,246
Yeah, you've activated          
    the bananas.                

1120
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,982
Then we're gonna take           
  our cream cheese.             

1121
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:21,517
we're gonna fold the banana     
mixture into the cream cheese.  

1122
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,719
  Okay, what's next             
   in this 'Hola?               

1123
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,922
    We're gonna make a blueberry
             strawberry compote.

1124
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:26,990
                Blueberries.    
Okay.                           

1125
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:27,857
            Little bit of water.

1126
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,125
     Now goes in                
  the brown sugar.              

1127
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:30,393
    So the slurry               
      goes in?                  
                            Yep.

1128
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:33,663
          Cold cornstarch slurry
        just to tighten that up.

1129
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:35,198
               Then I put the   
           strawberries in last.

1130
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,666
  If you put the strawberries in
       too early, they break up.

1131
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:38,934
 Strawberries go in.            
 Let that cook down,            

1132
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,603
kind of till it all breaks,     
thickens up.                    
                           Yeah.

1133
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,137
and that's gonna go on          
    top of the --               

1134
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:45,141
 Holy challah. Wow.             

1135
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:47,476
 You know, traditional challah's
      normally a little flatter,

1136
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,412
       but I had to get my baker
   to change it up a little bit.

1137
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:52,215
     It's like the dancing tooth
 from Saturday morning cartoons.

00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:54,750
We're gonna take our            
  bananas mixture.              
             This is ridiculous.

1139
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,553
Yeah.                           
                    What are you
         gonna do with that now?

1140
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:57,820
Now we're gonna dump it         
  in our egg wash,              

1141
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:01,691
which is egg, cinnamon,         
nutmeg, vanilla, sugar, cream.

1143
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:04,894
           Necessary, of course.

 to grill up all --

a blueberry strawberry compote.
