               CHIPOTLE KETCHUP.
GREAT.                          

99
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,640
           FIRST SOME OLIVE OIL.
           WE SAUTé THE ONIONS, 

100
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:03,642
                SALT AND PEPPER.
SO THE ONIONS HAVE SWEATED?     

101
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,777
     WE ADD APPLE CIDER VINEGAR,
            BROWN SUGAR,        

102
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,647
             CHIPOTLE PEPPER,   
          CHIPOTLE PEPPER SAUCE.
WHICH IS CALLED...              

103
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,715
$5 QUESTION.                    
                          ADOBO.

104
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,650
VERY NICE.                      
                TOMATO PASTE.   
            WOR-CHESTER-SHIRE...

105
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,852
                       WORCHES--
WHAT IS THE WORD?               

106
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:17,456
                I CAN COOK,     
           BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT.
JUST SAY, "WOR..."              

107
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:18,857
                        "WOR..."
"CHE-CHE-CHE-CHE."              

108
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,792
           WOR-CHE-CHE-CHE-CHE. 
           THEN WE MIX THIS UP. 

109
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:24,796
               AND THEN WE ADD  
            THE PURéED TOMATOES.
SO NO KETCHUP                   
GOES IN THIS.                   

110
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,998
THIS IS ALL YOU JUST            
 DOIN' IT YOUR WAY.             
                          RIGHT.

111
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,734
       WE LIKE TO DO IT OUR WAY.
              ALL RIGHT.        

112
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:31,002
    SO WE GET ALL THAT MIXED IN.
SMELLS GREAT. LET THIS          
SIT THERE AND SIMMER?           

113
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,737
    AN HOUR, AN HOUR AND A HALF.
       NOW THAT IT'S SIMMERED,  

114
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,806
      FRESH-SQUEEZED LIME JUICE.
A LITTLE BRIGHTNESS,            
   A LITTLE ACID.               

115
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,608
BREAK DOWN THE ONIONS,          
   WE'RE GOOD TO GO.            

116
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,077
I JUST WANT TO TASTE THAT       
    BY ITSELF. WHOA.

120
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,486
I MAKE IT ALL IN THE SAME PAN   
 THAT I'M GONNA COOK IT IN.     

121
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,022
SEVEN EGGS...                   
                 THAT'S A LOT   
              OF LIQUID CHICKEN.

122

     IN THERE IF YOU NEED ME TO.

127

THE BRICK'S MEAT LOAF SANDWICH. 

144
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:49,147
      WAS THE NAME "BRICK" JUST 
    BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THIS?
(laughs)                        

145

           REALLY NICE TEXTURE. 

147
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,754

   IN NICELY. MMM. THAT'S CRAZY.

148
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,556
        THE CHIPOTLE KETCHUP    
     CARRIES THE TORCH FOR THIS.

149
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,692
     BUT THE WHEAT BERRY BREAD  
   REALLY DOES GIVE NICE CRUNCH,

00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,928
      OR HIS GRANDMOTHER--      
      SHE WAS A GREAT COOK.     

192
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,531
 WE OPENED UP AND WENT FOR IT.  
   <i> MAKIN' GRANDMA'S CLASSICS</i>   
        <i> LIKE THIS ONE.</i>         

193
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,401
           THE SHRIMP AND GRITS.
WHEN I COME TO D.C.,            
    I NEED THAT.                

194
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,668
IT'S GRIT TIME.                 

195
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,937
 YOU THINK I GOT THIS BODY JUST 
     FROM EATIN' VEGETABLES     

196
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,473
   ALL THE TIME. I AM           
A GRIT-EATIN' FOOL. MMM.        

197
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,742
     SO WE GOT                  
THE WATER SIMMERING?            
          FIRST THING WE ADD    
       IS A LITTLE BIT OF CREAM.

198
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,810
I LIKE YOUR DEFINITION          
   OF "LITTLE BIT."             

199
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,948
SALT?                           
        SALT AND THE TINIEST BIT
                OF SUGAR.       

200
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,551
WOW.                            
    ADD SOME BUTTER. WE'RE GONNA
        ADD ALL THIS BUTTER.    

201
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,620
     THE FAT CAME               
RIGHT TO THE TOP THERE.         

202
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,756
     WHISK IN YOUR GRITS SO THAT
     THEY DON'T STICK TOGETHER. 

203
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,359
LET THESE SIMMER?               
               20 MINUTES OR SO.

204
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,428
THE GRITS ARE COOKIN'.          
   WHAT ARE WE INTO?            

205
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,163
SOME SHRIMP?                    
        GOTTA CLEAN YOUR SHRIMP.

206
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,832
  YOU DON'T BRING 'EM IN        
PRE-PEELED OR PRE-DEVEINED.     
                             NO.

207
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:24,635
YOU DO ALL THE EXTRA WORK.      
                   GOING TO DO  
                 THE EXTRA MILE,

208
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,637
     'CAUSE IT ALWAYS COMES OUT 
        A LITTLE BIT BETTER.    

209
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,707
             WE'RE GONNA MAKE   
           OUR CAJUN SEASONING--

210
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,776

                 CHILI POWDER,  

212
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,514
                GROUND GINGER...
I LIKE THAT CALL.               

213
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,583
     AND SOME RED PEPPER FLAKES 
           FOR SOME HEAT.       

214
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,918
       BLEND ALL THIS TOGETHER. 

215
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,921
   OKAY, AND THEN WE'LL ADD THIS
     GENEROUSLY TO THE SHRIMP.  

216
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,390
WHY NOT JUST TOSS IT            
    IN A BOWL?                  
     MY GRANDMA WOULD PROBABLY  
  BEAT ME IF I DID IT DIFFERENT.

217
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,527

YEP.                            

468
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,475
          IN ALL THEIR GOODNESS.
BLACK PEPPERCORNS, ONION,       

469
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,612
CARROT, CELERY...               
              A LITTLE MIREPOIX.

470
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,548
FRESH ROSEMARY,                 
 FRESH DILL...                  
               DILL AND A LITTLE
                     SAGE.      

471
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,217
AND SAGE.                       
                   SIMMER THIS  
                 FOR FIVE HOURS.

472
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:14,818
          HOW YOU GONNA KEEP    
       THE MURKINESS OF IT OUT? 

473
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,021
STRAIN IT ONCE THROUGH          
  A REGULAR CHINOIS.            
                       STRAINER.

474
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,822
 THEN I'LL RUN IT AGAIN THROUGH,
      LIKE, A COFFEE FILTER     

475
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,626
TO GET ALL OF THAT SEDIMENT     
        OUT OF IT.              
              SO THIS IS JUST   
           CLEAR LOBSTER BROTH. 

476
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,161
   MM-HMM. STRAIN IT            
INTO A SQUEEZE BOTTLE.          

477
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,565
       AND THEN WE'RE GONNA MAKE
          THE LOBSTER MARTINI.  
OH, WE'RE NOT GOING TO.         

478
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,700
 I AM GONNA HAND YOU OFF        
TO SARAH, MY BAR MANAGER.       

479
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,836
I'M A LITTLE WARY.              
                        (laughs)

480
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,438
      DO YOU WANT ME TO MAKE IT?
            ARE YOU READY?      
OH, GO FOR IT.                  

481
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,240
                          VODKA.
HEALTHY POUR.                   

482
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,575
                            YEP.
YEP.                            

483
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:38,642
               LOBSTER ESSENCE, 

484
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,644
         A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN 
          YOU WOULD DO VERMOUTH 

485
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,780
                   IN A MARTINI.
BUT IT'S NOT AS STRONG.         

486
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:44,648
           DOESN'T HAVE A TASTE 
              LIKE VERMOUTH.    

487
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,717
         THEN YOU JUST SHAKE IT.
   DOES ANYBODY FEEL            
LIKE I'M GONNA BE HAVING        

488
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:50,387
A COLD LOBSTER BISQUE           
      COCKTAIL?                 

489
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,456
CHILLED MARTINI GLASS.          
                      STRAIN IT.

490
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,591
                  LOBSTER CLAW, 
                THE LEMON TWIST.

491
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:55,593
      THERE'S YOUR LOBSTERTINI. 

492
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,261
LET ME PREPARE MYSELF.          

493
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,731
IS THERE A WAY TO DO THIS       
     IN PARTICULAR?             
             SOME PEOPLE PUT    
       THE LOBSTER IN THE GLASS.

494
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:03,667
      SOME PEOPLE JUST EAT      
 THE LOBSTER AND THEY FINISH IT 

495
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,535
    WITH A SIP OF THE MARTINI...
MM-HMM.                         

496
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:09,740
                 WHICH IS WHAT I
                  PREFER TO DO. 
WHEN IN ROME...                 

497
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,675
MMM, GREAT LOBSTER FLAVOR.      

498
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,744
     THIS IS ALMOST LIKE        
THE GHOST OF LOBSTER MARTINI.   
                           YEAH.

499
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,812
WHERE YOU DON'T GET THE LOBSTER,
    YOU JUST GET THE FLAVOR.    

500
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,749
YOU JUST GET THE HINT           
OF IT, SO I UNDERSTAND          

501
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,083
WHY YOU SERVE THE--             
 THE CLAW WITH IT.              

502
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:22,753
 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK THAT
PEOPLE THAT REALLY LIKE MARTINIS

503
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,355
AND LIKE 'EM DIRTY,             
  THAT'S GOT IT.                

504
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,491
IT'S ABSOLUTELY                 
LOBSTER MARTINI.                
       IT'S FRESH AND GOT       
  SOME LEMON IN IT. IT'S GOOD.  

505
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:29,760
  I'D DEFINITELY HAVE IT AGAIN. 
 YOU NEVER SEE IT ANYWHERE ELSE.

506
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,695
                          ENJOY.
JUST LOVE IT HERE.              

507
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,631
               IT'S A COOL PLACE
                  TO COME TO.   

508
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,566
                   THE LOBSTER  
                 MAC AND CHEESE.
AND THE FOOD IS FABULOUS.       

509
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,568
     SO THAT'S IT               
FROM THE LOBSTER SHANTY         

510
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,236
IN SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS.        

511
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,372
 A LOBSTER COCKTAIL.            
I'VE ALWAYS TOLD YOU,           

512
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,240
IF IT'S FUNKY,                  
WE'LL FIND IT.                  

513
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,510
      SEE YOU NEXT TIME ON      
 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

514
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,081
   (banging pans rhythmically)
