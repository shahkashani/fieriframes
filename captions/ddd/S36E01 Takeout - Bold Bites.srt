1
00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:03,135
    So, when I come off the road
          from doing "Triple-D,"

2
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:04,870
    the first thing I want to do
       is get home to my kitchen

3
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:06,805
              and cook my food  
               for my family.   

4
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:09,541
        And after a few weeks...
  Dad, can we just,             

5
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:12,077
I mean, please, go to           
a restaurant at least one time? 

6
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:14,880
        ...they start to revolt.
      So I came up with an idea.

7
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:17,416
          How about we reach out
   to some of our favorite chefs

8
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,551
                and have them   
            send<i> us</i> dinner? Huh?

9

     some "Triple-D" joints     

11

         that would love        
        to send it to us.

               She's more O.G.  

448
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,034
    than probably anybody you'll
        ever meet on "Triple-D."

449
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:11,903
                We've been to   
           over 1,300 locations.

450
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:14,571
             And my friend Wendy
       at the Russian River Pub,

451
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,240
          she was the sixth one.

452
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,509
      We were shooting the pilot
for "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

453
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,644
   I said, "Listen, we got to go
           to one of my places."

454
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,713
              And we go to our  
             favorite wing spot,

455
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,581
               which was like   
               25 minutes away  

456
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,584
              at a little town  
             called Forestville.

457
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:29,186
                     ♪♪         

458
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,922
               Ain't no thing   
             but a chicken wing.

459
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,724
  I want everything             
that comes out of my kitchen -- 

460
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:33,924
I want to be proud of it.       

461
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,194
This is eyeball recipe?         
             No, we got it down.

462
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:37,662
                Everybody has   
               a good eyeball.  

463
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,264
           Some people have two.
        Two.                    

464
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:41,932
    And Brenda's still with you,
                  correct?      

465
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,267
          She is, yeah.         

466
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,070
   You have got a lot of flavors
      going on in a little spot.

467
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,671
        I think I could put this
               on a flip-flop,  

468
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,675
            it would taste good.

469
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,009
               She's the best.  
             Tell her I said hi.

470
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,278
             I will.            

471
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:59,150
        So, Wendy delivered this
       in her really cool truck.

472
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,284
        Nice.                   

473
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,086
    Supporting local artists.   

474
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:03,421
    I know you love to skate.   

475
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:06,357
  Is that really a local artist?
      A local artist, yes.      

476
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,292
           That is awesome. Wen.
                 Thank you.     

477
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,695
        -You're awesome.        
        -You're the best.       

478
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,163
              Give me a rundown 
           of what we're making.

479
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,966
        We're going to do       
    wings in barbecue sauce,    

480
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:17,568
           as well as           
    the homemade blue cheese.   

481
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,370
             Are the wings raw, 
               or are they --   

482
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,371
       They're par-cooked,      

483
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,373
     so they'll need to cook    
        about 12 minutes.       

484
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,509
                  Alright.      
  While Hunter starts the wings,

485
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,910
               walk me through  
              the blue cheese.  

486
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,380
        In a mixing bowl,       
        put in the mayo.        

487
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,049
 Hunter's making noise over here
      with his friend the fryer.

488
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,718
       Then the seasoning.      
    Onion, pepper, salt, garlic.

489
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,722
And a little bit of lemon juice,
      maybe 2 tablespoons.      

490
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,924
                 Fantastic.     

491
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:42,326
    And then the blue cheese    
    crumbles marked "first."    

492
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,795
                    Okay.       
  You're just going to go ahead 

493
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,397
      and use a wand mixer.     

494
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,199
     Like, an immersion blender?
              Yes.              

495
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,967
               You're getting   
          the old-fashioned one.

496
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,201
       Okay. When in Rome.      

497
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,603
                When in Rome.   
                  Exactly.      

498
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,038
       So, just breaking it down

499
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,075
       so we get the blue cheese
 broken down into smaller pieces

500
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,744
          so it works its flavor
   into the mayonnaise, correct?

501
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:00,945
            Correct.            
                    Okay.       

502
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,747
      Fold in the remaining     
      blue cheese crumbles.     

503
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,283
                 Got it now.    

504
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:08,685
    This blue cheese is intended
        to be the chunky factor.

505
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,422
       Your flavor burst.       
                Flavor burst.   

506
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,757
               That's actually  
                a real word.    

507
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,358
       Is it?                   
                    Yeah.       

508
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,359
            What's up next, Wen?

509
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:16,894
  The homemade barbecue sauce.  

510
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,629
                Okay, great.    
   Typically, I would put that  

511
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,498
     in kind of a little bit    
         of a bigger pot        

512
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,899
      as opposed to a pan.      

513
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:24,168
          Now I got to take down
                 my display.    

514
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,304
          There we go.          

515
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:27,438
               Okay. First up?  

516
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,640
   You can do the beer first.   
           That works.          

517
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,175
                Apple cider.    

518
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:32,777
      Put in the molasses.      

519
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,779
     Chopped yellow onions.     
              Onion right here. 

520
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,047
      Fresh minced garlic.      

521
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,648
                  No flavor     
              in this one, Wen. 

522
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,250
    And then Worcestershire.    

523
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:41,518
          1 tablespoon          
   of the salt and pepper mix.  

524
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,922
             The sriracha sauce,
        the Dijon, liquid smoke.

525
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,592
       And the creamy hot       
          horseradish.          

526
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:51,195
   Reduce this down, and then   
   you add in the brown sugar   

527
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:52,797
        and the ketchup.        
            And then,           

528
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,599
    how are your wings doing?   
     Are those ready for --     

529
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,000
              Wings are great.  
             They're coming out.

530
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,868
          Okay, great.          
    Then you just want to let   

531
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,004
          a little bit          
      of the oil come off.      

532
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:04,275
   So let's drop a couple of the
  wings into the barbecue sauce.

533
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:05,876
  Dirty'd be losing             
 his mind right now.            

534
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:10,347
  Yeah. Our buddy Paul Thompson,
  who's a big Russian River fan,

535
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,950
        would be out of his mind
                 right now.     

536
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,685
    We should actually call him,
                 tease him.     

537
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:15,953
    Here you go.                
                   Right.       

538
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:19,223
 We have Russian River Pub wings
             that Wendy sent us.

539
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:22,226
  We just wanted to let you know
    that you're not having them.

540
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,361
         Paul:<i> Aw, man.</i>         

541
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:25,563
             Oh, those are good.
    He's so sad!                

542
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,030
                 Here, go in    
             for the bite, Paul.

543
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,032
          [ Laughter ]          

544
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,768
              Alright, brother. 
             We'll see you soon.

545
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,637
       That was worth everything
              of my whole day.  

546
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:35,306
   That was great.              

547
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,775
           I'm telling you what,
              the blue cheese   

548
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,243
                 tastes like    
              real blue cheese. 

549
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:40,711
               It's the method  
             in which you do it.

550
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,580
        You mix that blue cheese
                into the mayo   

551
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,848
             and then you throw 
  those crumbles in the last bit

552
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,317
         so you don't lose them.
  The wings are straightforward.

553
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,253
             I like that you put
       a little pre-cook on them

554
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,588
    so they get nice and crispy.

555
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,390
            That barbecue sauce,
     you get that beer in there?

556
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,658
 Ah, it's the best.             

557
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,727
        Let's be serious, folks.
    I got to tell you something.

558
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,930
       You're all great friends,
and you've done a fantastic job.

559
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:01,332
      And now you are the O.G.s.
         So thank you very much.

560
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,667
      You've been awesome today.

561
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,201
             -Yeah!             
       -Thank you so much.      

562
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,671
          And to not say goodbye
       without making the award,

563
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,608
               I got to confer  
            with my two co-hosts

564
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,877
     on who's getting Best Dish.

565
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,079
John, I think you got this      
maybe. I don't know.            

566
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,881
        Your blue cheese        
      would be really good      

567
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,683
 on the meatloaf sandwich, too. 

568
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,150
        -Yeah, it would.        
           -Oh, okay!           

569
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,086
A collaborative effort.         
     I like it.                 

570
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,756
           Ladies and gentlemen,
             drum roll, please. 

571
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:31,495
  Best Dish, no cash, no prizes,
                 goes to...     

572
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:34,098
              our brother John  
             at North End Caffe!

573
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,833
        -Congratulations.       
              -Yay!             

574
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,702
                 You get all    
     the bragging rights, buddy.

575
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,637
       Everything was delicious.
               Love you guys.   

576
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:40,771
       -See you next week.      
           -Thank you.          

577
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:41,972
      -"Triple-D Takeout."      
           -Love you.           

578
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,708
                   Adiós.       

579
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,044
     [ Laughs ]                 
                That's not --   

580
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:50,781
              Okay, that's it.  
                   I quit.      

581
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:53,116
I have never seen --            
                  Oh, God!      

582
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,786
 JOHN: Yeah, a little Manhattan 
 Beach Mardi Gras for you, boy. 

583
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,788
             No, that wasn't no 
             Mardi Gras nothing.

584
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,657
         That's evil clown stuff
                right there.
