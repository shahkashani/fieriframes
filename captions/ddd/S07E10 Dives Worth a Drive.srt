185
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,992

374
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,521
    DO A LITTLE FLIP HERE. NOW  
   I'M GONNA GET A LITTLE CAJUN.

375
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:26,257
 NOW WHAT'S IN                  
THE CAJUN SPICE?                
               CAYENNE, PAPRIKA,
                  BLACK PEPPER  

376
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:27,458
                     AND GARLIC.
GOT IT.                         

377
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:28,993
         PUT THE ONIONS ON TOP. 

378
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,461
              NOW THE ROQUEFORT 
            CRUMBLY BLUE CHEESE.

379
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,797
                AT GROVER'S     
           WE OVERDO EVERYTHING.

380
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,533
    PUT THAT ON TOP FOR A LITTLE
        QUICK STEAM UP HERE.    
I LIKE IT.                      

381
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,670
      AND IN ONE MINUTE, YOU'RE 
    GONNA BE EATING THE BRUISER.

382
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:41,539
YOU WANT ME TO PUT              
   A NAPKIN ON?                 
     YOU HAVE, LIKE, A BED SHEET
          OR SOMETHIN' HERE     

383
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,141
               THAT'S AVAILABLE.
(laughs)                        

384
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:47,145
 WOW, THAT'S A BIG BURGER. THIS 
  IS THE BEST PART ABOUT THIS.  

385
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,013
   FLATTOPS HAVE A VERY DISTINCT
         STYLE ABOUT THEM,      

386
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,015
         ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GOT
          A GOOD AMOUNT OF FAT. 

387
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,151
                IT CREATES      
           THIS CRUNCHY TEXTURE.

388
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,420
       I LIKE ROQUEFORT CHEESE. 
            I LIKE ONIONS,      

389
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:57,755
         BUT THERE'S NO WAY     
   I COULD EAT THAT WHOLE THING.
    THE PEOPLE                  
THAT ARE THIS BIG--             

390
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,358
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE            
 THAT CAN EAT TWO.              
          ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE.

391
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,426
 IS THAT ENOUGH BURGER? I MEAN, 
    YOU GUYS ARE FROM TEXAS.    

392
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,895
WAY TOO MUCH FOR ME,            
BUT IT IS EXCELLENT.

    AN AMAZING BURGER PLACE.    

398

405
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,459
 CHEESE BROTH WITH LARGE CHUNKS 
   OF BURGER IN IT. EXCELLENT.  

406
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,528
     I GOT A BOWL               
OF CHEESEBURGER SOUP.           
 NOT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT THE  
BUN AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF, 

407
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,063
      IT'S JUST FANTASTIC.      

408
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,531
     TASTES LIKE A CHEESEBURGER 
             IN A BOWL.         

409
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,467
OKAY, NOW I'VE NEVER HEARD      
         OF THAT.               
                           YEAH.

410
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:45,003
     FIRST THING WE DO IS PUT IN
        THE WONDERFUL BUTTER.   

411
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,537
      LET THIS SOFTEN UP A TAD. 

412
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,539
  ALL RIGHT, NOW YOU CAN GIVE ME
            THE ONIONS.         
GOT IT?                         

413
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,408
           WE HAVE TO WAIT NOW  
         FOR THESE TO SWEAT OUT.

414
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:52,410
  SWEAT THOSE DOWN,             
TURN 'EM TRANSLUCENT.           

415
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,412
AND NOW HERE'S THE NEW BURGER   
    THAT THEY'RE SERVING        

416
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,614
  HERE AT GROVER'S--            
THIS IS THE 4-POUNDER.          
                        (laughs)

417
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,416
SEE, THIS IS A GREAT MOVE.      

418
00:16:58,418 --> 00:16:59,817
   YOU GET SOME OF              
THAT CHARRED TEXTURE            

419
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,352
THAT YOU GET ON A FLATTOP.      
                           YEAH.

420
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,754
SO DEGLAZE THE PAN.             
                     WITH WATER.

421
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,490
        AND THEN I'M GONNA PUT  
       MY CHICKEN BASE IN THERE.

422
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,291
            NEXT, HALF-AND-HALF.
OKAY.                           

423
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,493
                COULD YOU PASS  
             THE SLURRY, PLEASE?
IS THAT A FLOUR SLURRY?         

424
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,095
          YES, FLOUR AND WATER. 

425
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,097
               NOW WE'LL PUT IN 
               THE CHEESE SAUCE.
I THOUGHT IT WAS MUSTARD.       

426
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,165
AND I'M LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW     
HOW POSSIBLY YOU COULD PUT      

427
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,301

                 AND YOU THOUGHT
                 IT WAS MUSTARD?

428
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:20,171
WHO MADE THIS RECIPE UP?        
                ACTUALLY, I DID.

429
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,706
       I JUST PLAYED WITH IT,   
     AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED. 

430
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,909
               NOW WE PUT IN    
          THAT WONDERFUL BURGER.

00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,577
                 NEXT, LETTUCE. 

432
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,979
WE'RE REALLY GONNA PUT LETTUCE  
     AND TOMATO IN THERE?       
                    YES, WE ARE.

433
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,882
               IS THERE LETTUCE 
              ON A CHEESEBURGER?
WELL, I KNOW THERE IS,          
    BUT I'M JUST--              

434
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,450
                           YEAH!
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.        

435
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,185
      AND LASTLY, THE TOMATOES. 

436
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,788
         WE MIX IT ALL TOGETHER,
           AND WE'RE ALL DONE.  

437
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,991
              READY TO TASTE IT.
THIS IS CRAZY.                  

438
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:41,325

      RIGHT SIZE OF TOMATO--MMM!

443

            THE LETTUCE,        

444
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,273

             OF SWEETNESS TO IT.
GLAD YOU'RE ENJOYING IT.

 THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.

471
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:59,770
GARLIC PARMESAN                 
BUFFALO WINGS.                  
                           OKAY.

472
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:03,040
THERE'S TEN TO AN ORDER.        
          WOW, PTERODACTYL WING.

473

           WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD 
           AND GET 'EM STARTED. 

474
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,978
AND HOW HOT'S THE FRYER?        
              ABOUT 400 DEGREES.

475
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,980
AND YOU GO FROM RAW             
   ALL THE TIME?                
                         ALWAYS.

476
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,649
LET 'EM GO FOR 14 TO 15 MINUTES,
     'CAUSE I LIKE THAT SKIN    

477
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:14,118
               TO BE CRUNCHY    
            WHEN I GET IN THERE.
YEAH, I WANT SOME CRUNCH.       

478
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:17,054
AND I ALSO LIKE TO RENDER DOWN  
       THE FAT INSIDE.          
                     YOU GOT IT.

479
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,191
OKAY, SO WHEN DO WE             
  MAKE THE SAUCE?               
     WE CAN START MAKING IT NOW.
          WE'RE READY, OKAY?    

480
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,793
       I MEASURED               
ABOUT THAT MUCH<i> BUTTER!</i>         
                         BUTTER.

481
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,529
  THIS IS FRESH GARLIC          
THAT WE CHOP IN ADVANCE,        

482
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,464

GRATED PARMESAN CHEESE,         

483
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:29,267

           I LIKE WHERE YOU WENT
                WITH THIS.      

484
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,402
             MY MOUTH'S STARTING
              TO WATER ALREADY. 
AND NOW WE MIX IT UP.           

485

486
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,472
 SHAKE 'EM UP. I DON'T LIKE 'EM 
       TO STICK TOGETHER,       

487
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,008
       WHICH THEY SOMETIMES DO. 

488
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,876
OKAY, LET'S GRAB OUR SAUCE.     
    DUMP 'EM IN THERE.

          ALL THAT SAUCE ON TOP?

491
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:45,082
DEPENDS ON HOW SAUCY            
   YOU LIKE THEM.               
                  OH, I'M SAUCY.

GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT.           

493
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,486
 I DON'T WANT                   
TO DO TOO MUCH.                 
                   LOOK AT THAT.

            A "HINT" OF HEAT.   

503

          INTO THEIR COOKING.
