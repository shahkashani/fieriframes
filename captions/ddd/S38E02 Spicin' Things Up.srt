   sugar, and one star anise.

   honey, garlic and jalapeno.

       immersion blender,       

89
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,726
       and then strain it       
       through a chinois.       

90
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,861
       So, a simple dredge      
        for the chicken.        

91
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,464
         Salt, AP flour         
       and garlic powder.

   chicken thigh in the fryer.

00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:27,472
           Boom. Salt,          
    and then just the glaze.    

95
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,542
        -Cilantro aioli.        
 -The daikon, carrot and onion. 

96
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,978
    The chicken. Ready to go.   

97

    Everything is done right.   

99
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,887
  One minute, it's a Nashville  
        chicken sandwich.       

100
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,488
        The next minute,        
         it's a banh mi.        

101
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,623
          It depends on         
       what bite you get.       

102
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,558
   Chicken's cooked perfectly.  
   Veggies are nicely pickled.  

103
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,827
   Not too soft. Not too firm.  

104
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,496
   Lime aioli... nice, light.   

105
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,765
       Bread, just enough       
       to keep it together      

106
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,434

        melting through.        

107
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,837
       But you know what?

         bring in a pro.        

108

        your buddy Derek.       

109

    your Triple D explanation

        nice and crispy.        

113

192

      Little vegetable oil      
  and a little julienned onion.

  Green onion, diced jalapeno.

200

       Some local arugula,      
       some of the curry,       
      cilantro and radish.      

213
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,579
        -You roll it up?        
  -You could fork and knife it.

            I'd move,           
   tear down the sign and go.   

221
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,597
         That is one of         
       the better curries       

222
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,332
  that I have tried in a while, 

223
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,467
            in or out           
    of an Indian restaurant.    

224
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:50,001
       Awesome. Thank you.      

225
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,470
         It's balanced,         
   it's fragrant, it's fresh.   

226
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,071
       It's a real curry.       

227
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,607
       Now, you're getting      
         that coriander,        
    all those toasted seeds.    

228
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,609
  You're really picking it up.  

229
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:58,743
      Loved the little bit      
      of jalapeno in there,     

230
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,679
     -the little bit of that    
        herbaceous heat.        
             -Yeah.             

231
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,547
     The ginger, the garlic,    
           very nice.           

232
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,149
  Cauliflower is still tender.  

233
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:06,418
     Naan's a great vessel.     

234

   Vegetarian, not vegetarian,  

235
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:11,556
  like curry, don't like curry, 
    I don't care what it is,    

236
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,559
    that sandwich right there   
    will blow your doors off.   

237
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,360
         I got a curried        
      cauliflower sandwich.     

238
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,429
  Quite honestly never thought  

239
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,630
        cauliflower could       
        taste that good.        

240
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,432

      one of the only times     

242
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,501
    that I eat the vegetables   
         that I should.         

243
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,437

00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,844

296
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,522
       [Guy] This does not      
  look like pizza dough-making. 

297
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,858
      Let that go for about     
       ten to 15 minutes.       

298
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,726
      We typically ball it      
     right after we mix it,     

299
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,661
      put it in the fridge      
   and let it grow overnight.   

300
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,130
   -[Guy] What do we do next?   
  -[Randy] Wanna shred cheese?  

301
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,799
           People like          
         the convenience        
     of pre-shredded cheese,    

302
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:37,068
      but there's a silica      
     they put on the cheese     

303
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,804
      that keeps the cheese     
        from coagulating        
      when it's in the bag.     

304
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,673
         So when you can        
       shred it yourself,       

305
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:44,075
   the melt that you're going   
    to get is very worth it.    

306
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:47,611
   [imitating Schwarzenegger]   
         You can do it.         
 Push harder. Use your muscles.

      Nice, light, fluffy,      
  lays out on the pizza great.  

309
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:53,752
     Tastes like mozzarella.    

310
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,420
        [Randy] Now we're

         Garlic, thyme,

313
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,627
      Fennel, onion powder,     
       red pepper, basil,       

314

          [Randy] Salt          
      and red wine vinegar.     

317
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,702
       So, we mix that up       
         into this pork.        

318
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,737
   [Randy] And then we put it   
    in the fridge overnight.

  It starts with a ranch base.  

321
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,642
     So we have mayonnaise,     
          sour cream...

   -...parsley, onion powder,   

323
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:20,712
         salt, thyme...

00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,580
          -[Guy] Dill.          
       -...water, chives,       

325
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,582

          black pepper.         

326
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,051
      And that's our ranch.     

327
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,719
  To make it the Dilly Drizzle, 
      we'll add red pepper,     

328
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:31,022
  -parsley, Parmesan, garlic--  
    -And a little olive oil.    

329
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:32,857
  That's like ranch gone wild.  

330
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,392
     If you get me a spoon,     
       I'll just eat this       
         as a cold soup.        

331
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:36,594
         -Yeah. [laughs]        
          -What's next?         

332
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,663
  -Roasted garlic white sauce.  
  -So, we got roasted garlic... 

333
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:42,199
   [Randy] Some butter, cream,  
     Parmesan, black pepper.    

334
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,735
         Cook that down,        
      make it a nice paste.     

335
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,003
      -Let's see it, chef.      
  -First we stretch the dough.  

336
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,339
     Look how nice and light    
       and tender that is.      

337
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,140
    [Randy] The white sauce.    

338
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,408
            -Spackle.           
          -Mozzarella.          

339
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,610
          This is where         
     things go off the rails    
       right here, folks.       

340
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,745
       Whoa! You're going       
      pickle happy on this.     

341
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,480
 [Randy] We do a lot of pickles 
       on the Dilly Dilly.      

342
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,749
         [Guy] And just         
  a little sausage. Very nice.  

343
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,817
     Let's go, uh, cook it.     
     In the oven, how long?     

344
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,687
     [Randy] Ninety seconds     
         to two minutes.        

345
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,687
    -[Guy] The type of wood?    
         -[Randy] Birch.        

346
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,557
  [whistles] Whoa, whoa, whoa!  

347
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,425
  Look at that thing. Medieval. 

348
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:08,559
       A friend of mine's       
          a blacksmith.         

349
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,028
      -So he made slicers.      
             -Nice.             

350
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,097
        The Dilly Shaker,       
       which is Parmesan,       
        Romano and dill.        

351
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:16,267
        -And then we have       
       our Dilly Drizzle.       
  -Schnizzle with the drizzle.  

352
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:22,841
  It's delicious. The crust is  
  about as spot on as you get.  

353
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:26,177
     Light, full of pockets,    
     but it's got good chew.    

354
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,711
          It's tender.          

355
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:30,314
     <i> I like biting into it</i>     
          <i> and getting</i>          
      <i> the pickle crunch.</i>       

356
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:31,716
    I like the fresh acidity    

357
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:34,518
        <i> contrasting to</i>         
        <i> the creaminess</i>         
      <i> of the base spread,</i>      

358
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,654
  and then you get the crumble  
        from the sausage,       

359
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,990
        and I think that        
    the sprinkle's dynamite.    

360
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,858
  -That's a destination pizza.  
            Congrats.           
           -Thank you.          

361
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,894
    Dilly Dilly with sausage    
       going in the oven.       

362
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,462
      What makes the pizza      
  amazing for me is the crust.  

363
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:46,531
 <i> It's got a good crisp to it.</i>  

364
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,600
       And the pickles are      
    kind of crunchy on there.   

365
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:52,069
    You can definitely taste    
         the birch smoke        
         coming through.        

366
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,672
  I crave it. I think about it  
     all the time. [laughs]     

367
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:56,607
        -We have to talk.       
      -We do have to talk.      

368
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,809
        Got some arugula        
    going on the No Truffle.    

369
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,546
      Hungry Robot is just      
  the best pizza in Fairbanks.  

370
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,813
           By the way,          
     how did Hungry Robot...    

371
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:04,549
   [Randy]<i> The ovens look like</i>

   as a little trailer thing,

   you don't get around here.   

377
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,430
    [Randy] Got a Bumble Bee    
          for table 6.          

378
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:20,631
      The Bumble Bee pizza,

     for Burning Bumble Bee.    

382

     We start with tomatoes,    
        and tomato paste,       
         diced tomatoes.        

383

       -Now we're going to      
   make the ancho chili honey.  

386

        Thank you, sugar.       

387
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:38,916
       Ancho chili powder.      

388
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,919
   So we just let this infuse,  
      and we're good to go.     

389
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:42,187

      -Well, let's do this!     

390
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:45,923
  We start with our red sauce,  
     pepperoni, mozzarella,     
        cubed pepperoni.        

391
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,459
        This gets on top        
   'cause then it gets crispy.  

392
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,528

    <i> Beautiful tomato sauce.</i>    

397

     giving you a little bit    
      of that vinegar acid      

398

00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,818
     Chicken Tikka, please.     

435
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,820
        I was overwhelmed       
  by the explosion of flavors.  

436
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,488
        There's something       
         for everybody.         

437
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:25,690
       Bread's coming out.      

438
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,558
   [man]<i> I could close my eyes</i>  
 <i> and tell you that I was home.</i> 

439
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,560
         It reminded me         
      of my mom's cooking.      

440
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,696
  [Guy]<i> And it was that longing</i> 
      <i> for Indian flavors</i>       

441
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,498
      <i> which led engineer</i>       
        <i> Sam Rangaswamy</i>         

442
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,234
       <i> to merge careers</i>        
     <i> after moving to Fargo</i>     

443
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,703
     <i> with his wife, Dana.</i>      

444
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:41,372
         How did you go         
    from software engineering   
   to the restaurant business?  

445
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,374
   Well, that was always there  
     in the back of my mind,    

446
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,243
      all the time cooking,     
          love cooking.         

447
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,578
    We said that we're going    
 to stick on to authentic food. 

448
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,447
         We didn't make         
       any changes at all.      

449
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:50,515
        Lamb Rogan Josh.        

450
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,717
     I've never had a better    
    Lamb Rogan Josh anywhere.   

451
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,654
         It takes an art        
       to cook this dish.       

452
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:59,190
        -[Guy] All right,       
        what are we into?       
      -The Lamb Rogan Josh.     

453
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,591
   Rogan josh, not Joe Rogan?   

454
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,793
   [chuckles] No. So, the lamb  
      that I'm using today,     

455
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:05,930
    grass fed, goes very well   
      with Indian curries.      

456
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,598
             -Okay.             
        -I'm going to use       
       a little technique       

457
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,800
        that grandmothers       
         like to follow.        

458
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,934
    Put some yogurt, turmeric   
         and salt to it.        

459
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,737
      -And let it pull out      
         the impurities.        
             -Yeah.             

460
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,739
       [Guy] Also creates       
   part of the flavor profile.  

461
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,807
       In India, everybody      
      has pressure cookers.     

462
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,943
     It looks like you could    
   split atoms with this deal.  

463
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,579
       -[Sam] Mustard oil.      
      -[Guy] I've never had     
          mustard oil.          

464
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:22,613
    Now we're going to bloom    

465
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,749
       cardamom, cinnamon,      
        black cardamom...       

466
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,352
 [Sam] Bay leaves, cumin seeds, 
      ginger-garlic paste.      

467
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,488
  This is called the asafetida. 

468
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:31,489
           -Asafetida?          
             -Yeah.             

469
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:32,757
            Oh, yeah.           

470
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,559
  -[Sam] Then we add our lamb.  
   -Put a little sear on this.  

471
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:38,696
       [Sam] Add turmeric       
        and let it steam        
      for about 20 minutes.     

472
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,631
        Now I'm going to        
       make onion base...       

473
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:44,435
        Now, this is the        
      foundation of so many     
         Indian curries.        

474
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,570
           [Sam] Yeah.          
     Vegetable oil, onions.     

475
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,638
   [Guy] Ginger-garlic paste.   

476
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,307
  [Sam] Kashmiri chili powder.  

477
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:51,442
     Very much like paprika.    

478
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:52,910
   Coriander powder, turmeric.  

479
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:53,844
       [Guy] Garam masala.      

480
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:55,713
       Is there an actual       
   written recipe around here?  

481
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:56,981
 Or we just eyeball everything? 

482
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,783
  Certainly the Indian cooking  
        is that you don't       
      measure up anything.      

483
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:00,918
             Water.             

484
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,654
      All right, so we cook     
            this down           
    till it's nice and soft.    

485
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,790
       Let's do the naan.       
       We make many, uh...      

486
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,326
    -You make many varieties    
            of naan?            
             -Yeah.             

487
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,460
        Food coma comin'.       

488
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:10,994
     Garlic naan, mint naan.    

489
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:14,332
   See, I thought it just went  
    seven, eight, naan, ten.    

490
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:18,402
           -[chuckles]          
            -[laughs]           

491
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,471
    [Sam] All-purpose flour,    
          baking soda,          

492
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,539
     yeast, homemade yogurt.    

493
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,607
         -Oh, homemade.         
  That's the way I do it, too.  
             -Yeah.             

494
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,009
     Salt, some sugar, oil.     

495
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:28,279
        This is the most        
        unmeasured recipe       
  I have ever seen in my life.  

496
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:29,747
       [Sam] Rest at least      
          for an hour.          

497
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,749
  -[Guy] And then roll it out.  
   -[Sam] The traditional way.  
        Use the fingers.        

498
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,684
      And now you're gonna      
        show me the magic       

499
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,419
       of the green onion       
         and the garlic.        

500
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:36,086
           [Sam] Sure.          

501
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,355
 [Guy] Garlic on the outside... 

502
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:38,256
           So awesome.          

503
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:40,291
         That's the pad.        

504
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,492
       [Sam] Put it inside      
        the tandoor oven.       

505
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,827
 Stuck to the side of the wall. 
        All right, chef.        

506
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,429
        [Sam] Let's make        
      the Lamb Rogan Josh.      

507
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,497
   Start off with mustard oil.  

508
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,233
      [Guy] Black cardamom,     
  cinnamon and green cardamom.  

509
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:49,633
        [Sam] Asafetida.        

510
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,435
       The old asafetida.       

511
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,171
         [Sam] It smells        
        very pungent, so.       

512
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,775
     That stuff, not so much    
        to try by itself.       

513
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,111
        [Sam] Onion base,       
       white onion sauce.       

514
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,379
     [Guy] And then in with     
    the pressure-cooked lamb.   

515
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,248
   Add some ginger powder now.  

516
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,315
          Garam masala.         

517
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:06,384
      Cumin powder, a bit.      

518
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,452
     Kashmiri chili powder.     

519
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,785
      Fennel seeds powder.      

520
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,721
           -Love that.          
          -Some yogurt.         

521
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:13,457
       This is the longest      
           Indian dish          
   we've ever made in my life.  

522
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,259
      -[Sam] Kasuri methi.      
        -[Guy] Some who?        

523
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,594
      Kasuri methi. Spice.      

524
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:17,728
         [Guy] Saffron.         

525
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,464
  [Sam] Stir fry till the sheen 
     and the oil oozes out.     

526
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:21,331
      [Guy] It's gorgeous.      

527
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:23,367
       Little of the gravy      
        into the basmati.       

528
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,370
       This is next level.      

529
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:29,406
   It's giving me goosebumps.   

530
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,541
      It's not one flavor.      

531
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,411
  You get the lamb, the onion,  
       you get the curry,       

532
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,413
       you get the pepper.      

533
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,749
     You're not just cooking    
         from the heart,        

534
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,484
       you're also cooking      
    with that analytical mind   

535
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:43,287
         that you have,         
  which makes it very precise.  

536
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:46,557
     I have taken 16 bites.     

537
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,192
       I am off the rails.      

538
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,361
               Oh.              

539
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,695
  Here's your Lamb Rogan Josh.  

540
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,831
     The lamb is excellent,     
        it's very tender.       

541
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,699
    The sauce that's with it    
     is absolutely decadent.    

542
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:58,569
     I'm a big fan of naan,     
         and they do it         
        really well here.       

543
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,704
  I'm making malai methi murgh. 

544
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,640
     -This is my first time     
   with Indian food, actually.  
         -In your life?         

545
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,776
          Yes. And I'm          
      pleasantly surprised.     

546
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,245
       They just bring out      
   so many different flavors.   

547
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,646
      Devil's Shrimp Curry.     

548
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,915
   [man]<i> Devil's Shrimp Curry</i>   
       <i> is kind of a spin</i>       
        <i> on tomato soup.</i>        

549
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,917
  It does have the spice kick.  
  It does have the creaminess.  

550
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,520
    Defined in an Indian way.   

551
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,721
          -[Guy] Chef,          
      what's the next dish?     
     -Devil's Shrimp Curry.     

552
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,324
     And this goes way back     
  to the southern tip of India. 

553
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:21,992
   Lemon juice, some turmeric.  

554
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,194
       [Guy] Little salt.       

555
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,462
        -How long is that       
         gonna marinate?        
      -[Sam] 15-20 minutes.     

556
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,596
       Got it. Next step.       

557
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,899
       [Sam] Coconut oil,       
        a little mustard,       
          curry leaves.         

558
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,668
      -Cumin, red chilies.      
              -Hot.             

559
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,536
        [Sam] Onion base        
        and onion gravy,        

560
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:33,604
       fenugreek seeds...       

561
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:34,538
       [Guy] Tomato puree.      

562
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,540
   Tamarind, garam masala now.  

563
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,343
          Chili powder,         
      ginger-garlic paste,      
          black pepper.         

564
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,611
          I lost count.         
    I gotta take my shoe off    

565
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,879
     -'cause we're over 20.     
             -Water.            

566
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:44,015
      -[Guy] A little salt.     
         -[Sam] Shrimps.        

567
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,284
         -Coconut cream.        
        -And a little bit       
         of heavy cream.        

568
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,152
          Goodbye, Guy.         

569
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,088
       Look at that bite.       

570
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,025
              Mmm.              

571
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:55,493
       Shrimp are tender,       

572
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:57,428
       just lightly bathed      
         in that sauce,         

573
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,763
     lavished in the curry.     

574
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,266
     For the average person,    
     it's got a little heat.    

575
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,702
   But it's not overly spicy.   

576
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:08,639
   Every time you get a bite,   
  kind of like a lotus flower,  
    just continuing to open.    

577
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,375
        That is the just        
         how it's done,         
    right there. Outstanding.   

578
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:12,509
      Devil's Shrimp Curry.     

579
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,378
    The shrimp is excellent.    

580
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:15,379
           Too spicy?           

581
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,580
     Uh, it makes me sweat.     

582
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:17,448
            [laughs]            

583
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,582
        Gobi Manchurian.        

584
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,451
          You can taste         
    the passion in the food.    

585
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:21,786
      You will never leave      
         empty stomach.         

586
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:24,522
   Any time someone tells me,   
       "Oh, I'm not a fan       
        of Indian food,"        

587
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,524
   I just look at 'em and say,  
  "Have you seen a movie in 3D? 

588
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:28,859
      Have you seen a movie     
           in color?"           

589
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,929
  Come to Fargo, North Dakota,  
    'cause the Indian food's    
            the bomb.           

590
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,664
           -Thank you.          
        -[Guy] Real deal.       

591
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,467
  So that's it for this edition 
      of<i> Diners, Drive-ins</i>      
          <i> and Dives.</i>           

592
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,869
      But don't you worry.      
      There's funky joints      
     all over this country,     

593
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,338
   and I'll be looking for you  
         next time on...        

594
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,540
         [all] Triple D!        

595
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,475
         [all cheering]         

596
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:45,475
           Here, just           
      come over here and...     

597
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:46,744
    Let's try this one time.    

598
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,680
       Everybody at home,       
          get your face         
    real close to the screen.   

599
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:52,416
       Come in fast, okay?      
         And let's eat.         

600
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:53,484
    Cover your teeth. Ready?    

601
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:54,752
           [laughter]           

602
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,288
     -[Guy]<i> Yeah. Good job.</i>     
           -[laughter]
