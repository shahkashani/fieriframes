00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,067
           Hey, there.          

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,535
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:07,005
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,674
          This trip...          
             Don't be a-scared. 

5
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:11,410
         ...we're going         
     from Jersey to Cali...     
               And he's running.

6
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:13,745
         ...getting our         
   East Coast, West Coast fix.  

7
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:14,746
   It's addicting.              

8
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,815
            First in            
   Bakersfield, California...   

9
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,283
                 Got to have    
           a little wango tango.

10
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,452
          ...an iconic,         
     down-home steakhouse...    

11
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,287
     This is about as old-school
                 as it gets.    

12
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,023
...where the character's kicking
  his way through the kitchen.  

13
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,491
             Dude's taking over 
                  the show.     

14
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:27,826
       And across town...       

15
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,161
      Oh, yes!                  

16
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,795
           ...a funky           
       Latin experience...      

17
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:31,764
    Cha-cha-cha?                

18
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:34,633
    ...putting fancy footwork   
          into fusion.          

19
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,235
 Now you're getting             
     the rumba.                 

20
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:37,702
      Then in Somers Point,     
          New Jersey...         

21
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,570
                  What up?      

22
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,706
          ...a standout         
        sandwich shop...        

23
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,307
        The only thing you need 
  when you come into to get that

24
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,842
                 is a friend    
            to drive you home...

25
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:46,045

        a knockout combo.       

26
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,245
                   ...and       
             a medical release. 

27

29
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,630
So, I'm here in south New Jersey
 in a town called Somers Point. 

30
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,732
          Now, this is          
   where people cruise through  

31
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,468
   to go down to the boardwalk  
         and Ocean City.

We call her "G-Tar,"

I got the crab melt.

             WOMAN:             
 It's a grilled cheese sandwich,

58
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,518
     and it has a crab cake     
         in the middle.         

59
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,720
            It's what           
     they're known for here.    

60
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,256
              Let's get into it.
All right, so,                  

61
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:06,959
the first thing we're gonna do  
is add our mayo to the bin.

00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,093
Next, we're gonna add           
      our eggs.

Then our fresh lemon juice.

   honey mustard.

00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:14,666
A little Sriracha --            

66
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,267
I think Sriracha                
just makes everything better.   

67
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:19,137
Just a little Crystal Hot Sauce,
a little extra heat.

     And then                   
Worcestershire sauce.           
            Wor-shur-shur sauce.

69

 Old Bay seasoning.

                There you go.

00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,024
      A load of                 
fresh-chopped parsley.          

79
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,025

  we whisk her up.

  She's good to go.

our panko bread crumbs.

     You can either have it     
         plain or angry.        

115
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:59,771
       "Angry" here means       
     Sriracha and jalapeños.    

116
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,306
You make the cheesesteaks angry.

117
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,575
      Cream of crab soup --     
     you can get that angry.    

118
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,576
    Having the sandwich angry   
      makes me very happy.

     making folks smile...      

120
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:09,947
  I love the pork belly Reuben. 

121
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,316
Pork belly Reuben up.           

122
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,352
    It's one of the most epic   
     sandwiches on the menu.    

123
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:16,655
We're doing pork belly          
        here.                   

124
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,456
    We just have                
 a real simple rub.             

125
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,726
  We're gonna start             
with a little kosher salt.      

126
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,460
A little black pepper.          

127
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,596
   Garlic powder.               
      Rosemary.                 

128
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,265
          A little bit of oil...
 Just so it sticks.             

129
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,066
               ...so it's pasty.
Mix her in.                     

130
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,802
           How about we do this?
  Yeah, that works.             

131
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,138
So, we give it a rub,           

132
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,407
   and we leave it              
 for about 24 hours.            

133
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,209
   And we're gonna              
put it in our roasting pan      

134
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,810
    and roast it                
  for three hours.              

135
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,011
              Word to the pig.  

136
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,547
All right, we're making         
Grandma G-Tar's sauerkraut.     

137
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,150
We're gonna mix up the brine -- 
apple cider vinegar.            

138
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,819
We got our apple cider.         

139
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,554
    Kosher salt.                

140
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,622
Crushed caraways.               
                    Very nice.  

141
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,825
 We add our cabbage             
    to the brine.               

142
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:57,496
      Back into                 
the microwave-safe container.   

143
00:04:57,498 --> 00:05:00,766
I feel like this is probably    
  a one-person job.             

144
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,634
If you wait out back,           
  that'd be great.              

145
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,302
            Good luck with that.

                 Do you need me?

147
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,271
               Okay, I'm back.  
 All right. Great.              

148
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:08,973
  Gosh, you were able to do that
              all by yourself?  

149
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,508
  Grandma bought me             
    a restaurant                

150
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,777
'cause I could put stuff        
in bowls all by myself.

           "Put stuff in bowls"!

00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,114
We cover this bad boy up.       

153
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,650
This is gonna go for            
about five minutes.             

154
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,118
                 Pork belly.    

155
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,921
I like to slice the pieces      
    pretty thick.               

156
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,189
                Like buttah.    

157
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,057
It's a sandwich.                
             That's a sandwich? 

158
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,894
Take our four slices,           
    nice hot pan.               

159
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,131
A little marble rye.            
We got to butter that.          

160
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,399
                  Oh-ho-ho!     

161
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,401
   We're gonna add              
   a little Swiss.              

162
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,469
  Now we cover it,              
  melt that cheese,             

163
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,005
and throw on our kraut.         

164
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,607
Top it with sauerkraut.         

165
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:45,043
We add our pork belly.          

166
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:48,013
Hit it with our homemade        
  Russian dressing.             

167
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,947
It's about the most ridiculously
                huge sandwich   

168
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,149
           I've seen in a while.

169
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,884
       That's                   
our pork belly Reuben.

172
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,694
                This has got    
         a lot of texture to it.

173
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,629
      It's got a lot of flavor. 
      The pork belly's dynamite.

     tons of moisture around it.

      a lot of character.       

210
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,512
   I think that's the best way  
         to describe it.

214
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,853
  But in 2010, the game changed 

215
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,787
        when a new buyer        
    started sniffing around.    

216
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,923
They kind of wanted to clean    
house and redo it their way.    

217

       Why did you buy it?      

218
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:41,793
                So everybody

00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,928
                  and that

228
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,879
I did that right here           
in the KC Steakhouse.           

229
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:03,080
 A lot of old-school specialties
               on the menu --   

230
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,415
                    like,       
      stuff you can't mess with.

231
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,084
    No.                         
               This is the way  
            we've been doing it.

232
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,552
Yeah, this is the way           
we've been doing it.            

233
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:08,620
  This is the way               
  it's gonna stay.              

234
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:09,687
              MAN:              
  This is not nouveau cuisine,  

235
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,490
          where you have        
    like three peas on a plate. 

236
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,091
     FIERI: Not even close.     

237
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:16,161
 Instead, they're loading up on 
 good old down-home favorites.  

238
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,096
   You normally wouldn't order  
         mac and cheese         

239
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,363
   in a steakhouse, would you?  

240
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,700
    FIERI: Unless, of course,   
     there's lobster in it.     

241
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,101
      I personally wouldn't     
          have thought          

242
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,169
     that lobster goes with     
  mac and cheese, but it does.  

243
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,237
         It's wonderful.        

244
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,572
         Lobster mac and cheese.
Mac and cheese.                 

245
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,374
 What makes good mac and cheese,
               in your world?   

246
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,675

     [ Laughs ]                 

247
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,043
                    Well,       
             there you have it. 

248
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,912
            I mean,<i> I'm</i> the one 
      asking the dumb questions.

249
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,381
          All right, let's start
           making some lobster. 

250
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,716
       We have                  
North Atlantic lobster tail.    

251
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,118
     Crack him.                 

252
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,654
           How are we gonna make
                this lobster?   

253
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:43,889
We're gonna steam it            
    in the oven.                

254
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:46,424
       Water.                   

255
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,994
  Pickling spice.               
                    Interesting.

256
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,596
     It makes it                
   real aromatic.               

257
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:52,664
                 I like it.     

258
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,266
 Paprika for color.             

259
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,601
                  Okay, so,     
          now we go to the oven.

260
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:57,802
             And this goes fast.
    Sure.                       

261
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,137
                Bring it out,   
                let it cool.    

262
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,338
               You chop it up?  

263
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,474
    And then we'll start to make
            the mac and cheese. 

264
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,010
 And then we'll make            
some macaroni and cheese.       

265
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,145
    We start with               
  some heavy cream.             
                        Okay.   

266
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,413
   Cheddar cheese.              

267
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,281
 Got to have a good,            
old-fashioned American cheese.  

268
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,883
            Oh, you got to have 
          some of that in there.

269
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,752
           Ain't mac and cheese 
           without the American.

270
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,419
   'Merican, yeah.

271
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,821
A little blue cheese.           

272
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,356
               You got to have  
           a little wango tango.

273
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,357
       Garlic.                  

274
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,358
   Chopped onions.              

275
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,626
Coarse black pepper.            

276
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,561
    Kosher salt.                

277
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,963
And a little cavatappi mac.     

278
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,231
This is the lobster.            

279
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,899
          Everybody in the pool.

280
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,702
         That's the size portion
             we're giving them? 
Uh-huh. That's it.              

281
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,236
                 Holy moly!     

282
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,572
 To-go boxes are big            
     at the KC.                 

283
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,507
                 I just want    
            to come and see<i> him.</i>

284
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:36,641
     [ Laughs ]                 

285
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,576
So, I'll let it rock 'n' roll   
 for a few minutes.             

286
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,444
               Rock 'n' roll.   

287
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,580
             All that's gonna go
                  in there?     

288
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,050
              It's like putting 
      your skinny jeans on, huh?

289
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,384
     Nobody here                
  has skinny jeans.             

290
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:49,253
 Now we're gonna do             
a little Parmesan cheese.       

291
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,922
    And a little                
Japanese bread crumbs.          

292
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,157
      Parsley.                  

293
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,393
And a little blowtorch          
     for color.                 

294
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,361
                  He knows      
               no boundaries.   

295
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,664
              Good, old-school  
             garlic bread there.

296
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,566
       That is                  
the lobster mac and cheese.     

297
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,071
                 The key is,    
       is when you bite into it,

298
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,340
          you should really get 
          big chunks of lobster.

299
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,142
                It's creamy.    
I like the blue cheese mix, too.

300
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,811
  Uh-huh. It works.             

301
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,146
          Big pieces of lobster.

302
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,981
 Loved the little crunch you did
               from the panko.  

303
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,283
   The pasta is nice and tender.
           It's not overcooked. 

304
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,086
You really hit it. Not everybody
         can do mac and cheese. 

305
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:23,354
   You got to have              
that big kid in you.            

306
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,757
        The big kid at the KC --
                The Forrest.    

307
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,926
           That's dynamite, man.
                  Nice job.     

308
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,963
    You like mac and cheese,    
    you're gonna love this.     

309
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,634
  The noodles are great. They   
  hold the cheese really well.  

310
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:38,636
  You have to stick to some of  
 the basic, simple ingredients, 

311
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,171
           and I think          
       they do that here.       

312
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,173
               So, this is one  
     of my really close friends.

313
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,241
       This is Michael Osterman.

314
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,776
        How does this restaurant
        stay here for 76 years? 

315
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,377
I think the biggest part        

316
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,045
is they treat everybody         
like family when they walk in.  

317
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,914
They have loyal guests          
   that come back,              

318
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,717
and the next generation         
  comes with them.              

319
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:56,320
 It's just really a neighborhood
 place where people congregate. 

320
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,523
  Me and a couple of my friends 
              here,             

321
00:10:58,525 --> 00:10:59,858
       we should probably       
         own the place.         

322
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,126
           We've spent          
       enough money here.       

323
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:04,529
It's what you would find at a   
steakhouse in the '60s and '70s 

324
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,664
    when you got                
 what you paid for.             

325
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,466
        Stuffed pork chop       
   with the cranberry relish.   

326
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,668
                  What else     
             you gonna make me? 

327
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,669
Oh, we're gonna go with         
the stuffed pork chop.          

328
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,005
     The Forrest show at the KC 
with the guy from the "Triple D"

329
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,007
             when we come back, 
     hanging out in Bakersfield.

330
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,208
            See you in a minute.

331
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,821
  I'm the Forrest.              
This is the KC with "Triple D." 

332
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,489
             Dude's taking over 
                  the show.     

333
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:32,757
            We're in Bakersfield

334
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,026
     hanging out with characters
             of all characters, 

335
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,361
           and we're at a joint 
           called KC Steakhouse.

336
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,630
    But as Forrest refers to it,
               it's "The KC."   

337
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,232

410
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,415
            And then here we are
            with the super chop.

411
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,217
     This is about as old-school
                 as it gets.    

412
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,554

       Love that you grilled it.

00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,426
      The texture from the grill
                 is great --    

416
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,228
               the little bit   
            of the char you get.

417
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,930
 Cranberry sauce is outstanding.
          Doesn't overwhelm it. 

418
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,298
         Doesn't take the flavor
                away from it.   

419
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,769

         and vegetable medley --

    that's the KC's middle name.

421
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,974
        This is the kind of food

 The reason the KC is still here
               after 76 years   

424
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,715
   is because if it ain't broke,
                don't fix it.   

425
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:14,418

bit of pink like I like my pork.

   and get a stuffed pork chop  
           this good.

449
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,137
          Now, they got         
  a lot of restaurants here --  

450
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,738
        Johnny Garlic's.        
     Shameless plug for me.     

451
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,073
But they got a lot of taquerías.

452
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,808
    So, when these two dudes    
    came together and said,     

453
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,810
"Hey, we're gonna open up, like,
      a Latin restaurant,"      

454
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:14,345
           they said,           
"We don't want to do a taquería.

455
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:17,147
   No, we want to do something  
 with a Latin/American fusion." 

456
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,984
     And that's what we got     
   right here at Mama Roomba.   

457
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,956
             Cheese empanadas --
                 pick it up.    

458
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,358
   It's one of the most unique  
     places in Bakersfield.     

459
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,695
       It's Mexican, it's       
 South American, it's Caribbean.

460
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:33,697
   Tortilla soup, sea mussels --
            pick it up, please. 

461
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,233
   WOMAN: Very eclectic menu.   

462
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,235
      It's like a vacation      
         on every plate.        

463
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,703
   FIERI: Thanks to this guy,   
      Chef Isaac Mancilla,      

464
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:43,908
        who's been fusing       
these exotic flavors since 2005.

465
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,711
So, we're taking American items 
and making them Latin           

466
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,312
   and Latin items              
and making them gringo?         

467
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,781
So, I try to mix it all together
        to make something nice. 

468
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,584
       I think every dish       
       is pretty amazing.       

469
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:54,852
            Latin fried chicken.

470
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,653
     The Latin fried chicken    
        is out of bounds.       

471
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,522
      It's nice and crispy,     
         tender inside.         

472
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,524
   WOMAN: And then you hit it   
      with the mango salsa.     

473
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,593
  It's the perfect combination. 

474
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,128
  What are we gonna             
     make first?                

475
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,696
             The Latin/American 
               fried chicken.   

476
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,231
So, we're gonna make            
the marinade for the chicken?   

477
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,132
                    Yes.        
  Okay, hit it.                 

478
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,001
               Cayenne pepper.  

479
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,602
             Granulated garlic. 

480
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,604
                Black pepper.   

481
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,573
                    Salt.       

482
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:16,741
                Plain yogurt.   

483
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,276
 Do you have yogurt             
  in Mexican food?              

484
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,209
              That's the twist. 

485
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,144
  That's the twist.             

486
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,012
              That's the twist. 
That's the twist.               

487
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,881
             And the buttermilk.
  Buttermilk?                   

488
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,817
         You're gonna mix it all
                  together.     

489
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:26,951
        Okay.                   

490
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,153
       And then I'm gonna put it
              in the container. 

491
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,621
            And then we transfer
            our chicken tenders.

492
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:31,956
      How long                  
is this gonna marinate?         

493
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,758
             At least six hours.

494
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,826
  What are we gonna             
     coat it in?                

495
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,827
                 Just flour,    
              salt, and pepper. 

496
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,162
Then we'll fry it.              
                  Exactly.      

497
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,567
      Now what                  
 are we gonna make?             

498
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:43,968
               Habanero-mango   
                chili sauce.    

499
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,571
Habanero-mango chili.           
He makes it sound good.         

500
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,773
            We start with water.

501
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,309
              Drop some garlic  
                and habanero.   

502
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,178
                Brown sugar.    

503
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,179
                  Tomatoes.     

504
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,914
                Bell peppers.   

505
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:57,982
                 Red onions.    

506
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,516
                  Molasses.     

507
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,853
  You use molasses              
   in Latin food?               

508
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:02,653
                 Not really.    

509
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:03,988
   Not really.                  
                 [ Laughs ]     

510
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,988
               Tamarind sauce.  

511
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,124
 Oh, tamarind sauce.            

512
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,725
               Apple vinegar.   

513
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:08,860
                   Cumin.       

514
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:09,927
                   Thyme.       

515
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,529
                  Cinnamon.     

516
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,998
   And...?                      
             And Dijon mustard. 

517
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,866
      Oh, yes!                  

518
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,534
                Another kick.   

519
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,269
              Then at the end,  
                 the mango.     

520
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,538
      How long                  
is this gonna cook down?        

521
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,006
                  An hour.      

522
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,675
And then later, we're gonna hit 
it with an immersion blender.   

523
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:25,676
           An immersion blender.

524
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:28,546
   Okay, let's go.              

525
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,214
       We got our chicken ready.

526
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,883
  This is how many              
 come with an order?            

527
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,317
                    Yes.        

528
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,488
        Mmm.                    

529
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,689
    Chicken's got               
a little bit of spice.          

530
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:39,757
I think a lot of people,        

531
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,159
they would call these           
  chicken tenders.              

532
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:45,029
   They're plump,               
   juicy, crunchy.              

533
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,231
What I like the best about it --
 the salsa's cold...            

534
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,098
                    Yes.        

535
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,433
...the chicken's hot.           

536
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:50,901
   Your mouth gets              
 a little bit spicy,            

537
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,070
    then it gets                
   a little sweet.              

538
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,839
   It's addicting.              

539
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,440
      Nice job.                 
                     Thanks.    

540
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,778
   The chicken is very crunchy  
 on the outside with the spices.

541
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,614
      The sauce is amazing,     
      a little bite to it.      

542
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:06,383
       I love their food.       

543
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,918
 This is the pan-fried sea bass.

544
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,853
   The ambience is wonderful.   

545
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,389
   FIERI: But the real show's   
     back in the kitchen...     

546
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,457
              Like Rico Suave.  

547
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,725
   That's Roomba?               

548
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:17,328
  ...which is where this joint  
      gets its funky name.      

549
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,062
                  Rumba is      
              a kind of dance.  

550
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:22,199
        Da-da, one-two, one-two.

551
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,734
Oh, is there a little kick      
      in there?                 

552
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:24,702
              Yeah, like that.  

553
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:27,472
      No dance floor here,      

554
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:30,074
     but Isaac's busting out    
  some mean moves at the grill. 

555
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,609
                 Tri-tip --     
                 pick it up.    

556
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,211
    The tri-tip is delicious,   

557
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,412
         especially with        
     the Chimichurri sauce.     

558
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,213
      WOMAN: They serve it      
     on a sizzling skillet,     

559
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,082
   so when it hits the table,   
   it's really a head turner.   

560
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:39,884
        Okay,                   
what are we gonna make next?    

561
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:40,951
             Churrasco tri-tip. 

562
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,153
So, we have the tri-tip.        

563
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:43,821
              And then we make  
               our seasoning.   

564
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,089
             Granulated garlic. 

565
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,490
                  Paprika.      

566
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,025
                Black pepper.   

567
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,427
                Chili flakes.   

568
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,961
                    Salt.       

569
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,829
                Brown sugar.    

570
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:53,898
  And a little...?              
                     Thyme.     

571
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,966
  And gimme some...             

572
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:55,966
                    Ooh!        
Yeah!                           

573
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,234
 Now you're getting             
     the rumba.                 

574
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,769
                  And then      
         we mix it all together.

575
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,170
So, now where do we put         
      the meat?                 

576
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,372
Oh, we're gonna tenderize?      
            With the tenderizer.

577
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,773
    Cha-cha-cha?                

578
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:03,441
         Ah!                    

579
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,709
And now we pour the oil         
    over the top?               

580
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:06,911
                    Yeah.       

581
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,113
             We let it marinate 
          for at least 12 hours.

582
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,514
And then we'll put that         
    on the grill?               

583
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:11,983
                  Exactly.      
   Got it.                      

584
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,051
And then we're gonna            
finish it in the oven.          

585
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,053
                In the oven.    

586
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,188
  All right, Chef,              
    what's next?                

587
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,789
              We're gonna make  
          our Chimichurri sauce.

588
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:19,857
    I like this.                

589
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:20,791
                  Cilantro.     

590
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,593
                  Parsley.      

591
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:23,995
                 The garlic.    

592
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:28,733
         We'll add black pepper.

593
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,334
                Chili flakes.   

594
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,735
                  Oregano.      

595
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:32,670
               Ground cloves.   

596
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,138
 Really? That much?             

597
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,005
                   Mm-hmm.      

598
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,206
                    Salt.       

599
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,074
                   Water.       

600
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:39,076
        Okay.                   

601
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,212
               White vinegar.   

602
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,146
                And the oil.    

603
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,081
              Thank you, Chef.  

604
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,750
Let all these flavors           
   come together.               

605
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:49,220
                We are ready.   
        Let's plate our tri-tip.

606
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:53,691
       We put on a bed of onions
              and our tri-tip.  

607
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,560
                   We put       
       the Chimichurri sauce on.

608
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,832
The flavors are great.          
It's a nice medium-rare.        

609
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,570
The meat's seasoned.            
 It's cooked great.             

610
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:09,106
    The freshness               
 of the Chimichurri.            

611
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:10,775
 The grilled onions             
going along with it.            

612
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:12,776
  Lots of flavor,               
  lots of variety.              

613
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,312
You put a lot of time           
      into it.                  

614
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,781
   Can't beat it.               
  Nice job, buddy.              

615
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:19,983
      It's nice and spicy.      

616
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,451
        You cut into it,        
      it's nice and tender.     

617
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,588
      The Chimichurri sauce     
          is delicious.         

618
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,057
 MAN: The grilled onions with it
  just adds to the whole meal.  

619
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,125
          It's amazing.         

620
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,726
      Atmosphere's great --     
        It makes you feel       

621
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,929
      like you're somewhere     
        in the Caribbean.       

622
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,999
       I enjoy                  
that you push the creativity.   

623
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,800
Simple but nice.                
              Yeah, thank you.  

624
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:37,868
  Thank you, Chef.              

625
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,403
                 Thank you.     

626
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,539
  So, that's it for this trip,  
        but don't worry.        

627
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,541
 There's plenty more "Triple D" 
  joints all over the country!  

628
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,410
     I'll be looking for you    
            next week

           and Dives."

Habanero-mango chili sauce.     

631
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,750
Drop a little shoulder in       
      on that?                  

632
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,152
Say it one more time to the     
camera. Tell it to the ladies.  

633
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:56,287
                  Habanero-mango
                   chili sauce. 

634
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:57,321
        Yeah.                   

635
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:59,523
