        really low heat.        

86
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:03,715

92

         to 45 minutes.         

93
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:19,965

       the place for you.       

234
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:04,782
  Walnut burger up.             

235
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,117
This vegetarian burger is great.

236
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,586
 You don't feel like            
you're being cheated on,        

237
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:08,787
    the fact that               
it's not a meat burger?         

238
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,055
         It just tastes perfect.

239
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,257
   I see people wolf them down  
          all the time.         

240
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,658
 All right, what are            
we making first, Chef?          

241
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,126
        We're gonna make        
       the walnut patties.      

242
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,996
 We got some pretoasted walnuts,
       nutritional yeast,       

243
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,533
 Hungarian paprika, ancho chili,
    Morita chili, and cumin.    

244
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:22,867
         Gonna buzz this        
        for a little bit.       

245
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,402
    And what does               
the nutritional yeast do?       

246
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:27,806
  It gives it kind of a cheesy, 
     Earthy kind of flavor.     

247
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,274
     I got you.                 

248
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:32,343
   Then we're gonna go in with  
the fried onions, maple syrup...

249
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,345
          It's, Canada.         

250
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,480
      And our black beans.      

251
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:36,814
       Got it.                  

252
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,150
  We got the rest of the nuts,  
       ground jasmine rice      

253
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,085
           that I cook          
 and then I put flaxseed in it. 

254
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,487
    It gives it a little bit    
        of nutty flavor.        

255
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:45,156
 A little salt, a little pepper,
        some bread crumb.       

256
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,359
I make a couple different styles
 of veggie patties,             

257
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,161
but the walnuts are something   
 totally new for me.            

258
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:53,164
 Bake it for about six minutes, 
         give it a flip,        

259
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,500
         put some mixed         
   mushrooms and cheese on it,  

260
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,901
             bake it            
    for another four minutes,   

261
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,036
      and it's a done deal.     

262
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,103
What else goes on this?         

263
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,638
      My grandma's pickles.     

264
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,641
It's the smallest kitchen and   
they're gonna make the pickles. 

265
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:05,242
     We're using these small    
       Lebanese cucumbers.      

266
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,579
      We got some sea salt,     
    some brown mustard seeds,   

267
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:10,848
        granulated onion,       
  ground celery, and turmeric.  

268
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,717
   Sugar, apple cider vinegar.  

269
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,719
    The salt pulls the juice    
       out of the cucumber      

270
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,721
      and creates the brine.    
How long you let these go?      

271
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,723
I like to let them go overnight.
So, that's it?                  

272
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,658
   We got out toasted bun here  
     that we make in house.     

273
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,726
House made?                     
        Yeah, of course.        

274
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,728
     Mayonnaise that we make    
            in house,           

275
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,598
   pickles, lettuce, tomatoes.  

276
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,865
That's all she wrote.           

277
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,534
That's a hardy burger           
    right there.                

278
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:33,671
                     ♪♪         

279
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,340
   That's a better              
  vegetarian burger             

280
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,875
than a lot of meat burgers      
      I've had.                 

281
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:40,812
This concoction with the walnuts
    and the rice                

282
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,146
 and the beans and the flaxseed,

283
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,750
  and I love the color that you 
    pick up from the chilies.   

284
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,818
  Everything you've done right. 
  The bun's great, very hardy.  

285
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,887
   When you roast the burger,   

286
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,623
        add the mushrooms       
         and the cheese,        

287
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,091
    you hit it with the house   
          made pickles,         

288
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,692
         your mind says,        
       "This is a burger."      

289
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:55,893
        Nicely done, man.       

290
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,561
      You do all this work      
     in this little kitchen?    

291
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,898
                    Yep.        
     Walnut burger's coming out.

292
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,700
    It's really rare to find    
  a garden burger that's juicy. 

293
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:05,103
     The texture is just on     
    'cause of the nuttiness.    

294
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,239
     It reminds me of, like,    
  Thanksgiving dinner in a bun. 

295
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,108
             FIERI:             
   But this joint is a far cry  

296
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,776
          from holidays         
       at grandma's house.      

297
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,645
   MAN: I was in here one time  
    and I heard someone say,    

298
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,113
    "Hey, could you guys turn   
     the music down a bit?"     

299
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,382
     And the bartender said,    
 "We don't do that around here."

300
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:20,251
  MAN: It is decorated with all 
    the things you might find   

301
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:21,653
   in a 17 year old's bedroom   

302
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:24,589
        or in my bedroom,       
       it really depends.       

303
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:27,191
Most people, when they walk in  
the door, they think "dive bar."

304
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,193
   But then you have food here  
        and it's amazing.       

305
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,261
     Rib dinner.                

306
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,197
   Every single thing you eat   
        is just so good.        

307
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,965
         My favorite is         
   the wake and bake chicken.   

308
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,135
   Big piece of juicy chicken   
    that is just to die for.    

309
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,604
 MAN: It's got a sausage gravy, 
      some mashed potatoes,     

310
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,073
    nice corn flakes on top.    

311
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,542
How did this chicken come about?
     I needed a new dinner item.

312
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,210
     We used to have chicken    
    and waffles on our menu,    

313
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,945
     so I just adapted that.    

314
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,414
   We're gonna start by doing   
           a dry rub.           

315
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,683
 We got salt, granulated onion, 
       Hungarian paprika,       

316
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:55,687
        Spanish paprika,        
    granulated garlic, sugar,   

317
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,222
        and celery salt.        

318
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:59,224
Chicken breast?                 
    It's gonna get dry rubbed   

319
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:02,027
  and then we're gonna add some 
 milk, egg, sour cream marinade.

320
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,495
  Is this gonna get             
  a flour coating?              

321
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,896
        It gets a crust.        

322
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:08,233
We got corn flakes, bread crumb,
     seasoned flour, sugar,     

323
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,101
        Spanish paprika,        
       poultry seasoning,       

324
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,436
    and ground celery seeds.    

325
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,171
Very interesting concoction.    

326
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,440
       Dredge the chicken,      
     small amount of canola,    

327
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:18,176
        put it in at 500°       
      for about 10 minutes.     

328
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,178
Okay, Chef, next step.          
         Sausage gravy.         

329
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,713
    We got ground pork jowls.   

330
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,449
   Sometimes we breakdown pigs  
       and grind in house.      

331
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,718
       Where?                   

332
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,653
I do not know what's going on   
  in this kitchen.              

333
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:31,723
We got salt, pepper, fresh sage,
          fresh ginger,         

334
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:34,125
          maple syrup,          
        and bread crumbs.       

335
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,861
Your own sausage mix            
  into the hot pan.             

336
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,797
   Brown it up, and I'm gonna   
 add some Canadian maple syrup. 

337
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,333
What is gonna be the basis of   
this gravy besides the sausage? 

338
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:45,269
    House rendered pork fat,    
 some chopped onions and garlic,

339
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:49,273
  fresh thyme, seasoned flour,  
 chicken stock, and whole milk. 

340
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,143
  Let that cook for 10 minutes  
 and it's ready for the sausage.

341
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,677
All right, where we at, buddy?  

342
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,148
  We got the chicken and we got 
 the sausage gravy, corn flakes,

343
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,616
        and a little bit        
         of fresh herbs.        

344
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:02,220
Giving it all right there.      

345
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,023
        It's a real rib sticker.

346
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:08,626
     Bro, this is not at all    
         what I expected        

347
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,295
        when I came into        
           Jackalope.           

348
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:13,765
          You and everybody else
             that comes in here.

349
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,767
     I've had fried chicken     
     at fried chicken joints    

350
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,035
      doesn't taste as good     
        as that chicken.        

351
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:20,371
  Great crunch, tons of flavor,

00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,390
           It's, like,          
   crispy all the way through.  

472
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,325
That sandwich has a lot of nooks

473
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,327
          and crannies          
     in that beach mushroom     

474
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,130
    where it captures all of    
   that flavor of the breading  

475
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,199
      and it's a little bit     
          spicy and...          

476
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,000
You're trying to take my job,   
     aren't you?                

477
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,802
    You're fired.               
Don't put her on the show.      

478
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,070
              Burger, mid rare. 

479
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:49,339
    Not a lot of places have    
  the local beers and the food. 

480
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,010
  It's got, like, a real cool,  
    like, family vibe to it.    

481
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,544
           Why are we calling it
              "Tiger! Tiger!"?  

482
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:56,013
Are you a "Brady Bunch" fan?    
                      Of course.

483
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,215
    Remember when               
  they lost Tiger?              

484
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,349
                   Right.       

485
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,750
And they do the close-up        
  of the dog house              

486
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,152
and there's the two bowls       
 next to each other             

487
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,553
and they say Tiger! Tiger!      

488
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:06,891
And Bobby runs out on the street
yelling, "Tiger! Tiger!"        

489
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,159
  How much did you have to drink

490
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:11,162
             before you came up 
               with that name?  

491
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,497
    Anytime that I come here,   

492
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,232
     it's just a really fun     
          place to be.          

493
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,234
So, when we come back,          
what are we gonna make?         

494
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,835
    Chicken-shawarma sausage.   

495
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,504
  I love the chicken shawarma.  

496
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,839
  It's all the flavors that you 
  would get off of a rotisserie 

497
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,441
       put into a sausage.      

498
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:24,509
We'll see you in a bit.         

499
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:29,346
                     ♪♪         

500
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,547
    Welcome back.               

501
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,549
"Triple D" hanging out          
    in San Diego                

502
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:32,816
  at Tiger! Tiger!              

503
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,085
        Tiger! Tiger! --        
 they're one of the first places

504
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:39,423
 to really start the craft beer 
farm-to-table here in San Diego.

505
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,026
 FIERI: And Chef Sharon's tying 
       the pub to the grub      

506
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,895
         with new takes         
        on old standards.       

507
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,229
   Two shawarmas!               

508
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,231
          This right here is the
       chicken-shawarma sausage.

509
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,499
                 It's juicy.    

510
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:51,102
   The tzatziki sauce counters  
      the red pepper sauce,     

511
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:53,971
 so it's hot and then it's cool 
and refreshing at the same time.

512
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,439
Chicken shawarma sausage.       

513
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,640
 Chicken shawarma sausage, yeah.
   Say that 10 times in a row.  

514
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,842
Chicken shawarma swa--          
I can't even say it once.       

515
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,646
    We got out chicken thighs   
       and chicken skins.       

516
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:03,180
        We marinade them        
       two different ways.      

517
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,848
        This is gonna be        
      the grilled chicken.      

518
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,652
 Olive oil, lemon juice, yogurt,
    a little salt and pepper.   

519
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:12,590
   It gets marinated overnight  
and then it's gonna get grilled.

520
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:17,395
 The raw chicken gets marinated 
with onions and garlic and salt.

521
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:19,130
This is also 24 hours?          

522
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,933
 24 hours and then they're gonna
   have two different grinds.   

523
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,734
      After that's grilled,     
      that's a bigger grind     

524
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:24,935
           so you get           
     those chunks in there.     

525
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,971
      And this gets ground      
         a little finer.        

526
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,739
The body and the highlights.    
            Exactly.            

527
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,208
 Now we're gonna put            
all these seasonings together   

528
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,610
and this is gonna be            
the base to come together       

529
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,878
     for chicken                
  shawarma sausage?             

530
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,179
     I said it.                 

531
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:38,615
 First, we add the raw chicken, 
      coriander and cumin,      

532
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:43,287
  milk powder, smoked paprika,  
    cinnamon, garlic powder,    

533
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,755
     the sausage phosphate.     

534
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,625
Dr. Sausage Phosphate,          
Dr. Sausage Phosphate.          

535
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:51,162
   Allspice, parsley, cayenne,  
          black pepper,         

536
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:53,497
    onion powder, oregano...    

537
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,700
Cardamom?                       
         And lemon zest.        

538
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:59,437
Now in with the grilled         
   ground thighs.               

539
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,771
              Yeah.             
Got it.                         

540
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,241
      Now we're gonna case      
      our chicken shawarma.     

541
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:04,775
In the oven.                    
             Mm-hmm.            

542
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:07,178
   After they're cooked, we'll  
 finish them on the char grill. 

543
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,645
 Okay, anything else            
    on top of it?               

544
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,047
  The kabob-chopped hot sauce.  

545
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,115
Kabob chop -- and we're         
   gonna make it?               

546
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,316
         Kabob chop, yeah.      
Kabob chop.                     

547
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,517
           Kabob chop.          

548
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,455
    Onion, jalapeño, garlic,    
      some salt, sambal...      

549
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:18,723
  A little vinegar.             

550
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,858
        And I'm gonna zap       
       that a quick second      

551
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,125
  and then I'll add my tomato.  

552
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,394
        Okay.                   

553
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:26,663
    So, we are gonna plate up   
     our toasty brioche bun.    

554
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,065
        Sausage going in.       

555
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,267
          The tzatziki.         

556
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,201
  This is our kabob hot sauce.  

557
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,536
     Homemade potato salad,     

558
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,806
     a little bit of pickle,    
      little bit of onion.      

559
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,876
  That's gorgeous.              

560
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,811
       I mean, that's like      
     real chicken shawarma.     

561
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:45,683
   The yogurt coming through,   
 the char of the chicken thigh, 

562
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,752
  the fattiness you're getting  
         from the skin,         

563
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:50,755
there's a lot of moisture in it,
     it's not overly salty,     

564
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:54,291
it's not too heavy in the spice,
   the tzatziki comes through.  

565
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,759
      That's the real deal      
          right there.          

566
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,295
                  Awesome.      

567
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:58,696
Chicken shawarma sausage.       

568
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,765
      The chicken shawarma,     
        it's really juicy       

569
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,500
  and then the tzatziki on top  
         is so perfect.         

570
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:07,705
   Chili sauce, it accompanies  
  the sweetness of the sausage. 

571
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,173
            Truffle parm fry up.

572
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,908
   There's not a lot of places  
    that do really good food    

573
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,042
      and really good beer.     

574
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,111
               What's better,   
           the beer or the food?

575
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:15,379
   The way the pair together.   

576
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,315
 Whoo, good answer!             

577
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,183
  Mrs. and Mrs. Smart over here.

578
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,784
  Burger and a chicken shawarma.

579
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,986
    A lot of people who come    
     into town stop by here     

580
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,588
        because they hear       
    a lot of real good things   

581
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,723
   about it and rightfully so.  

582
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,925
     It's something special.    

583
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,461
  If you're gonna have a funky  
    name like Tiger! Tiger!,    

584
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:33,130
         the food better        
        speak in volumes,       

585
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:34,665
       and it really does.      
                        Awesome.

586
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,201
             Legit.             

587
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:39,603
     So, that's it for this     
   road trip, but don't worry!  

588
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,673
    We got plenty more joints   
 to find all over this country! 

589
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,542
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time

00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:47,078
 on "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives"!

591
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,946
               My first horse   
         I had was named Jasper.

592
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:50,281
And I have another nickname,    
but I'm not telling you         

593
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:51,615
what that is.                   
             Oh, I want to know.

594
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,351
My nickname's Vicki.            
     I'm not gonna tell anybody.

595
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:55,619
Who here knows that Jasper's    
other name is Vicki?            

596
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,888
Who now knows that Jasper's     
other name is Vicki?            

597
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,557
 SINGH: I knew I shouldn't have 
         told you that.
