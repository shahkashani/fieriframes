 with some white wine.

331
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,583

                 Thai food.     

332
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:55,186
  So local Hawaiian

     stuffed chicken wings.     

335
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,459
  The chicken is really moist,  
    perfect texture contrast.   

336
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:04,996
 It's stuffed with pork, shrimp,
   and vegetables and noodles.  

337
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,798
  What culture makes            
a stuffed chicken wing?         

338

Stuff the chicken wing?         
                           Yeah.

340
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:10,935
        So, we're going to start
        by making the stuffing. 

341
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,003
             Start with the oil.

342
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,271
        Okay.                   
    Ground pork.                

343
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,006
  And this is a dish

344
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,474

345
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,876
        Now we're going to add  
      the shrimp and the garlic.

346

                Brown sugar.    

348
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,282
                Thai people     
           like sugar and spice,

349
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:27,151
                  so we add     
              the black pepper. 

350
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,755
   Oyster sauce and fish sauce, 
   commonly known as Thai vodka.

Oh,<i> I</i> love fish sauce.          

353
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,095
Oh, yeah.                       

354
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,698
I'll have a rubber boat         
  burrito of that.              
                        Yeah.   

355
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,101
          We're going to mix    
      the pork with the cabbage,

356
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:45,236
       carrot, and rice noodles.

357

       Okay.                    

358
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,306
           We're going to debone
               our wing now.    

359
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,309
And that's it. Just boned and   
now you're going to stuff it.   

360
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,377
              We will steam it. 

361
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,979
  So it gets cooked             
all the way through.            

362
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,115
           All right.           
So, we've got our chicken wings.

363
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,383
Now we're going to dredge       
   it in the AP flour,          

364
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:02,720

543

544
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:19,030

       And then...              
you get that little snap        

546
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:24,501
   from this acid               
 of the sauerkraut.             

547
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,837
    That's one of               
the best vegan dishes           

548
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:28,239
I've ever had on "Triple D."    
                            Wow.

549
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:29,774
  Prime time, bro.              
                 Thank you, man.

550
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,042
I mean, prime time.             
                   Thank you.   

551
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:32,977
            GITTENS:            
    Vegan chili dog -- ready.   

552
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:35,646
  I like it because it doesn't  
    <i> taste</i> like a vegan dog.    

553
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,581
One of my favorite chefs,       
      Mark Tadros,              

554
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,484
  he and his family             
   own a date farm              

555
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,386
       and make hundreds        
of thousands of pounds of dates 

556
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,054
   that they ship               
 all over the world.            

557
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,190
So, what do you think?          
             I think it's great.
    I want to take another bite.

558
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:49,193
Sauerkraut puts it over the top.
     Chili's nice and spicy.    

559
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,794
      WOMAN: Frankinbun is      
      a fun place to stop.      

560
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,065
   It's casual. It's eclectic.  
         It's colorful.         

561
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:55,332
  When you walk in,             

562
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:58,269
    you're going to see         
this really funky wallpaper     

563
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,870
   that you happen              
 to also be wearing.            

564
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:00,938
                 That's our     
             little hot dog guy.

565
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,539
A design your wife drew?        
                        Yep.    

566
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,341
    FIERI: And the creativity   
          doesn't stop          

567
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,277
        with his wardrobe       
       and wall coverings.      

568
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,811
   WOMAN: Chicken and waffles   
           on a stick.          

569
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:09,480
 Completely took me by surprise.

570
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,081
   One of my favorite dishes.   

571
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,617
             Chicken waffle dog.
             This is our thing. 

572
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:13,884
        Okay.                   
            We make our own mix.

573
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,021
            Flour, cornstarch,  
            baking soda,        

574
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,290
            baking powder,      
            sugar, salt.        

575
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:20,290
       Got it.                  

576
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,160
               Now we're going  
             to do the wet mix. 

577
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:23,961
                Milk, oil...    

578
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,496
                   egg --       
              just the yolk --  

579
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,698
                and vanilla.    

580
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,901
   He does things very          
doctor-like, doesn't he?        

581
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,236
                 Wet to dry.    
Yes, we will, Doctor.           

582
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,172
                 Now we whip    
               the egg white.   

583
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:36,240
     All right,                 
so the whites go in.            
                            Yep.

584
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,708
 What's the chicken             
that's going in this?           

585
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,443
         Bavarian chicken apple.

586
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,045
             It's like a little 
             breakfast sausage. 

587
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,446
    Look at those               
   little buddies.              

588
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,182
       Throw them in the batter.

589
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,184
         The waffle machine is  
      in the shape of a hot dog.

590
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,718
Oh, I got to see this.          

591
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,587
                  I hit it      
             with a lot of oil. 

592
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,255
            Add a little batter.

593
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,523
              Two to an order.  

594
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:56,660
           Down, spin, 4 minutes
            on the time clock.  

595
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,062
    All right.                  
   Four minutes.                
                   There you go.

596
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,663
         [ Bell dings ]         
Are we ready?                   
                There she blows.

597
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,000
    Whoa!                       
            And then we serve it
          with real maple syrup.

598
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:07,004
  Dude, that's way more         
than chicken and waffles.       

599
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,139
 The batter's great.            

600
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,007
 The maple syrup is             
 a nice little give.            

601
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,942
Yeah, this is stupid.           

602
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:15,812
  That is an extra              
  hour at the gym.              

603
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:18,582
   Can't say enough about it.   
 I would order it over and over.

604
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:21,886
Mika, I have known since he was 
a baby, grew up in Santa Rosa,  

605
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,155
and now he's going to college   
   down here in the area.       

606
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:25,623
What do you think?              
              I actually really 
                  liked it.     

607
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:26,757
          It all works together.

608
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,492
         And, like, super sweet,
            but really good.    

609
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:29,694
     WOMAN: If you're coming    
        to Palm Springs,        

610
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,295
      you should definitely     
      check out Frankinbun.     

611
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,896
The effort and the time         
    and the energy              

612
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,032
and the enthusiasm and the fact 
   that you love it so much     

613
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,635
and you wear a hot dog shirt,   
   that all works for me.       

614
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,203
It's really legit.              
            Glad you enjoyed it.

615
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:42,105
What a fun joint, man.          
              Thank you so much.

616
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:44,374
    That's it for this week,    
      but don't you worry.      

617
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,044
 I'll be looking for more joints
     all over this country.     

618
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,181
    I'll see you next week on   
  "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."  

619
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:53,050
          We whip the egg white.

620
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,985
      By hand?!                 
                       Yeah.    

621
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:57,188
     I got to go                
  check on my car.              
                      All right.

622
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,123
      Hey, kid!                 
   Get off my car!
