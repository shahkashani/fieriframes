 Hey, everybody, I'm Guy Fieri, 
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,671
 looking for America's greatest 
       diners, drive-ins,       

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,206
           and dives!           

4
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:09,475
          This trip...          
      Let the games begin.      

5
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:12,277
   ...we're taking a big bite   
     out of the Big Easy...     

6
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,812
        36 to go, please.

00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:16,081
      ...on this tasty tour     
         of New Orleans.        

8
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,816
     This is a show-stopper.    

9
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,551
      We've got prime time      
           po' boys...          

10
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,820
     Bro, that is gangster.     

11
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,288
     ...seafood with a spin.    

12
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,690
 Boom, there it is.             

13
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,159
   ...and the bomb butcher...   
       That's outstanding.      

14
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,762
      ...putting a twisted      
     take on local flavors.     

15
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:31,697
Let's make our ticket           
   to Flavortown,               

16
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,298
because we're going to get      
kicked out of New Orleans,      

17
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,766
  that's for sure.              

18
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:38,770
     That's all right here,

        So, I'm here for        
        a special edition       

22
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:52,985

23
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:55,320
 Now, typically, in an episode, 
  we'll go to different cities, 

24
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:57,189
 different states, and sometimes
      different countries.      

25
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:59,925
      But no, this episode      
   is all about the great city  

26
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:01,559
         of New Orleans.        
              Why?              

27
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,328
   Because if I have one more   
    friend say, "Hey, listen.   

28
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,063
    I'm going to New Orleans,   
        where do I eat?"        

29
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,465
   Well, this is your episode.  

30
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,133
     So, to kick things off,    
      we're here in an area     

31
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:10,468
        known as Mid-City       
      to check out a joint      

32
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,405
    where two chefs have come   
  together to form a restaurant 

33
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,006
  where they're -- let's see -  
     they're butchering it,     

34
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,808
       they're brining it,      
      they're stuffing it,      

35
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,544
       they're smoking it,      
     and they're serving it.    

36
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:21,679
     This is Piece of Meat.

  a butcher shop...

00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,034

        -...smoke shop...       

48
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,169
              Yeah.             
             Mm-hmm.            

49
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,237

51
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:48,506
        ...a wholesaler.        

52
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,709
We basically tried to fit as    
many concepts as we possibly    

53
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,978
     could into                 
a 900 square-foot space.        

54
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,913
      It's like                 
  a big playground.             

55
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:57,249
  WOMAN: Everything has sort of 
       a New Orleans feel,      

56
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:01,320
 but it's mixed together in fun 
ways, like the boudin egg rolls.

57
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:02,788
        Boudin egg rolls.       

58
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,923
       WOMAN #2: Boudin is      
   a sausage stuffed with rice  

59
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,392
         traditional to         
       the Louisiana area.      

60
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,528
    And then, wrap it around    
       pepper jack cheese,      

61
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,929
            and then,           
       fry it with dough.       

62
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,398
One of the most amazing vehicles
      I've seen for boudin.     

63
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,134
Okay, you're going to get       
kicked out of New Orleans.      

64
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,869
So, we're taking this           
 whole hindquarter.             

65
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,004
          SMITH: Yeah.          

66
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,872
 That's like music.             

67
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:25,344
Going whole animal is just about
as cool as it comes.            

68
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:26,745
       It makes it easier,      

69
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,815
     'cause you have all the    
  different cuts that you need. 

70
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,216
     All right.                 
Pork butt's broken down.        

71
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:35,753
   So, the spice mix is salt,   
   black pepper, white pepper,  

72
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:38,423
   a little bit of dry thyme,   
        some pig salt...        

73
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,226
             -Okay.             
-...smoked paprika, and cayenne.

74
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,829
       We put the liver in      
         with the pork.         

75
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,030
   Chicken livers.              

76
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,699
Then, we put jalepeños in there,
            poblanos,           

77
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:50,969
         celery, garlic,        
        and some onions.        

78
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,904
       Add our spice mix.       
             -Okay.             

79
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,440
        You let this sit        
          for 24 hours.         

80
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,175
            -Really?            
 -So it all gets into the pork. 

81
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,310
    Where do you                
  keep everything?              

82
00:02:58,312 --> 00:02:59,444
         Very organized.        

83
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:00,645
     Evidently.                 

84
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,247
           We just add          
      a tiny bit of water,      

85
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,916
 and then we braise it for about
     three and a half hours.    

86
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,985
     -That looks fantastic.     
        -Isn't it lovely?       

87
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,387
      Right into the mixer.     

88
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,522
         Load the rice.         
       -I love white rice.      

89
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:15,060
    Green onions, chicharon,    
add the braising liquid back in.

90
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:18,129
    My favorite recipes are when
you got to eyeball it like this.

91
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,598
All right, chef, let's make     
our ticket to Flavortown,       

92
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
because we're going to get      
kicked out of New Orleans.      

93
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,669
    All right. So, we take --   
The sacred boudin.              

94
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,940
    Yeah. And we take a piece   
     of pepper jack cheese.     

95
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:29,474
      We just roll them up.     

96
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,076
   Straight to the deep fryer.  
   -Right to the health tank.   

97
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,677
            -Exactly.           
          -There we go.         

98
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,812
       So, there they are.      

99
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:36,415
         The abomination        
        on a little tray.       

100
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,683
       You have the nice,       
          melty cheese.         

101
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,952
I want to fill out a time       
capsule for my heart.           

102
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,421
           Yeah, be sure to call
           in the defibrillator.

103
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,622
            Sriracha mayonnaise.

104
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,890
         And there you go, boss.

105
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,826
 I'm surprised, here            
  at Piece of Meat,             

106
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,628
 that you don't sell            
 these as earrings.             

107
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,629
                    Yeah.       

108
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,365
      You know                  
   what that does?              

109
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,701
That wrecks boudin for me       
    from now on.                

110
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,370
                    Yeah.       
              that's the goal.  

111
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:02,907
Because boudin in regular casing
   is like, "Hey."              

112
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,978
        This,                   
in crunchy casing...            

113
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,448
We can really get texture       
     out of it.                 

114
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,183
It's not soggy and wet.         

115
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:14,853
There's just a touch of heat,   
all that fantastic pork flavor. 

116
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,321
You're getting enough           
of the vegetable flavor         

117
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,656
with that green onion           
that's coming through.          

118
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,126
And then, the creaminess        
  of the cheese --              

119
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,794
    thanks a lot!               

120
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:23,861
  That's fantastic.             

121
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,598
            -Awesome.           
     -Uh, 36 to go, please.     

122
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,999
    Boudin egg rolls are up.    

123
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,534
        It's my favorite        
           local dish.          

124
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:32,204
  It's just melt-in-your-mouth  
         deliciousness.         

125
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:33,538
            We've got           
       six more chickens.       

126
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,806
       Smoking over there.      

127
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,541
          You can watch         
     the sausage being made,    

128
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,943
     and it's a really cool     
    kind of open environment.   

129
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,279
       They'll explain it       
             to you.            

130
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:41,613
 They'll tell you where you meat
         is coming from.        

131
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,881
     It's fun to watch them     
       enjoy what they do.      

132
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,617
       FIERI: And it's not      
       their first rodeo,       

133
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,953
 'cause these culinary partners 
          joined forces         

134
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,422
     after they met working     
    at another joint in town.   

135
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:52,291
        We realized that        
        I'm a psychopath,       

136
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:53,692
         and he's really        
         well-balanced,         

137
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,226
           and we work          
      really well together.     

138
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,761
        Huh.                    

139
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,496
      Teamwork,                 
     that's it!                 

140
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,964
    You know they're cooking,   
  you know you're going to get  

141
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,833
           some really          
        spectacular food.       

142
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,835
    So, if it's this good on    
   our first swing of the bat,  

143
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,303
           what are we          
         gonna do next?         

144
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,838
    -We're going to make a --   
       -Hang on, hang on.       

145
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,840
 So, the girl who's blowing out 
         boudin sausage         

146
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,375
            in a way            
        we've never seen.       

147
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,044
When we come back, it's gonna be
      something else great.     

148
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:13,911
        Let me just focus       
         as I eat these.        

149
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:14,846
          Think up what         
       we're cooking next.      

150
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:15,847
                    Okay.       

151
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,084
     I'm a lot less nervous than
    I thought I was going to be.

152
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,285
              You're not nearly 
                   as cool      

153
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,354
           as I thought you were
             going to be, but...

154
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:23,755
Well, that's usually            
what everybody says.            

155
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:24,956
                Just kidding.   
               You're lovely.   

156
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,758
"Wow. What a dumpling           
    that guy is."               

157
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,963
So, we're hanging out           
in New Orleans at Piece of Meat.

158
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:34,366
     I come to Piece of Meat    
 because it's the local butcher.

159
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:36,034
        I'm gonna de-bone       
            a couple.           

160
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,103
              -Ooh.             
           -Mm, fancy.          

161
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:39,971
    We come here, sometimes,    
           for lunch.           

162
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,240
     I'll have the sandwich.    
      -Bologna sandwich up.     

163
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,909
      The bologna sandwich      
           is famous.           

164
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:46,578
 It's definitely an old classic 
     with a new twist on it.    

165
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,448
All right, we're making bologna,
   and we use the pork shoulder.

166
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,485
           The lean meat in here
      is what we dice and brine.

167
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:54,853
        Okay.                   

168
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,387
          And the rest of it has
   the appropriate amount of fat

169
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,990
    for the grind that we use to
 make the farce for the sausage.

170
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,792
         -For the farce?        
        -Yeah, the grind        
        for the sausage.        

171
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,060
    The grind for               
 the sausage. Okay.             

172
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,662
                May the farce   
                be with you.    

173
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,399
  So, we're basically gonna dice
             all this lean meat.

174
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:09,066
This is going to have           
  funkin' nuggets?              

175
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,269
             -Yeah.             
   -Big pieces of brined meat.  

176
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:14,072
It's gonna stud the inside      
of this rustic bologna.         

177
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,875
                         Yeah.  
 My mouth is starting to water. 

178
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,077
           So, we make the brine
               with molasses.   

179
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,144
             -Salt?             
             -Yeah.             

180
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,680
          -Brown sugar?         
           -Nailed it.          

181
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:24,015
          -White sugar.         
   -And a little curing salt.   

182
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,082
                 Hot water.     

183
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,017
   How long are we              
  gonna brine this?             

184
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,486
          -Three hours.         
            -Next up?           

185
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:30,688
 Our spice mix starts with salt,
                white pepper,   

186
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,423
       we got coriander...      
             -Okay.             

187
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,825
         ...pink salt yet again,

188
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:38,096
   ginger, mace, mustard powder,
                and dextrose.   

189
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,632
Now we have the ground farce    
  into the mixture.             

190
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,567
           We add the lean meat,
         and then our spice mix,

191
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,836
    and then we mix it for about
           two or three minutes.

192
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:45,904
          And then, we stuff it.

193

197

  pieces, the sausage around it.

  that people love,             

224
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,839

    really well,                

225
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,042

 it could have been             

226

 That's outstanding.            

228

   of the molasses

       every time we come.

         you never saw.         

282
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:04,970
  The volcano is basically like 
an upside-down Asian taco salad.

283

 Oh, you hear about             
  those every day.              

284
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,642
   First, we're going to make   
    the blackening seasoning.   

285
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,110
      I've got some paprika     
          right here...         

286
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,311
  Some pap-a-rika.              

287
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:16,114
        ...black pepper,        
    sea salt, parsley flakes,   

288
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,583
        granulated onion,       
       granulated garlic,       

289
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,118
            and then,           
     the Italian seasoning.     

290
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,387
   Okay. So, now,               
we have the fresh Ahi.          

291
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,122
             Right.             
         This is local.         

292
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,257
So, if you can't get it fresh,  
you just won't be serving it?   

293
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,393
     -That's exactly right.     
       -The best attitude.      

294
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:29,927
We'll sear this off.            
     Next step?                 

295
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,063
                Spicy mayo --   
       I call it "dragon sauce,"

296
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,498
                just to have    
                a cool name.    

297
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,800
       -All it is is mayo.      
         -And sriracha.         

298
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,802
      I like to add a little bit
               of water to it   

299
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,871
           because when I put it
         in the squeeze bottles,

300
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,139
                I can, like,    
                draw with it.   

301
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,607
I don't speak Cajun.            

302
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,008
 That's how you say             
"draw with it" in Cajun?        

303
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,209
         -Draw with it!         
             -Next?             

304
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,811
        -The crab salad.        
             -Okay.             

305
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,881
   I'm taking this shredded kani
   that they use in sushi rolls.

306
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,415
So, this is pollock.            

307
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,686
      Take some of this sauce --
The Cajun measuring system.     

308
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,287
                   Right?       

309
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,756
   All right, so, I'm gonna show
   you how to make this volcano.

310
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,423
  I am on the edge              
     of my seat.                

311
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,958
          -Here we go.          
           -Gorgeous!           

312
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,761
               Fillet the tuna  
                around here,    

313
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:05,429
              avocados, lettuce 
            right in the middle.

314
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,765
               Put the shrimp   
                  on there,     

315
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:11,369
    the spicy mayo that we made,
            eel sauce, sriracha.

316
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,437
     I'm dizzy.                 

317
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:15,173
            Take the taco shell,
            turn it upside down.

318
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,575
               Put some of the  
         snow crab salad on top,

319
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:21,712
          spicy mayo, eel sauce,
     a little bit more sriracha.

320
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,248
       And then, I finish it off
             with sesame seeds. 

321
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,918
         So, that right there is
         the -- oops -- volcano.

322
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,320
See, it just erupted.           

323
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,456
    Interesting.                
 Do you jump on it?             

324
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,923
             -Yeah.             
     -Hit it with an elbow.     

325
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,060
             I mean, you've just
              got to go at it.  

326
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,528
 I was able to build            
a bite there, folks.            

327
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,530
       Right. So, you got, like,
     a little nacho right there.

328
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,266
    I don't care                
what you do with it,            

329
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:43,601
 when you serve tuna            
    that fresh --               

330
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,670
I mean, that's legit.           
That's really legit.            

331
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:48,873
I'm not a huge sauce guy, but I 
think this is a show-stopper.   

332
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,742
I mean, people see this come    
out, they're going to go, "Wow."

333
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,143
            It's like an awesome
                little salad.   

334
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,879
         And it looks cool, too.

335
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,615
      Can I go?                 
             Go for it, dude.   

336
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:00,351
 All right. Walking in the door,
        I got a volcano.        

337
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:03,220
      Jason's just sort of      
  pushed the creative envelope. 

338
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,756
  WOMAN: Delicious.             

339
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:07,024
And you can feel like you're    
eating something special.       

340
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,427
             When I started off,
   it was like a seafood market,

341
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:10,962
             so I got all these 
              different awesome 

342
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,698
              connections with  
              crabs and shrimp. 

343
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,901
             FIERI:             
  And he's calling on them all  
to build this seafood sculpture.

344
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,503
      I have a totem pole.      

345
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:21,706
      All of my New Orleans     
favorites wrapped into one dish.

346
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,041
    It's fresh seafood layer    
     upon layer upon layer.     

347
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:28,379
 It looks like a totem pole with
  a crab in the middle of there.

348
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,447
You have got a big imagination, 
     my friend.                 

349
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,651
All right. I'm going to show you
 how to make the crab stuffing. 

350
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:34,853
       Hit it.                  

351
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:37,455
         Butter, celery,        
    garlic, onions, peppers,    

352
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,991
         lump crab meat         
 fresh out of Lake Ponchartrain,

353
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,325
         the claw meat.         

354
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,729
And this is the stuffing that   
goes inside of the totem pole?  

355
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:45,796
             -Right.            
            -Next in?           

356
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:46,731
                I love dust.    

357
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,399
       Crawfish boil, crab boil.

358
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,668
        The blackening seasoning
           that we made earlier.

359
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,470
               Gumbo fillet --  
             a little sassafras.

360
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:53,871
      Grab them                 
  sassafras leaves.             

361
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,005
    Little bit of               
   the love dust.               

362
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,808
     You name these things?     
          -Absolutely.          

363
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,543
           Blackening seasoning,
             water, lemon juice,

364
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,545
       bread crumbs, and then --
    boom, there's your stuffing.

365
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,080
 Boom, there it is.             

366
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,749
         Now, we're going to get
           some soft-shell crabs

367
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,083
                  ready for     
               the totem pole.  

368
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,752
   And I'm a huge               
soft-shell crab fan.            

369
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,087
When you get a chance           
  to come down here             

370
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,156
and try true soft-shell crab    
done the right way --           

371
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,891
    game changer.               
   Tons of flavor.              

372
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,827
             Then, it goes into 
               the buttermilk.  

373
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,561
                  And then,     
             into our fish fry. 

374
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:18,963
                  And then,     
                into the oil.   

375
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,565
            Eggplant.           
           -Beautiful.          

376
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,033
     Let me see                 
   the totem pole.              

377
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,968
       Here's that crab stuffing
             that we just made. 

378
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,104
             Put a piece of this
        fried eggplant on there.

379
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,505
             More crab stuffing.

380
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,440
        -And this is hot?       
          -Absolutely.          

381
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,242
          Got some more of that.

382
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,645
            And then, here comes
           your soft-shell crab.

383
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,381
             More crab stuffing,
               more eggplant.   

384
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,815
          This is a cream sauce,

385
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:42,387
  And then, hold it all together
         with this shrimp kebab.

386
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,855
             More sauce on that.

387
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,323
              And then, we need 
           some Parmesan cheese.

388
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,059
        -Of course we do.       
 -Put a little greens on there. 

389
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,660

I did not want to like          
 the crab stuffing,             

395

396

And to me, it was just          
     a crab cake                

397
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,475

texture on the outside.         

398
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:05,944
But this, right here,           
   works perfect.               

399
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,879
You get this smooth,

400
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:10,014

 of the eggplant --             

401
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,749

   of eggplant --               

402
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:15,219
and then, you get the gravy.    
Then, you get that money bite.

That's like a roadside

440
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,001
    I always take them here,    

441
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,736
      'cause it's the best      
      New Orleans cuisine.      

442
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,872
         Stuffed artichoke balls
            with crawfish sauce.

443
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:43,674
      I came here one time,     
  and I was completely hooked.  

444
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,610
     FIERI: But at one point    
        for Justin Pitard       

445
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,078
     and his wife, Christy,     

446
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,881
    the very idea of opening    
this joint was, well, laughable.

447
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,216
        Now, how did you        
        two end up here?        

448
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,484
                 Kind of as     
              a practical joke. 

449
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:54,752
             She said she wanted
           to open a restaurant.

450
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,487
 A practical joke is            
a restaurant opening?           

451
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,022
                   I was a      
              property manager, 

452
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:00,024
             and this was one of
       the properties I managed.

453
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,759
        It was destroyed.       
  Nothing in there?             

454
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,094
            Unh-unh.            
           It was bad.          

455
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,628
          I told her that it was
           her "new restaurant."

456
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,230
            She called my bluff.

457
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:09,100
             FIERI:             
   And they turned that prank   
  into a seriously funky joint. 

458
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:13,570
  You go into their variations  
 on the basic New Orleans menu, 

459
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,307
        like your oysters       
      Rockefeller po' boy.      

460
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,709
       Oysters Rockefeller      
            po' boy.            

461
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:19,577
          This po' boy          
          is delicious.         

462
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:23,047
      They fry the oysters,     
  and they top it with a creamy 

463
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,982
   Parmesan and spinach sauce.  

464
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,918
      It's definitely like      
        a mother's touch.       

465
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,185
 What are we making?            

466
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,720
        PITARD: We're making our
      oysters Rockefeller sauce.

467
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:30,921
    -All right. Let's see it.   
           -All right.          

468
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,857
          Butter goes in, onion,
          garlic, and is liquor.

469
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,526
We take shots of it,            
or do we put it in the pan?     

470
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:36,794
             We can take shots. 

471
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:37,861
   Yeah, 90 proof,              
that's my kind of --            

472
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:38,929
               Never opposed.   

473
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,064
Little flame on that,           
     I imagine.                 

474
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,331
                  Yes, sir.     

475
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,134
             Some half and half,
              granulated onion, 

476
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,803
granulated garlic, white pepper,
              and ground thyme. 

477
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:46,737
             A little hot sauce.

478
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,138
             -Okay.             
        -Frozen spinach.        

479
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,606
   Now, people say              
"Why frozen spinach?"           

480
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,410
It would take that much         
fresh spinach to make that work.

481
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,212
     I don't even have the space
          for that much spinach.

482
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,280
You don't have the spinach      
for that much space?            

483
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:57,749
              Enough space for  
             that much spinach. 

484
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,150
Enough spinach for that         
 much space, right.             

485
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,417
           Let's put the spinach
                  in there.     

486
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,819
He doesn't even have enough     
   spinach space.               

487
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,154
          We'll do the Parmesan,
          add some bread crumbs.

488
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,690
           Oh, I'm going to need
            to add a little more
          half and half to this.

489
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,559
Well, I'm gonna add a little    
of this to my mouth.            

490
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:09,827
 That's really good.            
     All right.                 

491
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,361
               So, we're gonna  
              make our dredge.  

492
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,496
       Got it.                  

493
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,965
             Yellow corn flour, 
               white AP flour,  

494
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:15,633
                lemon pepper,   
              creole seasoning. 

495
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,034
     All right.                 
        Next?                   

496
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,769
            We're going to bread
            and fry our oysters.

497
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,571
Fry them just till you get      
a crisp, nice and tender inside?

498
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,174
             Yep. Garlic butter 
         the bread for toasting.

499
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:26,511
            We got some oysters,
 some of that Rockefeller sauce,

500
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:28,379
             a little Parmesan, 
               and she's done.  

501
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,782
        Mmm.                    

502
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,584
Bro, that is gangster.          

503
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:34,785
     Oysters are                
  cooked correctly.             

504
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,320
Dredge is really nice,          
 good crunch to it,             

505
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:39,257
The Rockefeller sauce           
     is spot-on.                

506
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,458
        Mmm.                    

507
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,860
The crust of the bread          
just holds it together --       

508
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,529
    just becomes                
      the foil.                 

509
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,531
If oyster Rockefeller is going  
to be made into a po' boy,      

510
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:47,465
it better be made like this.    

511
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,999
Dude, this is on point.         

512
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,803
            -Awesome.           
  -Oysters Rockefeller po' boy. 

513
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:53,137
     The sandwich is fresh.     

514
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:56,674
   The sauce on top is creamy,  
      and has great flavor.     

515
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,409
       -So, have you ever       
         had an oyster?         
              -No.              

516
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,877
             If you're gonna try
                 an oyster,     

517
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,212
               this is the one  
             you've got to try. 

518
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:02,680
  I'll try a tiny,              
 little piece of it.            

519
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,082
 This is so outside             
  of my wheelhouse.             

520
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,951
       We're breaking boundaries
             here on "Triple D."

521
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:09,287
   It's crunchy. It's delicious.
          Great depth of flavor.

522
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,487
Oh, that's terrific.            

523
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,689
         Seafood gumbo!         

524
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,024
  Where do you guys             
get your seafood from?          

525
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:14,825
        PITARD: From a multitude
         of different locations.

526
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,360
   That's the name              
    of the place?               

527
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:19,497
           We'll get our catfish
 and alligator from one place --

528
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:20,631
    [ Whistles ]                

529
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,033
 Time out. You guys             
 do enough alligator            

530
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:24,302
that you have a specific        
 alligator purveyor?            

531
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,170
              -Yep.             
  -You deep-fry the alligator?  

532
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,972
              -Yep.             
    -What don't we deep-fry?    

533
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:32,509
   Salad?                       
   No. We deep-fry potato salad.

534
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:36,314
     The fried potato salad     
is like a baked potato balled up

535
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,116
         and deep-fried,        
         with delicious,        

536
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:40,050
      homemade horseradish      
          cream sauce.          

537
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,785
If I didn't have enough         
fried gator in my diet,         

538
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,321
  I'm going to have             
 fried potato salad.            
All right. Let me see it.       

539
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,389
            We'll put our creole
 seasoning in, roasted potatoes.

540
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:46,857
    So, those are               
  gonna boil down.              

541
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:47,859
               Yep, And then,   
              we'll cool them.  

542
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:49,927
         Add some chopped bacon,
                  cheddar,      

543
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,196
    diced pickles, diced onions,
               bell pepper...   

544
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,864
Well, I like that your          
dragging the potato salad       

545
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,999
 through the garden.            

546
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,601
         ...celery, green onion,
             some sour cream... 

547
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,003
       -You want this egg?      
             -Sure.             

548
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,338
                 Hot sauce.     

549
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,805
      We're mashing it up.      
             -Okay.             

550
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,141
 We'll add some creole seasoning
            to the bread crumbs.

551
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,477
  See the egg wash              
that I diligently did.          

552
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,611
             Thank you for that.

553
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,112
   If tater salad               
 wasn't good enough,            

554
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,280
     we're gonna                
   fry it for you.              

555
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,483
Old shoe, bring it down.        
We'll fry it for you.           

556
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,485
We fried Toby Keith's           
    guitar here.                

557
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,553
   Oh, whoa, whoa!              

558
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,354
What did you just do            
 to my fried potato?            

559
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,290
     If you put it in the fryer,
        and you don't have that,

560
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:20,491
                it won't heat   
            all the way through.

561
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,092
           -All right.          
    -Horseradish cream sauce.   

562
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,628
              So, we've got our 
             fried potato salad.

563
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,963
         I'm gonna make a little
     signature "A" right on top.

564
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,164
       Oh, hi,                  
   cake decorator.              

565
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,233
           Green onion, a little
             crushed red pepper.

566
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:30,635
    Not bad with                
the cake decorating.            

567
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:31,702
              Yeah, I've gotten 
             pretty good at it. 

568
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,907
That exceeded my expectations   
   by about 100%.               

569
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,242
                  Awesome.      

570
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:39,643
You don't have big chunks       
     of potato,                 

571
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,979
so you have a nice creaminess   
all the way through it.         

572
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,448
The kicker is the warm,         
   crunchy veg --               

573
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,385
the celery and the onion        
and the bell pepper.            

574
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:49,587
Right amount of binder,         
right amount of breading.       

575
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,522
Not heavy, not oily.            

576
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,257
And then, rocking it with a     
bunch of horseradish in there.  

577
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,325
                  Oh, yeah.     

578
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,527
But it's supporting it,         
 because you've got             

579
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,396
a lot of sweet coming           
through, here, from the fry.    

580
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:01,933
 I officially, 100%,            
am ripping that off.            

581
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:03,801
        I don't know what to say
              about that, Guy.  

582
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:04,868
       You say                  
"Thank you very much."          

583
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,804
                 Thank you.     

584
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:07,805
       Fried potato salad.      

585
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,407
       Absolutely perfect.      

586
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:13,143
 MAN: It's cheesy. It's crunchy.
    it has this zesty sauce,    

587
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,479
           almost like          
        a thousand island       

588
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:20,484
         with a 10,000%         
           kick to it.          

589
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,220
           Muffuletta egg rolls,
                   please.      

590
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,154
      Avery's just kind of      
         switches it up,        

591
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,557
          and adds some         
          extra flavor.         

592
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,226
       The best restaurant      
       I've ever eaten at.      

593
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:30,160
 Good job, brother.             
Watch out for this guy.         

594
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:33,230
  Your waistband's              
   gonna increase.              

595
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,498
         So, that's what        
      I'm talking about --      

596
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,700
       oysters Rockefeller      
            po' boy,            

597
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,370
    deep fried potato salad.    
     Does it get any better?    

598
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:40,838
             Listen.            
    That's it for this trip.    

599
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,106
      But don't you worry,      

600
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,774
      there's funky joints      
     all over this country.     

601
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,177
     I'll be looking for you    
    next time on "Triple D."    

602
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:47,778
      -What happened there?     
     -I've never even had --    
           well, I --           

603
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,181
 -You've never even had a what? 
            -Avocado.           

604
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,185
           Did you see the look?
