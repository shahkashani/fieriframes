stuffed cabbage I've ever had.  

232
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,932
It's probably one of            
  the most intense              

233
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:51,536
 and most developed             
stuffed cabbage I've ever had.  

234
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,005
The three meats steaming        
in the vegetable stock,         

235
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,141
   the two layers               
of the tomato sauce,            

236
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,475
the little kiss of the dill.    

237
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,477
It's all just tying together.   

238
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,946
 I've made a lot of             
  stuffed cabbage,              

239
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:03,615
mine never tastes this good.    

240
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:06,350
Listen, you can hear my cousins.
They're on their way.           

241
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,153
Get some golumpkis ready.       

242
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,888
           The cabbage          
      is cooked perfectly.      

243
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,722
      It almost tastes like     
     it's a meatball inside.    

244
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,491
     And the sauce, it's got    
       a creaminess to it       

245
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,892
       that's to die for.       

246
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,028
        Just a little bit better
           than what I could do.

247
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,697
    Chocolate ganache pierogi   

248
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,565
     and a kielbasa platter     
            with rye.           

249
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,301
      They put so much love     
  into the food that they make. 

250
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,637
      Reminds you of eating     
        with your family.       

251
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,171
       It's just delicious      
       every single time.       

252
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,174
This is what people want to see.
They want the culture.          

253
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:32,643
They want the heritage.         
Fantastic is an understatement. 

254
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,979
Mom, you got to be proud.       

255
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,517
       Up next, a passport      
 to Peru in Hollywood, Florida. 

256
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,851
It's not just great food.       

257
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,119
It's Peruvian pride.            

258
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,787
  From stand out sandwiches...  

259
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,256
You want to eat more,           
you want to eat the other half. 

260
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,992
  ...to a bowl full of flavor.  

261
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:48,393
This is my secret recipe.       
  So don't show it.             

262
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,129
     I'm not gonna tell anybody.
        Shh, everybody be quiet.
Thank you.

264
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,503
    So I'm here in Hollywood,   
            Florida,            

265
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:02,173
        not too long ago        
   in this same downtown area,  

266
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:05,443
       I went to Krakatoa,      
a funky little Indonesian place,

267
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,712
    serving up a type of food   
  that people have heard about, 

268
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,246
      but probably haven't      
        tried that much.        

269
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,649
       So it can't be that      
      I'm at another place      

270
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,384
     with the same situation    
          has happened.         

271
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,320
   I mean, everybody's talked   
      about Peruvian food.      

272
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,587
  Everybody knows lomo saltado. 

273
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,589
        But did you know        
       that Peru is known       

274
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,991
  for their street sandwiches?  

275
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:23,461
          This is J28.          

276
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,462
      Here comes the beef.      

277
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:25,664
     This place is amazing,     

278
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,999
       people that open it      
       obviously show love      

279
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,334
         that they have         
       for their cuisine.       

280
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:30,468
                  Empanada.     

281
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,538
       It's very creative.      
      The food is on point.     

282
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,073
       And it's served up       
           by brothers          

283
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,974
    Javier and Marco Rondon,    

284
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,677
         who are repping        
 the Peruvian taste I know about

285
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,945
         and then some.         

286
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,880
    When I think                
about Peruvian food,            

287
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,616
 I don't think about            
   sandwich shops.              

288
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,351
          In Peru, sandwiches is
                very popular.   

289
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:47,885
  Like you guys do hamburgers.  
             -Right.            

290
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,087
             You do sandwiches. 

291
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,489
   If I come here,              
I get the same thing            

292
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:52,957
       if I went to Peru.       
       -Pretty much, yeah.      

293
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,827
So if I look for a while,       
I'll be kind of "peru-sing"     

294
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,162
            the menu.           
          -Definitely.          

295
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,565
"Peru-sing" the menu.           

296
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:03,368
I'll be here all week.          
Try the mushroom quinoa bowl.   

297
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,236
   Marco, I got your mushroom   
        quinoa coming up.       

298
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,372
    The quinoa mushroom bowl    
          is fantastic.         

299
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,507
    It's got the right amount   
     of seasoning and flavor    

300
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,376
            in there            
  just to make every bite pop.  

301
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:12,376
                   FIERI:       
             What are we making?

302
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,111
These peppers called            
      amarillo,                 

303
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,382
and I use it as a base          
for the mushroom quinoa bowl.   

304
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:18,850
      It's a little spicy.      
             -Right.            

305
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,651
We need to boil it down         
   three times --               
                           Okay.

306
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,920
so we get the spiciness out.    

307
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,722
         Peel the skin.         
             -Okay.             

308
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,457
And blender, that's it.         

309
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,726
               This is ketchup  
               to the gringos?  
You can say that.               

310
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,527
              Yeah.             
          -I just did.          

311
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,262
            -Exactly.           
           -Thank you.          

312
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:34,065
           This is the sauce for
   the mushroom quinoa stir fry?
Exactly.                        

313
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,667
   Amarillo paste               
the one we just did.            

314
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,402
              Don't mix that up 
             with the baby food.

315
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:38,937
This is my secret recipe.       
  So don't show it.

Quinoa on the bottom.

338
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,516

  we've ever done on "Triple D."

345
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,263
            But I will tell you,
 the flavor is through the roof.

346
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,531
            Dynamite.           
    -I'm so happy right now.    

347
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,799
  Here's your mushroom quinoa.  

348
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,402
         I like how fresh it is,
              how light it is.  

349
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,471
        It gives a good,        
       consistent flavor.       

350
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:47,671
       Every single bite.       

351
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,140
             Yes. Burt Reynolds'
               younger brother  

352
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:52,544
             does live down here
              in South Florida. 

353
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,280
         My buddy Rich and Chad.
        So are you a quinoa fan?

354
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:56,747
Yeah, this is perfect dish      
       for me.                  

355
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,616
    The mushrooms               
are tender and marinated.       

356
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,084
      Amazing.                  

357
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,619
Making the turkey sandwich.     

358
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:04,422
      I stumbled across J28     
    two and a half years ago.   

359
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,224
  Been coming here ever since.  

360
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,426
   A lot of people              
don't understand that J28.      

361
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,829
July 28th is for...yeah.        

362
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,831
  And we opened on July 28 also.

363
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,967
So it's not just great food,    
it's Peruvian pride.            

364
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,301
        I've been to Peru       

365
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,637
       and the sandwiches       
    here are always perfect.    

366
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,105
Here's your chicharrón sandwich.

367
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,507
     The chicharrón sandwich    
        is one of a kind.       

368
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,375
         The pork belly,        
    it's made to perfection.    

369
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:26,243
We're going to make a pork belly
chicharrón sandwich.            
                   That's right.

370
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,046
   We're gonna make the rolls.  
             -Okay.             

371
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,381
      Flour, sugar, salt, yeast.

372
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:33,051
             Mix it a little bit
              as water goes in. 
Okay.                           

373
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:34,986
             After two minutes, 
             we add shortening. 

374
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:37,121
 We'll let this mix             
  how much longer?              
                10 minutes more.

375
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,991
 -And then we'll cut it, proof. 
         -For two hours.        

376
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,059
      -And then we'll bake.     
        -For 20 minutes.        

377
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,061
        Got it. Where are we at?

378
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,063
So this is our fire sauce.      

379
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:48,867
In Peru, it's usually these     
peppers, the rocoto peppers.    
                      I got you.

380
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:51,135
    We took these               
other pepper called limo.       

381
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,204
  This is a spicier             
   than this one,               

382
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:56,207
   but go together              
the combination is really good. 
                    Yeah, I bet.

383
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,410
         -The salt, oil.        
      -And a little water.      

384
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:00,612
                Let's see it.   

385
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,213
So this is the marinade for     
our pork belly sandwich.        

386
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:06,351
Ginger, oregano, five spices,   
brown sugar, salt and pepper.   

387
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:08,018
         -Aji amarillo.         
         -That's right.         

388
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,087
  Aji panca paste.              

389
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,155
                 Aji panca.     

390
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:11,689
    Garlic paste,               
 white wine vinegar,            

391
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,291
     soy sauce.                 

392
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,892
          How long is this gonna
     marinate in the pork belly?
Overnight.                      

393
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,428
        Then we're gonna boil it
      in the marinade and water.

394
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,630
   Drain the water              
   and we fry it.               

395
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,631
           Crispy, slice it, go.

396
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,266
    That's right.               

397
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,301
           All right,           
       let's see it, chef.      

398
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,635
           We have our beautiful
                roseta roll.    

399
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,837
               Listen to this.  

400
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,238
          [ Crunching ]         
                    The crunchy?

401
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,572
 I hear the crunchy.            

402
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,841
    -The mayo, sweet potato.    
             -Okay.             

403
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,443
        The pieces of pork belly
                   on top.      

404
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,979
     Pickled onions, picked with
     a little bit of lime juice.

405
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,447
         Got some cilantro also.

406
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,984
 And the fire sauce.            

407
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,252
                   Cut it.      
           This is our sandwich.
Look at that.                   

408
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,654
I have to smash it down.        

409
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:46,991
I can't get my fat mouth        
around my fat sandwich.         

410
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,793
When I think of chicharrón,     
I think of Mexican chicharrón.  

411
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,995
        The crunchy skin.       
              -Yep.             

412
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,596
 The bread gives me             
    that crunch.                

413
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,999
After that, you get that        
creaminess of the sweet potato, 

414
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,268
the much-needed acid            
    of the onion,               

415
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,137
and the tender juicy pork       

416
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,074
and then the little icing       
on top, that pepper sauce.      

417
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,676
 This is fantastic.             

418
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:05,943
             Thank you so much. 

419
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,811
You want to eat more.           
You want to eat the other half. 

420
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,747
You want to eat the one         
that the person next to you     

421
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,616

      Chicharrón coming up.     

423
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:15,286
        I taste the pork.       
 I definitely taste the onions. 

424
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,487
    All the flavors just pop.   

425
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,089
            The bread           
     has a nice like crunch     

426
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,224
         on the outside,        
  but it's very fluffy inside.  

427
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,893
How many of those sandwiches    
    can you eat?                

428
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:24,162
   -I could probably do three.  
 -Thanks for telling the truth. 

429
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:27,899
 After his three, we take about 
a dozen of these empanadas home.

430
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,835

   as actually going to Peru.

        that I get here.

  missing in Peru, I got to go.

00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,562
    MAN: Wild mushroom pizza,   
           table one.           

460
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:34,431
   There's absolutely nothing   
     like a wood-fired pizza    

461
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,899
         coming straight        
        out of the oven.        

462
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:38,168
    This was the first legit    
     wood-fired pizza place.    

463
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,771
     And so, we were kind of    
         over the moon.         

464
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,105
             FIERI:             
    And that pie biz was born   

465
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:44,175
   when respiratory therapist   
           Casey Absey          

466
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,911
        turned tinkering        
    into a whole new career.    

467
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:48,646
              I was gonna build 
       an old-fashioned barbecue

468
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,381
               in my backyard,  
         made a wood-fired oven.

469
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,383
             And the next year, 
        I built one on a trailer

470
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,052
               and we started   
              doing festivals.  

471
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,387
What makes you different in     
the world of wood-fired pizza?  

472
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:59,256
         I think we have more of
 a Mediterranean spin on things.

473
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,658
               My dad's folks   
             came from Lebanon. 

474
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,726
       But my mom was Norwegian.

475
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:03,861
Lebanese, Norwegian.            

476
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:04,929
               I'm lebowegian.  

477
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,330
    A lebowegian.               

478
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,999
     Got a pep going in hot!    

479
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:12,203
I think you have to judge       
a good pizza by its dough.      
             Dough-n't you know?

480
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,538
   Sorry I had to take the shot.

481
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,141
It's just that perfect level    
   of crispiness,               

482
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,009
but it still stays chewy.       

483
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,411
 -We're gonna make pizza dough. 
           -All right.          

484
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:21,679
              Two cups of salt. 

485
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,614
 Now wait a second,             
 salt before yeast?             
                           Yeah.

486
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,015
                   Water.       

487
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,284
When in North Dakota.           

488
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:28,152
       -One bag of flour.       
          -All purpose.         

489
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,220
       Then I throw my yeast in.

490
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,154
 Are we gonna bloom             
     the yeast?                 

491
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,155
             -Nope.             
             -Okay.             

492
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,423
                Bread flour.    

493
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,025
        -No high gluten?        
             -Nope.             

494
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:35,893
   No double zero?              

495
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,294
             -Nope.             
             -Okay.             

496
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,163
              We're not trying  
               to be Italian.   
Okay, your house.               

497
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,764
   How long is this gonna mix?  
          -20 minutes.          

498
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,301
 And then you'll let            
     this proof?                
         We'll ball it up first.

499
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:44,835
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.   

500
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,304
You're not gonna proof before   
      you ball?                 

501
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:49,039
         Nope, proof in the box,
         24 hours in the cooler.

502
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,240
This is unconventional          
       to 99%                   

503
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,710
 of the pizza joints            
 I've ever gone to.             

504
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,946
     Just lots of experimenting.

505
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:56,780
         Putting apples         
   on the sausage apple pizza.  

506
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,649
     Sausage and apple pizza    
      is literally the one      

507
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,051
       I have every time.       

508
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:02,519
   When it comes to the table,  
      it's a piece of art.      

509
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,256
Sausage apple pizza's           
 a norm around here.            
                Nope, just here.

510
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,191
     All right,                 
what are we on to now?          
                   The béchamel.

511
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,394
     Half a pound butter, flour,
              and make a roux.  

512
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,929
           Then we add the milk,
               garlic powder,   

513
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,730
             parsley, bay leaf, 

514
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,267
           chili flakes, nutmeg,
            and salt and pepper.

515
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,602
Béchamel's done. Next up.       

516
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:20,204
          The sausage,          
      it's all local pork.      

517
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,673
    Salt and pepper, fennel.    
          -A lot of it.         

518
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:27,278
Oregano, sugar, parsley,        
chili flakes, granulated garlic.

519
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,614
          -Mix this up.         
          -Bake it 425.         

520
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:32,416
Let's take a look at this dough.
                It's gentle.    

521
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,818
        Boy, that's got a lot of
     elasticity for bread dough.

522
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,621
Béchamel on it, parmesan.       

523
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:39,557
Our homemade sausage,           
    apples, sage.               

524
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,026
            Goes in.            
   -And that's all she wrote.   

525
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:44,061
           Gorgeous, oh, square.

526
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,763
  Snap pea micros.              

527
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,832
       Yeah, it's your every day
       Lebanese Norwegian pizza.

528
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:51,035
                     ♪♪         

529
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,904
    That is one delicious pizza.

530
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,507
        Great chew to the crust.

531
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,842
             Get a nice crackle 
               on the outside   

532
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:03,247
          with true gluten style
                 flour pull.    

533
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,583
        And this little béchamel
         parmesan cheese program

534
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,651
         works completely right.

535
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,653
              Sausage still has 
               good fat to it.  

536
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:10,988
           A lot of great apple.

537
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,924
     The key at the end, though,
         that fresh herb on top.

538
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,526
         I can just go on and on
          about it. Outstanding.
Thanks, sir.                    

539
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,728
      Sausage apple pizza,      
           table four.          

540
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,130
 There's this sweet combination 

541
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:20,331
        between the sweet       
       of the green apple.      

542
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,467
And then, you also get the salty
         of the sausage.        

543
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:24,001
      It's a perfect crust.     

544
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,669
         It's the reason        
        why we come here.       

545
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,605
       FIERI: I'm impressed with
           the Fargo food scene.

546
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,540
             You have this whole
               we're in Fargo,  

547
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:30,942
       we're gonna do it the way
              we want to do it. 

548
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,076
           The chamber          
      a couple of years ago     

549
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,345
    came out with the motto,    
        North of Normal.        

550
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:36,547
      We kind of just make      
         our own rules.         

551
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,749
 FIERI: And this chef's throwing
   in a little family heritage  

552
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,017
        on top of it all.       

553
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,886
 Mediterranean bison meatballs. 

554
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,754
     Mediterranean meatballs    
        one of my go-tos.       

555
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:44,889
        It's super good.        

556
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:47,024
        With a beautiful        
   little creamy sauce on top,  

557
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,959
     it's a great appetizer.    

558
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,627
             So we're gonna have
           lebowegian meatballs.

559
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,029
 80-20 local bison.             

560
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,699
  Almonds, raisins,             
fresh mint, parsley,            

561
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:59,503
salt, pepper, chili flakes,     
and garlic granules.            

562
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,571
              He's the kind of  
          the granulated garlic.

563
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,039
              Just so you know. 

564
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,708
  -We'll add that to the beef.  
     -Love all that texture.    

565
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,244
  Add a little oil,             
 crack two eggs in.             
                   There you go.

566
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,579
   We're gonna mix              
that up a little bit            

567
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:09,647
and then we'll add the rice.    

568
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,115
           -The what?           
            -Basmati.           

569
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:14,251
                  All right,    
              so ball these out.
Cook it 15 minutes, 425.        

570
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,187
            -Next up?           
        -Tzatziki sauce.        

571
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:17,588
       So we're taking something
            from the Greeks now.

572
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,789
       No, no,                  
this is very Lebanese.          

573
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,457
 -What do the Lebanese call it? 
             -Leben.            

574
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:24,127
So we got some plain yogurt,    
parsley, mint, honey,           

575
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,131
olive oil, lemon juice,         
    salt, pepper.               

576
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:28,599
   Fantastic. What's up next?   

577
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,735
              We got the sauce, 
              do a little oil,  

578
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,670
       sweat the onions, garlic,

579
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,738
               deglaze it with  
             a little red wine, 

580
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,475
               parsley, mint,   
             a little oregano --
Bay leaf.                       

581
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,809
              ...chili peppers. 

582
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,212
       -Interesting sauce.      
   -Salt and pepper, tomatoes.  

583
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:42,613
Let this simmer, what,          
     20 minutes?                

584
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,482
          20 minutes tightens up
            and then we're done.
Okay.                           

585
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:47,017
      So we're gonna plate      
   our Mediterranean meatballs  

586
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,153
     add a little olive oil,    
       get them sizzling,       

587
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,488
    and then we'll add sauce    
        and reheat that.        

588
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,090
We'll plate it up with          
   our pita bread,              

589
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:55,026
tzatziki sauce that we made,    

590
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,962
then we'll garnish it           
     with mint.                 
                       Gorgeous.

591
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:00,464
             I can already feel 
                 the crunch.    

592
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:01,832
              That's fantastic. 

593
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,035
               That meatball,   
       I love the texture in it.

594
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,569
                    Wow.        

595
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,571
          When you get that play
          between that tzatziki,

596
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:11,608
       the fresh herbs, the mint
      singing through, for sure.
Yeah.                           

597
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,579
               This right here  
           has its own identity,

598
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,513
   really should be experienced.

599
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:17,515
              That's dynamite.  

600
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:19,784
    You got the Mediterranean   
        bison meatballs.        

601
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,785
    They're sweet and savory.   

602
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,854
  It's got a little kick to it, 
      but not overpowering.     

603
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,522
   A little package of flavor   

604
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,124
      when you just pop it      
         in your mouth.         

605
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,592
  Pepperoni pizza, table eight. 

606
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,460
  He cares a lot about the food 
          he puts out,          

607
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:31,796
it has a special meaning to him.

608
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:33,197
      FIERI: That's what's great
  about the restaurant business.

609
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,599
  You get to play your own music
             and a lot of people

610
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:35,733
 are showing up for the concert.

611
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,669
                 Well done.     
        I want to buy the album.

612
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,271
          So that's it          
       for this road trip.      

613
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:42,406
        But don't worry,        
    we got plenty more joints   

614
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,808
 to find all over this country. 

615
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,609
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

616
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:49,413
on "Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives."

617
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,349
What is that over there?        
     Is that...                 

618
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:54,351
                What? Where?    

619
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,620
                 [ Laughs ]     

620
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,557
          [ Laughter ]
