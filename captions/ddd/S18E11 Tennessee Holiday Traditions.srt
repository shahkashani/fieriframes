00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,201
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,669
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:07,139
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:08,807
          This trip...          
        How's that feel?        

5
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,676
 ...we're headed to Tennessee...

6
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,511
 Now you're cooking             
      with gas.                 

7
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,681
     ...for some honky-tonk     
       holiday traditions.      

8
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,015
              BOTH:             
        That's important.       

9
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,617
           In the city          
      of Hendersonville...      

10
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,487
     Well, I cleaned up for you.
           This is Sunday best. 

11
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,888
       ...pulled pork done      
          to perfection         

12
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,490
   and a sweet take on ham...   

13
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,759
I don't even really know        
what to say at this point.      

14
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,828
          ...just built         
      for the centerpiece.      

15
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,764
  Was that a growl              
   you just made?               

16
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,566
    And in East Nashville...    

17
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:35,634
                 Just wait.     

18
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:37,703
I can't wait anymore.           

19
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,637
   ...the funky Mexican joint   

20
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,908
         scratch-making         
   a festive masa masterpiece.  

21
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,443
The holiday tamale.             
              Holiday tamales.  

22
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:46,712
       And one traditional      
         seasonal soup.         

23
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:50,049
Every once in a while,          
I get one of those OMG moments. 

24
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:51,382
That just hit a new level.      

25
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,252
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

26
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:56,188
      on "Diners, Drive-Ins     
           and Dives."          

29
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,802
     I'm in the great state     
         of Tennessee --        

30
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:11,002
      one of my favorites.      

31
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,271
              Why?              
   Well, home of Jack Daniels,  

32
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:16,141
       the Grand Ole Opry,      
    and some killer barbecue.   

33
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:19,611
   Now, I'm in Hendersonville,  
 about 10 miles from Nashville, 

34
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:21,813
  on the corner of Center Point 
         and Main Street        

35
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,283
      to check out a joint      
  that's got a ton of character 

36
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:25,683
     and a bunch of stories.    

37
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,386
 This is Center Point Barbecue. 

38
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,359
       Brisket. Corn on the cob.
               Spicy red slaw.  

39
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:35,894
 The best barbecue in the south.

40
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,295
                Pulled pork.    

41
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,164
        This is authentic       
      as you're gonna get.      

42
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,099
 Everybody loves their barbecue.

43
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,368
   FIERI: 'Cause when it comes  
        to smoking meat,        

44
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,436
        owner Robert Duke       
      doesn't mess around.      

45
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,105
 You're the cleanest            
 pit master I know.             

46
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,974
     Well, I cleaned up for you.
        This is my Sunday best. 

47
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:53,111
      And the smell coming      
    from his three smoke pits   

48
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,315
 is like a come-and-get-it bell 
         for the locals.        

49
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:58,984
   Generally, I think you can   
   smell it about a mile away.  

50
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,786
   Just makes your taste buds   
   want to drop by and eat it.  

51
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,190
 FIERI: Whether it's a full rack
  of ribs, smoky beef brisket,  

52
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,259
  or one of Robert's down-home  
       family traditions.       

53
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,593
                Pulled pork.    

54
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,930
  There's no other pulled pork  
around that even compares to it.

55
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:14,065
 This is the entire             
 shoulder together.             

56
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,800
Not gonna mess around.          
      Bone in.                  

57
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,536
              We're gonna make  
               our marinades.   

58
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:20,605
         A gallon of mild sauce.

59
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,608
Two gallons of vinegar.         

60
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,942
Now what are we gonna do?       

61
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:27,079
       We're gonna mop it, and, 
   just like I said, generously.

62
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:30,148
         Let's do a little rub. 
  Do a little crazy pepper here.

63
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,149
    Crazy pepper?               

64
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,884
              Let's love on it  
             just a little bit. 

65
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,419
           A little bit of salt.
                  Not much.     

66
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,221
And that's it? Getting it       
ready for the smoker.           

67
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,222
  What are we gonna             
   smoke it with?               

68
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,823
              Shagbark hickory. 

69
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,358
  Shagbark hickory?             

70
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,960
           We get a lot of smoke
                out of that.    

71
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,028
              BOTH:

77
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,177
               225. That's it.  

78
00:02:58,179 --> 00:02:59,244
    For 18 hours?               

79
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:01,246
                Anything more   
             than that's a sin. 

80
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,714
              We're gonna cook  
                fat side up,    

81
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:05,717

   That is crazy.               

90

00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:27,198
   The pulled pork is some of   
   the best I've had anywhere.  

120
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,602
  It just melts in your mouth.  
       It is really good.       

121
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,604
 This little restaurant's been  
 here since I was a little kid. 

122
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,074
 Some of my first memories here 
           with my dad          

123
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,208
  getting a barbecue sandwich.  

124
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,878
    I remember coming in here   
        as a little girl,       

125
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,813
         and it would be        
      wall-to-wall people.      

126
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,815
             FIERI:             
   Full of friends, neighbors,  

127
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,751
      and...the occasional      
      country music star.       

128
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,154
    Everybody that's on the wall
               has been here,   

129
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,489
        and we've serviced them.

130
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,891
      From the Man in Black     
        to Taylor Swift.        

131
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,761
     And then there's one of    
     my personal favorites.     

132
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,496
    Sleepy LaBeef               
 and the Macaronis.             

133
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:58,997
You don't remember them?        
                     Oh, yes.   

134
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,432
                     Rocking.   
Got that on eight-track.        

135
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,201
     And if I had to guess,     
     I bet when he was here,    

136
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:05,770
       old Sleepy snacked       
   on this Southern staple...   

137
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:06,972
Fried green tomatoes.           

138
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,975
     ...topped with Robert's    
       own yum yum sauce.       

139
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,043
       You eat them here,       
        you'll come back        

140
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,646
         and order them         
      time and time again.      

141
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,447
This is yum yum sauce           
    we're making?               

142
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,649
               Yum yum sauce.   

143
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,784
 We're doing about half a gallon
              Thousand Island.  

144
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,052
                Chili powder.   

145
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,521
      Cayenne.                  

146
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:23,588
    Horseradish.                

147
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,061
  Thousand Island               
  with a big kick.              

148
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,062
              I'm telling you.  

149
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,464
   Next up?                     
                  Flour power.  

150
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:33,465
    Okay. Hit it.               

151
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:34,666
 All-purpose flour?             
                All-purpose.    

152
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,468
                  Cornmeal.     

153
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,070
                 Crazy salt.    

154
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,939
                Black pepper.   

155
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,608
               Center Point's   
          own garlic herb blend.

156
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,410
 Garlic herb blend?             
                         Blend. 

157
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,714
So, this is the typical dredge  
that's gonna go together.       

158
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,683
Big slab of green tomato.       

159
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,919
                  Little wet.   
  Little egg wash.              

160
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,158
And now to the fryer.           

161
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,365
               These are hot.   
                    Okay.       

162
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:07,466
                  Yum yum.      

163
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:14,038
                 Sour cream.    
                 Little bit.    

164
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,309
  We're gonna add a little touch
               of color to it.  

165
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:18,443
                There she is.   

166
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,912
Why are you so reserving        
on the yum yum sauce?           

167
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,048
             Oh, I can give you 
          some more if you like.

168
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,517
         You can always put on, 
         but you can't take off.

169
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,187
        Mmm.                    

170
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:33,124
I like fried green tomatoes     
because of the tang.            

171
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,560
And then the yum yum sauce on it
has got a little spice.         

172
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,330
 When they cool down            
    a little bit                

173
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,433
and they're not burning         
  your tongue off,              

174
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:42,467
that's when they're key.        

175
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,202
Great cornmeal crunch           
       to it.                   

176
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:46,138
Nice fresh green tomato.        

177
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,605
     Delicious.                 

178
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,473
     Good, huh?                 

179
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,274
        [ Both chuckle ]        

180
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,876
   He understands.              

181
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,245
      He speaks                 
   Barbecue-nese.               

182
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,681
        Fried green tomatoes up,
                   please.      

183
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:59,417
  The fried green tomatoes just 
   take you back to the South.  

184
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,819
      No regular tomatoes.      

185
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:03,021
          He'll only eat        
       fried green tomatoes.    
 Really?!                       

186
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,956
 WOMAN: They just have a flavor 
       of their own here.       

187
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,958
      When you taste them,      
  you always come back for me.  

188
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
So, here's the deal --          
   great barbecue,              

189
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:12,097
  tons of history,              
but I got to tell you something.

190
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,567
There's one thing I have heard  
about Center Point Barbecue,    

191
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,437
and it is this sugar-glazed,    
  honey-smoked ham.             

192
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,371
       This is                  
"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives"   

193
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,407
     hanging out                
in Hendersonville, Tennessee.   

194
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,709
This guy is gonna blow it up    
 with a killer ham.             

195
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,878
    We'll see you               
  in a little bit.              

196
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,354
          Welcome back.         
  "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives" 

197
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:39,491
 hanging out for the holidays at
 the Center Point Barbecue joint

198
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:40,692
     here in Hendersonville,    
           Tennessee.           

199
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,694
We are getting ready            
to do a holiday ham             

200
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,362
  like we've never              
    seen before.                

201
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,163
     Is it time?                
             We're ready to dip.

202
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,966
 Bring on the brine.            
                    Let's do it.

203
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,369
               We'll start off  
 with two gallons of water here.

204
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,737
                    Salt.       

205
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,572
                   Sugar.       

206
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,674
Equal parts salt and sugar.     
      Got you.                  

207
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,776
              Cloves. Cinnamon. 

208
00:07:58,778 --> 00:07:59,911
 Cinnamon-amon-amon.            

209
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:01,780
Little pickling spice?          
             Just a little bit. 

210
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:04,516
                  And then      
             white clove honey. 

211
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:06,518
 White clove honey.             
  How do you know?              

212
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,286
          Says it on the bottle.
Okay.                           

213
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:12,324
          We're gonna bring this
                 to a boil.     

214
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,592
Then let it cool down.          

215
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:15,793
         So, our ham trimmed up,
            going in the brine. 

216
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,329
How long are we gonna           
    let it brine?               

217
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,597
       We're gonna go four days.
    Four days                   
it's gonna brine? Nice.         

218
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,466
Does it go to the smoker?       
                Ready to go.    

219
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:24,469
           It's about six hours.
               225. That's it.  

220
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,739
  It's pretty ham.              
      Next up?                  

221
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,741
              Making the glaze. 
                Brown sugar.    

222
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,943
                   Cloves.      
                Black pepper.   

223
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,945
              Sugar. Cinnamon.  

224
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,213
             Mix that together. 

225
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,682
     Get the moisture out of it,
        put it in the shaker,   

226
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,285
             And we're ready to 
             glaze the ham then.
  Okay.                         

227
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,088
                 Ready, Guy?    

228
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,424
  Hang on a second.             

229
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:49,093
        Let's warm this thing up

453
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,236
     It's great Mexican food    
     outside of California.     

454
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,237
    This is the place to go.    

455
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,906
                It really is.   
Really is.                      

456
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,677
   We can't leave               
Mas Tacos Por Favor.            

457
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,445
 No, we cannot leave.           
             Got to make a taco?

458
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,846
  We're gonna take              
   a small break.               

459
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,648
 When we come back,             
we're gonna make a taco         

460
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,017
      in honor                  
of my little sister.            

461
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,652
           We got two quinoa up.

462
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,922
The quinoa and...               
                Sweet potato.   

463
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:11,856
        Taco?                   

464
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:12,923
                    Taco.       

465
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,891
    We'll see you               
  in a little bit.              

466
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,537
    Welcome back.               
Nashville, Tennessee.           

467
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,072
"Triple D" hanging out          

468
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:31,175
  at a killer joint             
called Mas Tacos Por Favor.     

469
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,346
We have had the bomb            
   holiday tamale.              

470
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,214
 Then we had pazolé.            

471
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,950
Not just any pazolé,            
but pazolé magnifico.           

472
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,286
    So, in honor                
of my sister Morgan,            

473
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,555
 who was a big-time             
     vegetarian,                

474
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:47,024
we are going to have            
   a quinoa and...              

475
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:49,360
                   Sweet potato.
...sweet potato taco.           

476
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:50,761
        Okay.                   
   Some habaneros.              

477
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,363
                    Yep.        
      Got to have a little heat.

478
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:54,398
  How's that feel?              

479
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,367
           We're gonna put these
                 in the oven    

480
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,102
  and just really low-roast them

481
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,905
        because we're gonna make
          a spice out of these. 

482
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,373
            These are habaneros.
    Get out.                    

483
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,974
   They're a shell              
   of a habanero.               

484
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,444
        So, I just blend them up
                 real quick.    

485
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,714
            So, we're gonna make
                 the quinoa.    

486
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,715
              Sweet potatoes -- 
       cubed, peeled, and diced.

487
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,251
                  Put that      
          right on top of there.

488
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:14,985
                 Jalapeños.     
      We like it a little spicy.

489
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,987
                 And, 'cause    
        we really like it spicy,

490
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,523
         we'll put those peppers
                  in there.     
 The dust.                      

491
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:20,991
              Folks around here 
            call it the "shake."

492
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,261
  They're addicted to it. We set
    it out for your tacos, too. 

493
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,262
You put that in a shaker jar    
     for people?                
                         Yeah.  

494
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,931
                    Water.      
Beverage sales go up.           

495
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,065
             [ Chuckles ] Yeah. 

496
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,800
              I'm gonna let it  
               come to a boil   

497
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,602
              and let it simmer 
               for 20 minutes.  

498
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,804
               So, we're gonna  
                make a taco.    

499
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,005
            You need a tortilla.

500
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,340
           That's the only thing
           we don't do in-house.

501
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,242
That's a good-looking           
   tortilla.                    
                It's incredible.

502
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,480
        This one's for your sis.

503
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,748
            Quinoa sweet potato.

504
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,151
              We'll put it in.  
                 Fill it up.    

505
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,219
           Fresh shaved cabbage.

506
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,689
       That same tomatillo salsa
                that you like   

507
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,958
             with a little crema
                right on top.   

508
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,229
            And then, of course,
             cilantro and lime. 

509
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:00,398
        Wow.                    

510
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:06,037
That's delicious. Creative.     
    It's hearty.                

511
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,040
The sweetness of the sweet      
potato, texture of the quinoa,  

512
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,374
crunch of the cabbage.          

513
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,642
You get a little bit            
  of that habanero,             

514
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,577
you get a little bit of that    
acid from the tomatillo.        

515
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,113
I had to give up a lot of       
options on the menu to try this 

516
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:18,449
'cause I can't eat everything,  
and it was so worth it.         

517
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,418
                  Bringing      
              the family down?  

518
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:26,257
       Something different      
     and something special.     

519
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,792
      Bursting with flavor.     

520
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:29,526
       I'm eating the rest      
       of this damn thing.      

521
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,462
 I can tell you that right now. 
       It's too damn good.      

522
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:32,863
          [ Laughter ]          

523
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:35,800
    Off the hook.               
This girl's dangerous.          

524
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,602
   Watch yourself               
when you're in Nashville.       

525
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,472
        So, that's it for       
   this Flavortown road trip,   

526
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,674
      but don't you worry.      

527
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:46,010
   There's plenty more joints   
     all over this country!     

528
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,544
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

529
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,847
      on "Diners, Drive-Ins     
           and Dives."
