 BROKE THE TOMATO DOWN SO FAST, 

160
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,442
    SO IT WORKS INTO THE SAUCE, 
   BUT IT'S NOT A TOMATO SAUCE.

232
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,308
             DEPENDS ON WHAT DAY
             OF THE WEEK IT IS. 

233
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,310

              OH, ONCE OR TWICE.
 OKAY, SO THESE ARE DONE.       
DO WE PUT ANYTHING ON 'EM?      

239
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,059
            NO, THEY GO STRAIGHT
             INTO THE PROOF BOX.
FOR TEN MORE MINUTES.           

240

          WE SPRAY THEM WITH    
      A LITTLE WATER, SCORE 'EM.
         AND THEN               
INTO THE 400-DEGREE OVEN.       

242
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,733
   AND THEN WE TURN THE STEAM ON
       FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS.    

243
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,536
           THAT'S WHAT GIVES IT 
            A NICE THICK CRUST  

244
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,671

        BRATWURST PLATE.        
    GET IT EVERY TIME I COME.   

292
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:27,919
   <i> AND THIS GERMAN CLASSIC...</i>  

293
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,321
                   SCHNITZEL UP.
    IT'S A WIENEL SCHNITZER.    
       WEENIE SCHNITZER.        

294
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:32,257
IT'S WEINER SCHNITZEL.          
           DELICIOUS.           

295
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,126
                  SO HOW DO WE  
                 START THIS OFF?
       FIRST OF ALL,            
WE USE OUR OWN BREADCRUMBS.     

296
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:38,063
NORMALLY WE JUST USE            
   THE MILD RYES.               
          YOU DRY THE BREAD OUT.

297
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,465
  AND WE GROUND THEM DOWN       
TO WHERE THEY'RE REAL FINE,     

298
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,201
  AND WE ADD GRANULATED GARLIC, 
    PEPPER AND SEASONED SALT.   

299
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,871
           NOW WE BUST OUT EGGS.
AND CRACK 'EM UP.               

300
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,873
          YOU'RE CRACKIN' ME UP.
AM I?                           

301
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:52,276
          PUT SOME MILK IN THAT?
YEAH, WE'RE GONNA PUT           
A CUP OF MILK IN THAT.          

302
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:55,013
WE'RE GONNA MIX THIS UP.        
        NOW DO WE HAVE ANY FLOUR
            GOING INTO THIS?    

303
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,348
   HOPEFULLY WE'VE DONE         
OUR BREADCRUMBS FINE ENOUGH     

304
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,283
THAT WE CAN SKIP THE FLOUR.     
                    I LIKE THAT.

305
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,286
SO WE CUT OUR OWN PORK LOIN.    

306
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,688
           ABOUT A 2 1/2-OUNCE, 
              3-OUNCE SLICE.    

307
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:07,158
THIS IS FOR OUR SMALL PORTION.  
              OH, YES, BECAUSE  
             I'M A PETITE EATER.

308
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,794
THEN WE TAKE OUR BAGGIE.        
               AND POUND IT OUT.

309
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,966
 SO THEN WE'RE                  
GONNA SOAK THIS.                
                 AND THEN INTO  
                THE BREADCRUMBS,

310
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:18,703
           NOW WHAT ARE WE GONNA
               COOK THIS IN?    
A LITTLE BIT OF OIL             
  ON THE FLATTOP.               

311
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:21,839
  A LITTLE PRESS, FLIP IT,      
BOTH SIDES NICE GOLDEN BROWN.   

312
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,707
                            YEP.
   AND WHAT'S THIS              
GONNA GET SERVED WITH?          

313
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,444
              SAUERKRAUT,       
      THE GERMAN POTATO SALAD...
WHICH IS HELD WARM.

                    RED CABBAGE 
                   WE MAKE HERE.

315
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,781
HOW WE LOOKIN'?                 
                 IT LOOKS GREAT.

316
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,516
READY TO PULL IT?               
                    YEP, WE ARE.

317
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,518
GOOD, AND THEN WE'LL HIT IT     
 WITH SCRATCH-MADE GRAVY.       

318
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,253
   YEP, BEEF STOCK, MAKE A ROUX,
          MIX IT ALL UP,        

319
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,923
          AND THERE'S OUR GRAVY.
CAN'T BEAT THAT.

383
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:08,306
WHEN YOU SLICE IT ALL THE JUICES
    DON'T COME FLOWIN' OUT.     
                        EXACTLY.

384
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,308
AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA    
    MAKE THE AU JUS FROM?       

385
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,310
             YEAH, I BASICALLY  
          PUT ALL THE VEGETABLES

386
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,646
   AND PAN DRIPPINGS INTO A POT,
      ADD WATER, KOSHER SALT,   

387
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,248
    A LITTLE BROWNING AGENT,    
 GROUND BLACK PEPPER, BEEF BASE.

388
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,384
ONCE THE AU JUS COMES TO A BOIL,
          WE STRAIN IT,         

389
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,252
         AND THAT'S YOUR AU JUS.
     THAT'S IT,                 
THEN WE'LL SLICE IT.            

390
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,587
                   THIS IS OUR  
                  FINAL PRODUCT.
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA            
 PUT THIS ON WECK.              

391
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,523
  START WITH THE BUN,           
DIP THE TOP IN AU JUS,          

392
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,326
INTO OUR CARAWAY SEED           
  AND KOSHER SALT.              

393
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,295
        I'VE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE 
        DO IT HERE IN LOCATION. 

394
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,863
        I'VE ALWAYS SEEN IT COME
            WITH IT ON THERE.   

395
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,431
WHY NOT FRESH?                  
                        WHY NOT?

396
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,402
    ALL RIGHT, TAKE OUR BEEF,   
 ADD A DIP RIGHT IN THE AU JUS. 

397
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:40,738
LET IT WARM UP FOR A MINUTE,    
WE GOT THE BOTTOM OF OUR BUN,   

398
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,941
   PUT OUR BEEF ON THERE, TOP   
 OF THE BUN--THERE YOU HAVE IT. 

399
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:44,809
    SO THAT'S IT--BEEF ON WECK.
