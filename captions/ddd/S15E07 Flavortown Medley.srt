        THAT I TRY TO RESIST.   

106
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:55,893
               A LITTLE BIT     
           OF SCALLION IN THERE,

107
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,630
          HINT OF THE GINGER    
       AND THE GARLIC, SOME SOY,

108
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,099
           AND THE DUCK... MMM. 

109
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,568
                 THIS IS GREAT. 
              HOW MUCH IS THIS? 
$5.                             

110
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,238
                  NO, IT'S NOT. 
  $5.                           

111
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,640
                 IS IT THAT BIG 
                  OF A PORTION? 
THAT'S OUR PORTION              
   RIGHT THERE.                 

112
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,576
   DUDE, THAT'S EXCELLENT.      

113
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,712
        DUCK FRIED RICE.        

114
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:16,248
                   5 BUCKS      
           FOR THAT FRIED RICE. 
      5 BUCKS.                  

115
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,583
                    RIDICULOUS. 
    OH, YOU HAVE NO IDEA.       

116
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,985
<i>BECAUSE HERE AT SOUTH OF BEALE,</i> 

117
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,655
        <i> CRAZY LOW PRICES</i>       
   <i> ARE ALL PART OF THE DEAL.</i>   

118
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,657
    (man) MAPLE BACON BRAISED   
        BRUSSELS SPROUTS.       

119
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,860
   WE COME HERE SO OFTEN, AND   
  IT'S BECAUSE WE CAN COME HERE 

120
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:31,996
    IN LIEU OF EATING AT HOME   
     AND NOT BREAK OUR BANK.    

121
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,531
                  SOME POPCORN. 

122
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,068
 <i> AND IT DOESN'T GET ANY CHEAPER</i>
    <i> THAN THIS STARTER SNACK.</i>   

123
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,738
 ON EVERY TABLE, THERE'S ALWAYS 
  A WONDERFUL BOWL OF POPCORN.  

124
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:42,207
                  SOMETHING     
            A LITTLE DIFFERENT. 
  IT'S JUST THE PERFECT SNACK.  

125
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:46,678
                 ALL RIGHT,     
             THE PRESTO POPPER. 

126
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,880
     I HAVEN'T HAD ONE OF THESE 
         SINCE I WAS A KID.     

127
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,282
I BELIEVE THEY CALL THAT        
 KICKING IT OLD SCHOOL.         

128
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,618
             THAT IS ROCKIN' IT 
                  OLD SCHOOL.   

129
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,821
                  OKAY,         
         SO WHAT ARE WE MAKING? 
IT'S OUR HOUSE POPCORN.         

130
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:59,157
         SO FIRE THIS THING UP. 
JUST LIKE MOM USED TO DO, WE'RE 
  GONNA DUMP IN SOME KERNELS,   

131
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,361
   LET THEM START               
WORKING THEIR MAGIC.            

132
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,662
                           OKAY.
AND WHILE WE'RE WAITING         
FOR THE POPCORN TO POP,         

133
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,498
WE'LL START MAKING              
 OUR HOUSE SPICE.               

134
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,567
  WE TAKE BROWN SUGAR           
THAT WE HAVE DEHYDRATED         

135
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,503
   AND GROUND UP                
INTO A POWDER FORM.             
             SO YOU GET A BUNCH 
            OF THE MOISTURE OUT 

136
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:14,238
              SO IT'S NOT HEAVY 
                  AND CLUMPY.   
THEN WE'LL ADD A MIXTURE        

137
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:16,441
  OF OUR HOUSE BLACKENING SPICE 
       TO IT, KOSHER SALT,      

138
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,177
PAPRIKA,                        

139
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,580
SOME CAYENNE PEPPER,            

140
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,782
CUMIN,                          

141
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,784
SOME BLACK PEPPER,              

142
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,119
DRY MUSTARD...                  
            MY KIND OF POPCORN. 

143
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,988
   AND A LITTLE BIT             
OF GRANULATED GARLIC...         
                           OKAY.

144
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,391
   JUST 'CAUSE GARLIC           
MAKES EVERYTHING BETTER.        

145
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,726
WE'LL GIVE THIS A LITTLE STIR,  
    BLEND IT ALL TOGETHER.      
         AND IT GETS MIXED INTO 
             THE BROWN SUGAR?   

146
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:38,530
YES.                            
               AND IT'S ALREADY 
               STARTING TO POP. 

147
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:41,767
         ARE WE GONNA DO THE    
   BUTTER-MELTING THING UP TOP? 
KICK A LITTLE BUTTER            
      ON TOP.                   

148
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:46,204
                  THIS IS NUTS. 

149
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,507
        ACTUALLY, IT'S POPCORN. 

150
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,544
NOW ONCE OUR POPCORN            
     HAS POPPED,                

151
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,146
 WE'LL TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF OUR 
BUTTER THAT WE'VE MELTED UP TOP.

152
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,783
    AND YOU GIVE THIS TO PEOPLE 
    FOR FREE WHEN THEY COME IN? 
YES, INDEED.                    

153
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,818
I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER COOKED 
ANYTHING ON TRIPLE "D"          

154
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:04,288
              THAT WE GIVE AWAY 
                   FOR FREE.    
   SO NOW WE'LL TAKE            
SOME OF OUR HOUSE SPICE.        

155
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:07,091
YOU'RE JUST PUNCHING THE KETTLE 
CORN GUY IN THE HEAD WITH THIS. 

156
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,294
      AND THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE? 
VOILà.                          

157
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,296
                       HUH.     

158
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,698
          OHH. IT'S GREAT.      
     SEE, IT'S NOT KETTLE CORN. 

159
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,034
       IT'S NOT THAT SUPERSWEET 
          KETTLE CORN STUFF.    

160
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,437
      IT'S NOT STICKY. WHEN YOU 
     PUT IT TOWARDS YOUR MOUTH, 

161
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:21,172
                YOU'RE GETTIN'  
               ALL THOSE SPICES.

162
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:24,409
                     MMM.       
               SALTY, CRUNCHY...

163
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,180
        A LITTLE BIT OF BUTTER, 
                AND FREE.       
AND FREE.                       

164
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,916
             LET ME BACK IT UP. 
                IT'S FREE...    

165
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,784
        AND IT HAS OTHER STUFF. 
(laughs)                        

166
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:36,254
                   AWESOME JOB. 

167
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,390
 THE POPCORN IS VERY ADDICTIVE. 

168
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,325
     NOWHERE ELSE IN MEMPHIS    
     HAS ANYTHING LIKE THAT.    

169
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,994
     IT'S DEFINITELY UNIQUE     
       TO SOUTH OF BEALE.       

170
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,063
      I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING-- 

171
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,864
               DUCK FRIED RICE--
                OUT OF BOUNDS.  

172
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:49,400
        FREE POPCORN--AS MUCH   
   AS I CAN SHOVEL IN MY MOUTH. 

173
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:52,003
             YOU GOTTA LOVE IT. 
                SO WHAT'S NEXT? 

174
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,939
         WE'RE GONNA DO         
 A JACK AND COKE BREAD PUDDING. 

175
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,608
 WE'RE SOUTH OF BEALE--S.O.B.-- 
  HANGING OUT WITH CHEF BRYAN.  

176
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:59,578
             IS THAT YOUR SPOON?
                     OH.        

177
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:07,919
         I'M IN, LIKE, SOME KIND
           OF A POPCORN COMA.   

178
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,854
                I'M HANGING OUT 
                WITH CHEF BRYAN 

179
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,057
               AT SOUTH OF BEALE
                  IN MEMPHIS.   

180
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,058
             DUDE, WHAT HAVE YOU
                 DONE TO ME?    

181
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,660
     I'VE NEVER EATEN THAT MUCH 
          POPCORN IN MY LIFE.   

182
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,595
                SERIOUSLY,      
           SOMEONE TAKE IT AWAY.

183
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,865
 HOPEFULLY WE'RE ON TO SOMETHING
       NICE AND LIGHT NOW.      

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,200
         WE'RE GONNA DO         
 A JACK AND COKE BREAD PUDDING. 

185
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,669
           DURING COMMERCIAL,   
         HE WHISPERED AND SAID, 

186
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,537
                   "YOU WANT    
               A JACK AND COKE?"

187
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,406
            I'M LIKE, RIGHT ON. 

188
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,475
         YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
          ABOUT BREAD PUDDING.  

189
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,811
                   FIRE IT UP.  
                WHAT DO WE GOT? 
FIRST WE'RE GONNA MAKE          
   OUR CUSTARD BASE             

190
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,879
FOR OUR BREAD PUDDING.          
                   YES, WE ARE. 

191
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:37,215
 WE'RE GONNA TAKE OUR EGG YOLKS 
      AND THEN SOME SUGAR,      

192
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,083
HEAVY CREAM,                    

193
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,152
   AND THEN WE MAKE             
A COCA-COLA REDUCTION.          

194
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:44,823
 SO YOU TAKE THE SYRUP OF COLA, 
         REDUCE IT DOWN...      
YES.                            

195
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,557
                SO IT TURNS     
         INTO THIS TRUE SYRUP-- 

196
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,293
                NOW IT'S ALMOST 
                LIKE MOLASSES-- 

197
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,161
       AND MIX THAT ALL TOGETHER
          TO MAKE THE CUSTARD   

198
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,430
              THAT'S GONNA      
       GO OVER THE TOP OF THIS? 
YES.                            

199
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,699
               AND WHAT BREADS  
            DO WE HAVE IN HERE? 
UH, WE'VE GOT                   
A HULA BREAD,                   

200
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,968
WHICH IS A SWEETER              
 HAWAIIAN BREAD.                
          SWEET HAWAIIAN BREAD. 

201
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,636
WE'VE GOT JUST A REGULAR--      
      A HOAGIE ROLL.            

202
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,573
    WE DUMP OUR BREAD IN, ADD   
 OUR CUSTARD THAT WE JUST MADE. 

203
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,910
                            WOW.
AND NOW WE'RE GONNA

    BUT WE USE BEEF INSTEAD.    

414

      AND THE ROAST BEEF...

OUT OF THERE.

        SOME CONDIMENTS FOR IT? 

429
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,980
       I WANT SOME WHITE ONIONS,

430
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,249
A LITTLE BIT OF THE HORSERADISH

        THAT'S THE TIGER SAUCE. 

431
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,850
        AND SOME MUSTARD.
