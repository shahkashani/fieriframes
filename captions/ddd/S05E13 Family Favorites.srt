            TO OUR POT--SWEET.  

221
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,019
WE'RE GONNA THROW               
 OUR ONIONS IN.                 

222
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,954
    LET THAT COOK               
FOR A COUPLE MINUTES.           

223
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,089
           NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD

IT SMELLS LIKE SOUR.            

225
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,562
      IT SHOULD SMELL REAL SOUR.
         THIS IS BROKEN DOWN.   
SMELL THAT.                     

226
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,230
              SO THIS DOESN'T GO
                 IN THE OVEN?   
 EVERYTHING

227
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,433
   SO WE'RE GONNA BROWN 'EM ON  
 ALL SIDES. DOES IT GET A COVER?

228
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:58,169
 IT NEVER GETS A COVER. THIS IS 
  A 3-HOUR PROCESS TO DO THIS.  

229
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,171

TIME TO STAB MY MEAT.           

233
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,846

    IT JUST ADDS                
TO THE GRAVY FLAVOR.            

234
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,582
 WE LET THAT COOK               
FOR A FEW MINUTES,              

235
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,383

 WE'RE GONNA TAKE OUR MEAT OUT. 

242
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,798
WE'RE GONNA STRAIN              
   THE OIL OFF.                 

243
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,734
THEN WE'RE GONNA STRAIN

NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD             
 OUR BROWN SUGAR.               

249
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,818
 YOU HAVE TO KEEP TASTING THIS. 
   A LITTLE MORE BROWN SUGAR.   

250
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,286
                       TOO SOUR?
TOO SOUR, YEAH.                 

251
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,688

   TO MAKE IT...                
                        EXACTLY.

257
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:04,102
         NOBODY WANTS TO DO THIS
            AT HOME. MM-HMM.    

258
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,638
   THAT IS GREAT.               
IT'S NOT TOO TENDER.            
                        MNH-MNH.

259
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,840
   IT'S NOT TOO TOUGH,          
BUT THERE IS A CONTRAST,        

260
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,809

BUT OUR PIZZA SAUCE             
IS A COLD PRODUCT.              
                           STAY!

383
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:00,031
THIS IS OUR PIZZA DOUGH.        
         LOOK AT THESE BAD BOYS.

384
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,100
                    THAT'S NICE.
IT'S A FAMILY RECIPE,           

385
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,302
MADE FRESH EVERY DAY.           

386
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,971
    NOW YOU RUN A SHEETER, GIVES
     YOU REAL GOOD CONSISTENCY. 
YES, SIR.                       

387
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,973
     A LITTLE FLOUR ON HERE     
SO IT SLIDES THROUGH THE ROLLER.

388
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:11,909
  IT'S A 2-STAGE ROLLER,        
SO THIS IS THE FIRST STAGE.     

389
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,111
DUST IT WITH A LITTLE MORE      
 FLOUR--ABOUT TWO PASSES.       

390
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:15,646
THE FIRST ONE GOES THROUGH,     

391
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,515
AND THEN THE SECOND ONE         
 MAKES IT JUST RIGHT.           

392
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,917
THAT'S A PERFECT CONDITION.     
                  NICE AND THIN,

393
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,252
                AND THEN YOU'LL 
               JUST TRIM IT OUT.
YES, SIR.                       

394
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:23,921
                    I LIKE THAT.
  WE'RE GONNA TAKE              
A LITTLE SAUCE HERE.            

395
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,990
I MEAN, THAT IS SOME THIN CRUST.
    I MEAN, THAT RIGHT THERE    

396
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,725
 I COULD READ THE PAPER THROUGH.
           I LIKE IT.           

397
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,061
    SO THE MEAT GOES DOWN FIRST.
YES.                            

398
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,663
       SO THIS HAS GOT SAUSAGE. 
        IT'S GOT THE PORK BUTT, 

399
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,465
                 THE ANGUS BEEF.
WE SPICE IT OURSELVES.          

400
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,533
   <i> WITH SALT, PEPPER, GARLIC,</i>  
 <i> FENNEL AND CRUSHED RED PEPPER.</i>

401
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,669
     WE'RE GONNA PUT            
A LITTLE CHEESE ON HERE.        

402
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,272
THIS IS WISCONSIN CHEESE.       
IT MAKES THE BEST PIZZA.        

403
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,539
   WE'RE GONNA                  
TAKE SOME ONIONS.               

404
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,342
WE'RE GONNA SPRINKLE 'EM        
       OVER HERE.               

405
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,210
         WE'RE GONNA ADD        
  A LITTLE GREEN PEPPER ON TOP. 

406
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:48,012
   MY UNCLE SAM                 
USED TO CALL THIS,              

407
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:49,680
 (deep voice) "GIMME ONE A THEM 
         GARBAGE PIZZAS,        

408

409
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,419
             (normal voice)     
            OKAY, IN THE OVEN-- 
HOW HOT'S THAT OVEN?            

410
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,154
      THAT OVEN IS 450 DEGREES. 

411
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,288
           IT'S ONLY GONNA TAKE 
         ABOUT 12 OR 15 MINUTES.
IS IT READY?                    

412
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,491
                 LET'S GO. GOOD.
WOW.                            

413
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:03,761
  AND WHAT DID YOU THROW        
THAT ON, A LITTLE CORNMEAL?     
               TO MAKE IT ROLL  
            OFF THE BOARD THERE.

414
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,230
             WHOA! WHAT IS THAT?
               THAT'S A KNIFE.  

415
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:10,101
   OH, THERE'S CHICAGO FOR YOU--
         CUT INTO SQUARES.      
  THIS IS CALLED                
A CHICAGO BOX CUT.              

416
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:13,904
GUY, ENJOY.                     
             WOW. THAT'S EXACTLY
            HOW I LIKE MY PIZZA.

417
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,308
 AND LOOK HOW WELL IT HOLDS UP. 
 THE HOMEMADE SAUSAGE MAKES IT. 

418
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,110
 AND THEN THE THIN-SLICED ONIONS
          AND PEPPERS--         

419
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,577
     THEY KIND OF MELT INTO IT. 

420
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,113
   BROTHER, I'M GONNA TELL YOU, 

421
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,382
           THAT'S SOME MONEY PIE
               RIGHT THERE.     

422
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,917
   IT'S A PLEASURE              
TO HAVE YOU HERE, GUY.          
               (with mouth full)
                THAT IS AWESOME.

423
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,320
            I CAN'T GET IT      
       IN MY MOUTH FAST ENOUGH. 

424
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:31,589
   THE CRUST IS REALLY CRISPY.  
           IT'S GREAT.          

425
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:35,259
       THE SAUSAGE IS FANTASTIC.
  THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PIZZAS
          I'VE EVER HAD.        

426
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,661
   PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD
    SELL FOOD OUT OF A TAVERN.  

427
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,597
          IT WAS A NOVEL CONCEPT
              HERE IN DALLAS.   
         <i> NOT ANYMORE.</i>          

428
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:43,400
  HERE'S YOUR STEAK. WE HAD TO  
CREATE A MENU TO DRAW PEOPLE IN.

429
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:47,405
FROM BAR FOOD                   
TO REAL FOOD.                   
     THE SALMON, THE STEAKS,    
 THE CHOPS--IT'S A FAMILY PLACE.

430
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,139
  I MEAN, WHEN YOU COME IN HERE,
     YOU'RE ONE OF THE FAMILY.  

431
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,941
  GOOD TO SEE                   
YOU GUYS AGAIN.                 
         IT'S SO GREAT.         

432
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,210
       I'M ON THE LASAGNA LIST, 

433
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,412
 SO WHENEVER THEY MAKE LASAGNA, 
      THEY GIVE ME A CALL.      

434
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,947
 <i> OR YOU MIGHT EVEN GET A BURGER</i>
        <i> NAMED AFTER YOU.</i>

    <i> AND A FEW OTHER THINGS.</i>    

443
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,167
OKAY, I WON'T TELL ANYBODY.

                             NO.
