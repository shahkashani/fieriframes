00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:03,202
     So when I come off the road
         from doing "Triple-D","

2
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:05,070
    the first thing I want to do
       is get home to my kitchen

3
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:07,139
              and cook my food  
               for my family.   

4
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:08,540
          And after a few weeks,
              I got to be hon-- 

5
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,942
Can we just please go           
   to a restaurant              

6
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,144
 at least one time?             

7
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:14,880
           They start to revolt.
      So I came up with an idea.

8
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:17,348
          How about we reach out
   to some of our favorite chefs

9
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,551
                and have them   
            send us dinner, huh?

10
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,420
  I like that idea.             

11
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:22,955
      GUY: And I know some      
        "Triple-D" joints       

12
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:25,157
         that would love        
        to send it to us.       

13

00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,153

00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,756
     And that's                 
  what we do here.              

233
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,892
     Oh, those are awesome.

   "Triple-D Takeout," folks.   

239
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,970
 I hope we're gonna cook today. 
      Did you send us food?     

240
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,506
Yes. We're making baked         
 macaroni and cheese            

241
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,109
 with rendered bacon            
  plus applesauce.              

242
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,577
 H, what do we start with first?

243
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,445
      Pull out                  
  the sweet cream.              

244
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,447
I sent you two portions.        

245
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:36,847
    Okay, two different pans,   
             Hunter.            

246
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,383
      We'll make them both      
        at the same time.       

247
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,717
     I love it.                 

248
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,321
And then you're gonna add       
1/4 teaspoon of kosher salt     

249
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,856
   and some fresh               
cracked black pepper.           

250
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,124
              Okay.             

251
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,060
And there is also a container   
 of smoked paprika.             

252
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,596
You're just gonna put           
a little pinch in each one,     

253
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:54,299
   add sour cream               
and Parmesan to each pan.       

254
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,267
             Got it.            

255
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,201
  And we can't add              
 another ingredient             

256
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,405
 until that comes up            
 to a rapid bubble.             

257
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:03,341
That's when you're going        
to add your mozzarella,         

258
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,210
  Brie and cheddar.             

259
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,678
      And once                  
that's incorporated,            

260
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,746
 you're gonna divide            
   that container               

261
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:12,550
of chopped, rendered bacon      
between the two pots.           

262
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,752
   Add your pasta.              

263
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:16,688
             I've never had Brie
            in a mac and cheese.

264
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,423
             HEATHER: You know, 
          when I was growing up,

265
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:19,957
                my mom owned    
             a catering company,

266
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,760
             and she always had 
         little pieces of cheese

267
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:24,162
                  left over     
   from the fancy cheese boards.

268
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,431
      And so when she would make
             our mac and cheese,

269
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,032
              she would be able 
     to throw the Brie in there.

270
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,901
And we had applesauce           
  with everything.              

271
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,036
       I love applesauce.       

272
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,772
So it tastes like that          
 quintessential bite            

273
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,706
      you have                  
with a cheese board,            

274
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,309
with a chunk of Brie            
    and an apple.               

275
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:38,376
             -Whoo!             
              -Oh!              

276
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,578
 Ryder, do you like applesauce? 

277
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,781
RYDER: I mean, it depends.      
School applesauce is not good.  

278
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,516
       Heather, break down      
     the applesauce for me.     

279
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:48,319
We get whatever apples our      
farmers are in need of moving.  

280
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,122
Put them in a stock pot         
with just a teeny bit of water  

281
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:54,058
and that apple dictates         
what ingredients we're adding.  

282
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,795
But mostly it's white sugar,    
    brown sugar,                

283
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:59,063
  fresh lemon juice             
      and salt.                 

284
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,598
And just cook it super slow     

285
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,667
until all the apples            
     break down.                

286
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,469
And then put it through         
    a food mill.                

287
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,805
    I'll tell you something.    
  That is the bomb applesauce.  

288
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,473
Thank you, my brother.          

289
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,341

290

     to get me some of that.    

291
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,211
  I will love that.             

292
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,080
         Okay, Heather,         
       so the game plan is      

293
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:16,947
     take these bread crumbs    
            on there.

Let's do it.                    

295
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:21,218
       Alright. We'll put       
a little crisp on top with that.

296
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,087

00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,623
      Those little nuggets.     

345
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,758
        The applesauce --       

346
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,359
         if you sold it         
      by the tanker truck,      

347
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:09,627
         I would be your        
         first customer.        

348
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,162
 Ryder said this is             
    his favorite                

349
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:12,296
mac and cheese of all time.     

350
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,098
                         What?  
        My favorite dish        

351
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,567
    from, like, all the shows   
            combined.           

352
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,569
                 Out of all     
         the "Triple-D Takeouts"

353
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,305
        that we've done, so far,
      this is his favorite dish.

354
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,175
Can you do me a favor?          
Give him a big squish for me.   

355
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,376
     Sure thing. Right here.    

356
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,512
     Yes, Hunt--                
No, not that kind of squish.    

357
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:30,181
Thank you very much, Ryder.     
 I appreciate that.             

358
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:33,317
    GUY: As these two retire    
  to enjoying that by the pool, 

359
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,852
  my brother Greg from Pinky's  

360
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,188
    all the way in Charlotte,   
         North Carolina.        

361
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,990
 Still got the Bug on the roof? 

362
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:41,058
   GREG: Oh, yeah.              
Bug's still on the roof.        

363
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,594
Rocking and rolling, man.       

364
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,862
        GUY:                    
Three 5-ounce patties.          

365
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,397
And why do you call it          
the Triple "G" burger?          

366
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,333
       Because it was Triple "G"
             Volkswagen repair. 

367
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,269
 See, I thought when you called 
   this the Triple "G" burger,  

368
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,604
             it was             
     "Guy's Grocery Games."     

369
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,338
 Even in Charlotte,             
it's got to be about Guy.       

370
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,406
           [ Laughs ]           

371
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,141
                 Here we go.    

372
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,810
  You're attacking              
     this thing.                

373
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,745
It looks like a coyote          
  got ahold of it.              

374
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:01,879
                [ Laughing ]    

375
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:02,947
          [ Laughing ]          

376
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,215
      GUY: Alright, Pinky.      

377
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,083
                    GREG:       
         Alright. Top box there.

378
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,418
           Just a bunch of swag.

379
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,553
   That's awesome.              

380
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,354
        Ryder, get a shot       
            at this.            

381
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,757
         That's the patron saint
               of Flavortown.   

382
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,759
        I'm gonna put it        
         right over here        

383
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,828
        at the Flavortown       
           memorials.           

384
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,229
                    Nice.       

385
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,031
       Tell us about this       
 great dish we're getting into. 

386
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:23,634
I'm bringing the green          
chili pork sandwich.            

387
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,769
  What do I have here, brother? 

388
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,437
            Marinated pork loin.

389
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,239
  What's it been marinated in?  

390
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,575
              Pineapple juice,  
               roasted poblano  

391
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:31,909
            and diced jalapeños,

392
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,580
            cilantro, soy sauce,
        little bit of olive oil.

393
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,314
       How do you want us       
     to start off with this?    

394
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,117
                  Get your      
               frying pan hot.  

395
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,784
             And that's got just
              enough oil in it  

396
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:41,786
           where it won't stick.

397
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,054
      So you'll get a good sear.

398
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:45,122
Alright. So what are we gonna do
     with the pineapple now?    

399
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,191
        Cut them about a quarter
                 inch slices    

400
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,394
            and just sear 'em up
                a little bit.   

401
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:52,463
    These big, huge, monster    
   pieces are what go on this?  

402
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,198
             -Yeah.             
            -Wowsers.           

403
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,336
         And there's little bits
      of poblanos and jalapeños.

404
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,204
        Don't be scared to throw
         a few of them in there,

405
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,539
                sear 'em up.    

406
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,274
     Poblanos and jalapeños.    

407
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,609
         I was gonna try to talk
             without subtitles, 

408
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,944
        but I'll just let loose.

409
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,413
  You just gonna let it happen? 
Let loose.                      

410
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:09,880
             Toast the buns up. 

411
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,882
  What's this little concoction 
     you sent me right here?    

412
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,952
       That is                  
the Jamaican relish.            

413
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:17,355
It's sweet red peppers          
and pickled watermelon rind.    

414
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,425
              -Ooh.             
    -Pickled watermelon rind?   

415
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,960
       Jamaican me hungry.      
       [You making me]          

416
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,828
     Dude, that's the bomb.     

417
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,030
 Take three quarters            
  of the mayonnaise             

418
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,832
    and mix it in               
with all of the relish.         

419
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:32,169
 That will be sauce             
 to put on the bun.             

420
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,504
             Got it.            

421
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,105
     That's the kind of sear    
  you're looking for, brother?  

422
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,641
                      Oh, yeah. 
  Nice caramelization on that.  

423
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,244
              And then lay some 
               of the arugula.  

424
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,380
           Cheese will go on top
             of the seared pork.

425
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,117
        Put the pineapple on top
            of the Swiss cheese.

426
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:46,985
                Looking good.   

427
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:48,719
I could smell it from here.     

428
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,054
      The bun is just dying     

429
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,623
   under the pressure of this,  
           by the way.          

430
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,193
                Uh-oh. Uh-oh.   

431
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,661
             He's stepping back.

432
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:58,663
          You have just         
        the right amount        

433
00:14:58,665 --> 00:14:59,864
       of pineapple juice.      

434
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:02,333
      Great with the Swiss.     
       You need the tang.       

435
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:05,003
      This Jamaican relish,     
      whatever you call it.     

436
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:07,338
        Nice little tang.       
       Pork loin is lean.       

437
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,540
     Get some extra fat from    
 the mayonnaise coming through. 

438
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:12,143
    You got so much heat and    
so much flavor and so much sauce

439
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:13,677
    and so much pow going on.   

440
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,746
          So much pow!          

441
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,881
           Ridiculous.          

442
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,416
  I mean, delicious, on point.  

443
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,550
 Thank you, brother.            

444
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,219
HUNTER: That's a good burger.   
     It's fresh.                

445
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,353
   We've got to clean this up.  

446
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,756
         We got to take         
     a little bit of a rest.    

447
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,157
     And when we come back,     

448
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,558
        don't go anywhere       
  because we're bringing to you 

449
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,360
        the barbecue king       
          of Pacifica.          

450
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,429
       Gorilla's up next.       
        See you in a bit.       

451
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,498
    Go, Gorilla.                

452
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:39,770
        Oh, welcome back        
     to "Triple-D Takeout."     

453
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,239
       I got to be honest       
        with you, folks,        

454
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,975
     the whole idea of this     
 was to get some delicious food 

455
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,576
     from around the country    

456
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,979
   so we didn't have to do all  
 the cooking here at the house. 

457
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,848
I thought it was to eat         
the meals throughout the day,   

458
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,451
not all in one sitting.         

459
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,720
             Between            
      the spaghetti waffle
