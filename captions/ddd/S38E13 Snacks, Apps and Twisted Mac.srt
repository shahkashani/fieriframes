       So let's talk about      
     how a lot of<i> Triple-Ds</i>     
          get started.          

28
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,810
       It usually involves      
    you sending us an email,    

29
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,013
     and then, us trying to     
     track the joints down.     

30
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:25,350
       But not this time.       
      Not in San Francisco      
       on the Embarcadero.      

31

36
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:46,972
       Pier 23's right on       
     the Embarcadero, which     
    makes it super accessible

      <i> Triple-D</i> location.

     walk through the door.     

40

       -About 18 minutes.       

61
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,567
      Cool thing about this     
     is after we cook this,     

62
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:49,834
         it's gonna turn        
         bright orange.         

63
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,970
   And then we'll pull it out.  
       We'll ice-bath it.       

64
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,640

         Are you a body         
          or a leg man?

69

   A little bit of olive oil,   
        get 'er started,        
         a little salt.         

70
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,586
  -[Guy] So you season the oil  
          a little bit.         
      -[Al] Little pepper.      

71
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,454
        Once it heats up,       
      little bit of garlic.     

72
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,056
      A little bit of crab.     

73
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:15,727
  So the crab's already cooked. 
  And now it's time to kind of  
     fortify it with flavor.    

74
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,662
        I wish you could        
    smell this right now. Oh!   

75
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,464
   [Al] Then you just give it   
     a little bit of a set.     

76
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,532
       [Guy] What we gonna      
        serve that with?

81
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:28,674
         So you say that        
        you're a leg man.       

82
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,676
       Go ahead and spend

00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,813
   Mmm. That is just awesome.   

86
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,884
    It's got the lemon juice,   
    but it's also got some of   
        that great crab.        

87
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,254
     This is getting messy.     
       I mean, this isn't       
         for the timid.         

88
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,559
      They do a great crab      
      when it's in season.      

89
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,961
         When we can get        
       the whole crabs in,      
         people love it.        

90
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,363
   When it's Dungeness season,  

91
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:54,632
          which we have         
    a crazy Dungeness season    
  here in Northern California.  

92
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:57,369
      -When you do have it,     
          it goes nuts?         
             -Nuts.             

93
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,237
          [Al laughing]         

94
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,440
      Aren't you guys busy?     
     Don't you have anything    
          you wanna do?

          [Al laughing]         

96
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,709
  Since then, you've taken over 
          as the chef.          

97
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,978
          But the food          
      continues to elevate.     

98
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:11,650
          We wanted to          
     go to the next chapter     
   of the business, you know.   

99
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:15,387
         So we got older        
  and we had all our fun times, 
          as you know.          

100
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,356
          It was like,          
   what are we gonna do next?   

101
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,927
  It's been around for decades. 

102
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,663
        But they've been        
    constantly improving it.

         new food items.        

104

    I know the menu by heart,   
       pretty much, unless      
    they introduce something,   

105
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,004
         And I'm, like,         
   "That's what I'm getting".   

106
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:37,475
          [Mac]<i> We got</i>

109

   -[Guy] Okay, so rillette...  
       -Spelling rillette       

110
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,950
        -is a challenge.        
        -Well, explaining       
          it to people.         

111
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,620
   I mean, how do the servers   
  explain it? What do they say? 

112
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,555
     -They call it tuna dip.    
            -Exactly!           

113
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,358

      what I was gonna say.     

114

      -Smoked cod rillette.     
           -Thank you.

   I have a big lingcod issue.

     <i> We add fresh herbs...</i>     

122
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,913
     It has dill, scallion,     
  parsley and some sour cream.  

123
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:20,085
      <i> Little bit of mayo,</i>

      our garlic crostini.      

126
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:34,733
         It's delicious.        
           It's creamy          
         and it's smoky,        

127
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,602
      and it's herbaceous.

    it's got some olive oil,    

128
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,673

     than there is anything     

129
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:44,076

      It's amazing. Smoky,

          of cod in it.

    of flavor in your mouth.    

139
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,367
        Perfect appetizer       
         for two people.        

140
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,635
       And with a cocktail      
     or two, it's fabulous.     

141
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,969
 That's really a dynamite dish. 

142

152

     My crew and I have been

           Good times!

00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,807
       It's just a really       
       great place to be.       
    Absolutely San Francisco.   

156
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:54,045
    It's a beautiful location   
     and you're missing out     
   if you don't stop in here.   

157
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,782
      Guy always felt like      
   this was one of his spots.   

158
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,716
     It was kind of special     
         in that sense.         

159
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,519
     All my boys in the crew    
          love the 23.          

160
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,321
     I made it in briefly...    

161
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,723
        Set up right here

162
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:07,058
          To this day,          
         people come in,        

163
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,594
         "Where was Guy?

 <i> Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives?</i>  

166
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,468
 Yeah, I think I saw that once, 
           late night.          

167
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,604
         So you still do        
      the local favorites.      

168
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,741
   -You still do what we love.  
   -Crab and shrimp sandwich,   
            for sure.           

169
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,676
  -[man] Crab and shrimp melt.  
     -[Mac] The fish tacos,     

170
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,345
       -which you've had.       
          -I've had it          
         multiple times.        

171
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:30,415
   First thing in the morning,  
  we phone the fish guys, say,  
    "Okay, what do you got?"    

172
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:33,351
          -Fresh first,         
      and then recipe next.     
            -Exactly.           

173
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,886
      So we got some fresh      
           mahi-mahi.           

174
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,622
         We cut our fish        
      a little bit bigger,      
        about one-by-one.       

175
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,490
   -Ready to go for the saute.  
            -Dig it.            

176
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,625
        Bit of olive oil,       

177
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,895
    garlic, get that started.   
      And in goes the fish.     

178
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,430
         How many tacos         
 are you making there, captain? 

179
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:46,764
           -A couple.           
          -I like this.         

180
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,434
  -[Al] A little bit of onion.  
      -[Guy] That's pretty      
        straightforward.        

181
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,436
  Let the fish do the talking.  

182
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:52,637
  A little salt, bit of pepper. 

183
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,840
      Now we've got to get      
   our tortillas ready. Okay.   

184
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,642
   The reason we cut our fish   
    a little bit bigger is...   

185
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,312
      it doesn't overcook.      
           Cooks rare.          

186
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,782
      Give it a quick chop,     
      and then, what really     
       sets our tacos off       

187
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,850
    are the fresh corn relish   
       and the house slaw.      

188
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,853
       And the house slaw?      
          And you make          
       this slaw to order?      

189
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:11,523
 Yeah, diced carrots in a honey 
       coleslaw dressing.       

190
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,990
      Nice under-achieving.     

191
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,394
      A little bit of fish.     
      See how nice and rare     
    that is? A quick fold...    

192
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:17,729
         -Get the fold.         
           -Get them.           

193
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,265
         -[Al chuckles]         
         -Look at that.         
    Nice and tender in there.   

194
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,869
        I don't know that       
          I've ever had         
     a semi-rare fish taco,     

195
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,938
      but I will tell you,      
   that is the way to eat it.   

196
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,342
   It's a dynamite fish taco.   
   Mmm. I ate the whole thing.  

197
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,743
      I gotta go lay down.      

198
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,813
      Fish tacos? Oh, yeah.     
        Those are great!        

199
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,482
   I've had most of the dishes  
          on the menu.          

200
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,019
       Great ingredients,       
 always fresh, tons of seafood.

         -[man] Octopus         
       and shrimp ceviche.      
  -Clam chowder in the window.  

202
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,557
        They have a great       
          clam chowder.         
        I really like it.       

203
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,960
        Okay, here's our        
     clam and fish chowder.     

204
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,429
     Our chowder is the best    
          in the city.          

205
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,231
        So what makes the       
     clam chowder so great?     

206
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,366
      It's not just clams.      

207
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,500
      Ours has fish in it,      
           lingcod...           

208
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,235
    How do you prepare that?    

209
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:02,507
       [Mac]<i> When we start</i>      
     <i> the chowder, we saute</i>     
 <i> vegetables. Carrots, celery.</i>  

210
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:06,311
     <i> Once those cook down,</i>     
  <i> we add potatoes and herbs.</i>   

211
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,582
       <i> Our shrimp stock</i>        
    <i> that we make in-house.</i>     
 <i> White wine, then heavy cream.</i> 

212
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,452
         It doesn't have        
        any flour in it.        

213
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,056
     What's the deal, then?     
 'Cause everybody makes chowder 
   with a little bit of flour.  

214
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,591
        -What do you guys       
       tighten it up with?      
             -Rice.             

215
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,593
        Wait, wait, wait.       
     So you puree the rice?     

216
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,862
   Yeah. We make a rice roux.   

217
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:29,801
     <i> And then, once we get</i>     
    <i> all that cooking down,</i>     
    <i> we add our fresh clams.</i>    

218
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:33,337
      <i> We add fresh, local</i>      
     <i> lingcod for the fish,</i>     

219
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,240
  <i> which gives it nice flavor.</i>  

220
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,013
       That chowder rocks.      
      This chowder's light.     

221
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,016
    I think that rice flour,    
    that ground-up rice roux    
  that you're putting in there  

222
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:48,686
       is keeping it from       
      becoming really tacky     
     and starchy and heavy.     

223
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,923
     -I definitely got fish,    
     I definitely got clams.    
             -Yeah.             

224
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:55,427
        It's got balance.       
    That's real-deal chowder.   

225
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,129
   Right on. Glad you like it.  

226
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,433
      I'm 100% ripping off      
       the rice deal, bro.      

227
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,367
              Nice!             

228
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,704
     I had the clam chowder.    
       Probably gonna gain      
         a lot of weight        

229
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,172
     now that I've found it.    

230
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,773
    There's a lot of seafood.   
         It's wonderful.        

231
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:12,510
   One of the most consistent   
   dishes there is on the menu  

232
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,845
   and that's one of the main   
      reasons I come back.      

233

   You can't walk into the 23   
      and not have a smile.     

234
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,650
      I mean, it's classic.     
        It's got history.       

235
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,787
      You're gonna love it.

00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:27,778
         Okay. Red wine.        

425
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,313
         So we're making        
      a red wine reduction?     

426
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,714
          -Demi-glace.          
          -[Guy] Okay.          

427
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,983
   Gonna let that reduce down   
        to about a fourth       
    of what we started with.    

428
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,519
        -[Guy] All right.       
    -[man] Then, we're gonna    
      get the bacon grease,     

429
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:36,854
   so it melts down, gets hot.  

430
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:39,657
     The butter, the garlic,    
            shallots,           

431
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,126
   bacon, and a few mushrooms.  

432
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,061
    And let that reduce down.   

433
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:48,299
      I'm gonna go and add      
          the red wine          
      demi-glace reduction.     

434
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:53,137
       All we gotta do now      
  is season the chicken breast. 

435
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,539
       [Guy] What is that       
      we just put on there?     

436
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,341
  -This is a garlic-herb blend. 
             -Okay.             

437
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,477
   [man] Little bit of butter,  
     put it on the flat top.    

438
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,079
       Put a press on it.       

439
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,082
    We take provolone cheese,   
      put it over the top.      

440
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,683
            Put a cap           
      over the top of that.     

441
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,486
   Give a little shot of water  
    to melt that cheese down.   

442
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:10,754
       [Guy] There you go,      
       I like the method.       

443
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:14,358
        [man] And put it        
         on our grilled         
   cranberry wild rice bread.   

444
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,359
        Take our sauce...       

445
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,297
          And serve it.         

446
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,237
      If any one component      
        of this sandwich        

447
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:27,838
          wasn't there,         

448
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:30,575
          this would be         
    a pretty basic sandwich.    
       It's great flavor.       

449
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,643
       I was cruising down      
          Boring Avenue         

450
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,513
         hooked a right,        
           right onto           
      Delicious Boulevard.      

451
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,515
     You navigated this into    
   a really dynamite sandwich.  

452
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,516
           Thank you.           

453
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,719
  It's got a very wide variety  
         of menu items.         

454
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:44,856
      <i> Lot of sandwiches.</i>       
  <i> The pizzas are really good.</i>

   [man]<i> It's such a big menu,</i>

456

    If you wanna do something   
      a little more casual      

457
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,862
    and have some appetizers,   
          there's that.         

458
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,597
 Cheese and garlic crack bread, 
       you can't go wrong.      

459
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,932
    There's the crack bread.    

460
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,068
      [Brian]<i> We start off</i>      
     <i> with a whole loaf of</i>      
       <i> sourdough bread.</i>

     <i> Cut it into diamonds.</i>     

462
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:01,606
     <i> Take Wisconsin cheese</i>     
 <i> and we fill all the crevices.</i> 

463
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:02,940
       <i> We then cover it</i>        
      <i> with garlic butter,</i>      

464
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,676

   <i> of garlic seasoned salt,</i>

00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,344
         <i> finish it off</i>

466

        <i> Bake that off.</i>         

468
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,949
    <i> And we'll garnish that</i>     
  <i> with a side of our marinara</i>  
      <i> sauce for dipping.</i>       

469
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:16,420
       The marinara sauce       
        is the same sauce       
     as we use on our pizza.    

470
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:17,488
         Put the oil in.        

471
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,424
       Canola oil, onions,      
         crushed tomato,

  basil, garlic, herbs, sugar,

         salt, oregano.         

474
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:25,763
        Red chili flake.        

475
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,564
          Let this cook         
       for about an hour.       

476
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,368
    It's a very savory sauce,   
        perfect for this        
         kind of bread.         

477
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:32,502
    Here is your crack bread.   

478
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:36,173
        I can look to see       
  where there's the most cheese 
     and just dig that out.     

479
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,109
  You're not gonna get a piece  
   of bread that doesn't have   
        everything on it.       

480
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,046
      Oh, it's ooey, gooey,     
     cheesiness right there.    

481
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:46,784
    I get it every time that    
      I'm here, It's one of     
      my go-to appetizers.      

482
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,588
       The cheese bread is      
   our best-selling appetizer.  

483
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,456
         <i> I have to say</i>         
 <i> I'm biased to the egg rolls.</i>  

484

  I just love those egg rolls.  

485
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,394
          I really like         
     the Canadian egg rolls.    

486
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:57,861
   A Canadian-style egg roll,

494

        <i> and then fry it</i>        
   <i> until it's golden-brown.</i>    

495

           egg rolls.           

496
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,815
          That's unlike         
       any other egg roll       
     that you're gonna have.    

497
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,218
         <i> It's crunchy,</i>
