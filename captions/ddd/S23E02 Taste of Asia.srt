We're in a wind tunnel!         
What are we making?!

       We're gonna start with a 
marinade -- 2 cups of soy sauce.

237
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,406
There we go.

       right on top of the pork.

242
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,686
You have to let it cool down    
or you're gonna poach it.

   All right, now,              
 what are we doing?

       nice slices of sourdough.

336
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,631
American cheese, cheddar cheese,
              and Swiss cheese.
