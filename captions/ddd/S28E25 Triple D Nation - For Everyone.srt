 of roasted garlic in this pot, 

114
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,247
    which we're going to cook   
         for five hours.        

115
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,249
        Now we blend it.        

116
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,116
       This is not so hot       
        you can't eat it.       

117
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,451
    We do create an extra-hot   

118
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,387
    for those who really want   
     to kick it up a notch.     

119
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,724
   The Big Juan is fantastic.   

120
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:22,060
     The hot of the chorizo,    
    the homemade hot sauce --   

121
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,329
       It's just luscious.      

122
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,131
    It's got a lot of flavor.   

123
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,934
       One of my favorite       
       breakfast burritos.      

124
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,803
              When I came here, 
 there was no hole in that wall.

125
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,405
         -That's right.         
  -And everything that went on  

126
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:38,276
        at Voula's Offshore Cafe
     was on those griddles only.

127
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,477
In the expansion process,       

128
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,346
  we decided to do              
 a secondary kitchen            

129
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,815
that works hand-in-hand         
with the front kitchen.         

130
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,817
             Pretty much tripled
             our cooking space, 

131
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,552
           and it's just made it
                a lot easier.   

132
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,888
Everybody we talked to          
when we were doing the remodel, 

133
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,957
 everybody wanted us            
to shove everything in the back,

134
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,358
and I didn't want that,         
 because the people             

135
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,926
want to see us doing this       
      out here.                 

136
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,228
                   FIERI:       
         Sitting at this counter

137
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,829
    -is part of the whole --    
            -Exactly.           

138
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,630
             People fight to get
              to this counter.  

139
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,299
It's kind of like entertainment 
while you're eating,            

140
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,701
and it's pretty cool.           

141
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,236
      SIKEY: Two Squealers.     

142
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:06,838
  FIERI: And the latest star of 
the show is the Little Squealer,

143
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,907
        the lunch version       
   of your favorite breakfast,  

144
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,441
  the Piñata, which is actually 

145
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,377
           what I ate           
   the first time I was there.  

146
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,312
FIERI: If Eggs Benedict         
  tasted like that,             

147
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,114
     I might eat                
Eggs Benedict every day.        

148
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,115
                    Good.       

149
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:21,052
    The chipotle                
hollandaise is money.           

150
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,787
        -Feed the camera.       
              -Mmm.             

151
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,123
    Now, you could just drink   
     that hollandaise sauce,    

152
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,525
       but instead, I made      
      a little suggestion.      

153
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,728
Now let's take some of this     
and make some sandwiches.       

154
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,196
              Yeah, no kidding. 

155
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,264
         Which they did.        

156
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,532
  This is the Little Squealer.  

157
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,068
              We use our sliced 
                smoked pork,    

158
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,204
    so it gives it a nice, smoky
 flavor throughout the sandwich.

159
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,873
            But we wanted to use
        the chipotle hollandaise

160
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,408
                 that we use    
             for the breakfast, 

161
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,011
              but adding tomato 
              and Swiss cheese. 

162
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,345
     WOMAN: The hollandaise     
      and the Swiss cheese      

163
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,414
     are just the best part     
        of the sandwich.        

164
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,149
 There's a little bit of spice, 
          it's creamy,          

165
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:54,286
 and it goes really, really well
 with the smoked pork shoulder. 

166
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:57,289
       It's all homemade.       
 It's just a delicious sandwich.

167
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,890
              I'm glad that you 
           turned the reins over

168
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,425
          finally to these boys.

169
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,694
        Except one thing        
    I didn't give it to them.   

170
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,696
        -Yes, one thing?        
      -My house in Greece.      

171
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,698
       That's the only one thing
         you don't give to them?

172
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,666
               You shouldn't.   
      Give it to your other son,

173
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,768
             the one with hair. 

174
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,969
             -Good.             
       -The one with hair.      

175
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,104
        -I will do that.        
 -Let me just get right in there

176
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,439
         -on that deal.         
           -All right.          

177
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,841
    Anytime you go to Greece,   
 go ahead and stay in my place. 

178
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,110
                 I love it.     
           Wow. Congratulations.

179
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,912
       -Thank you, buddy.       
    -Very happy for you, man.   

180
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:24,116
                Awesome job.    

181
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:25,584
   It's nice to see those guys  

182
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,786
    finally giving their mom    
            a break,            

183
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,087
        and I think that        
     I'm going to hold Voula    

184
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,723
  to that house deal in Greece. 
           Next up...           

185
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,724
          Can it get to the face
              without falling?  

186
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,126
                  Oh. Mmm.      

187
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,529
     ...a Minneapolis joint     
      doubling up the staff     

188
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,531
and the menu after doubling down

189
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,701
   on authentic, off-the-hook   
         Cuban cuisine.         

190
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,640
 FIERI: 10 years ago, I dropped 
  into a tropical-looking joint 

191
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:51,776
         in Minneapolis         
  with a rep for huge flavors.  

192
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,379
    Victor's Sandwich Cubano,   
          two of them.          

193
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,981
       Imagine my surprise      
    when I found a Greek chef   

194
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,717
serving up authentic Cuban food.

195
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:03,855
   This is Victor's 1959 Café.  

196
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,323
      Have your albóndigas.     

197
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:09,327
   It's really blown up a lot.  
   There's always people here.  

198
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:12,063
    WOMAN: It's not every day   
 that people associate Minnesota

199
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,465
 with a iconic Cuban restaurant,

200
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:18,403
     and then moreover with     
a Greek woman that's leading it.

201
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,670
      FIERI: That's right.      

202
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,874
  Some of the best, most legit  
     Cuban food we've seen,     

203
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:26,211
      all coming from Niki,     
      who's full-on Greek.

        Sandwich Cubano.        

205
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,749
     Here's ham for the two     
        Victor's Cubanos.       

206
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:33,552
         You have got the bling.
                Look at this.   

207
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,420
    Yeah, like --               
          And it's beauty bling.

208
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,222
         So, this is going to be
            the Cuban picadillo.

209
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:40,892
            -Am I --            
      -The Cuban picadillo.     

210
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,428
  NIKI: It's a very traditional,
           authentic Cuban dish.

211
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,829
       FIERI:                   
So we're all browned up.        

212
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,432
-Now who else jumps in the pool?
       -The Creole sauce.       

213
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:49,034
    Creole sauce                
  into Cuban food?              

214
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:51,837
  Yeah, it's part of the Spanish
             influence in Cuba. 

215
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,972

  -Nice little sweetness there.

      Little bit more saltiness,

219
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,380
   Smells killer.               

220
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,382
             Tastes even better.

221
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,517
                 We serve it

00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,125
      So, today, we're making it
                 with bison.    

463
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,393
 -This is some vegan mayonnaise.
       -Essentially, yeah.      

464
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,195
 What is this hippie            
 mayonnaise called?             

465
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,332
   I'm going to start calling it
     hippie mayonnaise, but, um,

466
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,734
              I call it kind of 
      veggie rainbow mayonnaise.

467
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:17,935
   Veggie rainbow.              

468
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:21,071
    I think Guy's excitement    
    and his passion for food    

469
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,874
  was really contagious for me. 

470
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,675
       What the hell am I doing?
What do you need help with?     
 What are you doing?            

471
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,477
        -What am I doing?       
       -Get the onions in!      

472
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,145
             I'm like, really --

473
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,614
                You're making   
                 me nervous!    

474
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,282
The bison spice mixture.        

475
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,818
A little cayenne in there,      
as well, the chili powder.      

476
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,953
            -Exactly.           
       -And the "xactly."       

477
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,955
                And the love.   

478
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:40,091
     The brown basmati, put down
            the sautéed veggies,

479
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:41,959
          baby spinach, carrots.

480
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,294
            -Got it.            
          -Fresh mango.         

481
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,163
    Mango tango.                

482
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:48,298
  Holy Bombay bowl.             

483
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,902
  Super flavorful.              
Not bland, not boring.          

484
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,970
The thing that I'm actually     
  most wowed about              

485
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:56,440
 is that vegetarian             
  mayo concoction.              

486
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,844
It adds such a nice,            
velvety texture. Killer.        

487
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,846
         AMY: There was         
  this big construction project 

488
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:03,180
   going on across the street.  

489
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,515
                This is Amy.    
              She's the owner.  

490
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:07,184
       And Guy rounded up       
some of the construction workers

491
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,120
   and served them our bison.   

492
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:10,587
     -Wow, that's delicious.    
         -Oh, it's good.        

493
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,256
             Out of bounds, man.

494
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,925
        And the reaction        
      was really positive.      

495
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,527
       And they were like,      
       "Oh, I had no idea       

496
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,328
          organic food          
      could taste so good."     

497
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,931
         Made me stoked.        

498
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,465
We say it on "Triple D"         
    all the time.               

499
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,267
   If it's funky,               
    I'll find it.               

500
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,269
Got to check this out.          

501
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,837
     People were coming in,     
             asking,            

502
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,073
      "What are the dishes      
     that you made for Guy?"    

503
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:32,009
 There's been an enormous amount
   of, like, recipe requests.   

504
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,278
    We would just tell them,    
 you know, just come and see us.

505
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,880
    We're not going anywhere.   
If anything, we're going bigger.

506
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,083
     And, boy, did she ever.    

507
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:42,353
  The quaint, little Lotus Cafe 
 moved one block over and became

508
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:46,356
    the bigger, more spacious   
    Lotus Organic Restaurant.   

509
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:49,093
       AMY: So, we're more      
      than double our size.     

510
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,227
             FIERI:             
     And that gave her space    

511

       to create even more      
       righteous recipes,       

512

      like the elk sausage      
       biscuits and gravy.      

513
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,701
              AMY:              
     Elk biscuits and gravy     

514
00:18:56,703 --> 00:19:00,370
   is one of our most popular   
        breakfast items.        

515
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,840
     FIERI: The elk sausage     
is locally seasoned and sourced,

516
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,575
          and the gravy         
      is made all in-house      

517
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:07,111
  with a blend of coconut milk  
       and amaranth flour.      

518
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:09,981
     The elk gravy is unique    
     in that it's non-dairy.    

519
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,782
      It tastes really good     
       with the biscuits.       

520
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,717
             WOMAN:             
  That had a fantastic flavor,  

521
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,386
      things that are hard      
          to recreate.

and then something for everyone,

524
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:21,659
     that if it tastes good     
  prepared in this unique way,  

525
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,060
  then it will go on the menu.

       with flying colors.

       No meat, no dairy,       
       but full of flavor.      

529
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,868
   AMY: We use French lentils.  
 They're something that you can 

530
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,804

      sink your teeth into.     

531
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:37,207
 FIERI: And people go nuts over 
  Amy's homemade cashew cheese. 

532
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:40,011
      She soaks and blends      
  the cashews, garlic, and salt 

533
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:43,080
  until it has the consistency  
    of a soft ricotta cheese.

 The lasagna noodles are ready.

537
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:52,557

538
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,026

  when "Triple D" contacted me, 

541
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,434
