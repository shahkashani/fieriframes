1
00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:03,135
   Hey, there. I'm Guy Fieri,   
     and we're rolling out,     

2
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:06,605
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

3
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,540
          This trip...          
                    Hey, kids.  

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:09,608
    ...the Camaro's racing...   

5
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,276
This is just everybody          
   playing together.            

6
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,412
     ...from land to sea...     

7
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:14,813
           How do we start this?

8
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,415
   ...in Olympia, Washington.   

9
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,816
 [ As Groucho Marx ] Well, I'll 
 tell you something, sweetheart.

10
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,751
    The Brew Pub pairing suds   

11
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:21,420
   with housemade specialties.  

12
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:23,088
                Holy cannoli.   

13
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,623
 In Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, 

14
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:28,293
    the seaside tradition...    

15
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:30,295
    100,000 people a summer.    

16
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,697
     ...reeling in tourists     
        and locals alike.       

17
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,234
        When it's good,         
        the locals know.        

18
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,103
   And in Syracuse, New York,   
    the underground joint...    

19
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:39,705
                  Magical.      

20
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:41,173
...serving up homemade twists...

21
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:43,442
       Do you sleep upside down 
            in a dark cave?     

22
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:44,576
        ...on tradition.        

23
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:48,847
                Who came up     
           with this crazy idea?

24
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,115
      Me.                       
               This is whacked. 

25
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:53,685
That's all right here, right now
         on "Triple D."         

26
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,934
 You remember the beer Olympia? 
              Oly?              

27
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:11,403
     They had that tag line,    
        "It's the water."       

28
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,805
    Well, I'm in that town --   
      Olympia, Washington.      

29
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:15,941
    So, when you show up        
    to a town like this,        
    what are you looking for?   

30
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,342
        A great brewpub.        

31
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:20,079
  But not just a great brewpub, 
    one that has great food.    

32
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:23,182
 The place I'm told to check out
   is right here at Fish Tale.  

33
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,086
       Here you are, Todd.      

34
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:29,420
     Thank you.                 

35
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:31,156
        WOMAN: As far as        
     variety and selection,     

36
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,958
           it's really          
      the best place to go.     

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,362
FIERI: It's been Olympia's go-to
spot for craft beer since 1993. 

38
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,566
How many different types of beer
        do you guys make?       

39
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:42,100
  SHELL: We're making about 20  
           on average.          

40
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:44,436
  And then we do seasonals and  
 special one-offs all the time. 

41
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:48,640
   And to pair with Brewmaster  
   Brad Shell's high-end suds,  

42
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,042
    Pub Manager Max DeJarnatt   

43
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:52,978
   knows the food's got to be   
       off the hook, too.       

44
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:55,180
    We're brewing craft beer,   
 so we want to have craft food. 

45
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,182
        And people here,        
they want to eat some good food.

46
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,450
           If you're gonna drink
            that kind of beer,  

47
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,018
                you should have 
             that kind of food. 
            Exactly.            

48
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:03,988
 FIERI: So, Chef Kerin Lewis... 

49
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:05,390
              Crab cannelloni.  

50
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,725
      ...is going local...      

51
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,394
    We really feel like it's    
 a good flavor of the Northwest.

52
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,729
  FIERI: ...with fish and chips 
     made from Alaskan cod,     

53
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,665
 and Northwest russet potatoes, 

54
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,668
        to a clam steamer       
 sourced from nearby Hood Canal,

55
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,203
      or a crab cannelloni      

56
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:21,206
 stuffed with Alaskan Bay shrimp
       and Dungeness crab       

57
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,442
straight out of the Puget Sound.

58
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,410
        Crab cannelloni.        

59
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,845
      It's just delicious.      

60
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:29,414
           How do we start this?

61
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,816
     First of all,              
I puree my bay shrimp.          

62
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:33,619
       I don't know about this. 

63
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,621
                 It's like      
           shrimp cotton candy. 

64
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,689
      Yeah.                     

65
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:38,890
                 Hey, kids.     

66
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,359
            So, now we take     
       the shrimp cotton candy, 

67
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:41,893
       and what are we gonna do 
               with it?         

68
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:44,096
       Shrimp "Ice, Ice, Baby?" 

69
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:45,964
     We go with                 
 the Dungeness crab.            

70
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,065
                That, I like.   

71
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:50,368
Lemon zest, then we have nutmeg,
          some parsley.         

72
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:51,903
                  Okay.         

73
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,839
             A little egg yolk. 
Egg yolk.                       

74
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,974
Sauteed shallots.               
 How do you spell "cannelloni," 
                 by the way?    

75
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,643
  C-a-n-n-e-l-l-o--             

76
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,177
               E-g-g-r-o-l-l?   

77
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,512
   Yeah, egg roll.              

78
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,313
   This is what you're gonna use
       for your pasta? Nice.    

79
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,783
When I started making it,       
  I used pasta sheets.          

80
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,118
And they were too thick         
   for this texture.            

81
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,654
         This is a thin texture.

82
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:10,989
 But when you get some of those 
 pasta sheets and they swell up,

83
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,859
           they're kind of like 
    the thickness of a lasagna. 
Right.                          

84
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,394
                  So,           
       what's gonna happen now? 

85
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,329
   Ricotta cheese               
   and parmesan.                

86
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,531
                 Excellent.     

87
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,132
                 Some gloves?   
  Some gloves.                  

88
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:22,734
I play with my food.            

89
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,203
       You play with your food? 
 Mm-hmm.                        

90
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:25,803
 You want to break up           
 the crab,                      

91
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,739
 but you want to leave it       
 so you can still tell it's --  

92
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,474
   You want to have some texture
           of the crab.         

93
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,609
    Some texture.               

94
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,143
         You want me to bust out
          any of these sheets?  

95
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:33,612
        Sure,                   
I need three of them.           

96
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:34,880
                 Chop, chop.    

97
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,349
       So, here's the thing     
   when it comes to these skins.

98
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,885
               Make sure        
       that you keep them cool, 

99
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,553
and make sure that you keep them
        from drying out,        

100
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,088
         'cause they are pastas.

101
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:44,556
                    Whoa!       
                Holy cannoli.   

102
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,958
  Yeah, that, too.              

103
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:48,760
              You got this down 
             to a science, girl.

104
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,296
 [ As Groucho Marx ] Well, I'll 
 tell you something, sweetheart.

105
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:52,363
         [ Normal voice ] Okay? 
  Okay.                         

106
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,032
   Then we'll cut them in half? 
Mm-hmm.                         

107
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,167
                That's good.    
                I was scared.   

108
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:57,369
     And now I'm gonna make     
  the roasted red pepper sauce  

109
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:58,570
 for the cannelloni.            

110
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:02,641
    Garlic butter               
  and heavy cream.              

111
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:05,176
           And then we have     
       the roasted red peppers. 

112
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,579
FIERI: So, the roasted          
red peppers are pureed?         

113
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:08,713
                   Mm-hmm.      

114
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:12,183
       Once it gets really hot, 
          I add the parmesan    

115
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,253
            a little at a time  
           until it gets thick. 

116
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:15,586
               So, basically,   

117
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,855
       this is an alfredo       
 with roasted red pepper sauce. 

118
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:20,124
 Very nice. And that's gonna go 
          over the top.

00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,580
    and then we put them on the 
   grill for about five minutes.

232
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,381
Give a nice, little crust       
      to them.                  
                     Oh, yeah.  

233
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:38,683
     Okay, and that's my gravy. 

234
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,987
                 Okay, well,    
              we're dishing up. 

235
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:45,757
We have our bangers marked      
  and the gravy we made.        

236
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,862
And a little fresh parsley.     
That's my bangers and mash.     

237
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,001
                    Mmm.        
                Very floral.    

238
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:59,737
              I like that lemon 
             that comes through.

239
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,873
             A little nutmeg    
         on the backside of it. 

240
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,008
              Nutmeg's the key. 

241
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:07,078
         This is a really nice  
       consistency of the meat. 

242
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,548
             Mmm. Good-tasting. 

243
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,617
      You definitely get a lot  
     of that beer coming through

244
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,153
and then a little grill to it so
it's not just a boiled sausage. 

245
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,889
         And the gravy, come on.
             Check that out.    

246
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,025
                Impressed.      
           Nice job. Delicious. 

247
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:21,158
     Thank you.                 

248
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,894
           She gave me knuckles.

249
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:26,631
       It's fresh,              
and it's prepared right.        

250
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,433
 It gives me everything I need. 

251
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:30,168
  Food's fantastic,             
the service is great,           

252
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,370
and we made a lot of our friends
           down here.           

253
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,173
    We're here all the time,    
    and we really enjoy it.     

254
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,842
         Nice, guys. Thank you. 
            Congratulations.    

255
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,784
        FIERI: Up next...       
                      Spank it. 

256
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,986
 ...we're headed to Kitty Hawk, 
        North Carolina...       

257
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,054
  Chug, chug, chug.             

258
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,989
            ...where            
   a summertime institution...  

259
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,590
 What do you know about risotto,
              son?              

260
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,626
    ...is serving up the sea.   

261
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,034
  Ah, one of the things I love  
       about "Triple D" --      

262
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,704
   it takes me to big cities,   
   it takes me to small towns,  

263
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,839
           it takes me          
    to historical landmarks.    

264
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,041
       This is Kitty Hawk,      
         North Carolina.        

265
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,044
      You know, Kitty Hawk,     
      the Wright brothers?      

266
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,580
 This is where aviation started.
    I mean, it's incredible.    

267
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,382
       You know what else       
         is incredible?         

268
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:18,716
        100 years later,        

269
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,120
   this restaurant is serving   
  over 100,000 people a summer. 

270
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,989
   This is the Black Pelican.   

271
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,860
                Shrimp grit.    

272
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:31,062
     It's my favorite place     
          on the beach.         

273
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:34,065
    It's got just about what    
    everybody would want        
    in a place down here.       

274
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,866
    Hey, y'all. Here you go.    

275
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,335
           It's real-deal food? 

276
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,470
     Absolutely.                

277
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:41,539
Fresh, always tasty,            
chef's very creative.           

278
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,341
             FIERI:             
   That's Chef Jason Smith...   

279
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,542
   Shrimp app up.               

280
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:46,544
             ...who,            
    like the Wright brothers,   

281
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,546
   has a bit of history here.   

282
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:53,051
 Well, I started out here when  
 I was 16, doing the steam bar. 

283
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,153
                 You got veg    
             for the pork shank?

284
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,023
     After years of honing      
     his craft elsewhere...     

285
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,824
    Table 10 up.                

286
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,093
         ...he came back        
    to the place locals love.   

287
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,695
It's got a little bit           
   of everything.               

288
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,163
        Cowboy burger up.       

289
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,165
 Whatever you want,             
   they've got it.              

290
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,833
     What is it,                
   everybody says,              

291
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,302
  "Oh, you go to Black Pelican, 
    you got to have the..."?    

292
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,837
               Citrus rosemary  
               brine chicken.   

293
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,507
         Citrus rosemary        
         brine chicken.         

294
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:17,508
     I like the combination     
           of flavors           

295
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,177
   with the citrus background.  

296
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,978
    And whatever the glaze is   
          is excellent.         

297
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,716
   All right, so, we start with 
    our airline chicken breast  

298
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,452
           into our brining pan.

299
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:28,719
                   Garlic.      
 Fresh garlic.                  

300
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,188
 A whole rosemary stem's        
 in there.                      

301
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,390
          Peppercorn.           
          Kosher salt.          

302
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,657
   A bunch of it.               

303
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,659
      And then we have just     
granulated sugar -- white sugar.

304
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,862
    Okay.                       
              We got an orange. 

305
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,264
          We're gonna throw     
     the whole orange in there, 

306
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,466
    but we're gonna go ahead    
and squeeze some juice in, also,

307
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,134
           just to make sure -- 
           Oh, thank you, sir.  

308
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,535
                   Limes.       

309
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:45,603
                   Water.       

310
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,338
           Okay, now,           
  how long is this gonna brine? 

311
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,708
                Usually,        
         about 24 hours is nice.

312
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,012
Chug, chug.                     
            [ Chuckling ] Yeah. 

313
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:56,280
            I like to do        
            the skin side down. 

314
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,850
    That's really the main side 
    we're gonna mark just for   
    presentation purposes.      

315
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,286
 Pour some chicken stock on it. 
Homemade chicken stock?         

316
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:03,822
                  That's right. 
Of course it is.                

317
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,757
   Put it in the convection oven
          at 500 degrees.       

318
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,826
      So, we're gonna get our   
   smoked-gouda mashed potatoes.

319
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,761
Oh, I love smoked gouda!        

320
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,829
                  Good.         

321
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:11,963
     Demi-glace?                
                    Demi-glace. 

322
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,298
       Do that around the bowl. 

323
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,900
   This is not what I expected  
to find in a seafood restaurant.

324
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,769
         Well, you have to serve
              chicken, too.     

325
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,504
               There's always   
             some chicken-eater.

326
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:20,571
   Chicken-eater.               

327
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,106
     There's our chicken breast.

328
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,709
     See, we got the grill marks
        nice and caramelized.   

329
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:27,912
       And then we top it       
 with our sauté of baby spinach,

330
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,249
       mushrooms, oven-roasted  
     tomatoes, and feta cheese. 

331
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:32,851
              That's the citrus 
              rosemary chicken. 

332
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,721
      Mmm.                      

333
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:41,192
  Look at how juicy             
  that chicken is.              

334
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:43,528
      We don't want anybody     
  to take, you know, first seat 

335
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:44,729
in the orchestra on this.       

336
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,331
 I mean, this is just everybody 
        playing together.       

337
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,867
  Spinach, mushroom, tomatoes,  
         the demi-glace,        

338
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:50,802
  the smoked-gouda              
  mashed potatoes,              

339
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,537
  and the citrus brine chicken. 

340
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,874
Had the Wright brothers         
   had some of this,            

341
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,075
they would have said,           
"Guess what. We flew.           

342
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,211
 "Oh, and you got to try        
the citrus brine chicken        

343
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,412
over at the Black Pelican."     

344
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,548

346

 of the seasoning and the sauce.

         like that, too.        

351

376
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:10,147
     Sweet corn. We put that in

00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:12,750

  Wanchese risotto              

389

 is because these scallops      
come in from Port Wanchese.

  of brown sugar and molasses.  

455
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,935

       evenly throughout.

459
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,477
                Who came up     
           with this crazy idea?

460
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:01,946
       Me.                      
              This is whacked.  

461
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:09,287
   What in the wild, wild world 
   of sports is going on here?  

462
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,888
Well, part of our fajitas       

463
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,357
is the marinated onions         
     and peppers.               

464
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,758
                  Magical.      

465
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,293
We start with our onions.       

466
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:19,630
Sliced grilled peppers.         

467
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,765
      And then                  
we make our marinade.           

468
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:24,735
You start with orange juice     
      and soy sauce.            

469
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,839
     Olive oil.                 

470
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:30,475
We have our minced garlic.      

471
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,078
    Brown sugar.                

472
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,447
    Black pepper.               

473
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,714
   Fresh cilantro.              

474
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,185
So, we mix it together, and then
    we throw a ladle of this    

475
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,322
          on top                
of our grilled vegetables.      

476
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,857
 So, it just gets a little brief
  introduction to it like this? 

477
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,259
These are good to go.           

478
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:49,927
         And then heat them up  
       and they're ready to go. 
Correct.                        

479
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,095
                I like that.    

480
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,730
               All right,       
         so, we got the sausage.

481
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,466
          [ Sizzling ]          

482
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,668
You're gonna bring those        
       up to temp,              

483
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,403
get them nice and warm,         

484
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,738
and then we're gonna finish them
       in the salamander.       

485
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,742
  Peppers and onions            
on the sizzle platter.          

486
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,344
         What do you want them, 
         on the sizzle platter? 
 Yep.                           

487
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,146
               Sizzle, sizzle.  

488
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:10,815
We're gonna break them down     
       just a hair.             

489
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,150
 We're gonna caramelize         
the sugars into the meat,       

490
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,286
  and it's gonna put            
this little, black edge         

491
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,754
   right around the outside of  
 each one of the sausage rings. 

492
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,957
   All right, so,               
sausage looking good.           

493
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,092
                Look at that.   

494
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,694
 Leave that right there.        
We'll get our underliner.       

495
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,298
           It's the Paul Bunyan 
              fajita platter?   

496
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,166
           How many is this for,
                 6 or 12?       

497
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,235
This is a one serve.            
                    One person? 

498
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,505
  Here, put a little            
shredded cheddar Jack.          

499
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,308
 And we sell it.                
                   [ Chuckles ] 

500
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,544
     That's it.                 
                     All right. 

501
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,986
       All the little things -- 

502
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,722
       marinating it in molasses
           and brown sugar,     

503
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,123
             roasting the onions
              and the peppers,  

504
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:55,192
             and then adding    
         the citrus marinade -- 

505
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,928
         all those little twists
            make it something   

506
00:19:57,964 --> 00:19:59,230
              that you probably 
             haven't had before.

507
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,935
   Sweet, heat, crunchy veggies,
          soft tortillas.       

508
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,370
       Yeah.                    
                  Nice job.     

509
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,372
       Sweet fire fajita.       

510
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,541
    WOMAN: There are so many    
   different flavors going on.  

511
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,811
    The sausage is obviously    
  the showpiece, but, you know, 

512
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,746
     everything just kind of    
   works together really well.  

513
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,949
   It's fantastic. Delicious.   

514
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:20,350
    WOMAN: The food is great.   
         It's succulent.        

515
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,286
     Everybody's taste buds     
      are gonna be touched      

516
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,555
    when they come down here.   

517
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,490
    Sunday brunch               
  or a Sunday brew.             

518
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:27,558
       It's always on the money.

519
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,427
     It's just so much fun.     
           We love it.          

520
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,228
   David does a fantastic job.  

521
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,630
               How do you       
         put all this together? 

522
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,232
   Surround myself              
 with great people.             

523
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:35,299
           That's my best line. 
   Yep.                         

524
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:36,400
             Kudos, my brother. 

525
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:42,039
  So, that's it for this trip,  
        but don't worry.        

526
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,775
  There's plenty more Triple-D  
  joints all over the country.  

527
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:46,710
     I'll be looking for you    
            next week           

528
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,513
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

529
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,848
Hey, listen, man.               
I'm just trying to get          
in the flow of things.          

530
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,918
   The sunglasses --            
you got that all wrong.         

531
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,121
   On my head? Come on.         
That's way too "Baywatch."
