                   NOW TRY THAT.

96
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,823
OH, ARE YOU SURE?               
                            YES.

122
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47,419
WHEN I THINK OF MAMA E's,       

123

         IT'S PIG FEET.         

126
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,362
IT'S REAL SOUL FOOD.            
           DELICIOUS.           

127
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,432
I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE EVER     
  GOT DOWN WITH THE HOOF.       
           THE HOOF IS THE BEST.

128
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,268
GIVE ME A HIGH HOOF.            
                      HIGH HOOF.

00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,036
ALL RIGHT.                      
                  OH, YEAH, NOW.

130
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,172
SO ANYHOW, WATER FIRST.

                I CAN'T TELL YOU

  LET ME ASK IF YOU             
IF THIS IS WHAT IT IS.          
                         MM-HMM.

137
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:23,321

                 WE JUST PUT IN.

138
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:25,323
OKAY.                           
            THEN WE'RE GONNA ADD
             SOME BLACK PEPPER. 

139
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,125
             ADDING THE VINEGAR 
                  TO THIS.      

140
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,327
         VINEGAR'S GONNA TAKE   
       SOME OF THAT SWINE-Y OUT.

141
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,329
    OH, WAIT,                   
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.               
                 I SAID SWINE-Y.

142
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:33,598
OKAY.                           
            THEN WE ADD A LITTLE
           BIT MORE WATER THERE.

143
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,467
                NOW WE'RE DONE. 

144
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:38,136
YOUR FOIL, SIR. WRAP IT UP.     
   LET ME GET THE OVEN.         

145
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:41,339
      OH, MY GOSH, WHAT IS THIS,
         CENTER OF THE EARTH?   
                 YES.           

146
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,942
 I'D WEIGH 95 POUNDS IF I WORKED
  IN THIS KITCHEN. THIS IS HOT. 

147
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,744
HOUR AND A HALF.                
            HOUR AND A HALF.    
       PULL 'EM OUT OF THE OVEN.

148
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,082
                     PULL THAT  
                   OFF OF THERE.
MAKE SURE YOU GET ME            
AN AL DENTE PIG FEET.           

149
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:53,151
     SO THAT LOOKS LIKE         
A RATIO OF, LIKE, 50% FAT...    
                            FAT.

150
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,353
50% MEAT.                       
                      THAT'S IT.

151
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:57,756
   SO THAT'S LIKE AN EXTRA      
20 MINUTES ON THE TREADMILL.    

152
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,957
             BUT I DON'T DO IT. 

153
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:03,295
 MMM, REALLY GOOD.              
THE FLAVOR'S MONEY.             

154
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,297
      IT'S CHEWY,               
BUT IT'S SUPER TENDER,          

155
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,432
SO IT'S BEEN COOKED DOWN        
     THE RIGHT WAY.             
                             MM.

156
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,969
BUT THEN THE FAT IS LIKE BUTTER.
    IT IS MELT IN YOUR MOUTH.   

157
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,971
THE SAUCE IS OUTSTANDING.       

158
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,440
 THAT'S SOME FLAVORFUL          
HOOF BROTH YOU'VE MADE.         

159
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,442
                   I DON'T KNOW 
                   WHAT TO SAY. 

160
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:19,644
      IT'S SIMILAR TO BACON.    
     IT'S SALTED, CURED MEAT.   

161
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,181
GARLIC AND PEPPER               
    AND HERBS.                  
           IT'S JUST            
      A FAMILY TRADITION,       

162
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,183
    SOMETHING THAT WE'VE DONE   
       SINCE WE WERE KIDS.      

163
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,452
YOU WANT CORNBREAD              
    OR A ROLL?                  
           CORNBREAD.           

164
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,387
      BUT IT IS SOMETHING IN    
   REMEMBRANCE OF THE ANCESTORS.

165
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,790
      IT'S FOOD THAT COMES      
        FROM THE HEART.         
    HEY, GRANDMA,               
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

KNOCKING IT OUT?                
              OH, I'M SO PROUD. 
             MY HEART IS SO BIG.

167

     GONE WILD RIGHT HERE, BUT--

175

179

      REALLY GOOD TAMALES.      

193
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,958

FLAVOR UP THE MASA.             

195
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,228
              I'VE MADE A LOT   
           OF TAMALES IN MY DAY,

196
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,564
     BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE 
      EVER FLAVORED MY MIXTURE. 

197
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,500
               GAUJILLO PEPPERS?
     ACTUALLY,                  
THOSE ARE CASCABEL.             

198
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,702
                    I WAS JUST  
                 GONNA SAY THAT.
YEAH.                           

199
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:53,104
   THESE HAVE BEEN RECONSTITUTED
         IN SOME HOT WATER.     
EXACTLY.                        

200
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,507
  POUR IN A LITTLE BIT          
OF SALT THERE, GARLIC...        
                          CUMIN.

201
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,509
AND THEN A LITTLE BIT           
   OF THAT LIQUID               

202
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,511
THAT WE STEEPED                 
THE PEPPERS IN.                 
                            YES.

203
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,913
AND NOW WE'RE GONNA             
 MAKE SOME NOISE.               
               HIT THE THROTTLE.

204
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,449
     SURE. SURE.                
WE CAN GO WITH THAT.            

205
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:06,451
        SCARED YOU A LITTLE BIT,
               DIDN'T IT?       
IT DID, YEAH.                   

206
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,053
ALL RIGHT. SO HOW DO YOU COOK   
THE PORK BUTT FOR THE TAMALES?  

207
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,055
           PUT IT IN A STOCKPOT,
                 COVER IT,      

208
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,724
      ADD SOME ONIONS, GARLIC,  
     LITTLE BIT OF SALT, PEPPER.

209
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,726
                 COOK IT UNTIL  
               IT'S JUST TENDER.

210
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,996
 WE PULL THE PORK FROM THE BONE.
        IT GETS CHOPPED.        

211
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,532
         WE PUT IT IN A PAN     
     WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LARD, 

212
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,534
      A LITTLE BIT MORE GARLIC, 
     SALT WITH SPANISH PAPRIKA, 

213
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,469
              SOME CHILI POWDER,
                PURéED CHILIES, 

214
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,871
   FRIES UP AND THAT'S WHAT GOES
       IN THE PORK TAMALES.     

215
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,141
                 NOW WE'RE GONNA
                 MAKE THE MASA. 
  FIRST I'M GONNA               
ADD THE CORN FLOUR.             

216
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,077
       NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD      
  SOME GARLIC,<i> COMINO</i> OR CUMIN. 

217
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:36,147
                 A LITTLE BIT   
               OF BAKING POWDER.
BAKING POWDER, SOME LARD,       
    AND NOW WE'VE GOT           

218
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,550
   SOME OF THE STOCK THAT       
WE COOKED OUR PORK BUTTS IN.    

219
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,952
                HOW MANY LADLES?
PROBABLY ABOUT                  
ANOTHER FOUR.                   

220
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,555
    WE ALSO STILL HAVE TO ADD IN
          OUR CHILI SAUCE.      
CORRECT.                        

221
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,557
YOU SAY CHUG.                   

222
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:48,093
HOW'S THAT?                     
          YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.   
       ISN'T THAT A GREAT COLOR?

223
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,495
WE'RE JUST GETTING, YOU KNOW,   
ALL THE GRITTINESS OUT OF IT.   

224
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,497
     GET THE HEEL               
OF YOUR HAND IN THERE.          

225
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:55,099
     SO WE'RE                   
PRETTY MUCH THERE.              
              OKAY, SO IT'S TIME
                TO DO TAMALES.  

226
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,101
WE USE THIS HIGH-TECH DEVICE    
     TO SPREAD THE MASA.        

227
00:08:57,137 --> 00:09:00,505
      OH, LOOK WHAT IT SAYS     
RIGHT THERE--"PROPERTY OF NASA."

228
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:02,641
                 THE CORN HUSK, 
                 WHICH IS DRIED,

229
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:05,043
        THEN SOAKED IN WATER    
    IS WHAT WE USE AS THE BASIS.
YEAH.                           

230
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,511
WE'RE GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BIT   
OF THE MASA, WE GO THAT HIGH,   

231
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,513
AND THEN GO TO THE END.         

232
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,515
HERE, I'LL LET YOU              
  GET IN THERE.                 
                     OH, THANKS.

233
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,918
AND EVEN SPREAD.                
           WE HAVE TO GET ENOUGH
              TO THE END NOW.   

234
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,920
SO NOW WE'RE GOING              
  WITH THE PORK.                
                           OKAY.

235
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,922
YOU WANT TO GET                 
ENOUGH IN THERE,                

236
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,458
BUT YOU DON'T WANT              
 TO GO TOO CRAZY.               
      I'VE GONE TAMALE GONE WILD
           RIGHT HERE, BUT--    

237
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,627
     NO, NO, NO,                
THAT'S ACTUALLY GOOD.           

238
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:25,063
 WE GO LEFT SIDE FIRST, AND THEN
   BRING THAT OTHER SIDE OVER,  

239
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:27,432
AND THEN JUST BRING             
THAT TAIL FORWARD,              

240
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:30,869
   AND THEN                     
THERE YOU GO.                   
        AND THEN ROLL IT UP.    
    IT'S EXACTLY HOW I MAKE 'EM.

241
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,871
     AND THEN YOU JUST START    
  YOUR LITTLE STACKING PROCESS. 

242
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,873
    WE LOAD UP ALL THE TAMALES, 

243
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,875
      STEAM 'EM HOUR AND A HALF,
              TWO HOURS.        
YEP.                            

244
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,743
               THIS COMES OFF...
YES.                            

245
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,279
                    AND NOW     
              WE GRAB THESE OUT?
 YES, ONE OF THOSE,             
OR A COUPLE OF THOSE.           

246
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,281

UH, SURE.                       

247
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,750
                       NO, WAIT.
THANK YOU.

                AND TENDER.     

249
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:52,089
                    THAT'S      
             A FANTASTIC TAMALE.
IT DOESN'T NEED ANYTHING        
 OTHER THAN HOT SAUCE.          

250
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,091

        IT NEEDS HOT SAUCE. MMM.
