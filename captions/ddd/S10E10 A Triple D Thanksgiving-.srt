TO THE CONFIT.                  
                 THAT'S CORRECT.

CORN BREAD EFFORT               

278
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,318
IS JUST TO MAKE CORN BREAD      
  TO MAKE INTO STUFFING?        
                        CORRECT.

279

OKAY.                           

482
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,505
                  JUST TO ABSORB
                 ALL THE LIQUID.
INTO THE BIG CHUNKS             
     OF BREAD.                  

483
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,507
WHAT ARE THESE LITTLE           
   TASTY MORSELS?

          THAT PAN RIGHT THERE. 

487
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,516
                         OOH!

DOWN FOR AN HOUR.               

491
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,591

OF THAT MOISTURE OUT,           

492
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,659
  JUST SITS THERE               
AND COMPACTS DOWN.              

493
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,729

  LITTLE CANDIED WALNUTS.       

494
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:27,331

  A LITTLE BIT.                 

496
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,735
THESE CANDIED WALNUTS TASTE     
     LIKE PUMPKIN PIE.          

497
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:33,671
I'M NOT A BIG BREAD PUDDING FAN,
  I GOTTA BE HONEST WITH YOU.   
                             NO?

498
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,740
NO, IT'S THE EGG RATIO.         
  IT'S NOT NECESSARY.           

499
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,408
  SHOULD BE ABLE TO PUT         
SOMETHING ELSE IN THERE--       

500
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,744
CHICKEN STOCK                   
WOULD BE GOOD.                  
     OH, OKAY, WELL, WE'RE GONNA
        SEE IF YOU LIKE THIS.   

501
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,547
I'M A FAN OF THIS               
 BREAD COMPANY,                 

502
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,749
 SO I GOTTA BELIEVE THAT WITH   
THE BREAD BEING CHEWY AND ALL-- 

503
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:46,417
             OH, IT'S WONDERFUL.
                 RUM SAUCE--    

504
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,553
              CREAM, SUGAR, RUM,
                  CORNSTARCH.   

505
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,755
   HOW DO YOU THINK             
I SHOULD GET AFTER IT?          

506
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:52,557
   ATTACK IT                    
FROM THE LEFT?                  

507
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,758
GONNA GO RIGHT                  
IN THE CENTER.                  

508
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,561
      LOOK AT THAT.             
SMELLS LIKE PUMPKIN PIE.        

509
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,497
   I'M GONNA BE EATING          
THESE WORDS FOR A WHILE.        

510
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,699
    THAT IS SOME                
TASTY BREAD PUDDING.            

511
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,835
  IT'S GOT GOOD CRUNCH.         
IT'S NOT PUMPKIN MADNESS.       

512
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,703
   THE RUM SAUCE ISN'T          
SUPER OVER-THE-TOP SWEET.       

513
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,039
COULD BE THE HOLIDAYS           
      OR WHAT,                  

514
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:10,707
   THERE'S SOMETHING            
ABOUT THAT COMBO THAT--         

515
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,644
I JUST ATE FOUR MORE BITES      
 THAN I EXPECTED I WOULD.       

516
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,513
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.             
     NICE JOB.                  
                      THANK YOU.

MIRLITON SOUP.
