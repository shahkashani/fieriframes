      AND HOW MANY KRAUT BURGERS
            WILL THIS MAKE?     
ABOUT 18 KRAUT BURGERS.         

96
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,220
          HOW MANY KRAUT BURGERS
           DO YOU SELL IN A DAY?
UPWARDS OF 200.                 

97
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,889
                   YOU DO THIS  
                TEN TIMES A DAY?
AT LEAST.                       

98
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,424
THIS WAY, I DON'T HAVE          
  TO GO TO THE GYM.             

99
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,960
      YEAH, YOU JUST WALK AROUND
        WITH ONE BIG, HUGE ARM. 
(laughs)                        

100
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:50,896
NOW WE'LL FORM IT INTO A BALL,  
  COVER IT, AND LET IT RISE.    

101
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,699
 I'M GONNA PUNCH THE DOUGH.     
FLOUR THE TABLE. DUMP IT OUT.   

102
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:55,767
PUT A LITTLE FLOUR ON TOP.      
      FLIP IT OVER.             

103
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,902
NOW WE'LL ROLL IT OUT.          
                   OH. JUST KEEP
                     DOING THIS.

104
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,172
      I'LL HAVE, LIKE, 20 POUNDS
     OF THIS FILLING IN ME. MMM.

105
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:02,974
    I'M GONNA TAKE MY           
BIG SQUARE KNIFE, CUT IT.       
              NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

106
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,777
I TAKE A PIECE OF THE DOUGH,    
  AND I ROLL IT YET AGAIN.      

107
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,845
AND THEN GIVE IT A FLIP.        
   STRETCH IT A BIT.            

108
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,849
TAKE A FULL CUP OF FILLING.     
PLOP IT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE.     
                            WOW.

109
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,451
  AND BRING IT UP               
AND START PINCHING.             

110
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:13,986
SEAL IT UP GOOD.                
                            MMM.

111
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:16,454
                CAN YOU MAKE ONE
                  WITH CHEESE?  
PEPPER JACK CHEESE              
OR AMERICAN CHEESE?             

112
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,323
TUCK THE CORNERS.               
                  AND THAT'S IT.

113
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:21,526
          THROW 'EM ON THE TRAY,
               IN THE OVEN.     
IN THE OVEN THEY GO,            
 15 MINUTES AT 350.             

114
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,662
        ALL RIGHT,              
THEY'RE READY TO COME OUT.      
                             OH.

115
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,532
                    OH, OH, OH. 
                   LOOK AT THAT.

116
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,600
                 MMM.           
     THAT'S LIKE A MEAT PRETZEL.

117
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,537
           THIS IS CRAZY.       
    THE PEPPER--OHH, PRIME TIME.

118
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,674

          IT'S MOIST. IT'S SOFT.

119
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,743
                 IT'S DOUGHY.   
              IT'S PRETZEL-LIKE.

120
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,877
            JUST FOR SENSE      
      OF TELEVISION AND SCIENCE,

121
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,214

       THE EGG NOODLES          
FOR OUR BEAN AND NOODLE SOUP.   

139

WE DO AT LEAST FOUR BATCHES     
     OF NOODLES A DAY.          

140
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:24,989

ADDING OUR FLOUR.               

141
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,692
                           OKAY.
PUT THE LID ON THIS.            
 START IT RUNNING.              

142
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,662
  STREAM IN THE EGGS.           
AND I HAVE TO SHAKE IT.         

143
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,463
               IT MIGHT BE      
        ON ITS LAST PASTA BATCH.

144
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,534
A LITTLE BIT OF WATER           
TILL I SEE IT FORMING.          
                 THERE YOU GO.  
                YOU CAN HEAR IT.

145
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:37,536
AND THAT'S IT.                  
                           OKAY.

146
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,804
THEN I DUMP IT TO THE TABLE.    
       I FORM A BALL.           

147
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,341
        AND IT RESTS            
FOR A MINIMUM OF 30 MINUTES.    

148
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,742
                FOLLOW THE BALL.
                FOLLOW THE BALL.

149
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,745
                  OKAY, PICK IT.
(gasps)                         

150
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:49,147
IT'S MAGIC.                     
                       AH HA HA!

151
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,949
THEN I KIND OF                  
JUST FORM IT.                   
                           OKAY.

152
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:54,485
 CUT IT INTO SIX PORTIONS.      
THEN I FLATTEN IT OUT A BIT.    

153
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,821
             SO IT'LL GO THROUGH
                 THE MACHINE.   

154
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,556
  THEN I GO THROUGH ANOTHER.    
IT'LL GET 'EM A LITTLE THINNER. 

155
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,826
THEY GO THROUGH AGAIN.          
               NO FLOUR ON THIS.

156
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,627
NOPE, THEN ONCE THEY START      
   TO DRY A LITTLE BIT,         

157
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,096
    I JUST GIVE 'EM A FLIP,     
DRY 'EM JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE. 

158
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,497
OKAY, NOW WE CUT.               

159
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,900
 WE'RE DOING A FETTUCCINE CUT.  
YOU JUST KEEP KNOCKING THIS OUT.

160
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,902
WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE SOUP       
       WITH THIS?               
                        CORRECT.

161
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,905
           WHAT ARE WE INTO NOW?
NOW WE ARE GONNA                
PRESSURE OUR HAM                

162
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,774
     TO START THE BROTH         
FOR OUR BEAN AND NOODLE SOUP.   

163
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,776
  WE USE THE SHANK PORTION      
SO WE GET THE NICE BIG BONE.    

164
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,710
     AND JUST WATER             
AND THEN PUT THE LID ON.        

165
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,713
       THAT'S A PRESSURE COOKER.
CRANK THE HEAT.                 

166
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,783
  THEN IT GOES                  
FOR 45 MINUTES.                 
   AND THEN WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
     WITH THE REST OF THE HAM?  

167
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,718
WE LEAVE THE BONE               
    IN THERE,                   

168
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,987
AND WE ADD THE REST OF THE HAM  
   IN THE PRESSURE COOKER,      

169
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,790
     AND THAT GOES              
FOR ANOTHER 30 MINUTES.         
              NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

170
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,326
   NOW WE'RE GONNA COOL IT.     
WE'RE GONNA SCOOP OUT THE MEAT. 
                           OKAY.

171
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:36,061
  STRAIN THE BROTH              
AND CUBE UP THE HAM.            

172
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,730
   FINALLY, IT'S TIME TO MAKE   
THE FAMOUS BEAN AND NOODLE SOUP.
WE'RE GONNA START               

173
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,732
  WITH OUR CUBED HAM,           
ADD OUR STRAINED BROTH.         
                           OKAY.

174
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,800
PINTO BEANS GO IN,              
A LITTLE HAM BASE.              

175
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,803
AND THEN WE ADD A LITTLE WATER  
     TO FILL UP THE POT.        

176
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,805
  BRING IT TO A BOIL.           
THEN WE ADD THE NOODLES.        

177
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,807
AND THEN IT SIMMERS             
 10 TO 15 MINUTES.              

178
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:51,742
NOW WE ADD OUR MIXTURE          
      OF CREAMS.                
          THERE'S CREAM IN THIS?

179
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,212
SOUR CREAM, HEAVY CREAM,        
  AND EVAPORATED MILK.          

180
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:57,748
         THIS IS REALLY STRANGE.
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA            
 ADD SALT, PEPPER,              

181
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,751
A LITTLE GARLIC POWDER,         
     STIR THAT IN.              

182
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,353
               AND WHAT IS THIS?
(speaking indistinctly)         

183
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,955
                          READY?
YEP.                            

184
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,490
     AND THAT'S                 
BEAN AND NOODLE SOUP.           
                   AND HOW DO WE
                     SERVE IT?  

185
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:08,760
     WE EITHER SERVE IT         
IN A CUP OR IN A BREAD BOWL.    
            I WANT A BREAD BOWL.

186
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,029
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL DO BREAD BOWL. 
      THERE YOU GO, SIR.        

187

IN TWO SEPARATE MIXES LIKE THAT?

510
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,794
