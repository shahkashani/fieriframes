00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,201
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,669
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:07,139
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:08,207
          This trip...          

5
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:09,074
               Whoa! Whoa-oh!   

6
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,609
       ...we're hitting         
        the highway...          

7
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:11,410
    We're rolling               
  right along here.             

8
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:12,544
                We're rolling   
                right along.    

9
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,479
       ...for a righteous       
    cross-country road trip.    

10
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:15,881
     It's gonna                 
  change your life.             

11
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,750
 It's gonna change my waistband,
     is what it's gonna change. 

12
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:19,617
    First, it's Somers Point,   
          New Jersey...         

13
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:20,819
              This is awesome.  

14
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:23,288
        ...a local legend       
 dishing out hearty favorites...

15
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,157
 Don't give small portions here,
                do you, boss?   

16
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:27,159
    ...with a heapin' helpin'   
           of history.          

17
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,094
              That is about as  
  old-school legit as they come.

18
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,562
              Then              
     in Gilbert, Arizona...     

19
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:31,697
                     Oh!        

20
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:34,033
      ...a paisano pizzeria     
          going big...          

21
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:36,235
               This is a pizza  
        that eats like a dinner.

22
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:38,770
      ...serving up Sicily      
        to the Southwest.       

23
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,572
       I know everybody in Italy
           thinks you're crazy. 

24
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:41,840
            I like crazy people.

25
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:43,976
       And in Bakersfield,      
          California...         

26
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:46,845
                     Giddyup.   
       ...a barbecue stop       
     bringing in business...    

27
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,647
                [ Whistles ]    
             Good-looking bird. 

28
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,715
   ...by sending up the smoke   
          street-side.          

29
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,050
                     Oh.        

30
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,052
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

31
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,721
         on "Triple D."         

32
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,536
          So, I'm here          
  at Somers Point, New Jersey,  

33
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:12,738
       right on Bay Avenue      

34
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,806
      to check out a joint      
  that's got a lot of history.  

35
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:18,143
    Let's see. It started out   
  as a hotel back in the '70s.  

36
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:19,411
        That's the 1870s.       

37
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,814
   Well, then they were known   
    for their 7-for-1 beers,    

38
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:24,750
     the big fire of '06 --     
     well, that was 2006 --     

39
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,351
         and now, well,         
  they're known for everything  

40
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,019
   <i> except</i> their lamb dishes.   

41
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,822
  This is The Anchorage Tavern. 

42
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,760
Two buffalo crab cakes          
      going up.                 

43
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,295
    Lots of different dishes.   

44
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:37,830
            WAITRESS:           
       White clam dinner.       

45
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:40,032
          This is truly         
  the landmark of Somers Point. 

46
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:41,567
 Everybody knows The Anchorage. 

47
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,103
 Everything's fresh, and that's 
the way Don likes to do it here.

48
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,171
           Thank you.           

49
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,840
  FIERI: That's chef and owner  
          Don Mahoney,          

50
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:51,643
          who took over         
 this local institution in 1997.

51
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,779
   The recipes were already here
         or you developed them? 

52
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,847
No. We made the whole menu.     
They're all my favorites.       

53
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,249
     You'll see                 
there's no lamb on the menu.    

54
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,184
              Do people come in 
              and ask for lamb? 

55
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,518
    No. They know               
  I don't like it.              

56
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,719
                  Oh, okay.     

57
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,788
              Hey, come on down 
       and try the lamb special.

58
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,990
              MAN:              
  The way Don runs this place,  

59
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,125
       it could be around       
       for 100 years more.      

60
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:07,726
             WOMAN:             
  All the seafood's wonderful.  

61
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,327
 Flounder Gorgonzola            
   in the window.               

62
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,595
      I love the flounder.      

63
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:14,399
      It's nice and flaky.      
 Crabmeat filling is excellent. 

64
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,068
    It's an outstanding dish.   

65
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,269
                 All right,     
         what are we into, boss?

66
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:18,670
We're making crab stuffing,     
        okay?                   

67
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,872
We're gonna stuff some          
really nice flounder with this. 

68
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,540
    We have egg.                

69
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,743
      Got some                  
Worcestershire sauce, okay?     

70
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,078
   Yep, yep, yep.               

71
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,479
 Seafood seasoning.             

72
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,814
      Parsley.                  

73
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,882
  Some cubed bread.             

74
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:31,884
                 Very nice.     

75
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:33,819
We have this beautiful          
jumbo lump crabmeat.            

76
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,620
               Whoa! Whoa-oh!   
               Look at that!    

77
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,955
 Gonna mix this up.             

78
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:39,024
      Would you like me to flop 
     some mayo in there for you?

79
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,092
   A little more.               

80
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:41,293
 Put that in there.             
                        Okay.   

81
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:43,761
      In my world of crab cakes,
              that's the ratio. 

82
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,031
We put this in the refrigerator 
for maybe a couple of hours.    

83
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,432
             Let it tighten up. 

84
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,034
            Now we're gonna do  
           the Gorgonzola sauce.
   Okay.                        

85
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:52,971
First, we're gonna add          
our clarified butter and flour  

86
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,373
   to make a roux.              

87
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,574
      Start out                 
   a little milk.               

88
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,043
  Salt and pepper.              

89
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,378
     All right.                 

90
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,512
So, we're gonna simmer this     
for 15 or 20 minutes.           
                        Okay.   

91
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,514
We're gonna make a reduction    
        here.                   

92
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,449
   So we got wine.              

93
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,051
 We got some garlic             
   going in here.               

94
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,920
Some shal-lots in here,         
        okay?                   

95
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:10,388
                  Shal-lots.    
 Yes. Got that?                 

96
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,593
Now we are gonna add it         
right into our Béchamel sauce.  

97
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,261
                There we go.    

98
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,129
   We're gonna add              
the Gorgonzola cheese.          

99
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,998
    Gonna simmer                
for about five minutes,         

100
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,400
just to get the cheese flavor   
throughout everything.          

101
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,902
We're gonna stuff our flounder  
right now, young man.           

102
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,271
Take this stuffing here,        
        okay?                   

103
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,872
     Putting it                 
right in the center here.       

104
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,874
And we're just rolling it up,   
        okay?                   

105
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,143
    We're rolling               
  right along here.             

106
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,345
            Rolling right along.

107
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:34,413
                Another one.    

108
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:36,214
A little melted butter.         
                          Yes.  

109
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,750
We're gonna put some water      
in here so it doesn't stick.    

110
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,418
          In the oven uncovered?
    Yes.                        

111
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,154
                       How long?
Takes about 15 minutes.         

112
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,223
                Fish is out.    

113
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,424
               And how does it  
                 get served?    

114
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,093
     On the top                 
 of fried tomatoes.             

115
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,094
 Don't give small portions here,
               do you, boss?    

116
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,231
No. We use a lot of takeout     
containers in this place.       

117
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,432
Got the Gorgonzola sauce        
       on top.                  

118
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,835
      Top with                  
a little green onions.          

119
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,837
  A little crumble              
of Gorgonzola cheese.           

120
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,905
    There you go.               

121
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,307
            Well, you got to dig
                the flounder.   

122
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,842
   You don't see enough flounder
                  anymore.      

123
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:07,846
                    Mmm.        

124
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,248
   Just the richness in the crab
                by itself       

125
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,316
            takes care of it.   

126
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,251
              The really nice   
              little gem on it  

127
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,720
                 is getting     
              underneath there  

128
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:16,688
                 and getting    
 that little fried-tomato piece.

129
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,393
         The acid of that tomato
                  is nice.      

130
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:24,062
            You make the sauce, 
   you roast it off in the oven.

131
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,864
           You didn't skimp here
                  one bit.      

132
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,666
              That is about as  
  old-school legit as they come.

133
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,067
   Thank you, sir.              
           Nicely done, brother.

134
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,336
      A flounder                
      Gorgonzola.               

135
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:34,205
     Flounder is delicious.     
 The portion size is incredible.

136
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,473
       FIERI:                   
 How's that flounder            

137
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,209
and the fried Jersey tomatoes   
    treating you?               

138
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,477
  It's like a burst of seafood  
          in my mouth.          

139
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,480
It's a burst of seafood         
   in your mouth.               

140
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:44,082
     FIERI: And even though     
   we're sitting on the coast,  

141
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,550
 this isn't<i> just</i> a seafood spot.

142
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:46,752
Cannelloni in the window.       

143
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:49,220
  Chef's also got some Italian  
        up his sleeve...        

144
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,822
     The best I've ever had.    

145
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:53,958
    There's Italian restaurants 
   that don't make it this good.

146
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,127
      ...when we come back.     

147
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,234
       FIERI: We're parked      
  at Somers Point, New Jersey,  

148
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,638
       at a landmark joint      
with quite the colorful history.

149
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,839
   The Anchorage has been here  

150
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,707
           for as long          
   as I can possibly remember.  

151
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,110
 MAN: This used to be a brothel 
        in the old days,        

152
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:14,379
        when they used to       
  run the liquor up the coast.  

153
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,915
          You really do         
     get a sense of history.    

154
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,985
When we were a kid, this place  
was a 7-for-1 beer joint.       

155
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,786
          So, 7 beers that had  
         7 ounces in each beer. 

156
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:22,854
    There you go.               

157
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:23,855
                   For $1.      
       For $1.                  

158
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,190
                 And that's     
           how you described it?

159
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,791
This was back in the '70s,      
      you know?                 

160
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,327
  And it kind of got run-down.  

161
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,729
   FIERI: Then chef and owner   
       Don Mahoney came in      

162
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,332
    and turned things around    
   with dishes like this one.   

163
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,135
        I'm having their        
   homemade cannelloni dinner.  

164
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,604
You can taste every single thing
          in the dish.          

165
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,073
                 All right,     
   so, what are we making, boss?

166
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:42,274
       Making                   
 the marinara sauce.            

167
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:44,142
So, we're gonna start           
   with olive oil.              

168
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,211
   Chopped onions.              
       Garlic.                  

169
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,213
We're gonna cook this out.      
                       Gotcha.  

170
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:49,881
   We're gonna add              
our crushed tomatoes.           

171
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,215
 Gonna whip this up.            

172
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,551
  It's gonna simmer             
for about 45 minutes.           

173
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,753
         Now time for the basil?

174
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,821
        Yeah.                   

175
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,689
        Salt.                   

176
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,892
     Bay leaves.                

177
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,028
       Pepper.                  

178
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,296
      Oregano.                  

179
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:05,764
               So, let this go  
               for another 45.  

180
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,031
        Yeah.                   

181
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,968
      So, what's the cannelloni?
           Give me the rundown. 

182
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,304
     Olive oil.                 

183
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:14,372
   Put some onions              
      in here.                  

184
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,175
  Garlic.                       
               I like the way   
   you handle the garlic, buddy.

185
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,177
You got ground veal.            

186
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,311
    Ground pork.                

187
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,713
   Ground chicken.              

188
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,914
        Salt.                   

189
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,050
    Black pepper.               

190
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,651
Cinnamon-amon-amon-amon-amon.   

191
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,119
               I always say it  
               like that, too.  

192
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,254
 Gonna mix this up,             
        okay?                   

193
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,989
               With your hand.  

194
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,924
 Now we're gonna add            
  the ground beef.              

195
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:33,859
                    Okay.       

196
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,593
      Oregano.                  

197
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,728
       Basil.                   

198
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,797
   One more time,               
we're gonna do this.            

199
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:40,932
           How long are we gonna
            let this cook down? 

200
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,200
We're gonna cook this           
for about 45 minutes.           

201
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:43,869
Then we're gonna add            
our spinach to there            

202
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,536
   and let it wilt              
and work that in there.         

203
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:46,538
                Gotcha, boss.   

204
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,541
Right now, we're gonna add      
  some lemon juice.             

205
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,843
        Eggs.                   

206
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,144
  Parmesan cheese.              

207
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,145
 Mozzarella cheese.             

208
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,113
    Mix this up.                

209
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,416
Add our ricotta cheese.         

210
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:00,151
                 Beautiful.     
               Now what's up?   

211
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,020
We're gonna stuff them          
in these pasta shells.          

212
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,155
            Right there by hand.

213
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:05,957
         So we get a little roll
              on top of itself. 

214
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,559
                   Sit it       
              on a sheet tray.  

215
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,361
And then we're gonna            
put some sauce on top.          

216
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:10,761
                  And then      
            they go in the oven.

217
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,631
They'll be in the oven          
about 35, 40 minutes.           

218
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:15,366
Bring them out, they'll be nice,
bubbly, hot, and delicious.     

219
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,635
                  Hit them      
            with a little sauce.

220
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,102
  Mozzarella cheese             
   and more sauce.              

221
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,305
            And then back in for
            another few minutes 
            to melt the cheese. 

222
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:21,239
    There you go.               

223
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,974
    Here we are.                

224
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,310
  We're gonna ladle             
a little bit of marinara.       

225
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,245

00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,191
           It's great.          

450
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,326
  Salty's Special.              

451
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,262
   Having the Salty's Special.  

452
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,730
 You got the best combination --
  You got tri-tip, pulled pork, 

453
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,067
 and you got the barbecue sauce 
          on top of it.         

454
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:10,734
             What are we making?

455
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,269
  We're gonna make              
  our Salty's rub.              

456
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,605
We got lemon pepper.            

457
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,740
 Some garlic powder.            

458
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,610
      And then                  
we're gonna put in allspice.    

459
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,479
                  A little      
               seasoned salt?   
  A little                      
seasoned salt.                  

460
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,880
And then we just throw in       
   a little basil.              

461
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:25,015
           Looks like an Indian 
       spice market right there.

462
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,350
             All right, so what 
       are we gonna put this on?

463
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,152
We're gonna put this            
   on our tri-tip.              

464
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,754
We like to make sure            
    it's covered.               

465
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,089
  We'll leave it on             
     overnight.                 

466
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,423
     So, you're setting these up
              for the next day. 

467
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:33,291
       We are.                  

468
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,962
Now we're gonna rub our         
pork butts with our Salty's rub.

469
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,499
We're gonna put them            
in our smoker for 12 hours.     

470
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,935
  Then we're gonna              
lay the tri-tip out.            
                       Got it.  

471
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,903
We put it on by hand.           

472
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,972
               Because by foot  
              would be awkward? 

473
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:48,940
        Very.                   

474
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,309
             So, this will go on
                for about --    

475
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:52,910

477
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,915
     What type of barbecue sauce
                are you into?   

478
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,983
       Kind of                  
a sweet, smoky, tangy.          

479

480
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,721
  We're gonna start             
with a little ketchup here.     

481

    A little bit                
  of vegetable oil.             

488
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,934
Our yellow mustard in.          

489
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,203
Then we put a little bit        
of black pepper in there.       

490
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,605
  And is this the standard sauce
          for all the barbecue? 

491
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,540
     Yes, it is.

 It's gonna change my waistband,
     is what it's gonna change. 

497
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,217
All right, so, now we're gonna  
pull our pork butts out.        

498
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,485
                    Okay.

get it nice and chopped up.     

506
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,633
 So, now this is --             
                That's ready?   

507
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,503
              Grab the tri-tip  
       and we're gonna slice it.

508
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,772
  Time to build it.             
                Rock 'n' roll.  

509
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,174
      So, we're gonna start off 
   with laying some tri-tip out.

510
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,510
              Put a little bit  
    of our pulled pork in there.

511
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,778
          Put our barbecue sauce
                  on there.     

512
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,714
        Add some yellow peppers.

513
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:06,517
               Top it off with

              does it come with

00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,926
             a free beach towel 
          or anything like that?

00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,596
             Not too much smoke.

519
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,063
            Pulled pork's great.

520
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:23,200
    Really get that deep, rich, 
    great flavor from the smoke.

521
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,669
       It's a really good sauce.

  Grilled chicken.              
                 Let's do it.   

550
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,923
We take a whole chicken.        
   We split them.               

551
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:20,858
Put a couple slits in there     
so the wings will lay flat

when we're grilling it.         

553
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,327
Now we're gonna make            
    our marinade.               

554
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,663
We got orange juice.

00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,531
    A little bit                
   of lemon juice.              

556
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,801
Then we put the chickens        
  in the marinade.              

557
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,135

558
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,471
      So, now we're gonna hit it
              with the dry rub? 

559
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:34,938
We're not gonna be shy          
about putting it on.            

560
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,642
Then we're gonna cover it with  
foil. Let it marinade overnight.

561
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,278
                Then we'll go   
                to the grill.   
 Absolutely.                    

562
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,213
                   Got it.      

563
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,149
So, we've been grilling         
this chicken about 45 minutes.  

564
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,418
     We're ready                
   to pull it off.              
                       Hit it.  

565
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,553
                [ Whistles ]    
             Good-looking bird. 

566
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,422
We just tear them by hand.      
We serve them in quarters.      

567
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:56,027
       This is                  
your half-chicken dinner.       

568
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,895
             That's great bird, 
                    man.        

569
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,797
                   Tender.      

570
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,166
             Good smoke flavor. 

571
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:04,502
                 I like that    
     it just falls off the bone.

572
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,739
            Got a little texture
                in the skin.    

573
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:11,676
             You killed it, man.
                  Nice job.     

574
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,713
             WOMAN:             
I like the crisp outside pieces,

575
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,382
  so it's got that nice, like,  
      char on the outside.      

576
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,583
   The chicken is very tender.  

577
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,719
       Falls off the bone.      
       It's smoky flavor.       

578
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,188
     Just taste a little bit    
      of mesquite in there.     

579
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,458
     What makes this special    
        is Jeff Salters.        

580
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,060
           Cool thing about this

581
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,795
      is you're not trying to do
               10,000 things.   

582
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:32,263
         You're able to take it,
                 harness it,    

583
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,665
           do it right, and win.

584
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,399
                 Impressive.    

585
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,634
Thank you very much.            

586
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:38,469
      You want to become friends
               with this cat.   

587
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:42,540
        So, that's it for       
this road trip, but don't worry.

588
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:45,342
    We got plenty more joints   
 to find all over this country! 

589
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,144
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

590
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:49,680
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

591
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,816
       You know what time it is,
             everybody at home. 

592
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:53,884
            Get up on the couch 
            and make some noise!

593
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:57,288
              It's time for...  
             bak-ed ziti pizza! 

594
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,522
             Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
