00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,221

307
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,502
        Some more onions so that
 this sweats down onto the meat.

308
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:40,004
Run the heat four hours.        

309
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,106
   I've been dying

         Yep. So we'll start off
              with a taco.      

313
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:54,919
                We got three.   

314
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,454
      Now, remember the garbanzo
             beans and the rice?

315
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:57,322
   Yes, yes, yes.               

316
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,656
               At the bottom.   
                 Here we go.    

317
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:01,192
         And here's the consommé
               de borrego.      

318
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:05,597
     Onions, some extra cilantro
        for the soup, and voilà.

319
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,133
        Mmm.                    

320
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,602
When you taste this,            
you are gonna shovel this.      

321
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:13,671
 Everything you love            
  about a great...              

322
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:17,341
rissole, just got deeper        
and richer with the lamb.       

323
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:18,877
   You're making me hungry, man.
           Can I dig in?        

324
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,144
      Aw, man.                  
      Come on.                  

325
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,746
I'm serious. I can't get it     
in there fast enough.           

326
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:25,150
Lamb has that distinct          
flavor and that depth.          

327
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,485
And this is so simple           
with those banana leaves        

328
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,419
             and the little bit 
               of the garlic,   

329
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:29,620
       a little bit of the lime.

330
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:30,955
   And the fact that            
you're taking the meat,         

331
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,490
   utilizing that               
   into the taco.               

332
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,159
      One of my new             
favorite Mexican dishes.        

333

           -Thank you.          
      -Consommé and tacos.      

334
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,829
   MAN: It's got a little bit   
         of spice to it.        

335
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,598
    The rice and the garbanzo   
      beans are phenomenal.     

336
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,033
       MAN #2: The lamb --      
      absolutely delicious.     

337
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,501
     Tender, well-seasoned.     

338
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,436
Two more huaraches, please.

343

346
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,917

            he said, "All right,

349
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,655
         Huarache a la Mexicana.

350
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,857
    The most authentic thing    
 on the menu are the huaraches. 

351
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,059
   They start with fresh masa.  

352
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:11,262
 It's steak, beans all together.
          It's awesome.         

353
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,198
            We're gonna be doing
         huarache a la Mexicana.

354
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,666
           -Huarache?           
         <i> -Una chancla.</i>         

355
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:15,867
   <i> A la chancla.</i>               

356
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,602
It's like an oblong tortilla    
with the masa on the outside    

357
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,205
     and a little bit           
of the beans on the inside.     

358
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,272
 It is a specialty.             

359
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,807
             So we're gonna make
              some pinto beans  

360
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,542
             so that we can make
             some refried beans 

361
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:25,610
                  to stuff      
             the huarache with. 

362
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,711
             -Okay.             
             -Water.            

363
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:27,879
               Some salt here.  

364
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:29,214
               Half an onion.   

365
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,349
                   Oil.         
          This'll go for an hour

366
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,484
      to an hour and 30 minutes,
   till they're nice and tender.

367
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:35,019
    So we're just gonna         
scoop them out, refry them.     

368
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:36,754
And this is the middle          
   of the huaraches?            

369
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,423
              -Yep.             
        -Next, what's up?       

370
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,558
            We're gonna be doing
          some arrachera steaks.

371
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,493
           -Arrachera.          
         -Inside skirt.         

372
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,563
 We use a combination of garlic,
            cumin, black pepper,

373
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,998
            bitter orange adobo.

374
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:51,436
    We mix this real good and we
  sprinkle it through the steak.

375
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:52,703
             And then tenderize.

376
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,440
    Let them marinate for a good
         at least 12 hours.     

377
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:56,707
     Beautiful.                 

378
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,109
         All right, we're gonna 
         start making some masa.

379
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,579
           So we got corn flour,
          water, and some flour.

380
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,849
            Just beat this until
          all the water is gone.

381
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,385
                 Roll it up,    
            punch a hole into it

382
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:10,120
       to put in a nice spoonful
           of refried beans.    

383
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:12,456
                Roll it into    
              a little burrito, 

384
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:15,126
         and then we just start 
         squeezing the masa out.

385
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:18,329
  And the idea is not           
to have the beans come          
 outside of the masa.           

386
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,932
             Correct. And we got
       a huarache ready to cook.

387
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,133
Crisp up both sides?            

388
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,668
              -Yep.             
     -Steak on the flattop.     

389
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:24,936

              of the huarache.  

390
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,937
    So melted cheese.           
What cheese is on there?        

391
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,339
                Queso oaxaca.   

392
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:32,409
 We top it with the skirt steak,
      and then it gets a cactus,

393
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:35,079
                  Jalapeño,     
             sweet onion bulbs. 

394
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,447

395
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,550
  As soon as I get              
a handmade tortilla,            

396
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,019
   and I get that               
little caramelization           

397
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,286

  the oddest names              

446
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,055
   I've ever seen in the hi--   
            -edi-BOL.           

447
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,390
        -Oh, I got that.        
          -[ Chuckles ]         

448
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:28,192
       UYEDA: Every single thing
       I design to be in a bowl.

449
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:31,529
             FIERI:             
   Inspired by the meals owner  
  Andrea Uyeda learned to make  

450
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,731
    with her Japanese mother    
        and grandmother.        

451
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,934
             For like a year,   
           I just cooked at home

452
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,802
                and came up     
           with different bowls.

453
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,970
  The flavors just keep coming. 

454
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,606
       MAN: Roasted garlic      
       and herb pork hash.      

455
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,075
The pork hash is a little salty,
         a little sweet.        

456
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,077
  She's hit it out of the park  
         with this one.         

457
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,277
All right, so give me           
   the breakdown.               

458
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:48,612
             -Okay.             
  -Pork butt that's been cubed. 

459
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,214
             Then we put salt...

460
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,083
Fresh-cracked black pepper --   
       I'm impressed.           

461
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,152
                    Yes.        
               Yellow onions.   

462
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:55,553
            Whole garlic cloves.

463
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:56,954
                   Thyme.       

464
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,088
                  Rosemary.     

465
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,490
          And bay leaf.         
           -Bay leaf.           

466
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,558
      And then?                 

467
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,827
         Take your favorite beer
               and then --      

468
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,228
And copious amounts of oil.     

469
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:05,696
                    Yes.        
             It's like a confit.

470
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:08,499
                 Marinate it    
             at least 24 hours. 

471
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:09,567
Roast it in the oven            
   at 350 degrees.              

472
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,435
              For 4 1/2 hours.  

473
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,837
    Bring it out,               
    let it cool.                

474
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:13,838
           We're gonna shred it.

475
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,373
          -Very tasty.          
            -Tender.            

476
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,807
                 Scallions.     

477
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:17,709
                 Red onion.     

478
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,243
             Chopped-up capers. 

479
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,911
                  Rosemary.     
                  Parsley.      

480
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,713
        Fresh-grated lemon zest.

481
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:23,915
             -Okay.             
          -Lemon juice.         

482
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,116
   -So this gets all mixed up.  
              -Yes.             

483
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:26,383
 And what is the jus            
    we have here?               

484
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,653
         This is the renderings 
         from when we cooked it.

485
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,655
              Then we put this  
               in the fridge,   

486
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,189
             and then we put it 
               on the griddle   

487
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,925
               and serve it up  
             with our biscuits. 

488
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:34,925
    Are we making               
    the biscuits?               

489
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,394
              -Yes.             
       -Of course we are.       

490
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,063
               We have sifted,  
             all-purpose flour. 

491
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,799
    And then what we're gonna do
          is sift baking powder,

492
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:45,936
                baking soda,    
              salt, and sugar.  

493
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:49,006
        This is actually frozen,
             grated butter.     

494
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,208
    Makes it light and airy.    
           -I got you.          

495
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:52,810
           Sharp cheddar cheese.

496
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,213
         -Ouch. Sure is.        
          -[ Chuckles ]         

497
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,415
       Scallions mixed in there.

498
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,283
     Buttermilk and heavy cream.

499
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,751
Mix this all up and --          

500
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,686
     Then we put them on a sheet
     tray, put them in the oven,

501
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,755
      350 degrees for 8 minutes.

502
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:06,757
    -I like the way you roll.   
       -Let's get cooking.      

503
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,826
             Butter, pork hash. 

504
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,028
That's roasted butternut squash.
            -Got it.            

505
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,030
 All right, so we're gonna      
crisp it up on both sides.      

506
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,766
   I put the biscuit on a sizzle
  plate so it's nice and crusty.

507
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:16,901
  You are so nice.              

508
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,636
                And let's get   
               this hash off.   

509
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,170
           The biscuit on there.

510
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:24,108
    Your pickled golden raisins,
         pickled onions, spiced,

511
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,510
            caramelized almonds,
                  parsley,      

512
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,446
      tomatillo-pineapple crema.

513
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,114
Tomatillo-pineapple crema.      

514
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:32,650
                And then        
         our crispy poached egg.

515
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,919
     You've got                 
a real serious issue            

516
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,522
 of taking something            
  completely normal             

517
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:40,792
and artifying it into           
 another dimension.             

518
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:47,198
  This is all kinds             
 of funkin' flavor.             

519
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:50,868
The key to the hash is all the  
little accoutrements on there.  

520
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,270
 The pickled onions.            

521
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,539
I love the almonds -- the little
crunch, that little bite.       

522
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,875
And the pickled raisins --      
    I'm using that one.         

523
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,678
And then you go over to this    
little, light, flaky biscuit.   

524
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,614
  It's half biscuit,            
half scallion pancake.          

525
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:04,549
   It's dynamite.               

526
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,951
The pork hash has so many layers

527
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:09,419
     that all come together     
      in such a lovely way.     

528
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:12,423
       The cheddar biscuit      
     will change your life.     

529
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,825
    The meals here at ediBOL    
     are visually stunning.     

530
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,962
   FIERI: And so is the decor,  
   which Andrea also designed.

             WOMAN:             
 That's why I like coming here, 

532
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,767
  'cause every little component 
     is so thought through.     

533
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:25,569
WOMAN #2: I find ediBOL not just
     any kind of restaurant.    

534
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,639
 It's a lot of different tastes 
   and fusions from all over.   

535
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,107
       Miso peanut ramen.       

536
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:33,644
 The miso ramen is a really good
  take on a traditional salad.  

537
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:36,580
    It's light and refreshing   
    with a lot of zest to it.   

538
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,049
 Talk to me, sister.            

539
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:40,151
            This is the dressing
      for the miso peanut ramen.

540
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:44,855
  Miso paste, honey, sesame oil,
             canola oil, tamari,

541
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:48,192
             rice wine vinegar, 
               garlic, ginger.  

542
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,394
             Blend this all up. 

543
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,996
That'll be terrible.            
I'll have two quarts of it.     

544
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,397
           -[ Laughs ]          
              -Mmm.             

545
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,266
            Next up?            
      -Put it all together.     

546
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:57,401
Every single ingredient,        
      I want to eat             

547
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,069
   the whole bowl               
  of it by itself.              

548
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:01,272
       Together,                
I'm gonna lose myself.          

549
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,607
And with that dressing...       

550
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,942
                 All right!     

551
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:08,011
               Ramen noodles,   
                red peppers,    

552
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,547
   pickled shiitake mushrooms.  
            -Got it.            

553
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,615
            -Edamame.           
   -Oh, I love Eddie's mommy.   

554
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,350
        Edamame -- I'll put more
            in there for you.   

555
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:14,952
         -There you go.         
        -Pickled carrots.       

556
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,353
        Yes.
