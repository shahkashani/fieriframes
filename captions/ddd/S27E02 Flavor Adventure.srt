<i>A la chancla.</i>

356
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:26,613
It's like an oblong tortilla
with the masa on the outside

357
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,280
and a little bit
of the beans on the inside.

358

It is a specialty.

359
00:12:29,446 --> 00:12:30,780
So we're gonna make
some pinto beans

360
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,513
so that we can make
some refried beans

361
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:33,646

the huarache with.

‐Inside skirt.

372
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,546
We use a combination of garlic,
cumin, black pepper,

373
00:12:53,646 --> 00:12:55,013
bitter orange adobo.

374
00:12:55,113 --> 00:12:59,513
We mix this real good and we
sprinkle it through the steak.

375

378

All right, we're gonna
start making some masa.

379
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,586
So we got corn flour,
water, and some flour.

380
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:12,820
Just beat this until
all the water is gone.

381
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,286
Roll it up,
punch a hole into it

382
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:18,053
to put in a nice spoonful
of refried beans.

383
00:13:18,153 --> 00:13:20,420
Roll it into
a little burrito,

384
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,086
and then we just start
squeezing the masa out.

385
00:13:23,186 --> 00:13:26,286
And the idea is not
to have the beans come
outside of the masa.

386
00:13:26,386 --> 00:13:28,920
Correct. And we got
a huarache ready to cook.

sweet onion bulbs.
