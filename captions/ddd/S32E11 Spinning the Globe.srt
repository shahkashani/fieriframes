-What are we getting into first?
   -Smoking our mesquite pork.  

54
00:01:58,252 --> 00:01:59,585
         I don't even wanna know
                what this is.   

55
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:01,053
      -A makeshift smoker.      
         -Very strange.         

56
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:02,654
          We're not gonna season
              the pork at all.

00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,856
 -It's going on just like it is.

58
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,925
             So just an hour to 
      perfume it with the smoke.

59
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:08,727
 Then it's gonna get            
  a wet rub on it.              

60
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,062
We're gonna start off

61
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,064
   ground oregano,              
ground black pepper,            

62
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,534
   garlic powder,               
  salt, olive oil.

64
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,204
     This isn't gonna be lacking
       any flavor, by any means.

65
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:20,872
            -Garlic?            
        -Red bell pepper.       

66
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,275
               This is one of   
          the funkier taco meats

67
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,809
        that I have come across,
                 by the way.    

68
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,344
       -Julienned onions.       
             -Okay.             

69
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,746
Add some cold water.            

70
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,549
Throw it in the oven at 250     
overnight -- 10, 12 hours.      

71
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:31,884
 Now we're gonna do             
    our chorizo.                

72
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:33,618
  We got our ground             
   picnic pork --               

73
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,153
which is, like, the arm         
 and the shoulder --            

74
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,222
oregano, cinnamon.              
            Cinaminaminaminamin.

75
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:40,959
Cloves, cayenne pepper,         
  coriander, cumin,             

76
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,560
    salt, pepper,               

77
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,562
a little bit of sugar           
 to sweeten that up,            

78
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,765
   garlic powder,               
chili powder, paprika.          

79
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,900
       I like when the seasoning
         gets 50/50 on the meat.

80
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,702
           That's where we're at
              right about now.  

81
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,070
Pureed chipotle and adobo.      

82
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,639
             -Okay.             
      -Apple cider vinegar.     

83
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:55,106
Let it rest overnight.          

84
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,775
           What's our final step
    before we build the burrito?

85
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,443
         -Queso blanco.         
             -Okay.             

86
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:01,113
Red onions, salt to help        
those babies sweat up,          

87
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:03,048
  milk, our cheese.             

88
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,584
      Nothing happier than a big
     bucket of processed cheese.

89
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,320
         That is a lot of queso.

90
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:11,924
Cream here, serrano peppers     
all charred up, with some milk. 

91
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:13,792
     So this is gonna cook down.

92
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,394
       -Okay, let's do it.      
         -Let's see it.         

93
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,929
Flour tortilla, chorizo.        

94
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,865
  We actually throw             
the mesquite pork on top of that

95
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,000
   so those juices              
   flow together.               

96
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,268
     Roll it up.                

97
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,670
          See those little moves
             he did right there?

98
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:26,138
              The little push,  
                 pull, make?    

99
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,339
Drop it in the fryer.           

100
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,873
        That's right. This comes
          with a gym membership.

101
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,076
Do a nice bed of our            
    Spanish rice,               

102
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:33,144
the Cowboy Junkie burrito       
in the center of that,          

103
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,547
queso blanco.                   
                  There we go.  

104

Spicy bacon pinto beans,        
fresh pico de gallo, cilantro.  

105
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:43,021
 That's your Cowboy             
 Junkie right there.            

106
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,422
                You know what   
               that's lacking?  

107
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,558
              -No.              
            -Nothing.           

108
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
              Brother, you are  
               the flavor man.  

109
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,629
               It's balanced.   
               Delicious heat.  

110
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:54,032
                  The beans     
          are definitely a plus.

111
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,634
      You got smoke in the pork.

112
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,703
                 The queso,     
             it's creamy-silky. 

113
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:01,773

      rolling that Junkie?      

115
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:06,845
The Cowboy burrito happens to be
 my favorite thing on the menu. 

116
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,313
         Tons of flavor.        

117
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,582
   You can't come to Kansas City
  without running into this guy,

118
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,852
    my good buddy Stan from OBR,
             Operation Barbecue.

119
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:16,454
               And these folks  
           deploy barbecue rigs,

120
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,156
                uh, anywhere    
             there's a disaster.

121
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,325
   We've got about              
  8,000 volunteers.

             between you and me.

124
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,263
   This guy built his own smoker
     and put it on the flat top.

125
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,265
      What kind of smoke are you
    getting on that pulled pork?

126
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,134
It's great. You telling me      
that it's off of the cooktop,   

127
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,470
   I wouldn't have              
    believed you.               

128

129

 I love the kimchi over the top.

134
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,152

137
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,891

                         Okay.  

138
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,427
We're gonna throw it            
in our Korean pork slather.     

139
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,696
                    The slather.
   Start it with                
some whole garlic.              

140
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,497
               Chili de arbol.  
              A lot of ginger.  

141
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:04,169
Soy sauce, plenty of onion,     
rice wine vinegar, sesame oil.  

142
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,437
               This is the key  
                 right here.    

143
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,506
Korean chili powder.            
       Sugar.                   

144
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,508
   -And there's your slather.   
     -Let it rest overnight.    

145
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,909
           And then for service?

146
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,712
Cook it up with some            
of our homemade kimchi.         

147
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,246
      -We're making kimchi?     
           -Oh, yeah.           

148
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,648
Napa cabbage cut down.          

149
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,252
We got some non-iodized salt.   
A ton of water in that.         

150
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:22,387
          Pull the moisture out,
              wilt the cabbage. 

151
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,189
Now we're gonna make            
   the "slurthy."               

152
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,923
                    The slarly? 
 Now we're gonna                
 make the slurry.

154
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:30,929
Some rice vinegar, lime juice.  
 We love the ginger.            

155
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:33,932
   Fried chilies.

00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,670
              Nice, big chunks  
           of ginger and garlic.

158
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,272

     some tacos.                

163
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:50,549
We're gonna cook up our pork    
that we've slathered overnight. 

164
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,016
Here's our homemade kimchi.     

165
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,020
Put it on top and let the juices
meld together for a minute.     

166

168
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:01,359
Korean pork, ginger-infused     
   hoison drizzle,

174
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,774
             It's a good amount 
                  of spice.     

175
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,776
          Kimchi's got the funk.
       Got a little bit of heat.

176
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,577

         brought their own thing

237
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,968
     and threw whatever they had

             and then you said, 
    "I'm gonna spread the word."

446
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,756
            -Correct.           
 -You're an ambassador, brother!

447
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,491
         You're taking people to
   another county of Flavortown.

448
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,293
Two milanesa tortas.            

449
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,296
       The milanesa torta       
     is made out of seitan.     

450
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,633
  Breaded, fried, and it comes  
    with a jalapeño toreado,    

451
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,702
      and it's super good.      

452
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:39,370
      -What are we making?      
       -The seitan steak.       

453
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,639
 -What are we gonna use it for? 
      -Our milanesa tortas.     

454
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:44,208
         -So, mushroom?         
     -Into a vegan bullion.     

455
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,910
   Liquid aminos,               
 which is something             

456
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,511
  really essential              
   for all vegans.              

457
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,047
          -Absolutely.          
     -Pepper, a little salt.    

458
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:51,448
         A little touch of salt.
Let this cook down for how long?

459
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,585
  30 to 45 minutes.             
And it gets strained.           

460
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,721
            So we're just making
           hearty mushroom broth

461
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:59,657
       to work as the foundation
  of flavor for the seitan loaf.

462
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:00,925
            -Exactly.           
           -Next step?          

463
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:03,394
So, this is vital wheat gluten. 
    Onion powder.               

464
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,463
         -Black pepper.         
    -Cayenne and some garlic.   

465
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,731
               And now we have  
           that beautiful broth.

466
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,800
        Yeah.                   
  It gets stretchy.             

467
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,536
 -It really looks like a brain. 
            -I know.            

468
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,270
  People say like,              
"Ooh, that's kind of brainy."   

469
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,741
We've got boiling water,        
and we just drop for one hour   

470
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,609
until it starts rising          
    a little bit.               

471
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,544
  -Once it's a floating brain.  
             -Yeah.             

472
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,547
Now we're going to make the     
dredge for our milanesa steak.  

473
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,617
Pour water in there,            
flaxseed meal, onion powder,    

474
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,553
garlic powder, and flour.       

475
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:30,554
   -So slice it, dredge it...   
            -Mm-hmm.            

476
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:31,689
      ...pack it with the panko.

477
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,324
         -In the fryer.         
            -Got it.            

478
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,893
So, we got torta bread.         
Put some black beans.           

479
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:38,496
 You got your patty,            
cabbage, some tomatoes.         

480
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,898
               Avocado crema,   
              vegan mayonnaise. 

481
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,233
Put a toreado on the side.      

482
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,701
     -I see this in El Paso.    
            -Oh, man.           

483
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,770
           I've not seen this in
     other parts of the country.

484
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,838
   Basically, it's              
a deep-fried jalapeño.          

485
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,641
   You marinate it              
   with soy sauce.              

486
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,044
            I'd eat 50 of those.
                    Dude!       

487
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,713
                     ♪♪         

488
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:58,115
      You get such great texture
             out of the seitan. 

489
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,383
             It's got good chew.

490
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,852
             You definitely get 
        the mushroom through it.

491
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:04,122
                 You cut it     
            the right thickness.

492
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,057
   The beans are nice and creamy
               on the bottom.   

493
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,524
        Good crunch of the slaw.

494
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,727
     The tomato adds this little
       acid affect on top of it.

495
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,930
             And then the crema.
           Well done. Delicious.

496
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,732
Two milanesa tortas, ready!     

497
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,401
       The mushroom seitan      
       really stands out.       

498
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,870
          It's crunchy.         
    The bread's really good.    

499
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,139
       I love the avocado.      
     It has a ton of flavor.    

500
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,141
When did you figure out         
    it was vegan?               

501
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,343
        I did right away        
       because I<i> am</i> vegan.      

502
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,146
  So this was like              
the Holy Grail for you.         

503
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,414
         Oh, heck yeah.         
     This is my second home.    

504
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,883
    FIERI: Which is actually    
       outside on a patio.      

505
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,286
      Lick It Up is located     
       behind Monarch Bar.      

506
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,221
     Did you find the bar first,
               or Lick It Up?   

507
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,957
Found the bar first.            
 I'm not vegan, but             
good food is good food.         

508
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,560
   -Everybody can enjoy this.   
  -Absolutely. It's fantastic.  

509
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,495
         -Fresh flautas.        
     -The flautas are, like,    

510
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,497
   the best thing on the menu,  
         in my opinion.         

511
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,100
    They have my two favorite   
  things -- beans and potatoes. 

512
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:52,103
 They also have some green chili
      and red chili sauce.      

513
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:53,437
    It's the perfect flavor.    

514
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,106
             Alright, what else 
         you got up your sleeve?

515
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:56,908
  Flautas, which is             
our other big seller.           

516
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,709
    We start off                
 with boiled beans.             

517
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,911
-Into some boiled russet potato?
             -Yeah.             

518
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,446
       What are we incorporating
                 into this?     

519
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,781
  A vegan bullion.              

520
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,048
         -Vegan bullion?        
           -Yes, sir.           

521
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,517
                  It's like     
           vegetable demi-glace.

522
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,785
   And margarine.               

523
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,319
     We're using flour tortillas
             or corn tortillas? 

524
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,622
Corn tortillas, and they're --  
  It's a rectangle.             

525
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:12,990
         What you talkin' about,
                   Willis?      

526
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,925
        Bro, I have been around,

527
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,261
           but I have never seen
         a rectangular tortilla.

528
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,530
              So, we take this, 
   drop a little bit of the mix.

529
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:22,400
        -Water and flour.       
 -Just to work as a little glue.

530
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,268
  We'll deep-fry it             
 until it's crispy.             

531
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,270
               You got a salsa  
           that comes with this?

532
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,606
 I got two salsas --            
 jalapeño tomatillo             

533
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,140
and chili de arbol tomato.      

534
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,875
          Tomato chili de arbol?
             Okay, let's see it.

535
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:36,347
Water, Roma tomatoes,           
chili de arbol, onions, salt.   

536
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:37,481
      Then what are we gonna do?

537
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,884
Boil this for 40 minutes,       
   scoop them out,              

538
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,418
      put them                  
in the food processor,          

539
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,620
 combine it with oil            
   to emulsify it.              

540
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,223
 -And you also make a tomatillo?
     -A tomatillo jalapeño.     

541
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,825
   Start out with               
   a pot of water.              

542
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:51,895
Jalapeños, tomatillos,          
some onions, garlic cloves.     

543
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,631
Boil this 40 minutes.           

544
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,299
   You don't want               
those tomatillos to pop.        

545
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,502
If they pop, it gets            
a little bitter taste to it.    

546
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:59,036
        Pop 'em when they're... 
             <i> Hot!</i>              

547
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,438
         Pop 'em when they're...
              <i> Hot!</i>             

548
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,041
Put them in the food processor, 
combine it with cilantro, salt. 

549
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:06,444
   And just slowly              
  drizzle that oil.             

550
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,579
            -Next up?           
   -We got our three flautas.   

551
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:11,448
Put the cabbage in there,       
   avocado sauce,               

552
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,051
 coconut sour cream,            
   fresh tomatoes.              

553
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:15,186
                  Cilantro.     

554
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:16,721
  Cilantro on top.
