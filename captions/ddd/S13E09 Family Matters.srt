LET'S START WITH                
THE NOODLE DOUGH.               
                  TWO SCOOPS    
              ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR.

212
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,996
ONE OF THE PASTRY FLOUR.        
                           YEAH.

213
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,798
WHY TWO KINDS                   
  OF FLOUR?                     

214
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,133
             BECAUSE--TO MAKE IT
                MORE STRONGER.  
MORE GLUTEN?                    

215
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,937
                           YEAH.
THE GLUTEN'S KIND OF WHAT       
GIVES IT THAT ELASTICITY.       

216
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,539
                     COLD WATER.
OKAY. COLD WATER.               

217
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,342
                      LYE WATER.
LYE WATER. WHY DO WE PUT        
  LYE WATER IN THERE?           

218
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,345
             THEN FLOUR GET INTO
            WATER MORE STRONGER.

219
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,282
SO THE GLUTEN AND THE LYE WATER 
WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE NOODLE

220
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:12,617
MORE--MORE ELASTICITY.          
                     YEAH, YEAH.

221
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,619

      AND YOU SPIN IT.          

230
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,707

IN MY WORLD OF COOKING,         

231
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,176
 THIS IS ONE OF THE ARTS        
THAT I HAVE GOT TO LEARN.

THEN HE SPINS IT THE OTHER WAY. 

236
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,992
YOU CAN'T SEE IT YET,           

237
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,662
BUT IT IS SEPARATING ITSELF

00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,805
  ARE WE GONNA BE ABLE          
TO FIT THE FISH IN THERE?       
                   OH, YEAH.    
              AND LOAD THESE UP.

485
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:37,541
       NEXT, A SLICE OF AVOCADO.

486
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,610

                     LIME CREMA.
                    THERE WE GO.

487
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,079

           TWO FULL-SIZED TACOS.

ALL RIGHT.                      
                      ALL RIGHT.

489
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:49,153
 THE FLAVOR OF THE FISH RIGHT   
OFF THE BAT IS NICE AND FRESH.  

490
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,689
      I MEAN,                   
THIS DEFINITELY HAS             

491
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,991
MORE OF A CARIBBEAN FEEL TO IT  
      WITH THE SWEETNESS        

492
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:56,227
OF THAT MANGO BARBECUE SAUCE    
       UNDERNEATH IT.           

493
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,295

YOU GOT THE SWEET,              

494
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,498
THE CRUNCH OF THAT SLAW.        

495
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,266
NICE JOB, BROTHER.              
    NICE JOB.                   
                      THANK YOU.

         (woman) BEST FISH TACOS
               IN THE AREA.     

497
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:08,372
     WE HAVE A COUPLE OF DRINKS,
     RELAX, WEAR OUR FLIP-FLOPS.

498
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,307
            I USUALLY AM, TOO.  
          I PICKED THE WRONG DAY

499
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,376
         NOT TO WEAR FLIP-FLOPS.
  I KNOW. WE SAID THAT          
RIGHT WHEN YOU WALKED IN.       

500
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,378
        BUT YOU THOUGHT FOR SURE
              I'D WALK IN.      
EXACTLY.                        

501
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,847
            YEAH, NO, IT WAS    
        A LITTLE CHILLY OUTSIDE.
 HEY, GUYS,                     
HOW WE DOING?                   

502
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,449
              GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

503
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,784
  I THINK WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON
          HERE, YOU GUYS,       

504
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,786

              SPENT AS MUCH TIME

505
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,522
        IN CORPORATE RESTAURANTS
                AS I DID,       

506
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:26,524
       AND THERE IS NOTHING MORE
          THAT YOU WANT TO DO   

507
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,526
         WHEN YOU'RE COMING OUT 
        OF CORPORATE RESTAURANTS

508
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:31,462
           THAN LOSE THE TIE,   
        THROW ON THE FLIP-FLOPS.
ROCK THE FLIP-FLOPS.            

509
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:34,532
