       LIKE YOU'RE DOING A CAKE.

97
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:03,441
JUST LIKE YOU'RE DOING          
        A CAKE.                 
                      FANTASTIC.

101

            IS NOT OVER THE TOP.

102
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,919
  USING THE CREAM CHEESE TO MAKE
   THE FROSTING HELPS OUT A LOT.

103
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,656
                MMM. I'VE NEVER

113

                 THE DIFFERENCE.

117
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,227
                  ROCK 'N' ROLL.
   LET'S MAKE SOME BREAD.       
WE ACTIVATE THE YEAST FIRST.    

118
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:58,496
                   LET IT BLOOM.
YEAH. AND THEN WE JUST PUT      
  THE REDUCED STOUT BEER,       

119
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:01,366
BUTTER, SALT, MOLASSES...       
                AND A LOT OF IT.

120
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:03,568
  OATS, AND THEN                
ALL SORTS OF FLOUR.             

121
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:07,372
              WHAT KIND OF FLOUR
                    WE GOT?     
ALL-PURPOSE WHITE FLOUR.        
 THEN ADD IN OUR YEAST.         

122
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,042
 NOW WE JUST CRANK THIS THING UP
         AND LET IT MIX.        
                   FOR HOW LONG?

123
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:12,443
ABOUT 10 MINUTES,               
   15 MINUTES.                  
             STARTS PULLING AWAY
               FROM THE BOWL.   

124
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,646
 IT STARTS COMING OFF THE SIDES,
   AND THEN IT'S READY TO GO.   

125
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,915
     WE PULL IT OUT,            
STICK IT ON A SHEET TRAY,       

126
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,117
     OIL IT, COVER IT,          
AND LET IT RISE OVERNIGHT.      

127
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,786
THEN WE BRING IT OUT AGAIN      
 TO FLUFF UP FOR AN HOUR.       
                    SMELL IT.   
                 SMELLS AWESOME.

128
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:25,790
  YEAH. WE WEIGH THIS OUT       
TO 3-POUND, 1-OUNCE CHUNKS.     
                           OKAY.

129
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,192
SO NOW YOU JUST GOT TO WORK     
  THE BREAD A LITTLE BIT,       

130
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,862
STRETCH IT OUT, AND ROLL IT UP  
   INTO A BASIC LOAF SHAPE.     
                  HIT IT WITH   
              A LITTLE AQUA NET.

131
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:33,331
                 PUT THEM       
           INTO THE BAKING PANS.
 FILL IT OUT                    
A LITTLE BIT.                   

132
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,934
              GIVE IT ONE SCORE,
                    SO IT--     
      YEAH, SO IT RISES UP      
 AND LOOKS LIKE A LOAF OF BREAD.

133
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,403
THEN I'LL BRUSH IT              
     WITH OIL.                  
                  PROOF AGAIN   
              IN THE BAKING PAN?

134
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,405
YEAH, OVERNIGHT.                

135
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,874
THEN WE BRUSH 'EM WITH OATS     
 AND PUT THEM IN THE OVEN,      

136
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,477
BAKE THEM FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES  
          TO AN HOUR.           
         OATS, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

137
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,546

IT IS A FINISHED PRODUCT.       

138
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,947
POP IT OUT OF THIS GUY.         
          STILL WEIGHS 3 POUNDS.

139
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,484
IT'S A PRETTY DENSE BREAD.      
        CUT IT UP.              
           MMM. SMELL THAT. MMM.

140
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,619

               IS ALL THAT BACON
                GOING ON THERE? 
YES.                            

143
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:01,559
           THAT IS A GOOD THING.

144
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,561

                    GREAT BACON.

145

STACK DOWN THE BACON.           
                     LOAD IT UP.

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,863
 <i> AND HE'S BEEN MAKING 'EM HERE</i> 
      <i> SINCE THE LATE '70s.</i>     
     PICK IT UP, PLEASE.        

188
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,598
    THE DEAL WAS,               
I WAS ON WALL STREET,           

189
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,801
   AND MY DAD ASKED ME          
TO HELP SELL THIS PLACE.        

190
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,404
I DECIDED THAT I LIKED IT, AND I
   DECIDED TO BUY IT FROM HIM.  

191
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,472
                   HOW LONG     
               HAS IT BEEN HERE?
65 YEARS.                       

192
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,341
       HUNGARIAN GOULASH.       
 THE RECIPES ARE                
EXACTLY THE SAME.

     FRIED KREPLACH, PLEASE.    

194
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,011
      THIS IS OUTSTANDING.      
IT'S LIKE A JEWISH              
     EGG ROLL.                  

195
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,746
           CAN YOU SAY KREPLACH?
KREPLACH.                       

196
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,147
                           LACH?
LACH?                           

197

 THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. THAT'S IT. 
COME ON NOW.

   WHERE WE GOING?              

199
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:09,955
            WE'RE GOING TO GRIND
             INTO THE KREPLACH. 

200
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,956
                   SALT, PEPPER,
                     GARLIC...  
GRANULATED.                     

201
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,359
                    AND PAPRIKA.
SINCE WE'RE GONNA GRIND THIS,   
    WE'RE NOT TOO WORRIED       

202
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:17,295
THAT IT'S EVENLY                
   DISPERSED.                   
       NO, JUST WANT THE FLAVORS
            TO BE IN THERE.     

203
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,030
CELERY.                         
                          ONION.

204
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,098
A LITTLE MIREPOIX.              
       CARROTS. PUT A LITTLE BIT
        OF OLIVE OIL, COVER IT. 

205
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,100
AND HOW LONG'S THIS GONNA       
      GO DOWN FOR?              
              ABOUT THREE HOURS.

206
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,703
            WE JUST WANT IT NICE
            AND SOFT AND TENDER.

207
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:29,641
WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE BRISKET OUT
     AND WE'RE GONNA CUT IT.    
ALL RIGHT. NOW IT'S TIME        
TO GRIND UP THE BRISKET.        

208
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:32,377
           RUN ALL THIS THROUGH.
NOW WE'RE GONNA DO              
   THE VEGGIES.                 

209
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,046
ONIONS.                         
      YOU GONNA THROW THE CARROT
            IN THERE, BOSS?     

210
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,115
  YOU KNOW WHAT?                
LET'S TRY A CARROT.             

211
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,251
I NEVER DID ONE                 
    BEFORE.                     
    IN ALL THE YEARS THAT YOU'VE
       BEEN LACHING THE KREP,   

212
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,455
              YOU'VE NEVER ADDED
                   A CARROT?    
    NO. LET ME JUST             
THROW IN SOME SPICES--          

213
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:45,590
A LITTLE GARLIC POWDER,         
     SALT, PEPPER.              
                    MIX THIS UP,

214
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,592
       AND WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?
WE'RE GONNA BE MAKING           
   KREPLACH DOUGH.              

215
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,594
FLOUR, WATER.                   
             EGG SHADE--ALTHOUGH
              IT LOOKS ORANGE,  

216
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,063
                IT COMES OUT    
            A LITTLE BIT YELLOW.
    THROW IN AN EGG.            
THROW IT RIGHT IN THERE.        

217
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,265
SALT. THAT'S HOW                
    WE DO IT.                   
                 SO MIX THIS UP,
                 TAKE IT OUT... 

218
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,334
    LET IT SIT                  
FOR AN HOUR OR TWO.             

219
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,069
         NOW WE'RE GOING TO ROLL
           THE KREPLACH DOUGH.  

220
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,204
       THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART.

221
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,206
         IT'S REALLY GREAT FOR  
       UPPER BODY AND SHOULDERS.

222
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,676
  WHAT ARE WE,                  
A PASTRY PILATE?                
                    I LIKE THAT.

223
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,078
      TRY TO MAKE KREPLACH DOUGH
         AS THIN AS POSSIBLE.   

224
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,080
            WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO 
          IS WE'RE GONNA CUT IT,

225
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,282
            AND THEN WE'RE GONNA
               DO IT BY HAND.   
WELL, THEN LET ME GET IN        
        ON THIS.                

226
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,484
SO IT'S LIKE I'M MAKING         
     LITTLE PIZZA.              
                           YEAH.

227
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,820
      THE KEY IS TO GET IT THIN 
    ENOUGH. THAT'S LOOKIN' GOOD.

228
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,689
                 NOW WE'RE GONNA
                 TAKE SOME MEAT.
THERE YOU ARE.                  

229
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,224
  AND THEN WE FOLD IT IN HALF,  
AND NOW WE PINCH THE SIDES DOWN.

230
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,295
                 WE GIVE IT SOME
                  EARS, OVER... 
AND TIE IT THROUGH.             

231
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,297
                 GOOD. NICE JOB.
EACH ONE IS DONE LIKE THIS?     
 WAY TO ROCK THE KREPLACH.      

232
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,167
     OKAY. PUTTING KREPLACH     
 IN THE FRYER, ABOUT 15 MINUTES.

233
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,302
                ALL RIGHTY THEN,
                 FRIED KREPLACH,

234
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,504
                    FRIED ONION.
NO DIPPING SAUCE?               

235
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,573
               I LIKE DUCK SAUCE
                    MYSELF.     
DUCK SAUCE?                     

236
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,441
                     DUCK SAUCE.
IT'S A POT STICKER,             
  I KNEW IT WAS.                

237
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,678
               YOU FOUND US OUT.
LOOK HOW BIG                    
  THIS IS.                      

238
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:44,449
 MMM. COMING BACK               
FOR THIS FOR SURE.              

239
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:47,318
         DUCK SAUCE,            
OR THE SWEET-AND-SOUR SAUCE.    
          IT'S LIKE AN EGG ROLL.

240
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:50,522
MMM. IT'S GREAT WITH THIS.      
     THOSE ARE HEARTY.          

241
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:53,257
GREAT CRUNCH, THE FILLING       
IS NICE AND SUPER TENDER.       

242
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:54,659
GOOD FRY, COMFORT FOOD.         

243
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,528
AND KREPLACH.                   
   I LIKE THE CRUNCHINESS,      

244
00:09:57,598 --> 00:10:00,931
       AND THE BRISKET HAS      
        A LOT OF FLAVOR.        
      AND THEN THE ONIONS ON TOP
         JUST TOTALLY MAKE IT.  

245
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,801
    MM-HMM. IT'S VERY YUMMY.    
I GOTTA BE HONEST               
    WITH YOU,                   

246
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,803
WHEN I HEARD THAT WE WERE       
    MAKING KREPLACH,            

247
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:08,139
I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE       
       IN A SOUP.               
          WELL, FUNNY YOU SHOULD
               MENTION THAT.    

248
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,141
           WE BOIL IT AND PUT IT
               IN THE SOUP.     

249
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,143
                   OLD-FASHIONED
                   CHICKEN SOUP.
LOOK AT THAT.                   
  KREPLACH.                     

250
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,745
AND WHAT'S IT CALLED,           
 CHICKEN IN THE POT?            

251
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,814
  CHICKEN IN--EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT
    AS MY GRANDMOTHER MADE IT.  

252
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,349
MMM, MMM.                       

253
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,618
    THE CHICKEN IN THE POT--    
     A LITTLE BIT OF HEAVEN.    

254
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,687
ENJOY.                          
    OH, REALLY AUTHENTIC.       

255
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:25,222
                      GOING OUT.
        IT'S A THROWBACK        
         OF YEARS AGO...        

256
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,224
YEAH.                           
      WHEN YOU THOUGHT          
      OF A JEWISH DELI.         

257
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,294
           PICK UP ON           
      A PASTRAMI SANDWICH.      

258
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,630
IN 1938, THERE WERE 2,000 KOSHER
 DELIS IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK. 
  HERE'S YOUR ORDER.            

259
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,432

        OF THE ORIGINALS.

HOW'S EVERYTHING?

       YOU HAVE PASTRAMI.       

265
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,977

<i>AND THIS JEWISH DELI STAPLE.</i>    

267
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,317

  TASTES LIKE                   
IT'S HOMEMADE.                  

268
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,786
     <i> 'CAUSE IT IS, THE WAY</i>     
     <i> JAY'S GRANDMA MADE IT.</i>    
IT'S PERFECT.                   

269
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,455
             WHAT ARE WE MAKING?
STUFFED CABBAGE.                

270
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,990
               WHAT DO WE STUFF 
               THE CABBAGE WITH?
WITH MEAT.                      

271
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,326
TAKE A PIECE OF CHUCK FLAT,     
 CUT IT INTO 2-INCH CUBES       

272
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,395
  IN ORDER TO GRIND IT          
FOR THE STUFFED CABBAGE.        

273
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:06,664
 ALL RIGHT, SO THE MEAT'S GROUND

              LAMB CHEESESTEAK. 
            LAMB-TASTIC, I HEAR.
             IT IS.             

456
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,526
             OKAY, WHAT UP NEXT?
 LEG OF LAMB. TAKE OUR          
STRAINED BACON GREASE.          

457

SQUIRRELLY BEAVER SEASON ALL.   

458
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,165
RUB IT DOWN REALLY GOOD,        
     AND THAT'S IT.             
                           OKAY.

459
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:24,068
SO WE SEASONED THE LEG,         
    WE GOT THE FAT.             
           WE'RE READY TO SEAR. 
          ADD SOME BACON GREASE.

460
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,737
SEARING ON BOTH SIDES.

00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,472
       TRAPS IN THAT GOOD FLAVOR
             OF THE LAMB.       

462
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:30,474
           PULL THAT OFF,       
     NOW WE ADD IN OUR MIREPOIX.

463
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,610
        CARROTS, ONIONS, CELERY,
           AND WE ADD GARLIC.   

464
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,746
        NOW WE STIR THAT AROUND.
JUST LOOKING FOR THAT           
 DEEP, RICH FLAVOR.             

465
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,415
NATURAL SUGARS                  
  WILL HELP.                    
          ADD SOME TOMATO PASTE,
              COOK THAT DOWN.   

466
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,485
      CARAMELIZE ALL THE SUGARS.
         ADD OUR LAMB BACK IN.  
OKAY.                           

467
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:44,622
        ADD OUR DARK STOUT BEER.
ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS            
   OF THE WAY UP.               

468
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,423
     THIS GIVES A GOOD RICH BODY
           TO THE AU JUS.       

469
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,226
        FINISH WITH A LITTLE BIT
                OF WATER.       
SO IT'S COVERING                
BY ABOUT AN INCH.               

470
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:50,895
                THEN WE ADD OUR 
              WHOLE PEPPERCORNS,

471
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,696

      3 HOURS AT 350 DEGREES.   

473
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:58,168
                 NOW AFTER IT'S 
                 BEEN BRAISED...
LOOK AT THAT.                   

474
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,170
NICE. MEAT SHOULD FALL          
  RIGHT OFF THE BONE.           

475
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:02,640
SO WE CAN ROAST IT.             
           SO WE SHRED THE MEAT.

476
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,309
                WE'LL LEAVE THAT
                  TO CHILL UP.  
WE'RE CARAMELIZING              
   THE LEG BONE.                

477
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,777
              A LITTLE OLIVE OIL
                  OVER THERE.   

478
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,513
 TAKE THE BONE, ROAST IT OFF,   
AND NOW IT'S GONNA GO BACK IN,  

479
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,316
REALLY KINDA BRING IN TOGETHER  
   THIS AU JUS FOR THE LAMB.    
                           YEAH.

480
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,318
AND HOW MUCH LONGER             
 IS THAT GONNA GO?              
                     20 MINUTES.

481
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,320
LET IT REDUCE DOWN              
    EVEN MORE.                  
             LET IT REDUCE DOWN.

482
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,322
AND THEN YOU JUST               
   STRAIN IT?                   
                 YES. NOW WE ADD
                 THE AU JUS MIX.

483
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:21,325
   FORTIFIED WITH               
A LITTLE BEEF PASTE.            
                    NOW STIR,   
                BRING TO A BOIL.

484
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:22,993
                   COOL IT DOWN 
                   A LITTLE BIT,

485
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,728
          THEN WE'LL MARRY THAT 
         WITH THE SHREDDED LAMB?
YES.                            

486
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,665
THIS JUST GETS A LITTLE BIT MORE
  OF THAT GOOD BRAISING LIQUIDS 

487
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,734
INTO THE MEAT.                  
               JUST A LITTLE BIT
                 MORE OF THAT,  

488
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,735
        SO IT DOESN'T DRY OUT   
    WHEN IT GOES ON THE FLATTOP.
EXACTLY.                        

489
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:34,272
 OKAY, LET'S BUILD THIS. WE WANT
    A LITTLE CRISPY IN THERE,   

490
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:36,207
          BUT NOT TOO MUCH.     
     LET THAT COOK A LITTLE BIT.

491
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,076
   TOAST A BUN. CHEDDAR CHEESE  
GOES REALLY GOOD WITH THIS LAMB.
ALL RIGHT.                      

492
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:42,346
       PUT A LITTLE WADDELL MAYO
               ON THERE.        
MAYO WITH TERIYAKI SAUCE.       

493
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,548
           AND THIS GOES ON TOP.
              NICE AND JUICY.   

494
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:45,883
                OUR LAMB AU JUS.

495
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,885
       I ALWAYS THINK SANDWICHES
         LIKE THIS NEED A DIP.  

496
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:50,821
             NOW WHAT DO WE CALL
             THIS LAMB-STROSITY?
THIS IS THE IRISH               
    LAMB DIP.                   

497
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,156
                   DELICIOUS.   
                 RIGHT ON POINT.

498

       WILL REALLY ENJOY THIS.  

499
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,895

           THINK THEY LIKE LAMB,

500
00:19:57,964 --> 00:19:59,897
    I CHALLENGE 'EM TO TRY THIS 
  AND TELL ME THEY DON'T DIG IT.

501
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:02,366
       THAT TERIYAKI MAYO ADDS  
    JUST A LITTLE HINT OF SWEET.

502
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:05,636
     I COULD CHUG THE AU JUS.   
  YOU PICK THE BEER UP FOR SURE.

503

             TRUE LAMB FLAVOR.  

504
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,640
     THIS IS THE WAY YOU SHOULD 
     DO IT. RIGHT ON POINT, MAN.

        AMAZINGLY JUICY.
