FISHERMAN'S COMBO--HOW'D YOU    
   COME UP WITH THE NAME?

      <i> SHRIMP, CLAMS, RINGS</i>

104
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:01,106
  THAT'S A BIG PLATE OF FRIED.  
 YOU SHOULD FRY THE PLATE, TOO. 

105
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,108
NOW YOU CAN TOSS                
IT ALL TOGETHER?                

106
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:05,110
OR YOU DO IT INDIVIDUALLY?      
             I ACTUALLY COOK 'EM
                IN TWO GROUPS.  

107
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:09,047
'KAY.                           
           THE SCALLOPS AND FISH
            CAN GO IN ONE FRYER.

108
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,582
      ONCE I DREDGE EVERYTHING,

           I'M JUST MAKIN' SURE 
           EVERYTHING'S COVERED,

110
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,253
                SO THE COATING  
               WHEN IT'S COOKED 

111
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:16,655
               WILL BE UNIFORM. 

112
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,657
             WE'LL LAY THE FISH 
                 DOWN FLAT.     

113
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,659
              SCALLOPS WITHOUT  
             COVERING THE FISH, 

114
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,661
           'CAUSE THAT'LL EFFECT
               THE COATING,     

115
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,130
           SO WE HAVE TO KIND OF
            SEPARATE THOSE TWO. 

116
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,065

    OF THE EXTRA LOOSE STUFF    

117
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,067
      OUTTA THERE, SO I'M NOT   
  THROWING A BUNCH OF CORN FLOUR

118

                    IN THE MIX. 

119
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,604
           THE SCALLOPS AND     
       THE FLOUNDER TAKE LONGER.

120
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,606
             MAYBE THREE OR FOUR
              MINUTES TO COOK.  

121
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,608
       THE RINGS MIGHT TAKE TWO 
       TO THREE MINUTES TO COOK.

122
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:38,810
   I LIKE THAT COLOR. IT'S JUST 
     BEYOND THE CANARY YELLOW   

123
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:42,281
