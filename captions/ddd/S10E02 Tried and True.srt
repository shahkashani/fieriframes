            <i> THANKS</i>             
    <i> TO MICHAEL LANDGARTEN.</i>     
        QUART OF CLAMS.         

192
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,871
I USED TO EAT HERE,             
BEFORE I BOUGHT IT.             
<i>FROM ORIGINAL OWNER BOB KRAFT,</i>

00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,474
     <i> WHO OPENED THIS PLACE</i>     
       <i> BACK IN THE '50s.</i>       

194
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,942
          IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT   
      HOW I WAS GONNA FIGURE OUT

195
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,610
         HOW TO DO JUST WHAT BOB
               WAS DOING...     
          FISH DINNER.          

196
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,679
 NOT CHANGE WHAT BOB WAS DOING. 
      I HAD TOTAL RESPECT.      

197
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,815
         <i> AND MORE THAN</i>         
     <i> TWO DECADES LATER...</i>      
CLAM DINNERS.                   

198
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,550
      <i> HE'S STILL DOING IT</i>      
           <i> BOB'S WAY.</i>          

199
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,753
  I'M HAVING BOB'S FRIED CLAMS. 
     THEY'RE JUST DELICIOUS.    

200
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:12,557
      <i> AND LILLIAN'S WAY.</i>       
WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE           
 THE LILLIAN CLAMS?             

201
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:15,026
  LILLIAN CLAM--IS THAT         
A NEW--NEW KIND OF CLAM?        

202
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,963
   WE HAVE A LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE,
        OUR BEST, LILLIAN.      

203
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,965
 SHE WOULD ALWAYS ARGUE WITH ME,
    "YOU GOTTA PUT THE CLAMS    

204
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,367
          IN THE WASH FIRST--   
      THEY'RE BETTER LIKE THAT."

205
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,901
      SO THE IDEA IS            
THERE'S THE BOB'S ORIGINAL      

206
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:26,838
   THAT GO INTO                 
JUST A DRY FLOUR...             
                        YOU BET.

207
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:30,642
AND THEN THERE'S                
THE LILLIAN CLAM.               
        LILLIAN GOES IN EGG WASH
        BEFORE IT GOES IN FLOUR.

208
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,578
GIVE ME THE FLOUR               
    BREAKDOWN.                  
             THIS IS CORN FLOUR.

209
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,448
CORN FLOUR FROM CORN,           
   AND YOU GOT...               
            THIS IS WHITE FLOUR.

210
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,649
FLOUR FROM WHEAT.               
                          RIGHT.

211
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,651
IS IT 50/50?                    
                       IT'S NOT.

212
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,720
   SO THREE CORN                
AND THREE FLOUR...              

213
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:44,722
                  AND TWO WHITE.
AND SI--AND ONE--               
 AND THEN FOUR--                

214
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,724
SO THAT'S FOUR CORN?            
                   YOU'RE TRYING
                  TO MESS ME UP.

215
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,859
THAT'S FOUR CORN...             
               IT WAS THREE CORN
                AND TWO WHITE.  

216
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:51,662
WHATEVER YOU WANT               
  TO CALL IT.                   
           NOW I'M GONNA MIX IT.

217
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:52,931
      IN CONSIDERATION          
TO HOW MUCH YOU DO IN A DAY,    

218
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,534
 HOW MANY OF THE BOWLS LIKE THIS
      COULD YOU GO THROUGH?     

219
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,735
                             40.
YOU'LL MAKE 40 BOWLS?           

220
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,405
   YOU'RE JAMMIN'               
WHEN YOU'RE CLAMMIN'.           
                    WE'RE CRAZY.

221
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,939
                 ALL RIGHT,     
            SO NOW THE FLOUR IN?
YES.                            

222
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:05,076
            SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA
                MAKE FIRST?     
MAKE THE BOB'S TRADITIONAL      
       FRIED CLAM.              

223
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,478
 OKAY. YOU ALWAYS JUST DROP 'EM 
  RIGHT IN THE FLOUR LIKE THAT? 

224
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,814
   YEAH, THEY GO RIGHT IN,      
AND AS BOB'S WIFE TAUGHT ME,    

225
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,485
YOU GOTTA GET YOUR FINGERS IN   
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE NECKS.  
                           OKAY.

226
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:14,752
SHAKE OFF THE EXCESS.           
                      THAT'S IT?

227
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,554
  NOW THEY GO                   
INTO THE FRYER.                 

228
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,089
NOW IT'S TIME FOR?              
                       EGG WASH.

229
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:21,426
WHAT ARE WE DOING               
WITH THE EGG WASH?              
          WELL, THIS IS SPECIFIC
           TO THE LILLIAN CLAMS.

230
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,762
           FIRST, SIX EGGS,     
       AND THEN WE'LL MIX IT UP.

231
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,096
                     STAND BACK.
OKAY.                           

232
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,164
       AND THEN EVAPORATED MILK.
MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT SWEET.     

233
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:30,635
   YES. THIS IS THE HARDEST PART
        OF THE WHOLE THING.     
YOU'RE GONNA SPILL IT.          

234
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:33,238
OH, OH!                         
                   BEEN AT THIS 
                 A LITTLE WHILE.

235
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,839
NICE.                           
       NOW FILL IT UP WITH MILK.
               THAT'S IT.       

236
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,242
           THAT'S A LOT OF WASH.
READY TO MAKE CLAMS?            

237
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:41,012
             I'VE BEEN DYING TO.
OKAY. JUST ONE EXTRA STEP--     
CLAMS GO INTO THE EGG WASH.     

238
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,582
            SO JUST A LITTLE BIT
               MORE MOISTURE.   
YEP.                            

239
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,251
         A LITTLE BIT OF FLAVOR.
NEXT TO THE SIFTER.             

240
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,519
  NOW THEY GO                   
INTO THE FRYER.                 

241
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,521
     SO IN COMES                
THE TOMATO FLAT BOX.            

242
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,525
         AND THIS IS HOW THEY'RE
           NORMALLY DRIED OFF?  
YEP.                            

243
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:54,659
               (whistles) OKAY. 

244
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,728
AND OUR NEW FRIEND              
    IS LILLIAN.                 

245
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,596
    SO WE'VE GOT                
THE BOB'S ORIGINALS.            

246
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,800
  MMM. THAT'S A LOT             
OF FRESH CLAM TASTE.            

247
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:04,535
AND THESE ARE                   
THE LILLIAN'S.                  

248
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,671
IT AIN'T GONNA BE EASY.         

249
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:07,939
NOW WITH TARTAR SAUCE.          

250
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,343
BOB'S CLAMS ARE KIND OF         
  THE PURITAN STYLE.            

251
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,544
   A LITTLE DREDGE              
FOR A LITTLE CRUNCH.            

252
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,879
    MMM. KEEPS IN               
SOME OF THE MOISTURE.           

253
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,681
AND THE LILLIAN METHOD,         
       I THINK,                 

254
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,684
     IS WHAT THE MAJORITY OF    
AMERICANS WANT IN FRIED SEAFOOD.

255
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,620
THEY WANT A LITTLE CRUNCH,      
 THEY WANT SOME TEXTURE--       

256
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,556
BUT THEN AGAIN...               
                        (laughs)

257
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,626
MMM. WHEN YOU'RE USING CLAMS    
    THAT ARE THIS FRESH,        

258
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,562
 YOU REALLY DON'T NEED          
TO DO ANYTHING TO THEM.         

259
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,564
           WHERE'S THE DRUMROLL?
I LOVE THE CRUNCH-IFICATION,    

260
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,500
 BUT I GOTTA GO                 
BOB'S ORIGINALS.                

261
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,768
AND IT'S KILLING ME,            

262
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,237
'CAUSE I LIKE LILLIAN           
A LOT BETTER THAN YOU.          

263
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,439
NOW I'VE GIVEN                  
MY TWO CENTS.                   

264
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,908
I THINK THERE'S A BETTER PERSON 
          TO STEP IN            

265
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,445
TO GIVE THAT ALL-AMERICAN       
 FRIED CLAM PERSPECTIVE,        

266
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,648
 MY RIGHT-HAND MAN,             
MY SON HUNTER FIERI.            

267
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,650
OKAY.                           
         IS THIS BOB'S?         

268
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,586
   YEP. I WANT YOU              
TO GIVE ME A RUNDOWN.           

269
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,923
       NICE FULL CHOW.          
YOU CAN TELL THIS KID CAN EAT.  
           IT'S GOOD.           

270
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:00,125
THIS IS THE LILLIAN.            
            LILLIAN.            

271
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:03,127
I WANT TO HEAR YOUR PERSPECTIVE,
  WHAT YOU LIKE ABOUT THIS ONE  

272
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,929
AND WHAT YOU LIKE               
 ABOUT THAT ONE.                

273
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,398
     WHAT I LIKE ABOUT BOB'S    
          IS IT'S CHEWY         

274
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:08,733
   AND IT'S MORE CLAM FLAVOR,   

275
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:12,270
      AND LILLIAN'S IS MORE     
     OF A, YOU KNOW, FRIED.     

276
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,273
            LILLIAN.            

277
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,674
                            WOW.
LILLIAN!                        

278
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,943
"GOOD BOY," SHE SAYS.           

279
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,613
SPLIT RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE     
   IN THE FIERI FAMILY.         

280
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:23,814
      GOT TWO CLAM DINNERS,     
          ONE LILLIAN.          

281
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:26,551
WE ORDERED BOTH CLAMS.          
         ONE BOB STYLE.         

282
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,818
I LIKE THE LILLIAN'S CLAMS,     

283
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,821
AND MY WIFE LIKES               
THE BOB'S CLAMS.                
                            MMM.

284
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,423
    AROUND HERE, EVERYONE HAS   
       THEIR OWN FAVORITE.      

285
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,692

401
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,504
  WE'RE MAKING                  
THE DOMERY SAUCE.               

402
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,906
     PUT A LITTLE BIT

                ARE YOU SERIOUS?

406
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:24,115
THAT'S RIGHT. LITTLE BIT

407

 THE SAUSAGE WOULD BE GROUND UP 
           LIKE THAT.           

411

 ONE OF THE BEST WAYS

00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,697
CHICKEN PISANO.                 
             SAUSAGE, POTATOES, 
           CHICKEN, BROWN GRAVY.

467
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,767
  THIS IS LIKE AN ITALIAN STEW. 
        IT'S INCREDIBLE.        

468
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,769
     GOT A 10-INCH PAN,         
A LITTLE BIT OF DRAWN BUTTER,   

469
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,438
ADD OUR BELL PEPPERS,           
     JALAPEÑOS.                 
              OH, GIVE IT SPICE.

470
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,641
THERE YOU GO.                   
                 DON'T TEASE ME.

471
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,776
SAUSAGE.                        
     THIS IS A DIFFERENT SAUSAGE
        THAN WE MADE, CORRECT?  

472
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:08,779
YES, THIS IS FROM A VENDOR THAT 
WE'VE BEEN DOING BUSINESS WITH  

473
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,648
FOR A LONG TIME.                
      BEFORE YOU WERE IN CHARGE.

474
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,917
ADD THE POTATOES.               
               HOW LONG HAVE YOU
                BEEN IN CHARGE? 

475
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,853
MY FATHER'S STILL HERE,         
      SO I'M NOT.               
              HE'S STILL RUNNING
                   THE SHOW?    

476
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,855
     HE STILL RUNS THE SHOW.    
  PUT THE CHICKEN ON THE GRILL. 

477
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:20,591
    WANT TO SEE SOMETHING COOL? 
  SEE THESE LITTLE STRIPES HERE?

478
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,925
              THESE ARE SLICES  
             FROM A TENDERIZER. 

479
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,061
           YOU GUYS GOT YOUR OWN
            IN-HOUSE TENDERIZER?
YES, WE DO.                     

480
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,797
   PROBABLY ABOUT               
A 50-YEAR-OLD HOBART.           
           THEY DROP THE CHICKEN
           BREAST RIGHT THROUGH,

481
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,465
                  AND IT        
           TENDERIZES THE MEAT. 

482
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,602
      THAT'S AS CLOSE TO CHICKEN
        SAUSAGE AS YOU'LL GET.  
    GIVE IT A LITTLE            
QUICK FLIP, TAKE IT OUT.        

483
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,405
NOW YOU GIVE IT                 
A LITTLE SLICE.                 
                 AND WE THROW IT
                   IN THE PAN.  

484
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,806
           THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
             WITH THIS AT ALL.  

485
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,608
     STIR IT UP,                
LET THE CHICKEN COOK.           

486
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,610
     A LITTLE BIT OF OREGANO    
 AND SWEET BASIL, BLACK PEPPER. 

487
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,679
  NOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE          
A LITTLE THICKENING ROUX,       

488
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,146
ADDING A LITTLE FLOUR.          
      THE OIL THAT YOU HAVE FROM
      THE BUTTER AND THE SAUSAGE

489
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,816
                 WORKS TOGETHER,
                 MAKES THE ROUX.
TURN THE HEAT DOWN              
  A LITTLE BIT,                 

490
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,885
GIVE IT A SHAKE, LET THE ROUX   
  BROWN JUST A LITTLE BIT.      

491
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:50,955
             WHAT KIND OF SAUCE 
            DOES THIS COME WITH?
 THIS WILL BE                   
A BROWN GRAVY.                  

492
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,624
GIVE IT A SHOT OF SHERRY.       
                    I LIKE WHERE
                   THAT'S GOING.

493
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,493
ADD OUR AU JUS                  
THAT WE MAKE.                   

494
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:56,893
  SIMMER THIS FOR               
ABOUT TWO MINUTES,              

495
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:58,895
 AND IT SHOULD                  
BE READY TO GO.                 
             WHAT'S THIS GETTING
                 SERVED WITH?   

496
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:01,899
TODAY WE'RE GONNA PUT           
 A SIDE OF BROCCOLI,            

497
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,768
  FETTUCCINE ALFREDO, AND WE'LL 
    GO AHEAD AND PLATE IT UP.   

498
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,704
IT'S AN OLD-SCHOOL SAUCE,       
     RIGHT UP FRONT.            
                            YES.

499
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,706
     GOOD GRAVY. THE CHICKEN    
IS JUST ABOUT FALL-APART TENDER.

500
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,908
LIKE THE POTATOES IN IT.        

501
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:13,043
  EVEN WITH THE JALAPEÑOS,      
I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO SPICY.   

502
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,646
WITH A LITTLE FETTUCCINE ALFREDO
  ON THE SIDE, COOKED AL DENTE. 

503
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,782
YOU MAKE YOUR OWN               
    ALFREDO?                    
                            YES.

504
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:18,783
    IT'S COMFORT FOOD.          
IT'S ITALIAN COMFORT FOOD.      

505
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:22,119
GOOD STUFF.                     
         (woman) CHICKEN PISANO.

506
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,720
        THE BEST PISANO         
         I'VE EVER HAD.         
         NICE LITTLE KICK TO IT,

507
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,390
          A LITTLE SPICE--      
     IT'S FANTASTIC, VERY GOOD. 

508
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,792
    (man) LASAGNA MAMA, UP.     
I JUST LOVE THE FEELING         
YOU GET COMING IN HERE.         

509
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,462
                  HOW'S IT GOING
                    WITH YOU?   
      WHEN SOMEBODY COMES,      
   THEY ALWAYS WANT TO STAY.    

510
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,130
        IT'S THE COZZAS.        
 THEY REALLY DO GOOD STUFF HERE.

511
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:37,601
IF IT WASN'T FOR MY KIDS,       
IT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE.        
                  THAT'S GREAT  
                 FOR YOU TO SAY.

512
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,603
    REALLY NICE TO MEET YOU.    
      YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME.     

513
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,472
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.            
        SIR, THANK YOU.         

514
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,874
  SO I TOLD YOU, IF IT'S FUNKY, 
         WE'LL FIND IT.         

515
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,877
    I'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME ON   
 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

516
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:50,414
           UH, THAT'S WHERE     
       YOU LOST IT, RIGHT THERE.

517
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,384
           (laughter)
