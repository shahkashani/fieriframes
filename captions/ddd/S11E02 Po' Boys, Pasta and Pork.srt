  NICE AND CRISP, ALL THIS GOOD

102
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,974
         IT'S WONDERFUL.        
    I REALLY, REALLY LIKE IT.   

103
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:05,744

106
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:12,383
TWO YEARS IN A ROW.             
<i>AND THIS YEAR'S CONTENDER...</i>    

107
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,786
   A ROOT BEER GLAZED HAM.      
     YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT        
TO PUT THOSE TASTES TOGETHER,   

108
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,788
BUT IT JUST WORKS OUT.          
                     WORK GREAT.

109
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:18,390
      YOU CAN REALLY TASTE      
         THE ROOT BEER,         

110
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,659
AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS.   
     WE START OUT               
WITH ROOT BEER EXTRACT,         

111
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,929
2 OUNCES OF WATER,              
DARK BROWN SUGAR...             
               DARK BROWN SUGAR.

112
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,530
COUPLE OF CINNAMON STICKS.      

113
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,598
WHILE THAT'S MELTING,           
CUT THIS HAM IN HALF.           

114
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,600
THIS IS A LOCAL                 
CHISESI'S HAM.                  
                        CHISESI.

115
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:32,471
EVERYBODY IN NEW ORLEANS,       
THIS IS THE HAM THEY EAT.       
           TALKING ABOUT SCORING
                 THE HAM.       

116
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:34,673
  THAT WAY THAT ROOT BEER       
CAN SOAK UP IN THE CRACKS.      

117
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,609
JUST POUR IT ON TOP             
    OVER HERE.                  
        THE HAM'S ALREADY COOKED
               AND CURED,       

118
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,811
              SO THIS IS JUST   
          FORTIFYING THE FLAVOR.
EXACTLY.                        

119
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,147
      POP THIS IN THE OVEN      
 AND BASTE IT EVERY TEN MINUTES.

120
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,549
WELL, THIS ENTIRE KITCHEN SMELLS
    LIKE ROOT BEER RIGHT NOW.   

121
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:47,618
 AND THEN IN 40 MINUTES         
WE WILL HAVE A BAKED HAM.       
                   THERE YOU GO.

122
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:50,489
               ALL RIGHT,       
         SO THEY'VE COOLED DOWN.
I CUT AGAINST THE GRAIN.        

123
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,557
I'M GONNA POP IT HERE           
   ON THE SLICER.               

124
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,559
  YOU GOT TO CUT IT             
AS THIN AS POSSIBLE.            

125
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:57,762
         CHECK THAT. YOU CAN SEE
          THE LIGHT THROUGH IT. 
    (laughs)                    
THAT IS SO GOOD.                

126
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,832
      SINCE WE LET THE HAM COOL,
         I WANT TO REHEAT IT.   

127
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,101
        ALL THIS FOR A SANDWICH?
IT'S A PO'BOY.                  

128
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:06,638
LET ME GRAB THE BREAD.          
THAT IS A 30-INCH LOAF.         
          (imitating lightsaber)

129
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,242
  AND IT'S VERY FRAGILE.        
WE'LL MAKE A 12-INCH HERE.      

130
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:13,044
POP IT INTO THE OVEN FOR ABOUT  
  TEN SECONDS. BITE INTO IT.    
                    TEN SECONDS?

131
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,113
THAT'S IT.                      
              NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

132
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,648
  MAYO, PICKLES, TOMATOES,      
LETTUCE, AND CHEDDAR CHEESE.    

133
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:20,852
 NOW THIS IS THE RESERVE GLAZE  
THAT I SCRAPED OUT OF THE PAN.  
                   THERE YOU GO.

134
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:23,121
AND JUST LAYER IT ON,           
    FOLD IT OVER,               

135
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,457
CUT IT IN HALF,                 
AND THAT'S IT.                  
          LOOK AT ALL THE JUICE.

136
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:28,126
         MMM. DYNAMITE SANDWICH.
         THE BREAD'S ROCK STAR. 

137
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,261
          THE PORTION'S HUGE.   
      THE INGREDIENTS ARE FRESH.

138
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:32,731
    WHAT REALLY STANDS OUT IS   
THIS CRAZY ROOT BEER GLAZE, MAN.

139
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,866
           THAT'S OUT OF BOUNDS.
IT'S POTENT.                    

140
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:36,802
   I FEEL LIKE I'M A LITTLE KID,

141
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,804
       HAVING A ROOT BEER FLAVOR
             IN MY MOUTH,       

142
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:41,072
            THEN TAKING A BITE  
           OF MY LUNCH. AWESOME.
           HAM AND CHEESE.      

143
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,542
            CAN YOU REALLY TASTE
            THE ROOT BEER IN IT?
INCREDIBLY SO, VERY SWEET,      
        DELICIOUS.              

144
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:47,078
               ROOT BEER HAM,   
             JUST CHISESI'S HAM.
         SMALL HAM DOWN.        

145
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:50,882
      AND THAT'S LOCAL.         
     THAT'S NEW ORLEANS.        
  <i> EXACTLY WHAT THIS LOCAL BOY</i>  
           <i> WAS AFTER.</i>          

146
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,485
      (Ben) GRILLED SHRIMP,     
      FRIED GREEN TOMATOES.     

147
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:55,019
PEOPLE GETTING BACK             
  TO THEIR ROOTS                

148
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,222
 AND EATING FOOD                
WHERE IT'S FROM.                
 <i> LIKE A SWEET POTATO PIE...</i>    

149
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,091
      HERE WE GO, MOM,          
YOUR SWEET POTATO CRUNCH PIE.   

150
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:03,762
    <i> INSPIRED BY THE COOKING</i>    
        <i> HE GREW UP WITH.</i>       
       EVERY THANKSGIVING       
   I WOULD MAKE THE CASSEROLE,  

151
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:06,164
      AND MY BOYS LOVED IT.     
 WHEN HE OPENED THE RESTAURANT, 

152
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,367
    HE SAYS, "I'M GONNA MAKE    
        A PIE OUT OF IT."       

153
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:11,903
        SWEET POTATO CRUNCH PIE.
        YEP, SO WE START        
WITH SWEET POTATOES IN THE OVEN.

154
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,172
               ROAST THEM OFF   
            LIKE WE ROAST BEETS.
EXACTLY.                        

155
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,575
            SO THOSE ARE COOLED.
I'M JUST GONNA PEEL             
   THE SKIN OFF.                

156
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,977
             BREAK 'EM ALL DOWN.
YEP. A LITTLE CINNAMON,         
        NUTMEG,                 

157
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,646
GOT TO HAVE SALT                
   AND SUGAR.                   
                  GONNA BE SOME 
                 SWEET POTATOES.

158
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,982
A COUPLE EGGS AND...            
                   HEAVY CREAM, 
                   JUST A TOUCH.

159
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,852
       AND THAT'S IT.           
I'M JUST GONNA FOLD IT OVER.    
                SO IT'S NOT     
          MASHED SWEET POTATOES.

160
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,586
OH, NO. IT'S SUPER CHUNKY.      

161
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,722
AND THAT'S THE FILLING          
     RIGHT THERE.               
                    WHAT'S NEXT?

162
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,792
 WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE TOPPING-- 
LOUISIANA PECANS, BROWN SUGAR...
                  FLOUR TO BIND.

163
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:36,127
BUTTER AND SALT,                
 AND THAT'S IT.                 

164
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:39,664
I'M GONNA MIX IT TOGETHER       
        BY HAND.                
THIS IS KIND OF LIKE THE CRUMBLE
 YOU GET ON TOP OF COFFEE CAKE. 

165
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,399
MOST DEFINITELY.                
        SO LET'S MAKE THE CRUST.

166
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,668
ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR, SUGAR,       
  SOME CHILLED BUTTER.          
                           SALT.

167
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,804
WE'RE GONNA PUT ZEST IN HERE    
      FROM THIS ORANGE.         

168
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,338
IT REACTS WITH THE FAT          

169
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:49,541
SO YOU DON'T HAVE THIS BUTTER   
    COATING YOUR TONGUE.        
                         DIG IT.

170
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,609
THIS IS THE JUICE               
   AND WATER.                   

171
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:54,546
NOW MOST PEOPLE USE DOUGH       
CUTTERS. I USE MY HANDS.        
             BUT YOU ARE TRAINED
                LIKE A NINJA.   

172
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,948
YOU WANT TO GO FAST, TOO.       
       SOON AS THE BUTTER MELTS,

173
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,950
             YOU'RE GONNA LOSE  
          THIS FLAKY CRUST-NESS.
EXACTLY.                        

174
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:01,419
 BOOM. SO HERE IT IS.           
WRAP IT UP IN PLASTIC.          
                    LET IT REST.

175
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,822
IN THE REFRIGERATOR.            
       OKAY, SO LET'S ROLL OUT  
    THE DOUGH AND BUILD THE PIE.

176
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,623
ALL RIGHT, BEAUTIFUL.           
   A LITTLE FLOUR.              

177
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:08,092
 I'M JUST GONNA ROLL IT OUT,    
MAKE IT AS ROUND AS POSSIBLE.   

178
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:10,829
RUB A LITTLE BUTTER             
     IN HERE.                   
                GOT TO GIVE IT  
              A LITTLE GREASING.

179
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,097
 ROLL IT UP ON THE PIN,         
PREVENT IT FROM BREAKING.       

180
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,099
PUT IT IN THE PIE SHELL.        
   CUT OFF THE EXCESS.          

181
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,369
  PUT HOLES                     
IN THE CRUST.                   
                   HELPS IT     
               FROM BUBBLING UP.

182
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,971
PUT THE SWEET POTATO FILLING    
          IN THERE.             
    AND HIT IT WITH THE TOPPING.
            LOOKING GOOD.       

183
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,973
THAT'S IT.                      
              POP IT IN THE OVEN
                   HOW LONG?    

184
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,042
45 MINUTES TO A HOUR AT 350.    
                 (clicks tongue)

  TO IT THAN I ANTICIPATED.     
             IT GOES REALLY WELL
                WITH THE RUB.

00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,872
       WRAP IT IN ALUMINUM FOIL.
THEN GO TO THE OVEN.            
    AT WHAT TEMP?               

263
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,941
              START IT AT 400,  
            TURN IT DOWN TO 300.

264
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,610

I DON'T EVEN KNOW...            

372
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,379
WHOA. THIS IS LIKE              
A CHILI GRIND NOW.              

373
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,248
 SO YOU JUST KEEP               
RUNNING IT THROUGH.             

374
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,450
    THEN ONCE WE GET            
ALL THE CHILI GRIND DONE,       

375
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,252
THEN WE DO THE BURGER GRIND.    

376
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,454
   THE DARK IS THE ELK,         
AND THE LIGHT IS THE PORK.      

377
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,790
    AND THEN WE'RE GONNA MAKE   
 THE MUSTARD SAUCE ON THE STOVE.
                          RIGHT.

378
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,992
GOT IT.                         
       LIGHT AND DARK BEER,     
   ADD THE MUSTARD, WHOLE SEEDS.

379
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,194
     OUR LIGHT                  
AND OUR DARK SEEDS.             
             MARINATE OVERNIGHT.

380
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,597
THEN WE STRAIN THE SEEDS OUT.   
THE SEEDS GO INTO THE BLENDER   

381
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,732
    AND THEN ARE                
PARTIALLY GROUND UP.            
                           OKAY.

382
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,668
WE GOT SOME WHOLE SEEDS         
    IN THERE STILL.             
       ALL OF THIS IS JUST GOING
          FOR A MUSTARD SAUCE   

383
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,738
     THAT'S GOING ON THE BURGER?
ALL OF THIS IS FOR MUSTARD      
    FOR THE ELK BURGER.         

384
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,874
              ALL RIGHT.        
       GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN HERE.
WE'VE GOT A DARK BEER,          
      PALE BEER.                

385
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,277
            AND WE'RE DOING THIS
             IN A DOUBLE BOILER.
SO IT DOESN'T SCORCH.           

386
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,346
                           OKAY.
   ALLSPICE, SALT,

                OH, BROWN SUGAR.

388
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,550
A LITTLE SWEETNESS.             
     TURMERIC.                  
        GREAT COLOR OUT OF THAT.

389
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,551
HORSERADISH GIVES IT            
   A LITTLE KICK.               

390
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,821
         AS MUSTARD DOESN'T HAVE
           A KICK OF ITS OWN,   

391
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,891
           YOU NEED HORSERADISH.
 WE'VE GOT GARLIC AND HONEY     
FOR A LITTLE MORE SWEETNESS.    

392

NOW WE ADD THE MUSTARD.         
               OH, LOOK AT THAT.

395
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,634
STIR.                           
                 HOW LONG       
           IS THIS GONNA SIMMER?

396
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,236
FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF.         
    ALL THAT FOR THE ELK BURGER.
           GOT TO LOVE IT.      

397
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,639
    WE'RE READY

            GROUND BLACK PEPPER,
               CAYENNE PEPPER.  
I LIKE IT.                      

400
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,511
     WE'RE GONNA FORM OUR BURGER
            WITH THE LID        

401
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,246
      TO MAKE IT NICE AND ROUND.

402
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,515
    THROW ON A LOT OF THIS GRILL
    SPICE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GET

403
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,918

           REALLY NICE FLAVOR.  
AND THERE WE GO.                

404
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,320

            ADD SOME EXTRA HEAT,
             MELT IT REAL FAST. 
WOW. EFFECTIVE.                 

406
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,459
WHAT ARE WE GONNA               
 SERVE THIS ON?                 
     ONE OF THE HOUSE-MADE BUNS.

407
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,995
            PUT ON SOME LETTUCE,
             TOMATO, AND ONION. 

408

               AND THERE YOU GO.

410
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,801
NO MAYO.                        
           NO, JUST OUR MUSTARD.

411
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,736
AND YOU MADE THE CHIPS ALSO.    
                            YEP.

412
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:49,073
OKAY, SO HERE'S

IS GROUND PERFECTLY.            

417
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,750
NICE AND LEAN,                  

418
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:02,220
     THE FAT OF THE PORK        
REALLY HELPS BALANCE IT OUT.    

419
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,621
  GREAT TEXTURE. THAT'S NOT     
A TYPICAL BURGER RIGHT THERE.

THE MUSTARD. LOOK AT THAT.      

421
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,093

OF COMPLEXITIES TO IT.          

422

 AND EAT THE WHOLE THING,       

424
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,433
 BUT THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO PROP
   ME UP AND PUT ME IN MY CAR   

425
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,902
AND PUT A BRICK ON THE...

00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:04,208
              THEY DID IT RIGHT.
GREAT FLAVOR IN THE MEAT.       

468
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:07,878
          <i> AND THEY SAY</i>         
   <i> IT'S ALL ABOUT THE SMOKE.</i>   
        IT DOES HAVE            
    A SMOKY FLAVOR TO IT.       

469
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:09,547
            THE SMOKE           
    IS COMING FROM THE MEAT.    

470
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:12,016
    <i> AND WHERE THERE'S SMOKE,</i>   
         <i> THERE'S FIRE.</i>         

471
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:14,218
       (Charlie) I DECIDED      
     TO GIVE HICKORY A TRY.     

472
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,821
 IT SEEMS TO GIVE A NICE FLAVOR,
  AND IT'S WORKING REALLY WELL. 

473
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,356
      MY BIG CUTS OF MEAT,      
         I COOK IN PANS         

474
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,159
 TO TRY TO RETAIN THE MOISTURE. 

475
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:24,695
  (man) HERE'S                  
THE BEEF BRISKET.               
        I USED THAT JUICE       
     TO REHEAT THE MEAT IN,     

476
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:28,365
 USING ITS OWN NATURAL GOODNESS 
  TO KEEP IT TENDER AND MOIST.  

477
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,901
            THE MEAT            
    IS SO PERFECTLY PREPARED.   

478
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:33,437
 (woman) THE SMOKY FLAVOR COMES 
THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT MEATS.

479
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,706
       IT'S FANTASTIC.          
(woman) RIB TIP SANDWICH.       

480
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,910
  THAT'S HOW YOU CAN TELL THAT  
  IT'S GOOD, 'CAUSE IT'S GONE.  
            HALF A RACK OF BACK.

481
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:43,514
HE CERTAINLY KNOWS HIS BARBECUE.
      IT'S VERY, VERY GOOD.     
        1 POUND SPARE WITH MASH.

482
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,316
<i>AND IT'S ALL DONE CHARLIE'S WAY</i> 

483
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:49,052
 <i> WITH INSPIRATION FROM A COUPLE</i>
 <i> OF CAPITALS OF AMERICAN 'CUE.</i> 

484
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,922
  (Charlie) I DEVELOPED MY RUB  
  BASED ON A MEMPHIS-STYLE RUB. 

485
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,390
      WE HAVE EIGHT SAUCES,

    <i> THERE IS A CLEAR WINNER.</i>   

489
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:03,668
     OUR BEST-SELLING SAUCE     
        IS THE ESPRESSO.        

490
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,070
TANGY WITH A LITTLE SPICE IN IT.

491
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,339
   <i> YEP, HE'S PUTTING ESPRESSO</i>  

492

  <i> A KANSAS CITY-STYLE SAUCE...</i>

          ESPRESSO.             

497
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,686
  <i> THAT GREAT BIG SHOT OF JOE.</i>  
        EXTRA STRONG.           

498
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,357
       AND THEN BLEND IT.       
THAT SAUCE IS JUST PHENOMENAL.  
     IT'S A GREAT FINISH.       

499
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,426
