00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,954
  SOME PEOPLE MAKE SOUP         
OUT OF IT, YOU MAKE HASH.       
         THIS IS SOME COLCANNON.

386
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,488
     COLCANNON IS A POTATO DISH 

387
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,824
         INDIGENOUS TO A CERTAIN
           REGION IN IRELAND.   

388
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,628
  IT'S DONE WITH CABBAGE, ONIONS
   AND CARAWAY, SALT AND PEPPER.
OH.                             

389
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:33,498
                 IT'S CONSTANTLY
                  IN THE HOUSE. 
THAT'S SO GOOD.                 

390
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,099
                JALAPEñO BACON. 

391
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,168
      THESE ARE THE DUCK BREASTS
          AFTER BEING SMOKED.   

392
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:40,104
                 I DON'T PUT    
             THE SKINS IN THERE.
NO. SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA TEAR   
   THAT DUCK BREAST APART.      

393
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,173
 I DON'T LIKE TO DICE TOO MUCH, 
        'CAUSE YOU DICE,        

394
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,776
           IT LOOKS TOO UNIFORM.
              CHECK THAT OUT.   
ALL RIGHT.                      

395
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,644
THAT'S GREAT DUCK.              

396
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,246
                   FRESH CORN...
BROCCOLI RABE.                  

397
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,314
              BROCCOLI RABE,    
          RED ONIONS AND GARLIC.
LOOK AT THAT.                   

398
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,316
A HANDFUL OF...                 
                SOME IRISH STEW.

399
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:55,053
THIS IS HASH-A-LISTIC.          
     I LIKE THIS.               

400
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:57,722
    YOU COOKED IT IN RISOTTO.   
 THAT'S REALLY GONNA BIND IT UP.

401
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,724
                           EGGS.
THERE YOU GO.                   

402
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,859
             PUT SOME SPEARMINT,
            SOME SAGE IN HERE...
SALT AND PEPPER.                

403
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:05,329
              TOASTED HAZELNUTS.
 PROBABLY THE MOST UNIQUE HASH  
YOU'VE EVER SEEN ON TRIPLE "D." 

404
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:08,132
A LITTLE BACON GREASE.          
                   OH--GOODNESS.

405
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,268
       PUT A LITTLE CRUST ON IT.
        I DIG IT. APPLE BUTTER. 

406
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,604
                AND THESE ARE   
            THE DUCK CRACKLIN'S.

407
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,740
                 AM I SUPPOSED  
              TO BE DIPPING IN--
 A LITTLE BIT                   
WOULD BE GOOD.                  

408
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,809
JUST ROUND IT OUT               
  A LITTLE BIT.                 
                            MMM.

409
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,543
             BOY, THIS IS GOOD. 
              WITHOUT QUESTION, 

410
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:23,414
     THAT IS THE FUNKIEST HASH  
   I'VE EVER SEEN ON TRIPLE "D."

411
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,817
        I THINK THE DUCK'S MY   
    FAVORITE PART. AND THE CORN.

412
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,819
         I NEVER THOUGHT OF CORN
                IN HASH.        

413
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:31,089
         THAT'S FUNKY DELICIOUS.
                  MMM.          

414
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,124
           IT'S GREAT.          
       IT'S JUST FABULOUS.      

415
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,026
               THIS IS SO GOOD. 
               CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

416
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,028
         BUT I HAD NEVER        
        THOUGHT OF DUCK,        

417
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,163
     AND THAT'S WHAT I LOVE     
       ABOUT THIS PLACE.        
         THE FOOD HAS CHARACTER.

418
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,698
     THE BUILDING HAS CHARACTER.
         <i> BUT IN 2006,</i>          

419
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:44,702
      <i> THEY ALMOST LOST IT</i>      
           <i> FOREVER.</i>            
              WE HAD A FIRE HERE
             A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

420
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,971
 THAT MUST HAVE BEEN            
LIKE LOSING YOUR HOME.          
                         IT WAS.

421
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:49,240
AND IT TOOK EVERYTHING OUT.     
             TOOK EVERYTHING.   
           THE STRUCTURE STAYED.

422
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,242
    I THINK THAT PEOPLE JUST    
   DIDN'T WANT IT TO GO AWAY,   

423
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:54,312
  AND SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT, WE  
 GOTTA PUT A COMMITTEE TOGETHER 

424
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:57,448
   AND BRING THE DINER BACK."   
 SCHOOLS AND ALL DIFFERENT      
GROUPS RAISED MONEY FOR HIM.

     FREEDOM WITH THE MENU.     

429
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:11,062
             THE BREAKFAST MENU

  <i> WITH 30 DIFFERENT OMELETS.</i>

IN THERE.                       
           HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE
               TO STEAM THEM?   

479
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:21,858
 FOUR OR FIVE MINUTES WILL      
GIVE YOU A NICE MEDIUM ONE.     
              NOW WHERE DOES ONE
               GET ONE OF THESE?

480
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:25,529
THAT'S HANDMADE. THAT ONE THERE 
IS PROBABLY ABOUT 30 YEARS OLD. 
                             NO.

481
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:28,065
                  THAT'S SWEET. 

482
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,067
          I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS. 

483
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:32,069
      THE OLD TIMERS,           
WHAT THEY USED TO DO IS...      

484
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,471
        THEN POUR A LITTLE BIT  
       OF ITS OWN FAT ON THERE, 

485
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,406
              A LITTLE MOISTURE.
OUT COMES THE CHEESE.           

486
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,408
               OH, I GOTTA GET  
            ONE OF THESE THINGS.

487
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,944
   THE TRADITIONAL WAY TO HAVE  
THESE IS WITH MUSTARD AND ONION.

488
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,681
             LOOK AT THAT. MMM. 

489
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,350
     THAT CHEESE MAKES IT. YOU  
  REALLY TASTE THE BEEF IN THAT.

490
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:49,720
          IS THERE ANY SEASONING
               IN THE MEAT?     
NO, THAT'S JUST THE WAY         
  IT'S GROUND FOR US.           

491
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:52,890
          REALLY? DYNAMITE ROLL.
WE BAKE THE ROLLS               
    EVERY DAY.                  

492
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,826
        SURE MAKES A DIFFERENCE,
           THOUGH, DOESN'T IT?  
OH, ALL THE DIFFERENCE          
    IN THE WORLD.               

493
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:59,497
              SO THE WHOLE THING
                 WAS STEAMED?   
      EXCEPT THE ROLL.          
THE ROLL CAME OFF THE GRILL.    

494
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,198
   TYPICALLY YOU STEAM THE ROLL 

495
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:03,167
               AND YOU PUT      
        THE BURGER ON THE GRILL.

496
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:05,169
     HERE THEY STEAM THE BURGER 

497
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:07,171
 AND PUT THE ROLL ON THE GRILL. 

498
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,772
                 YEAH, EXACTLY. 

499
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,442
          I LOVE THEM.          
                 IT'S GOT A LOT 
                OF CHEESE ON IT.

500
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:14,512
                      IT'S GOOD.
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT   
THICK GLOB OF CHEDDAR CHEESE    

501
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,581
 ON THERE THAT'S                
REALLY SATISFYING.              
                           GLOB.

502
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,583
 BETTER THAN THOSE OTHER        
PLACES THAT MAKE BURGERS?       

503
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,318
           REALLY?              
I MEAN, LIKE,<i> REALLY</i> REALLY?    

504
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,055
              DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE
                THE SAME THING? 
 NO. THERE'S SO                 
MANY GOOD THINGS.               

505
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,857
WHY DID YOU E-MAIL ME?          
              I JUST THOUGHT    
           YOU HAD TO COME HERE.

506
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,859
AND THIS SURPASSES              
   ALL OTHERS?                  
                          RIGHT.

507
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,728
                 WITH RADICCHIO.
    IT'S OUR KIND OF PLACE.     

508
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:33,330
REALLY, REALLY BETTER THAN      
 ALL OF THE OTHER PLACES?       
                            YES.

509
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,698
HE SAID IT.                     

510
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,667
SO YOU THOUGHT AS YOU SAT       
   AND WATCHED IT BURN          

511
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,669
THAT YOU WERE GONNA REBUILD?    
          I MAY HAVE STAYED HERE

512
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,671
        AND JUST SOLD STEAMED   
    CHEESEBURGERS ON THE CORNER.

513
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,741
                   IT'S MY HOME.
   GOOD LUCK.                   
NICE TO MEET YOU.               

514
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,209
   SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP.  
     I'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME

00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,813
         ON TRIPLE "D"--        
 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

516
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:51,749
SEE? IT DOESN'T COME UP.        

517
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:53,918
                  WHAT WAS THAT?
I DON'T KNOW!                   

518
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,556

                    OH, MY GOSH.
