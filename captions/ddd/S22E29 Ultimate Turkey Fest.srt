1
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:05,302
         I'm Guy Fieri,
      and we're rolling out

2
00:00:05,304 --> 00:00:08,038
 looking for America's greatest
  diners, drive-ins, and dives.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,839
          This trip...

4
00:00:08,841 --> 00:00:09,973
        Hey.

5
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,608
  ...it's a Thanksgiving feast.

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,010
             Tastes like holiday
             right off the bat.

7
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:15,579
    Where the bird is flying
        front and center.

8
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:19,149
That's like someone shot off all
 the fireworks at the same time.

9
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:20,784
        Of course, we got
        the fully loaded

10
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:21,952
      traditional dinner...

11
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:24,121
 Get the hand cart.
I'm ready to get to my car.

12
00:00:24,123 --> 00:00:25,889
          ...alongside
      some real ringers...

13
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:27,858
            Shut the front door.

14
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,693
      ...like turkey pizza
          in Detroit...

15
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:30,594
                Look at that!

16
00:00:30,596 --> 00:00:32,429
        ...a turkey-twin
        in Albuquerque...

17
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:34,598
    People like to have a turkey
             to look that good.

18
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,400
  ...turkey tots in Milwaukee.

19
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:38,101
This is crunch-a-tastical.

20
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:41,171
        And in Syracuse,
    one funkalicious waffle.

21
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:44,441
                That is just,
         in so many ways, weird.

22
00:00:44,443 --> 00:00:45,642
     Whether it's smoked...

23
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:47,377
              Teach me the rub,
                oh, wise one.

24
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:49,079
        ...sandwiched...
  Rocks the house.

25
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:50,247
        ...or stuffed...

26
00:00:50,249 --> 00:00:52,149
                 Holy moly.

27
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:54,985
    ...get ready to gobble up
       this holiday hero.

28
00:00:54,987 --> 00:00:57,487
          Dude, that has changed
    Thanksgiving for me forever.

29
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:01,158
     That's all right here,
    right now, on "Triple D."

30
00:01:10,335 --> 00:01:11,635
     When I think of Boston,

31
00:01:11,637 --> 00:01:12,969
    I think of the Tea Party.

32
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:14,805
 I think of the Sox, of course,

33
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:17,541
         and now a place
    called Mike's City Diner.

34
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:18,975
          Now, it's not
       because the owner's

35
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:20,977
       an immigrant living
       the American dream

36
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:22,979
 or because President Clinton's
           eaten here.

37
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:24,448
     It's because of the way

38
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,551
      they're cranking out
  an American favorite: turkey.

39
00:01:27,553 --> 00:01:28,752
             Here you go, folks.

40
00:01:28,754 --> 00:01:30,020
 All right, Jay.
         Thank you, Jay.

41
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:31,088
       Turkey's fantastic.

42
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,122
    The food is just amazing.

43
00:01:32,124 --> 00:01:33,590
     Did you see this plate?

44
00:01:33,592 --> 00:01:35,392
       That, it should be
      almost semi-illegal.

45
00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:37,094
I remember
 the first time I came in here.

46
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,162
     I said, "Is that real,
       or is that a prop?"

47
00:01:39,164 --> 00:01:40,764
Oh, it's real all right.

48
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:42,532
 One of four home cooked turkeys

49
00:01:42,534 --> 00:01:45,802
        they're doing up
 and serving up every day here.

50
00:01:45,804 --> 00:01:47,204
    The all-American meal...

51
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:48,138
  Nice to meet you.

52
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,406
          ...from a guy
        who's telling you

53
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:50,774
           he's living
     the all-American dream.

54
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:53,143
  How old were you
when you came to the states?

55
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:54,811
                     8.
                8 years old.

56
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:55,846
    8 years old.

57
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:57,314
                  Lebanon.

58
00:01:57,316 --> 00:02:00,383
 Jay Hajj fell into the food biz
  as a dishwasher in his teens

59
00:02:00,385 --> 00:02:02,219
     then worked his way up.
                 It's excellent.

60
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:05,522
  He bought this place 12 years
  ago, left the original name,

61
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:07,691
      but got right to work
       on his own menu...

62
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:08,892
                 Can I have
              some more fries?

63
00:02:08,894 --> 00:02:11,161
      ...filled with fresh,
    homemade local favorites.

64
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:12,562
     We got some
good turkey dinner today.

65
00:02:12,564 --> 00:02:15,232
    When he tried his hand at
 turkey, it was an instant hit.

66
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:16,666
             It kind of happened
                by accident,

67
00:02:16,668 --> 00:02:19,236
      when I had no place to put
 the turkeys but on the steamer,

68
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:20,604
          on top of the steamer.

69
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:23,673
             And because it was
  an open kitchen, just it grew.

70
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:25,242
     It just got out of control.

71
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:26,443
    I was like, "Oh, my God.

72
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:28,578
      He's got real turkeys
     up there on the bone."

73
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,214
And on the plate
 and in huge sandwiches --

74
00:02:31,216 --> 00:02:35,118
 turkey salad, turkey meat loaf,
       turkey everything.

75
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,853
   All made fresh every day...

76
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:38,021
Here you go.
    Grab them now.

77
00:02:38,023 --> 00:02:38,922
          ...Jay's way.

78
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:40,090
         So,
someone made that for you?

79
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:41,791
                    Yeah.

80
00:02:41,793 --> 00:02:43,994
      That's...
Dude, that's snazzy.

81
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:45,061
Where'd you get the idea?

82
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:46,630
       I mean,
I've done the beer-can chicken.

83
00:02:46,632 --> 00:02:48,431
             Years ago, I found
    the stand for the chicken --

84
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:49,866
                  exactly,
           the beer-can chicken.

85
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:53,103
    And I realized that it cooks
     the chicken a little better

86
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:55,472
            because it's cooking
    from the inside and outside.

87
00:02:55,474 --> 00:02:57,340
                You twist the...
I like this little maneuver.

88
00:02:57,342 --> 00:02:58,341
       ...wings around the back.

89
00:02:58,343 --> 00:02:59,676
   Put your wings
  behind your back.

90
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:00,610
                There we go.

91
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:02,078
    And we're not
 gonna season this?

92
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,914
                  No seasoning.
No seasoning on the skin?

93
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,415
                   Unless
       you want to eat the skin,

94
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:11,021
    I found that it doesn't give
  any extra flavors to the meat.

95
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:12,756
             But if you say so,
          I will agree with you.

96
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:16,793
     No need -- Jay's gonna
 be all over the seasoning thing

97
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:17,928
    with his homemade gravy.

98
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,529
                 All right,
      now, this is onion powder,

99
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:21,198
       garlic, and white pepper.

100
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,599
          That is for the stock.

101
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:23,867
 A little bay leaf?

102
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:24,734
                    Yep.

103
00:03:24,736 --> 00:03:26,536
Turkish or Californian?

104
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:28,471
             That's Californian.
   Californian.

105
00:03:28,473 --> 00:03:29,839
       So we're just gonna
     make a standard rouge?

106
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:31,241
    There we go.

107
00:03:31,243 --> 00:03:32,909
                Come to papa.

108
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:36,012
You whisk that so you don't make
         yourself any dumplings.

109
00:03:36,014 --> 00:03:37,280
    That's right.

110
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:43,587
              Oh, that's good.

111
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:45,288
     That's got real big flavor.

112
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,723
     The stuffing will, too.

113
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:48,892
              Celery, carrots.
             Just dump them in.

114
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:50,026
 Dump them right in.

115
00:03:50,028 --> 00:03:51,361
               You don't have
      to sauté them or anything?

116
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:53,964
   No. No. No, no.
That's for fancy places.

117
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:55,532
                    White onion?
   White onion.

118
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:57,100
   Spanish onion.
        Yep.

119
00:03:57,102 --> 00:04:00,203
            I didn't talk to it.
  How'd you know it was Spanish?

120
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:01,171
   Now the turkey.

121
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:03,240
    Little chunks
between the stuffing.

122
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:05,642
            White pepper, cumin,
               seasoned salt,

123
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:07,677
      and the poultry seasoning.

124
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:09,579
                     Whisk.
   Whisk a little bit.

125
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:13,083
And now we let it simmer
for about 5, 10 minutes.

126
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:14,718
                We don't want
      to break the veggies down.

127
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,619
    That's right.

128
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:17,220
Put it right in here.
                         Wow.

129
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:20,223
      And now,
I'm gonna smash-a-matic.

130
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:22,626
        Now we got to bake this.
     It's not done. There we go.

131
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:25,095
 And there are potatoes to mash
     and squash to whip up.

132
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:27,731
      Whipping it where the whip
      keeps it a little stringy.

133
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:29,499
                 You want it
              a little stringy.

134
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:31,901
Everything you do has got
a little magic behind it.

135
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:33,036
      But the real magic...

136
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:34,170
                 Here we go.

137
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:36,206
           ...is when
     it's all on one plate.

138
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:41,311
         Wow. The turkey
     is super-money-tender.

139
00:04:41,313 --> 00:04:44,281
   The gravy, which is money.

140
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:47,951
  Stuffing, you can still taste
 the texture of the vegetables,

141
00:04:47,953 --> 00:04:50,954
        but it's creamy.

142
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:52,188
       That's really good.

143
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,990
         Have you eaten
     the Thanksgiving-a-thon

144
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:54,924
       here before, or...?

145
00:04:54,926 --> 00:04:56,793
Thanksgiving in July.

146
00:04:56,795 --> 00:05:00,030
             Yeah, Thanksgiving
       in September or February.

147
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:01,097
                    About
           any time you want it.

148
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:02,332
 Well, that's one of
  the cool things.

149
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:04,067
   You can get it
 any time you want.

150
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:06,303
 And if Thanksgiving on a plate
       isn't your thing...

151
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:08,338
    Those are our
pilgrim sandwiches, you guys.

152
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,806
That's my
   Thanksgiving dinner.

153
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:11,341
    That's right.
 It is Thanksgiving.

154
00:05:11,343 --> 00:05:12,876
      Thank you very much.
  All in a roll.

155
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:14,978
              We're gonna make
             a pilgrim sandwich.

156
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,313
Okay, so cranberries,

157
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:17,514
             Put stuffing in it.

158
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:19,215
That's a nice giddy-up.

159
00:05:19,217 --> 00:05:22,152
    Usually, it's all white meat
 unless the customer asks for...

160
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:24,654
So you pretty much make and do
and give whatever they want.

161
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:25,889
                 They want.

162
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,824
   Holy enchilada!
How much you gonna give them?

163
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:29,793
You should call that sandwich
  "The Goodnight."

164
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:31,061
  How many of these
   you sell a day?

165
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:32,228
          About 45, I would say.

166
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,798
    45 a day?
                   45, 50. Yeah.

167
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,301
No wonder you go through
700,000 turkeys a year.

168
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:41,237
Now, do you eat this with --
Is there, like, a contraption?

169
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:42,672
                    Well,
       when there's gravy in it,

170
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:45,342
             it's best to eat it
          with a fork and knife.

171
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:49,379
I got the gravy, the stuffing.

172
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:50,980
   That's awesome.
                        Thanks.

173
00:05:50,982 --> 00:05:52,949
That stands up there,
the best turkey sandwiches

174
00:05:52,951 --> 00:05:53,383
   I've ever had.

175
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:54,784
                    w.

176
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:56,920
Did you hear a piggy
 noise when you bit into it?

177
00:05:57,889 --> 00:05:58,822
       Say "Eat them up!"

178
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:00,724
Eat them up.

179
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:02,859
I like it all mixed up,
just like Thanksgiving.

180
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:03,893
      Put it all together.

181
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:05,128
Is this for real?

182
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,996
    Well, let me get another guy
             to help me eat it.

183
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:09,232
 It's like that with everything
       on the menu here --

184
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:11,401
          huge portions
     of real deal cooking...

185
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:12,635
  Eggs Benedict...
               Yes.

186
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:14,204
...with a huge chunk
       of ham.

187
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:15,872
  ...that has folks lining up.

188
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:17,140
Do you eat it all?

189
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:20,543
             I make a good dent.

190
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:22,145
        Yeah.
There's no gut down there.

191
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:24,447
          Dynamic Duo,
   and I get eggs and sausage.

192
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:25,849
This is called
    the Dynamic Duo?

193
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:26,983
             Uh-huh.

194
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:28,618
They usually order them
before I sit down, so...

195
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,587
          Oh, you're that loyal?
  Yeah.

196
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:31,755
              Gretchen. Amanda.

197
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:32,922
For Jay...

198
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:34,457
    And how's your breakfast
          this morning?

199
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:36,960
...It's all about owning
 a place people want to come to.

200
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:38,261
I'm very proud of that.

201
00:06:38,263 --> 00:06:39,896
      ...and locals want to
      keep coming back to.

202
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:41,731
 Everything's good?
                   Very good.

203
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:45,268
     And a big part of that
 is basic American home-cooking.

204
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,472
 Like those four turkeys a day,
 Thanksgiving anytime you want.

205
00:06:49,474 --> 00:06:51,808
               Really, I mean,
              that's a serving.

206
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,609
 Get another plate.

207
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:53,676
See, this is what I love.

208
00:06:53,678 --> 00:06:55,011
This is the best thing
     about this.

209
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:56,780
    Dude, you are
 the American dream.

210
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:58,081
                    I am.

211
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,550
          I feel sometime, like,
    it's like winning a lottery.

212
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:01,718
       It is!

213
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,921
 Get the hand cart.
I'm ready to get to my car.

214
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:06,389
     In Sarasota, Florida...

215
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:07,190
      Learn me.

216
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:07,991
       ...it's a chicken.

217
00:07:07,993 --> 00:07:08,858
                    Rawr!

218
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,793
         ...it's a duck.

219
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:10,593
                    Whoa!

220
00:07:10,595 --> 00:07:11,394
            It's a...

221
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:12,328
                 Turducken.

222
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,663
          ...Turducken.

223
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:15,765
This is kind of like culinary
Disneyland for a dude like me.

224
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:22,305
      When you're thinking
          about turkey,

225
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:24,340
  you're probably not thinking
      of a joint like this.

226
00:07:24,342 --> 00:07:26,075
      The Alpine Steakhouse
      in Sarasota, Florida

227
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:28,878
   is more of a like a sirloin
   and sausage kind of place.

228
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,114
      But wait till you see
 what they're doing with turkey.

229
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:33,283
    It's gonna blow you away.

230
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:34,984
           I love it.
     All different flavors.

231
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:36,252
          You can't get
        anything better.

232
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:38,588
     It's like Thanksgiving,
       just, all the time.

233
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,989
             No. Seriously, man.

234
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:42,792
            They take a chicken,
        they shove it in a duck,

235
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:44,360
         and they shove the duck
             inside the turkey.

236
00:07:44,362 --> 00:07:46,196
       And then they put a bunch
    of stuffing and stuff on it.

237
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:47,931
It's absolutely fabulous.

238
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:49,365
It's called a turducken.

239
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:52,135
   Just one of the hand-made,
      homemade specialties

240
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:54,404
    transplanted New Yorker,
          Mark Rebhan,

241
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:56,606
       and his son, Matt,
       are cranking out...

242
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:57,674
Need some fries down.

243
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:59,375
      ...at the restaurant
        and butcher shop

244
00:07:59,377 --> 00:08:02,145
   first opened by Mark's dad
          32 years ago.

245
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:05,548
My dad basically came to Florida
                 to retire.

246
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,749
            And that didn't last
                  too long.

247
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:08,485
  Yeah, looks like
he really did a good job of it.

248
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:10,386
                And went back
               into business.

249
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:13,122
         And I came down in '75,
               and here I am.

250
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:14,791
       About 12 years ago,

251
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:17,594
    Mark says he heard about
  something called a turducken.

252
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:19,262
Your dad comes home one day
      and says,

253
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:23,032
"Guess what? You're gonna
start boning chickens,

254
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:24,934
 ducks and turkeys,
making all the stuffing,

255
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:26,436
and shoving it together,
and then sewing it up

256
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:27,470
  like a football."

257
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:28,638
   What'd you say?

258
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,206
              Well, basically,
       he put one on the counter

259
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,508
               and he started
             doing one himself.

260
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,675
             And we just did it
                side-by-side.

261
00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:34,010
    Did you guys
  learn it together?
                         Yeah.

262
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:36,179
    Let me learn.
      Learn me.

263
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:37,714
        Well, basically, I mean,

264
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:40,450
             you have a chicken,
           a duck, and a turkey.

265
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:42,118
         So what I'm gonna do...
    Show me.

266
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,319
                Is I'm gonna
              take this chicken

267
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:44,521
                 and cut it
            right down the back.

268
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:46,022
                 I call this
           the scissor cut here.

269
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:47,824
               You want to get
         your knife tip in here.

270
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:49,692
         This is the oyster meat
               of the chicken.

271
00:08:49,694 --> 00:08:50,693
                 Best part.

272
00:08:50,695 --> 00:08:52,028
 All right. Now, the duck.
                    Same way.

273
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,496
   I like this.
                   All right.

274
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:56,332
This is kind of like culinary
Disneyland for a dude like me.

275
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:57,834
                   All right.
  Big turkey.

276
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:01,237
         If I'm down far enough,
   this is gonna pull right out.

277
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,541
         Oh.

278
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:05,975
                 Stock pot.

279
00:09:08,113 --> 00:09:09,512
That was money, dude.
                         Yeah.

280
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:10,680
Okay. Can I try this one?

281
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:13,216
              Sure. Absolutely.
                Be my guest.

282
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:14,951
                I feel a good
       finger cutting coming in.

283
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:17,654
   And you're just gonna kind of
         go down, pull the meat.

284
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:19,856
    There it is.

285
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:22,225
    Good job.
                     Rawr!

286
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:23,960
We're gonna take the duck
  and the chicken,

287
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:26,329
and I'm gonna hit it
with a little Cajun seasoning.

288
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:28,665
Throw the duck down.

289
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:29,666
Same with the chicken.

290
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:31,034
             The chicken goes on
                 a little --

291
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:33,403
                   This is
             the super-hot side.

292
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:34,270
             A little less hot.

293
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:35,371
    Right. Right.

294
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:36,773
Now what I'm gonna do
 is put some of them

295
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:39,075
blackening seasonings
      on there.

296
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:41,678
              Whoa!

297
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,446
I like how you let me
jump in on this part.

298
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:45,615
             Hey. You can cough.

299
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:47,984
Now, to start
 piecing this bad boy together.

300
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:49,252
          Virgin olive oil here.

301
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:50,620
          Get it into the seams,

302
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:52,722
      the pockets where you took
            the thigh bones out.

303
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:54,190
             A little blackening
                on this guy.

304
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:56,593
          Then take some of this
        cornbread stuffing here.

305
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:58,595
     Now you're gonna go to your
          spinach stuffing here,

306
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:00,496
            and you're gonna put
         some andouille sausage.

307
00:10:00,498 --> 00:10:02,198
And you guys make
the andouille sausage, also?

308
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,299
              Here on premises.

309
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:04,901
                    Some
       roasted red bell peppers.

310
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:06,536
Ah, that looks good.

311
00:10:06,538 --> 00:10:09,372
 Now you're gonna take your duck
             inside this turkey.

312
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:11,107
Let me ask you this, boss.

313
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:13,376
Why isn't the chicken down?
    He's bigger.

314
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:17,213
              Well, turducken.

315
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,015
             That's the turkey,
              then the duck...

316
00:10:19,017 --> 00:10:20,416
Give me the knife.
            ...then the chicken.

317
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:21,918
              You're not doing
                as much now.

318
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,252
You're just kind of hiding
  it in there now.

319
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:24,954
           Yeah. Now we're gonna
             go to the chicken.

320
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:26,322
   I bet you have
  a lot of friends

321
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:27,857
  come Thanksgiving
 and Christmas time.

322
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:29,726
      You're just gonna take it,

323
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:33,262
    and you're gonna bring it up
          and turn it like this.

324
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:36,032
    Sometimes, it's best to have
      a friend help you hold it.

325
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:38,201
     Let me see
if I can find somebody.

326
00:10:39,604 --> 00:10:42,205
    When is your
spring clothing line coming out?

327
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:44,307
'Cause you're really
  doing a MAC job.

328
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:46,509
Dude, you make that look
      so easy.

329
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:48,011
That might be one of
  the best-looking

330
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:50,179
Dokood itemske that look
    I've ever...

331
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:51,447
I mean, it's just beautiful.

332
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:53,416
    And you just want to kind of
             set it up in here.

333
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:57,286
    Now, how long
does super bird take?

334
00:10:57,288 --> 00:10:59,956
            This super bird here
             is gonna take about

335
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,058
               12 to 13 hours
               at 200 degrees.

336
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,292
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
      How many?

337
00:11:03,294 --> 00:11:05,662
               12 to 13 hours.

338
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:06,696
        Okay.
  So that goes in.

339
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:08,665
           Slide it on in there.

340
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:11,167
  So you just close
  that oven and...

341
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:17,840
                  It's hot.

342
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:20,643
                One, two, three.
  One, two, three.

343
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:24,814
     All right.

344
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:25,882
   I feel better.

345
00:11:25,884 --> 00:11:27,650
                   You do?

346
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:30,319
  I'm gonna cut it
right down the middle.

347
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:33,823
      The steam coming off that.
      Aw, you should smell that!

348
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:35,958
                 Holy moly.

349
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,827
How's that look for you?

350
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:45,034
                     Ah, man.
 It's a good combination.

351
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:46,235
         Definitely the richness
                of the duck.

352
00:11:46,237 --> 00:11:48,705
                And the fat.

353
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:52,141
                  And then,

354
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:55,144
         you know what I pick up
      in there is the andouille.

355
00:11:57,882 --> 00:12:00,483
               And the chicken
      has such a lighter texture

356
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:01,350
              than the turkey.

357
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:02,318
        Yeah.

358
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,756
           That is a flavor-fest
                right there.

359
00:12:06,758 --> 00:12:07,924
                    Mmm.

360
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:11,127
Guy, you haven't even had
  gravy on it yet.

361
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:12,662
        Why would you cover that
               with anything?

362
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:14,097
                 Seriously.

363
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:16,165
             That's like someone
      shot off all the fireworks

364
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18,067
              at the same time.

365
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:19,068
            So good.

366
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,037
     It's very,
very tender and moist.

367
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,538
Seems Mark and Matt

368
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,308
      just have a way with
 stuffing things full of flavor.

369
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,976
Look at this thing.
                  There you go.

370
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:29,445
   First course or main meal.

371
00:12:29,447 --> 00:12:33,316
  Set these guys loose, and you
   really are talking turkey.

372
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:35,084
        That's really good, man.
  Isn't that good?

373
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:37,086
                  This has
             fulfilled a dream.

374
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:38,554
        Good.

375
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:40,556
            Coming up
  in Albuquerque, New Mexico...

376
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:41,824
                Wait for it!

377
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:44,393
         ...we're baking
 a whole different kind of bird.

378
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:45,728
              That's beautiful.

379
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,463
  And in Syracuse, New York...

380
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:48,765
                   Welcome
               to flavor town.

381
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,268
      ...or waffle town for
the craziest turkey dinner ever.

382
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,970
                Oh, my gosh!
               That is killer!

383
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:02,578
   On the road to flavor town.

384
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,646
     I say it all the time,

385
00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:05,548
 "If it's funky, I'll find it."

386
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,717
      I'm here in Syracuse,
 New York right by the campus --

387
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:09,118
   This is called S.U. Hill --

388
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,853
    To check out out a joint
          that's funky.

389
00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:12,321
      "How funky," you ask?

390
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:15,258
            So funky,
   it's called Funk-n-Waffles.

391
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:24,901
       And this is, like,
    adult version of waffles.

392
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:26,836
         Falafel Waffle.
    There's nothing like it.

393
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:34,310
Who runs around with
a bunch of waffle irons?

394
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:35,411
These guys.

395
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:38,581
         Syracuse grads,
    Kyle Corea and Adam Gold.

396
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,249
We threw these crazy
    house parties

397
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:41,250
when we were in college.

398
00:13:41,252 --> 00:13:42,752
  I'd be deejaying
   with my buddy.

399
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:43,786
And my business partner,
        Kyle,

400
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:44,921
would be slinging waffles
     at the bar.

401
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:46,355
 You got your beer.
You got your waffles.

402
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:47,623
                       Really?
   Just handing them out.

403
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,925
And in 2007,

404
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,661
       they made it legit
     and kept it underground

405
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:54,096
   when they opened this joint
        in the basement.

406
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,334
               Savory waffles
           and breakfast waffles

407
00:13:58,336 --> 00:14:01,170
              and lunch waffles
  and fried chicken and waffles.

408
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:03,306
      And for the ultimate
          comfort food,

409
00:14:03,308 --> 00:14:04,707
      the bird is the word.

410
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:08,277
  Jive Turkey -- a Thanksgiving
   dinner on top of a waffle.

411
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,613
All right, we're gonna
make the Jive Turkey.

412
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:12,148
 And that starts out
with our stuffing batter,

413
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,483
some cubed up bread, celery.

414
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:15,651
     A little caramelized onion.

415
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:19,455
I got our eggs and rosemary.
    Kosher salt.

416
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:21,691
A little bit of chicken broth.
Fresh ground pepper.

417
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:22,825
Spin this thing around.

418
00:14:22,827 --> 00:14:24,160
             So this is gonna go
             in a waffle maker?

419
00:14:24,162 --> 00:14:25,528
    That's right.
This guy's ready to go.

420
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,363
                Load that up.

421
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:28,998
    veer seen this before.
    That's right.
ThAll right.eady to go.

422
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,201
                That is just,
         in so many ways, weird.

423
00:14:32,203 --> 00:14:33,269
 Weird can be cool.

424
00:14:33,271 --> 00:14:34,503
    And now that
 the waffle's down,

425
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:36,272
we're gonna start preparing
  everything else.

426
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:38,007
We got some turkey right here.
                         Got it.

427
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:39,075
         This is probably one of

428
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:40,743
            the weirdest waffles
               I've ever seen.

429
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:42,245
              But I am going to
                 steal this.

430
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:44,580
     All righty.
This guy's ready to go.

431
00:14:44,582 --> 00:14:46,249
          Let's just trim him up
                a little bit.

432
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:47,550
             Look at this thing!

433
00:14:48,353 --> 00:14:49,452
                     Ah.

434
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:51,020
Let's throw some of this turkey
      on there.

435
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:52,455
  Let's get some of
these mashed potatoes.

436
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:54,724
             Mouth is firing up.

437
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:55,925
      Oh, yeah.

438
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:58,594
Then let's get a little bit
   of gravy on it.

439
00:14:58,596 --> 00:15:00,329
     We're gonna
throw some cranberry sauce.

440
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:01,998
            This might be one of
             the funkiest things

441
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,133
              we've ever tried.

442
00:15:05,637 --> 00:15:06,669
                    Mmm!

443
00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:08,371
            Shut the front door!

444
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:10,873
                Oh, my gosh!
               That is killer!

445
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,509
             This is righteous.

446
00:15:13,511 --> 00:15:17,079
  The stuffing, it's the crunch,
                the texture.

447
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:18,514
      Mashed potatoes are legit.

448
00:15:18,516 --> 00:15:20,249
     That is funking ridiculous.

449
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:23,152
          Dude, that has changed
    Thanksgiving for me forever.

450
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:24,553
               I'm coming here
              for Thanksgiving.

451
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:25,855
                 You're in.
         Welcome to flavor town.

452
00:15:25,857 --> 00:15:27,356
   Appreciate it.

453
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,660
It is probably

454
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:32,628
       the most ridiculous
  funking waffle I've ever had.

455
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,730
 Out of this world.
                   Delicious.
             You can't go wrong.

456
00:15:34,732 --> 00:15:37,433
       This may be, like,
   the capital of flavor town.

457
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,677
   So, it's Thanksgiving time.

458
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,345
             Now, on
 "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,"

459
00:15:49,347 --> 00:15:51,180
    I have traveled all over
       this great country

460
00:15:51,182 --> 00:15:52,548
   meeting all types of folks

461
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,684
    celebrating this holiday
         their own way.

462
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:57,119
          So here I am
   in Albuquerque, New Mexico

463
00:15:57,121 --> 00:15:58,721
   where a father-and-son team

464
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:02,591
 have been baking up New Mexican
     specialties since 1972.

465
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:05,928
      And wait till you see
  the type of turkey they bake.

466
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,230
 This is Golden Crown Panaderia.

467
00:16:11,402 --> 00:16:15,237
        It's a fantastic,
     family-oriented bakery.

468
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:19,075
  We feel really lucky to have
  them right around the corner.

469
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:21,010
Great food.
  Great customer service.

470
00:16:21,012 --> 00:16:22,545
   Where you feel like family.

471
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:25,681
And they definitely know
 how to make a Guy feel welcome.

472
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:27,083
  Chris and Pratt are the best.

473
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:30,052
The father-and-son
 powerhouse behind this joint.

474
00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:33,923
       It all began in '72
 when military-man Pratt Morales

475
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:36,859
            got after
   what he really loved to do.

476
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,260
I always wanted
 to be a baker.

477
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:40,429
And everywhere in the world
that I traveled in the military,

478
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:41,931
   I would wind up
at the local bakery.

479
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:44,433
        And it took just
     another 30 years to get

480
00:16:44,435 --> 00:16:46,035
  a reliable business partner.

481
00:16:46,037 --> 00:16:47,903
Couldn't afford a C.E.O.,
 so I raised my own.

482
00:16:47,905 --> 00:16:50,506
  Together, they've turned out
      a one-of-a-kind menu.

483
00:16:50,508 --> 00:16:52,675
         It's all about
      the bizcochitos here.

484
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:54,076
  I like the pumpkin empanadas.

485
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:55,778
But when it comes to
   Thanksgiving...

486
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,046
Isn't that beautiful?

487
00:16:57,048 --> 00:17:01,217
    ...it's no surprise that
the bird is absolutely the word.

488
00:17:01,219 --> 00:17:02,551
     Turkey bread is great.

489
00:17:02,553 --> 00:17:05,121
        They make it look
       just like a turkey.

490
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:07,390
               Okay, what are
               we gonna make?
I want to make some dough.

491
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:09,592
And this is gonna be the wheat
part of the turkey...

492
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:11,093
               The wheat part.

493
00:17:11,095 --> 00:17:12,595
...which is the leg,
the drumsticks, and the wings.

494
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:15,731
    Got some nice
stone-ground wheat flour.

495
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:17,299
This is the bread flour.

496
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:18,534
A lot of gluten in here.

497
00:17:18,536 --> 00:17:20,136
Put a little bit of salt
      in there.

498
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:21,504
A little bit of shortening.

499
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:23,973
   And let it mix
  for a little bit.

500
00:17:23,975 --> 00:17:26,175
Some molasses. That's gonna
give us some of the color.

501
00:17:26,177 --> 00:17:27,810
   It's also some
of the sweetener, too.

502
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:29,678
And to soften up the dough
    a little bit,

503
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,946
   we're gonna put
     some honey.

504
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:32,148
                     Darling.
Beautiful.

505
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,817
And now we're going to add
  some water to it.

506
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:38,921
I'm gonna add it slowly,
little by little by little.

507
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:40,423
 Time for the yeast.

508
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:42,858
We got all the mixes in there,
   so here we go.

509
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:47,063
     We stop it,
bring it all out here.

510
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:49,231
And what I'm gonna do now
 to make a turkey --

511
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:50,966
 It's gonna be made
   in three parts.

512
00:17:50,968 --> 00:17:52,835
    I'm gonna cut
   the drumsticks.

513
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:56,806
The wings is gonna be
 about 1/2 a pound.

514
00:17:56,808 --> 00:17:58,574
    There you go.

515
00:17:58,576 --> 00:18:00,342
I have another dough
     that I need

516
00:18:00,344 --> 00:18:02,578
to make the white
part of the turkey,
which is the breast.

517
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,413
    White flour,
a little bit of sugar,

518
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,649
salt, the shortening.

519
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:08,818
                   Gotcha.
  Water.

520
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,519
 And add the yeast.

521
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:14,690
  Well, here we go.
                           Okay.

522
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:17,159
                  How long
       have you been doing this?
About 40 years.

523
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:18,527
                  40 years
       you've been making these?

524
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:19,628
    Yes. Mm-hmm.

525
00:18:21,232 --> 00:18:23,299
Oh, this is gonna be
   the drumsticks.

526
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:24,433
                  I see it.

527
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:25,734
 They're dark meat.

528
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:27,336
And then we're gonna do
      the body,

529
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:30,005
which is the white part
of the turkey -- the breast.

530
00:18:30,007 --> 00:18:32,141
And this is gonna go
   right in here.
                      Seriously?

531
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:35,077
Okay. And I'm gonna twist it
     like this.

532
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,412
 Now we're gonna do
     the wings.

533
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:45,020
    separate it.

534
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:47,156
    There you go.
 And then the wings.

535
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:48,924
Separate them over here, also.
      The bone.

536
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:50,459
               Could have been
               a taxidermist.

537
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:52,795
                  Giving it
               a little texture.
There you go.

538
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:54,930
  And I'm gonna do
a very light egg wash --

539
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:56,232
Give it the golden color.

540
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:57,500
   Some rosemary.

541
00:18:57,502 --> 00:18:59,168
A little bit of parsley.

542
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,638
     Let it rise
 as high as it will.

543
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,807
                Wait for it!
                   Ready?

544
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:06,408
Ta-da!

545
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,144
  Here we go, guys.

546
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,378
                Look at that.

547
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,247
              That's beautiful.
Isn't that beautiful?

548
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:13,149
          I think people would
          like to have a turkey
          that looked that good.

549
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:15,050
I'm gonna slice you a piece.
    How is that?

550
00:19:15,052 --> 00:19:16,685
              I'd like to have
              some of the knee.

551
00:19:16,687 --> 00:19:18,554
    A little knee
    right there.

552
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:23,592
                    Mmm.

553
00:19:23,594 --> 00:19:25,361
           Great crust on there.

554
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:29,465
             I get a little bit
             of that molasses.
There you go.

555
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:31,167
         Try some of the breast.

556
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:33,435
 There's a good part
    right there.

557
00:19:33,437 --> 00:19:35,371
        It has huge crust on it,

558
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:37,873
 but then it's just pillowy soft
               on the inside.

559
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:43,646
             I get a little bit
     of that rosemary on that --

560
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:44,780
               On that bread.

561
00:19:44,782 --> 00:19:46,582
          It tastes like holiday
             right off the bat.

562
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:48,584
It looks good on your table

563
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:50,386
        with your flowers
    or whatever you're doing.

564
00:19:50,388 --> 00:19:52,721
It's a great place to come

565
00:19:52,723 --> 00:19:54,590
  and feel like you're welcome
          all the time.

566
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:55,691
    There you go.

567
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:57,593
               Pratt, amazing.
Thank you, my friend.

568
00:19:57,595 --> 00:20:00,162
                 I love it.

569
00:20:00,164 --> 00:20:03,432
Up next, on this full hour --
  ultimate turkey fest...

570
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:04,266
That's good bird, man.

571
00:20:04,268 --> 00:20:05,701
       ...in New Orleans.

572
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:07,636
This is like food Mardi Gras
   right here.
                   There you go.

573
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:09,772
 Thanksgiving, Big Easy-style...

574
00:20:09,774 --> 00:20:12,808
I'm not kidding you.
That is ridiculously fantastic.

575
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:13,876
 ...all the way down to dessert.

576
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:15,344
  How do you think
I should get after it?

577
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:22,418
  So, I'm here in New Orleans,
    on Elysian Fields Avenue,

578
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,120
  right between I-10 and I-610.

579
00:20:25,122 --> 00:20:27,489
     Now, when I'm thinking
   of great food in this area,

580
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:28,657
    and there's a lot of it,

581
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:29,725
       I got to be honest.

582
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:31,560
     I'm not thinking about
          Thanksgiving.

583
00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:35,397
Well, that's until I heard about
 Sammy's Food Service and Deli.

584
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:36,832
               Turkey dinner,
             working coming up.

585
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:39,401
      It's just a wonderful
  New Orleans local restaurant.

586
00:20:39,403 --> 00:20:40,603
               Turkey dinner.

587
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:42,171
Doing a killer
 New Orleans Thanksgiving.

588
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:43,272
              Mmm.

589
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:45,708
Thanksgiving is a big time
   in New Orleans.

590
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,676
           Coming up.
    And it's a huge tradition

591
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:49,578
      for self-taught chef,
        Sammy Schlegel...

592
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,280
When you cook everything
     homemade...

593
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:53,515
  ...at a joint that used to be
   his uncle's butcher shop...

594
00:20:53,517 --> 00:20:54,683
Turkey dinner for here.

595
00:20:54,685 --> 00:20:57,119
   ...till Sammy and his wife,
        Gina, took over.

596
00:20:57,121 --> 00:20:58,754
     Turkey and oyster dressing.

597
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:00,889
    Butcher chop
turns into a sandwich shop.

598
00:21:00,891 --> 00:21:02,825
Now turns into making
some Thanksgivings...

599
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:04,560
        Wonderful turkey
       and cranberry. Mmm.

600
00:21:04,562 --> 00:21:05,861
Done the Big Easy way.

601
00:21:05,863 --> 00:21:07,029
Dressing with oysters.

602
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:08,564
This is New Orleans.
We always have oysters.

603
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:09,565
           That's the way it is.

604
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:10,799
     Okay, well,
give me the rub down.

605
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:12,968
             Get our beds set up
       for our turkey to lie on.

606
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,871
               Celery, garlic,
        coarsely chopped onions.

607
00:21:15,873 --> 00:21:17,740
These are also gonna
create a lot of great flavor

608
00:21:17,742 --> 00:21:18,574
for our gravy later.

609
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:19,441
                   Absolutely.
     Okay.

610
00:21:19,443 --> 00:21:20,242
                Paint him up.

611
00:21:20,244 --> 00:21:21,377
     A little garlic butter oil.

612
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:22,645
              And that's gonna
          give him a nice sheen,

613
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:24,813
              make this poultry
         seasoning stick to him.

614
00:21:24,815 --> 00:21:26,282
      Try not to miss any spots.

615
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:27,950
I think you might have
    missed there.

616
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:29,251
  There you go. Good job.
               Now we're good.

617
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:30,319
    Did you make
 the chicken stock?

618
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:31,387
         From the chicken backs.

619
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:32,354
It's a sandwich shop.

620
00:21:32,356 --> 00:21:33,555
              Put it in there.

621
00:21:33,557 --> 00:21:35,291
So that's gonna make some
great gravy on the bottom.

622
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:36,125
   Stuffing time.

623
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:37,159
         Half a pound of butter.

624
00:21:37,161 --> 00:21:38,327
              We're gonna make
              a bechamel sauce.

625
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:39,995
      Bechamel?
    For stuffing?

626
00:21:39,997 --> 00:21:41,630
                   Some flour.
Build a little rue.

627
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:42,798
   Throw a little
   milk in there.

628
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,266
             Get a nice, little,
             creamy paste here.

629
00:21:44,268 --> 00:21:46,902
              Sauté some celery
           and red bell peppers,

630
00:21:46,904 --> 00:21:48,637
      onions, green bell pepper.

631
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:49,872
         I'm gonna need a spoon.

632
00:21:49,874 --> 00:21:51,874
    Well, listen,
I just showed up with car keys.

633
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:54,209
            Ah, I'm telling you.

634
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:56,779
       How you like them apples?

635
00:21:56,781 --> 00:21:58,314
  Please don't ask
    for a mixer.

636
00:21:58,316 --> 00:22:00,516
             Put our butter in.

637
00:22:00,518 --> 00:22:02,184
Butter's kind of helping
  them mellow out.

638
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:04,887
      Take our oysters, put them
in this little chopping machina.

639
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:06,088
                Break them up
                a little bit.

640
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,791
That's not something
 you see every day.

641
00:22:08,793 --> 00:22:10,159
         Releases up the flavor.
 Huge.

642
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:12,227
   Add some of this garlic here,
                 the thyme.

643
00:22:12,229 --> 00:22:13,729
    What was that word?
                       Thyme.

644
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:14,963
        Thyme.
                      Thyme.

645
00:22:14,965 --> 00:22:17,566
Red pepper flakes, black pepper,
             some Cajun season,

646
00:22:17,568 --> 00:22:18,801
       bay leaves, chicken base.

647
00:22:18,803 --> 00:22:20,035
    Smells great.

648
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:21,904
Look at the amount of oysters
to the amount of bread.

649
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:24,373
 This guy is crazy.

650
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,274
                    Hey.

651
00:22:25,276 --> 00:22:26,508
        Hey.

652
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,943
You have the french bread
     brought in.

653
00:22:27,945 --> 00:22:29,011
                    Yep.

654
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:29,912
That's good, even stale.

655
00:22:29,914 --> 00:22:31,113
               All right, Guy.

656
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:32,715
         I know this is the part
        you've been waiting for.

657
00:22:32,717 --> 00:22:34,483
              Put the bechamel
                in here now.

658
00:22:34,485 --> 00:22:36,785
You're building the gravy
right into the stuffing.

659
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:38,654
    Here we go with the oysters.
                All that in.

660
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:41,223
I want that over some pasta.
Forget putting it in stuffing.

661
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:43,158
              Grated Parmesan,
           touch of lemon juice,

662
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,226
             flat-leaf parsley.

663
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:45,661
  Can I just start
dipping the bread in it,

664
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:47,062
  forget the whole
 Thanksgiving thing?

665
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:48,731
              Sure. Absolutely.

666
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:51,900
Is that your five bucks
on the floor over there?

667
00:22:51,902 --> 00:22:54,203
          Oh, man. My lucky day.
                Look at this.

668
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:55,504
So worth five bucks.

669
00:22:55,506 --> 00:22:58,273
This has just got to be a dip
with some bread and some...

670
00:22:58,275 --> 00:22:59,742
              That's a thought.
                  Exactly.

671
00:22:59,744 --> 00:23:01,110
 Oh, and the oysters
     are fresh?

672
00:23:01,112 --> 00:23:02,144
             Oysters are fresh.

673
00:23:02,146 --> 00:23:04,613
           And we have five eggs
                beaten here.

674
00:23:04,615 --> 00:23:06,582
   Oh. Wait, wait,
  wait, wait, wait.

675
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:08,250
Before you put the eggs
     in it, man.

676
00:23:08,252 --> 00:23:09,785
    Now, I'm gonna fold this in.

677
00:23:09,787 --> 00:23:12,588
I'm not kidding you.
That is ridiculously fantastic.

678
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,423
Gonna bake a little bit?
         We're pre-cooking this.

679
00:23:14,425 --> 00:23:15,791
  Out of the oven,
I'm not kidding you.
Thainto that bird.ly fantastic.

680
00:23:15,793 --> 00:23:17,693
             Stuffing the bird.
              Tuck his legs in.

681
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:18,861
        Give him a little truss.

682
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:20,496
         Birds gonna go in, 350.

683
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:21,730
  Hour and a half?
                      Correct.

684
00:23:21,732 --> 00:23:23,165
                Now it's time
             to make our gravy.

685
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:25,801
'Cause you already fortified it
with some chicken stock.

686
00:23:25,803 --> 00:23:28,470
     Turn this boat motor loose.

687
00:23:28,472 --> 00:23:30,339
     Add a little texture to it.
                 Here we go.

688
00:23:30,341 --> 00:23:32,508
           Go ahead and cut this
        breast lobe off of here.

689
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,643
I don't really think it's fair
that I should have all that.

690
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:36,145
             Feel free to share.

691
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:38,447
   This seasoning
on the outside of this,

692
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:40,783
along with that garlic butter
    rub you did,

693
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:41,984
that's good bird, man.

694
00:23:41,986 --> 00:23:43,218
         Put it on a plate here.

695
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,553
Did you make the cranberry?

696
00:23:44,555 --> 00:23:46,455
     Yeah, this is what you been
         waiting for right here.

697
00:23:46,457 --> 00:23:47,356
Right out of the bird.

698
00:23:47,358 --> 00:23:50,325
            And a little topping
                of the gravy.

699
00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:51,226
        Mmm.

700
00:23:51,228 --> 00:23:53,529
Dude, that's super-tasty.
        Wow.

701
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:55,831
     The turkey
is ridiculously tender.

702
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,499
    The stuffing
has great texture to it.

703
00:23:57,501 --> 00:23:58,834
I mean, it's big flavor.

704
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:00,769
You can really taste
the oysters, a boatload of them.

705
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:04,339
And the gravy is right on point,
up at ridiculous level.

706
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:06,375
This is like food Mardi Gras
   right here.
                   There you go.

707
00:24:06,377 --> 00:24:08,811
The turkey dinner,
  it's really good.

708
00:24:08,813 --> 00:24:10,279
   The dressing is delicious.

709
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:12,581
     You taste the oysters.
                       Oh, yeah.

710
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:13,849
                   Perfect
             Thanksgiving meal.

711
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:15,684
           And that's how you do
            a Thanksgiving right

712
00:24:15,686 --> 00:24:16,485
               in New Orleans.

713
00:24:16,487 --> 00:24:18,053
That's how you do it.
        Mmm.

714
00:24:18,055 --> 00:24:19,455
- Pick up.
- And for dessert...

715
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,423
- Pumpkin bread pudding?
- Pumpkin bread pudding.

716
00:24:21,425 --> 00:24:23,659
 Especially around Thanksgiving,
             you got to have it.

717
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:25,861
You know when it starts off
     with this,

718
00:24:25,863 --> 00:24:26,762
   makes me happy.

719
00:24:26,764 --> 00:24:27,763
   A mess of eggs.

720
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:29,498
                Mess of eggs.
               Whipping cream.

721
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,033
    Get in there
  and get you some.
                         Yeah.

722
00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:34,870
  Brown sugar, some white sugar,
        roasted, pureed pumpkin.

723
00:24:34,872 --> 00:24:36,939
           And then we have some
               pumpkin spice.

724
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:37,739
     Necessary.

725
00:24:37,741 --> 00:24:39,241
                Some vanilla.
   Vanilla.

726
00:24:39,243 --> 00:24:41,109
                Vanilla beans.
  The scrapings
 of the vanilla beans.

727
00:24:41,111 --> 00:24:41,944
                    Yes.

728
00:24:41,946 --> 00:24:43,312
      Puree everything together.

729
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:46,181
A big pumpkin omelet
    right there.

730
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:48,550
                 All right.
          Now some French bread.

731
00:24:48,552 --> 00:24:50,319
So, you take the french bread
  that's left over,

732
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:52,020
ind it up, crust and all.

733
00:24:52,022 --> 00:24:54,056
            And we're just gonna
             pour that right in.

734
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:56,558
Wow. You guys get serious
     about this.

735
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,994
             This will sit for,
              maybe, 20 minutes

736
00:24:58,996 --> 00:25:01,029
               just to absorb
               all the liquid.

737
00:25:01,031 --> 00:25:02,264
 Into the big chunks
      of bread.

738
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:03,832
What are these little
   tasty morsels?

739
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:06,335
                    Those
            are candied walnuts.

740
00:25:06,337 --> 00:25:08,136
        Just to add a little bit
              of flavor to it.

741
00:25:08,138 --> 00:25:09,738
 There's some nice,
little texture in there.

742
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,875
         And then I'm gonna need
           that pan right there.

743
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:14,176
    There you go.

744
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:15,878
Down right
down to the number, huh?

745
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,912
                    Yeah.

746
00:25:16,914 --> 00:25:18,447
     We're gonna bake it at 300.

747
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:19,648
  Down for an hour.

748
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,316
 So you bring a lot
of that moisture out.

749
00:25:21,318 --> 00:25:22,618
   Just sits there
 and compacts down.

750
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,752
    That's crazy.

751
00:25:23,754 --> 00:25:25,854
     But I like
these little candied walnuts

752
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:27,422
that I just picked out of there.

753
00:25:27,424 --> 00:25:28,457
         Would you like a slice?

754
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:29,825
 Is that cooled down
    a little bit?

755
00:25:29,827 --> 00:25:31,393
Them candied walnuts
taste like pumpkin pie.

756
00:25:31,395 --> 00:25:33,395
I'm not a big bread pudding fan.
I got to be honest with you.

757
00:25:33,397 --> 00:25:34,296
                   You aren't?
        No.

758
00:25:34,298 --> 00:25:35,531
 It's the egg ratio.

759
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:36,665
 Just not necessary.

760
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:37,866
Should be able to put
something else in it.

761
00:25:37,868 --> 00:25:38,934
    Chicken stock
   would be good.

762
00:25:38,936 --> 00:25:40,135
                  Oh, okay.

763
00:25:40,137 --> 00:25:41,703
           Well, we're gonna see
              if you like this.

764
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:43,238
    I'm a fan of
 this bread company.

765
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,707
So I got to believe that with
the bread being chewy and all...

766
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:46,942
             Oh, it's wonderful.

767
00:25:46,944 --> 00:25:49,411
                 Rum sauce.
  Cream, sugar, rum, cornstarch.

768
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:50,445
         Ah.

769
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:52,614
  How do you think
I should get after it?

770
00:25:52,616 --> 00:25:53,782
Attack it from the left?

771
00:25:53,784 --> 00:25:54,850
    I'm gonna go
right in the center.

772
00:25:54,852 --> 00:25:58,020
    Look at that.
Smells like pumpkin pie.

773
00:25:58,022 --> 00:26:00,722
I'm gonna be
eating these words for a while.

774
00:26:00,724 --> 00:26:02,624
    That is some
tasty bread pudding.

775
00:26:02,626 --> 00:26:05,494
It's got a good crunch.
It's not pumpkin madness.

776
00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:07,829
 The rum sauce isn't
super over-the-top sweet.

777
00:26:07,831 --> 00:26:10,198
Could be the holidays
      or what.

778
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,533
  There's something
  about that combo

779
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:13,602
because I just ate four more
bites than I expected I would.

780
00:26:13,604 --> 00:26:14,703
 That's really good.

781
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:16,204
    Nice job.
                   Thank you.

782
00:26:16,206 --> 00:26:17,372
          Pumpkin bread pudding.

783
00:26:17,374 --> 00:26:19,041
       It's just fabulous.

784
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:21,043
Pumpkin-y,
  nice cream sauce.

785
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:21,910
         Oh, it's yummy.

786
00:26:21,912 --> 00:26:23,211
    Malata soup.

787
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:25,547
 Anything that they put together
       is excellent. Mmm.

788
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:28,250
And you can just count on coming
   here and having good food.

789
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:29,284
            Oh, yeah.

790
00:26:29,286 --> 00:26:30,652
              That's my brother
            from another mother.

791
00:26:30,654 --> 00:26:32,120
              A little goatee,
               some earrings,

792
00:26:32,122 --> 00:26:33,689
    bleached-out hair, I'll have
       him working as my double.

793
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:35,691
       You drive the '67 around.

794
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:36,825
                I'll hang out
            and make sandwiches.

795
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:38,994
Oh, you got a deal then.

796
00:26:40,898 --> 00:26:42,164
Coming up in Detroit...

797
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:44,132
All right, let me try to
explain things to you

798
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:45,968
as I shove my face with it.

799
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,704
 ...a joint putting the poultry
        right on the pie.

800
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:50,906
You got to try this.

801
00:26:50,908 --> 00:26:52,574
 And in Milwaukee, Wisconsin...

802
00:26:52,576 --> 00:26:54,276
That gravy is legit.

803
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:56,979
      ...the whole shebang
   rolled into a single bite.

804
00:26:56,981 --> 00:26:58,413
 Lucky you have her
keeping you in line.

805
00:26:58,415 --> 00:26:59,615
                    She does.
This guy's out of control.

806
00:27:06,156 --> 00:27:07,356
 I'm here in Detroit, Michigan,

807
00:27:07,358 --> 00:27:09,224
     right across the street
    from the Eastern Market,

808
00:27:09,226 --> 00:27:10,559
   to check out a pizza joint

809
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:12,494
         where the owner
       got his inspiration

810
00:27:12,496 --> 00:27:15,397
 from a little village that his
   father grew up in in Italy.

811
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:17,032
         He got so much
       inspiration from it

812
00:27:17,034 --> 00:27:18,634
     that he named the joint
            after it.

813
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,469
    This is Supino Pizzeria.

814
00:27:20,471 --> 00:27:21,837
      Margherita going out.

815
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,705
   Supino's is the best pizza
      anywhere around here.

816
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:24,940
    Large Supino coming out.

817
00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:26,742
     But not New York pizza,
         Italian pizza.

818
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:28,176
            What makes the pizza
                  so good?

819
00:27:28,178 --> 00:27:29,945
The ingredients.
 Everything's great.

820
00:27:29,947 --> 00:27:31,680
  Dave's excellent
  at making pizzas.

821
00:27:31,682 --> 00:27:33,415
Large verdure e funghi
   coming out.

822
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:34,850
That'd be Dave Mancini,

823
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:37,085
       who chucked his own
  medical career out the window

824
00:27:37,087 --> 00:27:40,489
             in 2008
  to open his own pizza joint.

825
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:43,025
Where did you become
the dough aficionado?

826
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:44,526
           Well, it was actually
                  Supino's,

827
00:27:44,528 --> 00:27:45,927
the name of my father's hometown
                  in Italy.

828
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:47,596
          And I went back there,
         had some amazing pizza.

829
00:27:47,598 --> 00:27:49,131
You were the tallest person
   in the village.

830
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:50,532
               By a long shot.

831
00:27:50,534 --> 00:27:52,434
  I was inspired by their pizza.
       I thought it was amazing.

832
00:27:52,436 --> 00:27:54,036
               Over the years,
  I developed a crust of my own.

833
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:55,904
   In my little KitchenAid mixer
              on my countertop.

834
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:58,073
  I used to mix a batch of dough
              almost every day

835
00:27:58,075 --> 00:27:59,007
           what I really wanted.

836
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:00,776
    You ate pizza
seven years in a row?

837
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:02,644
        My friends and relatives
     benefited from it, as well.

838
00:28:02,646 --> 00:28:03,779
     All right.
So let's make some dough.

839
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:05,147
              We're gonna start
          by putting the dry mix

840
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:06,114
                    into
       the 60-quart Hobart here.

841
00:28:06,116 --> 00:28:07,315
 What kind of flour
    are we using?

842
00:28:07,317 --> 00:28:09,117
        We're using bread flour.
              Nice elasticity.

843
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,686
      So, now,
you're not a double-zero guy?

844
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,454
      I'm not a double zero guy.
         This is not Neapolitan.

845
00:28:12,456 --> 00:28:13,922
               It's more like
   an East-Coast-American style.

846
00:28:13,924 --> 00:28:15,724
         It borrows a little bit
   from the Italian styles, too.

847
00:28:15,726 --> 00:28:16,858
           A little bit of yeast
               to go in this.

848
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,126
  Dry active yeast.

849
00:28:18,128 --> 00:28:19,761
             Now I'm gonna make
      my wet mix -- water, salt.

850
00:28:19,763 --> 00:28:21,229
And the oil's gonna go in
the water here, too?

851
00:28:21,231 --> 00:28:22,230
                  Yes, sir.

852
00:28:22,232 --> 00:28:23,598
            And we're just gonna
                  add this.

853
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,966
And when will you use it?
                      Tomorrow.

854
00:28:24,968 --> 00:28:26,802
   So you at least
give it a 24-hour rest?

855
00:28:26,804 --> 00:28:28,370
Really develop some of
 that yeast flavor.

856
00:28:28,372 --> 00:28:30,272
But we'll use some of the dough
that you made yesterday.

857
00:28:30,274 --> 00:28:32,407
                 Absolutely.

858
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:34,710
Twice a week,
 Dave hits the Eastern Market

859
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,912
        across the street
  for the freshest ingredients.

860
00:28:36,914 --> 00:28:38,213
             Thanks a lot, guys.

861
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:41,249
 But the key topping for
 one of his most popular pies...

862
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:43,118
Large City Wing Thing
     going out.

863
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,886
          ...comes from
       one of his buddies.

864
00:28:44,888 --> 00:28:46,855
           It's a smoked turkey.
                 Delicious.

865
00:28:46,857 --> 00:28:49,458
      Dave and the City Wing guy
           collaborated on this.

866
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,792
     Here's the City Wing Thing.

867
00:28:50,794 --> 00:28:52,127
 Now, are you really
 a City Wings dude,

868
00:28:52,129 --> 00:28:53,095
or did you just get the hat?

869
00:28:53,097 --> 00:28:54,129
          It's my spot.

870
00:28:54,131 --> 00:28:55,497
Oh, that's your spot?
  You're the dude?

871
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:57,299
            Yes, sir.
  Nice!

872
00:28:57,301 --> 00:29:00,068
Nice, brine-smoked
 turkey legs.
                      Yes, sir.

873
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,803
           We're gonna make some
             braised turkey legs

874
00:29:01,805 --> 00:29:03,038
         for the City Wing Thing
                   pizza.

875
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,839
Oh. See it every day.

876
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:05,073
                    Yeah.

877
00:29:05,075 --> 00:29:06,675
              I'm not a big fan
     of chicken breast on pizza.

878
00:29:06,677 --> 00:29:07,976
           And I've been looking
          for a poultry product.

879
00:29:07,978 --> 00:29:09,511
    Throw the smoked turkey legs
                  in here.

880
00:29:09,513 --> 00:29:10,712
                 We got some
           quartered red onions,

881
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:11,947
          Frank's Red Hot Sauce.

882
00:29:11,949 --> 00:29:13,682
Oh, so we are going after
a real chicken wing flavor.

883
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:14,783
         A little bit of a tang.
                   Sugar.

884
00:29:14,785 --> 00:29:16,051
               Now we're gonna
          cover this with water.

885
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:17,586
         I've got garlic cloves,
         really more for flavor.

886
00:29:17,588 --> 00:29:18,787
So, how long we gonna
   let it go for?

887
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:20,288
              This is gonna go
          for about 2 1/2 hours.

888
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,890
  They're the bomb.

889
00:29:21,892 --> 00:29:23,191
    That's tasty.

890
00:29:23,193 --> 00:29:25,861
The turkey leg and the thigh,
they have such rich flavor.

891
00:29:25,863 --> 00:29:27,129
                Yeah. We want
         a little texture there.

892
00:29:27,131 --> 00:29:28,230
                We don't want
             to turn it to mush.

893
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:29,631
Yeah, you don't want
 to turn into mush.

894
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:30,999
           But we want toothness
                to the meat.

895
00:29:31,001 --> 00:29:32,300
  Toothness.
                    Toothy-ness.

896
00:29:32,302 --> 00:29:33,435
Toothy-- tooth -- toothsome.

897
00:29:33,437 --> 00:29:34,436
             One of them words.

898
00:29:34,438 --> 00:29:35,437
          Yeah, yeah. Toothsome.

899
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:37,873
   Just 220, 221,
 whatever it takes.

900
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:42,144
   This is really
where we're gonna separate

901
00:29:42,146 --> 00:29:43,445
the men from the boys.

902
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:44,746
I like the method so far.

903
00:29:44,748 --> 00:29:45,781
 Building the edge.

904
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:47,949
   That's it.
                     That's it.

905
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:49,951
Cheese, and we're gonna
  put sauce on top.

906
00:29:49,953 --> 00:29:52,020
            We're trying to keep
     that crust nice and crispy,

907
00:29:52,022 --> 00:29:54,022
     so putting the sauce on top
             keeps the texture.

908
00:29:54,024 --> 00:29:55,157
 And a little Gouda.

909
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:56,458
                Smoked Gouda.

910
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,326
          Fresh cubed mozzarella
              over top of that.

911
00:29:58,328 --> 00:29:59,861
             The roasted garlic,
               cherry peppers.

912
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:01,730
     And we're gonna finish with
 that turkey we braised earlier.

913
00:30:01,732 --> 00:30:03,198
  That's all she wrote.
          That is all she wrote.

914
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,699
  What temperature
you running that oven at?

915
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:05,901
          This oven's going 670.

916
00:30:05,903 --> 00:30:08,270
You got brick lining the top,
the bottom, the sides.

917
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:09,604
  There's all kinds
of thermal mass in there.

918
00:30:09,606 --> 00:30:10,806
This does not get cold.

919
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:12,207
I can open and close this oven
    all day long.

920
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:13,642
                Not something
             you hear every day,

921
00:30:13,644 --> 00:30:14,643
       but today, on "Triple D,"

922
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:17,913
            you've learned about
                thermal mass.

923
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:19,080
With that kind of heat,

924
00:30:19,082 --> 00:30:21,116
          the pie bakes
     for about six minutes,

925
00:30:21,118 --> 00:30:24,486
       with a spin midway
 for an even cook on the crust.

926
00:30:27,224 --> 00:30:29,858
                Look at that!

927
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,060
Enough of the Tom Foolery.
        Set up and ready to eat.

928
00:30:34,231 --> 00:30:36,164
    Let me try to
explain things to you

929
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,766
 as I shove my face
      with it.

930
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:39,301
 'Cause you can tell
  I don't like it.

931
00:30:39,303 --> 00:30:41,603
   It's definitely
  light and crispy.

932
00:30:41,605 --> 00:30:43,738
Cross between, probably,
  an American style

933
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,841
     and a Neapolitan style.

934
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:47,142
        Mmm.

935
00:30:47,144 --> 00:30:48,743
  I give you an "A"
 in the dough, man.

936
00:30:48,745 --> 00:30:52,414
    A nice blend
between cheese and sauce,

937
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,949
a little bit of spice
  from the vinegar

938
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:56,284
of the sweet peppers,
creaminess of the garlic.

939
00:30:56,286 --> 00:30:59,621
Oh, I love it.

940
00:30:59,623 --> 00:31:01,256
It's not Thanksgiving turkey

941
00:31:01,258 --> 00:31:02,991
          that someone
     carved from the table.

942
00:31:02,993 --> 00:31:04,693
          It's smokey.
   It's absolutely delicious.

943
00:31:04,695 --> 00:31:07,495
   And it pairs excellent with
those peppers that are on there.

944
00:31:07,497 --> 00:31:09,030
Large 'Pino ready to go out.

945
00:31:09,032 --> 00:31:11,466
Dave is
 an absolutely fearless chef

946
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:12,634
 when it comes to making pizza.

947
00:31:12,636 --> 00:31:14,636
    I don't have a favorite.
     I never order a pizza.

948
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:16,171
      I always come in here
  and say, "Dave, surprise me."

949
00:31:16,173 --> 00:31:17,772
Do you think this is some of
the best pizza in town?

950
00:31:17,774 --> 00:31:19,407
               It's definitely
          the best pies in town.

951
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:21,343
We really want to make sure
  it was something special.

952
00:31:21,345 --> 00:31:22,878
           It's set itself apart
                a little bit.

953
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,346
You got to come down here
 and try this pizza.

954
00:31:24,348 --> 00:31:25,947
 Well done, brother.
 Really, well done.

955
00:31:25,949 --> 00:31:28,416
You know, I think one of the tag
 lines for "Triple D" should be,

956
00:31:28,418 --> 00:31:29,985
 "If it's funky, we'll find it."

957
00:31:29,987 --> 00:31:32,287
  Here we are on the east side
          of Milwaukee.

958
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:34,422
   Now, Lake Michigan's about
      two blocks that way.

959
00:31:34,424 --> 00:31:36,658
      And the university's
     about a mile that way.

960
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:39,127
      And we're at a joint
  that used to be a coffee shop

961
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:41,396
         now turned into
     a restaurant and a bar.

962
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:42,898
    Welcome to the The Comet.

963
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,065
  Bacon apple pie.

964
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:45,867
      It's apple pie with bacon.

965
00:31:45,869 --> 00:31:47,535
   From pancakes and burgers,

966
00:31:47,537 --> 00:31:50,805
           to good old
    American mac 'n' cheese.

967
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:54,042
 It's all about the comfort food
 Adam Lucks and his sister, Val,

968
00:31:54,044 --> 00:31:56,878
      have been cooking up
    since they opened in '05.

969
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,447
Just you two winging it
and doing it your way?

970
00:31:59,449 --> 00:32:00,315
          Pretty much.
                   Essentially.

971
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:01,783
      Ahi tuna.

972
00:32:01,785 --> 00:32:04,052
And they're putting
 their mark all over this menu.

973
00:32:04,054 --> 00:32:05,921
    Chicken, peach jelly on top.

974
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:06,922
   The vegan gyro.

975
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:09,324
Vegan Reuben tortilla.
             Fantastic.

976
00:32:09,326 --> 00:32:11,693
            It's things you know
     in kind of a different way.

977
00:32:11,695 --> 00:32:13,495
Like something
 they named after a buddy,

978
00:32:13,497 --> 00:32:16,298
   A.J.'s Compact Turkey Dinner.
                           Mmm.

979
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,434
It's Thanksgiving and convenient
  to eat ball form.

980
00:32:19,436 --> 00:32:21,436
              Killer stuffing,
              mashed potatoes,

981
00:32:21,438 --> 00:32:23,071
              and fresh roasted
               turkey breast.

982
00:32:23,073 --> 00:32:24,706
 Yeah. And you just
get in and mix it up.

983
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:25,941
We're gonna make them
 into little balls.

984
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:27,409
And then we'll flour them,
  -bter them.

985
00:32:27,411 --> 00:32:28,443
               How do you make
              the beer batter?

986
00:32:28,445 --> 00:32:30,245
   Flour and beer
and salt and pepper.

987
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:31,613
     Throw them
 in the deep fryer.

988
00:32:31,615 --> 00:32:33,648
 They're get served
in a chicken gravy that we made.

989
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,050
Just place the turkey
     right there

990
00:32:35,052 --> 00:32:36,217
in the center of the gravy.

991
00:32:36,219 --> 00:32:38,653
A little parsley for color.
  And there you go.

992
00:32:38,655 --> 00:32:40,989
        Mmm.
That gravy is legit.

993
00:32:40,991 --> 00:32:42,290
See, this is the component

994
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:44,392
 that we're missing
in Thanksgiving, is crunch.

995
00:32:44,394 --> 00:32:45,860
This is crunch-a-tastical.

996
00:32:45,862 --> 00:32:46,995
    Look at that.

997
00:32:46,997 --> 00:32:48,029
        Mmm.

998
00:32:48,031 --> 00:32:50,165
   Thcove
   gravy emporium.

999
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:51,700
         Get just about anything
                off the menu,

1000
00:32:51,702 --> 00:32:52,968
     and it's just really great.

1001
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,436
Always tastes delicious.

1002
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:55,770
Kimbo Burger, order up.

1003
00:32:55,772 --> 00:32:56,805
     I think it's fantastic.

1004
00:32:56,807 --> 00:32:58,473
 Lucky you have her
keeping you in line.

1005
00:32:58,475 --> 00:32:59,841
                     She does.
 This guy's out of control.

1006
00:32:59,843 --> 00:33:00,809
      Someone's got to boss
           him around.

1007
00:33:00,811 --> 00:33:02,310
    Bacon pusher.

1008
00:33:03,714 --> 00:33:05,814
   Up next, in Albuquerque...

1009
00:33:05,816 --> 00:33:07,549
  My mouth is already starting
            to water.

1010
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:08,984
      It smells so killer.

1011
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:11,953
      ...sandwiches stacked
    with a New-Mexican spin.

1012
00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:14,155
    That's what she gave me.
              Okay?

1013
00:33:14,157 --> 00:33:16,891
      And a barbecue champ
     in Glendale, Arizona...

1014
00:33:16,893 --> 00:33:18,593
      Now I know why you been in
           so many competitions,

1015
00:33:18,595 --> 00:33:19,661
            why you won so many.

1016
00:33:19,663 --> 00:33:21,296
          ...smoking up
        the centerpiece.

1017
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:23,999
                  Aw, man.
   But it sure is tender turkey.

1018
00:33:33,043 --> 00:33:35,643
 So, I'm here in the older part
   of Albuquerque, New Mexico

1019
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:37,045
     known as North Valley.

1020
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:39,147
   Now, out here, you'll find
  everything from horse ranches

1021
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:40,482
        to organic farms.

1022
00:33:40,484 --> 00:33:43,218
But more importantly, you've got
    a cool, little restaurant

1023
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,520
  where the chef/owner started
       by selling burritos

1024
00:33:45,522 --> 00:33:47,022
   out of the back of her car.

1025
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:48,857
          Now she's got
  a little take-out restaurant

1026
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:50,692
  where she's making, get this,

1027
00:33:50,694 --> 00:33:53,595
     over 1,000 meals a day
       for local schools.

1028
00:33:53,597 --> 00:33:55,764
       This is Bocadillos.

1029
00:33:55,766 --> 00:33:57,532
     How long on a T&A, sir?

1030
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:01,336
        It's real people
        making real food

1031
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:02,504
  that real people want to eat.

1032
00:34:02,506 --> 00:34:03,738
After that, a Philly.

1033
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,773
      It's fresh. Love it.

1034
00:34:04,775 --> 00:34:06,541
 They're good people, friendly.

1035
00:34:06,543 --> 00:34:08,176
      Gonna be a busy day.

1036
00:34:08,178 --> 00:34:11,513
And for owner and chef
Marie Yniguez, that's every day.

1037
00:34:11,515 --> 00:34:13,948
           Since '09,
     this Albuquerque native

1038
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:16,751
  has been delivering the goods
    on what the locals crave.

1039
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:18,386
  We love chili in New Mexico.

1040
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:19,888
    We put it on everything.

1041
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,057
And they're a staple
 of Bocadillos' sandwiches.

1042
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:23,391
  Not only does it taste good,

1043
00:34:23,393 --> 00:34:26,494
     but it makes the whole
    neighborhood smell good.

1044
00:34:26,496 --> 00:34:28,563
So, I'm gonna follow
  my nose down the road,

1045
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:32,400
 where Marie's cousin Charlie is
 rockin' his Hatch-chili stand.

1046
00:34:32,402 --> 00:34:34,436
So, let me
    get this straight.

1047
00:34:34,438 --> 00:34:35,703
             This right here is
              the Hatch chili?

1048
00:34:35,705 --> 00:34:37,372
Yes, it comes from Hatch,
     absolutely.

1049
00:34:37,374 --> 00:34:38,540
            So Hatch is a place?

1050
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:40,075
 Yes, chili capital
    of the world.

1051
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:41,309
             Let's turn her on.

1052
00:34:41,311 --> 00:34:42,911
 Now, that's my kind of machine.

1053
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:44,546
    Only takes eight minutes

1054
00:34:44,548 --> 00:34:46,915
      to roast these babies
         to perfection.

1055
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:48,650
  My mouth is already starting
            to water.

1056
00:34:48,652 --> 00:34:49,984
      It smells so killer.

1057
00:34:49,986 --> 00:34:52,187
         I've never seen
     a chili-roasting stand.

1058
00:34:52,189 --> 00:34:53,254
          Welcome to New Mexico.

1059
00:34:53,256 --> 00:34:54,589
              Yeah,
     welcome to New Mexico.

1060
00:34:55,392 --> 00:34:57,392
                There we are.

1061
00:34:57,394 --> 00:34:59,327
          Look at that!

1062
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:01,229
And we're gonna cook with this?
                       Yes, sir.

1063
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:03,598
            In fact,
   they're the crowning glory

1064
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,533
on one of Marie's top sellers...

1065
00:35:05,535 --> 00:35:07,001
          T&A on wheat.

1066
00:35:07,003 --> 00:35:09,304
...a New Mexican spin
  on the turkey sandwich.

1067
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:10,772
    It's extremely flavorful.

1068
00:35:10,774 --> 00:35:11,806
           It's legit.

1069
00:35:11,808 --> 00:35:13,875
              We're gonna start
              with the dry rub

1070
00:35:13,877 --> 00:35:16,144
               for the turkey
           for the T&A sandwich.

1071
00:35:16,146 --> 00:35:17,445
      The T&A?
                        T&A.

1072
00:35:17,447 --> 00:35:18,580
    What does T&A
     stand for?

1073
00:35:18,582 --> 00:35:19,747
             Turkey and avocado.

1074
00:35:19,749 --> 00:35:24,385
        We got crushed peppers,
         garlic, salt, pepper,

1075
00:35:24,387 --> 00:35:26,855
                a little bit
               of brown sugar.

1076
00:35:26,857 --> 00:35:28,156
               Mix all this up
                  together.

1077
00:35:28,158 --> 00:35:29,324
  Dry rub goes on?

1078
00:35:29,326 --> 00:35:30,325
              Dry rub goes on.

1079
00:35:30,327 --> 00:35:31,359
 Not on the inside?

1080
00:35:31,361 --> 00:35:32,427
                No, I like it
                to fall apart

1081
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:33,962
            as soon as I pull it
              out of the oven.

1082
00:35:33,964 --> 00:35:35,296
     And what is
  this concoction?

1083
00:35:35,298 --> 00:35:37,365
        So, that right there is
   our house-made honey mustard.

1084
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:38,800
                Just go ahead
               and toss it on.

1085
00:35:38,802 --> 00:35:40,168
                 Good to go.
                   Pretty.

1086
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,269
             Wrap it up in foil,

1087
00:35:41,271 --> 00:35:45,507
            stick it in the oven
            for 12 hours at 250.

1088
00:35:49,346 --> 00:35:51,980
                 All right,
               roasted turkey.

1089
00:35:51,982 --> 00:35:53,581
    Pretty much when you take it
              out of the oven,

1090
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:54,549
            it just falls apart.

1091
00:35:54,551 --> 00:35:56,217
That honey mustard...

1092
00:35:56,219 --> 00:35:57,519
  rocks the house.

1093
00:35:57,521 --> 00:35:59,187
          It's pretty sick, huh?

1094
00:35:59,189 --> 00:36:00,989
              We're gonna make
  the green-chili apple chutney.

1095
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:04,325
            So, this is typical
    chili peeling in New Mexico.

1096
00:36:04,327 --> 00:36:05,660
But you're wearing gloves?
                     Oh, yeah.

1097
00:36:05,662 --> 00:36:07,061
  Because...
           'Cause you don't know

1098
00:36:07,063 --> 00:36:08,863
 if you're gonna touch your face
        or anything else later.

1099
00:36:08,865 --> 00:36:09,764
                Ready to go.

1100
00:36:09,766 --> 00:36:11,099
            And then, basically,
                    you just...

1101
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:13,701
Nice roasted flavor,
  not super spicy,

1102
00:36:13,703 --> 00:36:15,103
but those will all range
   in heat, right?

1103
00:36:15,105 --> 00:36:16,337
                    Yes.

1104
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:18,239
And this chili apple chutney's
gonna go on the turkey?

1105
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:19,707
                    Yes.

1106
00:36:19,709 --> 00:36:23,278
      You get your diced apples.
         A little bit of sugar.

1107
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:26,014
So, about a cup and a half
     of chilies.

1108
00:36:26,016 --> 00:36:27,348
     Let it all
   just cook down.

1109
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,717
   And then you'll start getting
         the sweet and the hot,

1110
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:32,720
             and you'll be ready
                   to go.

1111
00:36:32,722 --> 00:36:34,189
          So, we're gonna put it
              in a hoagie roll.

1112
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:36,157
   Whole wheat?!
                       Yep.

1113
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:37,892
       You have a little healthy
            somewhere in there.

1114
00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:41,396
    So, you put your green-chili
               apple chutney,

1115
00:36:41,398 --> 00:36:42,730
    let it soak into the turkey,

1116
00:36:42,732 --> 00:36:44,332
   and that's kind of what makes
           your whole sandwich.

1117
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:46,234
         Got the Muenster cheese
                   going.

1118
00:36:46,236 --> 00:36:47,902
  As in Herman?
                       As in.

1119
00:36:47,904 --> 00:36:50,405
      So, we got the green-chili
               chutney going.

1120
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:53,575
                 Here we go.

1121
00:36:53,577 --> 00:36:54,909
Is that a serious portion
      or what?

1122
00:36:54,911 --> 00:36:56,010
       That's a serious portion.

1123
00:36:56,012 --> 00:36:57,378
            We do about 8 ounces
                per sandwich.

1124
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,847
         Heirloom tomatoes fresh
         from one of the gardens

1125
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:01,716
             here in the valley,
                  avocado.

1126
00:37:01,718 --> 00:37:03,818
               There you go --
             your very own T&A.

1127
00:37:05,956 --> 00:37:07,889
That's what she gave me,
        okay?

1128
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:09,057
             That's a sandwich.

1129
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:11,192
 No, that's a dinner
      for six.

1130
00:37:18,368 --> 00:37:21,102
        What do you think, yeah?

1131
00:37:21,104 --> 00:37:22,470
The sweet and the heat

1132
00:37:22,472 --> 00:37:24,005
with the roasted turkey
 and the mustard --

1133
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:26,140
    I don't know
where you came up with the idea.

1134
00:37:26,142 --> 00:37:27,342
   It's delicious,

1135
00:37:27,344 --> 00:37:29,143
 and the little burn
of the chili in the back...

1136
00:37:29,145 --> 00:37:30,478
             It's just the love.

1137
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,913
   It is the love.

1138
00:37:31,915 --> 00:37:34,115
             Carley,
 you have a T&A sandwich ready.

1139
00:37:34,117 --> 00:37:35,783
       The turkey's moist.

1140
00:37:35,785 --> 00:37:37,418
      The bread is awesome.

1141
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,220
  It has all the chilies in it,
      which is really good.

1142
00:37:39,222 --> 00:37:41,222
   It's enough for two people.
        That's for sure.

1143
00:37:41,224 --> 00:37:42,790
Marie just wants to feed you,

1144
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:45,793
       a skill she's taken
way beyond this tiny restaurant.

1145
00:37:45,795 --> 00:37:47,595
 What are you doing
for all these hours?

1146
00:37:47,597 --> 00:37:48,830
       I mean,
there are seven tables.

1147
00:37:48,832 --> 00:37:50,164
           Well, because we feed
              charter schools.

1148
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:52,967
       So I feed a thousand kids
    before 10:00 in the morning.

1149
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:54,602
  A thousand?!
                   A thousand.

1150
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:56,704
      I'm here for my community.
        I'm here for New Mexico.

1151
00:37:56,706 --> 00:37:59,007
    I'm here to feed the future,
   and we do it all from scratch

1152
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:02,210
      just the way my mom and my
 grandma taught me how to do it.

1153
00:38:02,212 --> 00:38:04,412
  You're gonna get good quality
      every time you come.

1154
00:38:04,414 --> 00:38:06,581
     Every time I come here,
   I get something different.

1155
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:07,448
       I love this place.

1156
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,716
You're priceless, girl.

1157
00:38:08,718 --> 00:38:10,285
I'm gonna tell you something.
You really are priceless.

1158
00:38:10,287 --> 00:38:12,153
You -- You give a lot
     to people,

1159
00:38:12,155 --> 00:38:14,656
  and it comes out
    in your food.

1160
00:38:14,658 --> 00:38:16,157
  You're the bomb.

1161
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:17,191
                 Thank you.

1162
00:38:20,697 --> 00:38:22,697
           Something's
     a little strange here.

1163
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:24,299
    Joint looks like a diner.

1164
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:26,067
 But it's in Glendale, Arizona.

1165
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:28,436
  Oh, yeah, and they're serving
    southern style barbecue.

1166
00:38:28,438 --> 00:38:29,904
     You know, low-and-slow.

1167
00:38:29,906 --> 00:38:34,309
   But they tell me the guy's
 a competitive barbecue champion

1168
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:36,978
  who's won some of the biggest
  competitions in the country.

1169
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,013
                 Let's see,
            I've got 300 awards.

1170
00:38:39,015 --> 00:38:41,849
What's the most prestigious
  event you won in?

1171
00:38:41,851 --> 00:38:43,318
        Oh, always Jack Daniels.

1172
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,919
   And it's those same recipes

1173
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:46,954
     that he's cranking out
  for the neighborhood crowd...

1174
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:48,589
          Got the pork and slaw.
        ...every day.

1175
00:38:48,591 --> 00:38:49,624
The ribs are really good.

1176
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:51,025
          Great flavor,
    and they're very tender.

1177
00:38:51,027 --> 00:38:53,494
   The beef brisket. It tastes
  really good, and it's moist.

1178
00:38:53,496 --> 00:38:54,662
I love the pulled pork.

1179
00:38:54,664 --> 00:38:56,197
            The best.

1180
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:59,734
All done low-and-slow in
 Roger's mesquite-fired smoker.

1181
00:38:59,736 --> 00:39:00,902
                   This is
      the heart of the business.

1182
00:39:00,904 --> 00:39:03,237
    He learned how to do this
       almost 30 years ago

1183
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:05,373
  at a joint called Thee Pitts.

1184
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:07,008
We got the whole farm on here,
      or what?

1185
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,509
         What he opened
       a place of his own,

1186
00:39:08,511 --> 00:39:10,845
 he called it Thee Pitts Again.

1187
00:39:10,847 --> 00:39:11,913
  I love the ribs.

1188
00:39:11,915 --> 00:39:13,247
I like the chicken wings.

1189
00:39:13,249 --> 00:39:14,482
I like the onion rings.

1190
00:39:14,484 --> 00:39:15,850
        Sir, let's make it easy.

1191
00:39:15,852 --> 00:39:17,552
        Anything you don't like?

1192
00:39:17,554 --> 00:39:18,586
         No.

1193
00:39:18,588 --> 00:39:21,122
      And beyond the smoke,
        there's the rub.

1194
00:39:21,124 --> 00:39:22,890
              Teach me the rub,
                oh, wise one.

1195
00:39:22,892 --> 00:39:24,792
Season salt,
 Spanish paprika.

1196
00:39:24,794 --> 00:39:28,529
It's got a little different
taste than regular paprika.

1197
00:39:28,531 --> 00:39:30,598
I toss in a little sugar.
               A little sugar.

1198
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,601
A little granulated garlic,
just a little bit of cumin.

1199
00:39:33,603 --> 00:39:35,236
And also a pinch of salt.

1200
00:39:35,238 --> 00:39:36,738
               A little onion.

1201
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,239
   A little onion.

1202
00:39:38,241 --> 00:39:39,640
    Some paprika.
    The parsley.

1203
00:39:39,642 --> 00:39:40,875
                The parsley.
   Parsley.

1204
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:42,310
         Because if your paprika
           is looking like that,

1205
00:39:42,312 --> 00:39:44,479
      that's why I'm not winning
              big competitions.

1206
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:46,214
             I've been thinking
    it's parsley the whole time.

1207
00:39:46,216 --> 00:39:48,583
And then we have my ingredient
  here that I add.

1208
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:49,951
              You've got about
                half of one,

1209
00:39:49,953 --> 00:39:51,419
                and then half
           of your secret, so...

1210
00:39:51,421 --> 00:39:52,620
        Yeah.
Now you're calculating it.

1211
00:39:52,622 --> 00:39:54,021
                  Who gets
           to make the rub here?

1212
00:39:54,023 --> 00:39:54,889
        I do.

1213
00:39:54,891 --> 00:39:56,023
                  Only you?
      Yeah.

1214
00:39:56,025 --> 00:39:57,525
             You're the only one
             that makes the rub?

1215
00:39:57,527 --> 00:39:58,926
  I'm the only one
 that makes the rub

1216
00:39:58,928 --> 00:40:01,095
    And that goes on everything?
  Everything.

1217
00:40:01,097 --> 00:40:03,030
   I've used this
  in competitions.

1218
00:40:03,032 --> 00:40:04,899
And I've won chicken.
   I've won ribs.

1219
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:07,001
 I've won shoulders.

1220
00:40:07,003 --> 00:40:08,136
It's very versatile.

1221
00:40:08,138 --> 00:40:10,004
 He's even smoking whole turkeys
            with it.

1222
00:40:10,006 --> 00:40:12,273
I've never had barbecued turkey.
        This is a first.

1223
00:40:12,275 --> 00:40:13,641
       So how do you serve this?

1224
00:40:13,643 --> 00:40:15,143
 We pull it.
                All pulled bird?

1225
00:40:15,145 --> 00:40:16,911
  All pulled.
       Give me the rundown here.

1226
00:40:16,913 --> 00:40:18,946
  This is margarine
 to give it a glaze.

1227
00:40:18,948 --> 00:40:22,517
It also let's the seasoning
    adhere to it.

1228
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:23,851
Give it the old rub.

1229
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:26,421
              Take this beauty
      and just lay her right in.

1230
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:28,189
Now, how long
is that gonna run for?

1231
00:40:28,191 --> 00:40:32,059
       Usually, a bird this size
       will take about 14 hours.

1232
00:40:32,061 --> 00:40:33,961
    Look at that.

1233
00:40:33,963 --> 00:40:35,630
                    Mmm.

1234
00:40:35,632 --> 00:40:36,664
                    Mmm.

1235
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:38,866
                  Aw, man.
       It sure is tender turkey.

1236
00:40:38,868 --> 00:40:41,436
      Oh, yeah.

1237
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:42,670
         Were you talking to me?

1238
00:40:42,672 --> 00:40:44,472
      Really, really good,
          moist turkey.

1239
00:40:44,474 --> 00:40:45,673
          Very tender.

1240
00:40:45,675 --> 00:40:49,243
And great
 with Roger's homemade sauce.

1241
00:40:49,245 --> 00:40:50,645
               Sauce is money.

1242
00:40:50,647 --> 00:40:54,248
I start off with brown sugar,
Worcestershire sauce,

1243
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,516
 put in the mustard.

1244
00:40:55,518 --> 00:40:57,552
       I've never seen that much
          mustard go in a sauce.

1245
00:40:57,554 --> 00:40:58,853
   Oh, yeah.
                Want me to help?

1246
00:40:58,855 --> 00:41:00,488
        Yeah.
  That'd be great.

1247
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,190
Heinz ketchup is what I use.

1248
00:41:02,192 --> 00:41:04,125
             So, no cooking it.

1249
00:41:04,127 --> 00:41:04,926
   No cooking it.

1250
00:41:04,928 --> 00:41:05,760
             No messing with it?

1251
00:41:05,762 --> 00:41:07,061
 No messing with it.

1252
00:41:07,063 --> 00:41:08,329
             That's good sauce.

1253
00:41:08,331 --> 00:41:10,731
       And folks here say
    it's great on everything.

1254
00:41:10,733 --> 00:41:12,967
    Tangy, but not too much.

1255
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:16,604
  He just, somehow or another,
  just has the magic about him.

1256
00:41:16,606 --> 00:41:20,541
    I think he just eats it,
    sleeps it, and dreams it.

1257
00:41:20,543 --> 00:41:21,876
                 Well done.

1258
00:41:21,878 --> 00:41:23,444
      Now I know why you've been
        in so many competitions,

1259
00:41:23,446 --> 00:41:25,746
            why you won so many.

1260
00:41:25,748 --> 00:41:27,014
                 Real deal.

1261
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:29,550
          So, that's it
       for this road trip.

1262
00:41:29,552 --> 00:41:30,885
        But don't worry.

1263
00:41:30,887 --> 00:41:34,021
    We got plenty more joints
 to find all over this country.

1264
00:41:34,023 --> 00:41:35,623
     I'll be looking for you
            next time

1265
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:39,293
               on
 "Diners, Drive-ins and Dives."

1266
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:41,095
 You're gonna start
hearing some funny sounds.

1267
00:41:42,632 --> 00:41:44,432
              What is going on
                 right now?

1268
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:45,299
'Cause it's still urgling.

1269
00:41:45,301 --> 00:41:46,200
          "Urgling" is the term?

1270
00:41:46,202 --> 00:41:47,034
                It's urgling?

1271
00:41:47,036 --> 00:41:48,069
I clearly should just write,

1272
00:41:48,071 --> 00:41:49,537
like, a new dictionary
for this restaurant.

1273
00:41:49,539 --> 00:41:51,506
               You should have
         the funking dictionary.
