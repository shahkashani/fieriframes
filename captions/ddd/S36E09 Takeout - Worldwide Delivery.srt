     from doing "Triple-D,"     

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,003
  the first thing I want to do  
    is get home to my kitchen

I got to be --

8
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:17,483
     how about we reach out     
  to some of our favorite chefs 

9

00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,846
       Now we want to make      
        the hot mess mix.       

119
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,081
         -What is that?         
 -Get your Thousand Island back 

120
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,451
     and we're going to add     
      in the chopped bacon,     

121
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,253
         the jalapenos.         
     -Things are definitely     

122
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,587
    getting hot around here.    

123
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,122
 Chopped red onion.             

124
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,725
       I've never seen this many
 ingredients for any burger dish

125
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,059
        we've done on this show.

126
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,861
       Last but not least,      
         house pickles.         

127
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,663
              Yep. Mix that up  
         with a thousand island.

128
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,664
          You should have a kind
         of a thick consistency.

129
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,533
Do you have a preferred size    
   on the burgers?              

130
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,735
             We do. Eight ounce.

131
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,070
  Your burgers are going to cook

132
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,538
              when I get those  
               to medium rare,  

133
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,807
    toast those buns, get a nice
            little golden brown.

134
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,943
   Do you make these delicious  
           addicting,           

135
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,478
         jalapeno chips,        
      or do you buy these?      

136
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,146
   I do buy those.              

137
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,947
 I don't care who you're buying 
           them from,           

138
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,884
        buy that company.       

139
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,419
     If I could.                

140
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,221
        Hit it with half        
     the cheese that I ate?     

141
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:51,022
You can use some of those       
 pickled jalapenos.             

142
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,423
You can throw them right        
     in the pan                 

143
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,825
and heat them up a little bit.  

144
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,160
      Take that bottom bun,     

145
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,095
  slather a little horseradish  
         sauce on there,        

146
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,696
   and some shredded lettuce.   
             -Good.             

147
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,498
  Now when the burger's ready,  
       shove the jalapenos      

148
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,834
     on top of that burger,     
      spoon in some of that     

149
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,303
          hot mess mix          
         that you made,         

150
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:06,437
Hunter, look around, there's got
            to be some raincoats

151
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,506
   or something that he sent us,

152
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,307
             because we're going
              to have to wear.  

153
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,778
Now, you want to drizzle over   
the porkasauras barbecue sauce. 

154
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,547
Yup, just like that.            
     All right.                 

155
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,915
Now you can put the crispy      
    jalapenos on.               

156
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,185
        -Where are those?       
         -In your belly.        

157
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:23,121
      -You didn't send any.     
       -Make your burger.       

158
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,456
No, I thought I wouldn't eat -- 
   share that one.              

159
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,590
            No, we're not eating
                 any of it.     

160
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:26,658
   There's no way               
you're going to finish all.     

161
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,592
         I'm going to finish it.

162
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:28,560
                 Here we go.    

163
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,197
    I'm starving.               

164
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,531
   Me too! Me too!              

165
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,000
See how it's dripping           
    out the back,               

166
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,869
that's the way it should be,    
 that's made right.             

167
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,405
 They can't even talk right now.
             Must be good, Paul.

168
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,676
      What do you think of that?

169
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,279
                 This burger    
                is balanced,    

170
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,080
this burger's got great texture,

171
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,283
     you get the spicy jalapeno,
   you get the crunchy jalapeno,

172
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:52,951
               what'd you call  
the Thousand Island sauce again?

173
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,820
           -Hot mess.           
      -It's named after us.     

174
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:58,022
              But the hot mess  
              is nice and cool  

175
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,625
      and refreshing and acidic,

176
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,894
    cutting the fat which you're
       coming to with the burger

177
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,029
        and that cheddar cheese.
I mean, just everything is good.

178
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,098
          You know what, listen,
     I'm gonna go out on a limb.

179
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,967
          You should think about
 getting in the burger business.

180
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,368
            I know...           
      -That's a great idea.     

181
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,304
   I mean, there's              
  a depth of flavor             

182
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:13,772
throughout the entire thing.    

183
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,774
          Delicious. Now, I want
             to remind everybody

184
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:18,043
               there's no cash  
             or prizes involved,

185
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,579
   but one of the four of you is
 going to get best dish tonight.

186
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,447
     So we'll figure out exactly
         who that's going to be.

187
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,983
    But I gotta tell you, out of
        the gate, Boston Burger,

188
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,252
       Paul, you rock the house.
   Don't go anywhere, everybody.

189
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,921
    Hunter, Rider and myself,   
    cooking on the back porch   

190
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,523
     with a little "Triple-D    
   Takeout," see you in a bit.  

191
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,729
Welcome back, "Triple-D Takeout"
        here at the Fieri house.

192
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,331
             Four of my favorite
 "Triple-D" chefs have joined us

193
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:44,002
 and we have somehow figured out
           a way to coerce them,

194
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,403
               encourage them?  
Encourage.                      

195
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,472
   Encourage -- we've encouraged
               them to mail us  

196
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,474
  some of their favorite dishes.

197
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:52,210
     And I got to tell you,     
 my boy Paul from Boston Burger,

198
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,479
  I'm still having a little bit 
      of a jalapeno attack.     

199
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,481
       But the thing was,       
     it wasn't overly spicy.    

200
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,750
               -No              
      -But it was dynamite.     

201
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,887
 And we have our friend Pam from
   Pam's Trinidad in Seattle,   

202
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,423
         my buddy Justin        
 and La Piazza down in Arizona. 

203
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,359
      Now we're going to go     
  all the way out to the island 

204
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:08,493
       to my buddy Nakoa.       

205
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,228
   The first time we met Nakoa  

206
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,030
  we went and cooked at Umeke's 
        and had a blast.        

207
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:16,234
   Oh, that's -- there's a '66  
      Corvette convertible,     

208
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,502
        if you just wrap        
        that in some ice,       

209
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:18,703
       put that out there.      

210
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,305
            Boom, and that's our
                 poke bowl.     

211
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,707
That's how you roll.            
I'm not messing around.         

212
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,710
 The fish is melting            
   in your mouth.               

213
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,246
I can't get in my face hole     
    fast enough.                

214
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,715
   Nice to have you, brother.   
           -Thank you.          

215
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,117
             I can only imagine 
              what you sent me. 

216
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,052
            That's the pipikaula
                for you, man.   

217
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,255
 Thanks for tuning in, Hunter's 
    got the rest of the show.   

218
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,723
            Goodbye.            

219
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,725
      Guy loves pipikaula,      
     every time he comes to     

220
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,527
           the island,          
    that's his first request.   

221
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,729
            Give me the rundown,
             what's on the menu?

222
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,197
       Pulehu beef salad.       

223
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,598
   How do I say this word again?

224
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,000
  Pulehu, which means grilled.  

225
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,670
 Pulehu -- so we're really going
        to take this meat       

226
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,137
        and it's going to       
        go on to a salad.       

227
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,340
Yeah, you're going to take      
 that little bottle.            

228
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,542
I sent you of Hawaiian          
  salt and pepper.              

229
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,145
    All right. So just season it
with the salt pepper. That's it.

230
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,014
         In a saute pan.        
   -Get that pan nice and hot,  

231
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,883
     want to do a nice sear     
          on that beef.         

232
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:07,018
          Nice mixing in Hunter,
                 like a pro.    

233
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,820
    Hunter is doing so good.    

234
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,755
  Am I pouring oil              
in the pan for this?            

235
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,223
        -Yeah. Just oil.        
       -You've got a break      

236
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,558
       on this dish, Guy.       

237
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,160
Hawaiian style is easy, brother.

238
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,029
    -What else are we doing?    
         -A Romaine bed.        

239
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,365
   And then we're going to lay  
our cucumbers on the side of it.

240
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:21,899
We'll top it off with the onions

241
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,569
and tomatoes and a little bit of
      that ogo I sent you,      

242
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,638
     the seaweed that grows     
     over here in the farm.     

243
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,573
 -Now, what about the dressing? 
         -In the islands        

244
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,241
      we call the dressing      
         a "bug juice."         

245
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,110
       -It's called what?       
           -Bug juice?          

246
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,845
             We use cockroaches 
              and grasshopper.  

247
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,713
  You don't want to know what's 
       in that one, right?      

248
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,717
        -What's in this?        
-It's actually a two part sauce.

249
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,519
     So we actually have a sauce
   like a Korean pickling sauce,

250
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,988
          which is rice vinegar,
                shoyu, sugar.   

251
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,323
              And then we have  
             chili water sauce, 

252
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:48,193
         which is cider vinegar,
        garlic and chili peppers

253
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,328
       and then just equal parts
             of that two sauces.

254
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,931
 That sounds great.             
     Delicious.                 

255
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,199
         I got the salad, what's
  all the rest of this food for.

256
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,402
We got one more dish.           
The ahi belly tempura.          

257
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:00,472
See, mine's is simple, but we'll
   make two dishes out of it.   

258
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:02,674
You trying to say mine          
   was difficult?               

259
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:05,744
   You just move the goalposts  
       on us there, Nakoa!      

260
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,545
  I wanted two chances to win.  

261
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,214
We're going to tempura flash fry
        this tuna belly?        

262
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,483
      Mix the tempura mixed     
        with soda water.        

263
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,953
 We'll whisk that up real good. 

264
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:17,021
 All right. And what temperature
           you want this oil at?

265
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,757
              350?              
           -350, yeah.          

266
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:22,560
     Was I supposed to save some
 of this flour to coat the fish?

267
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,628
             -Yeah.             
         -I'm starving.         

268
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,297
             -Yeah.             
    -Always getting me sta--    

269
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,232
          I'm starving.         
      -Do I have any sauce      

270
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,833
           or anything          
     that's going with this?    

271
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,368
     Yep, you got our sweet     
         and sour sauce         

272
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,770
  that'll be the topping after  
         it's all done.         

273
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,439
          That doesn't look like
            sweet and sour sauce

274
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,174
         where I'm from.        
        -It's the island,       

275
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,109
 the good pineapples we get over
            a better.           

276
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,245
       Warm that sauce up.      
       -With the veggies?       

277
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,715
That's fine. Red bell peppers,  
green bell peppers, red onions  

278
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,650
       and some pineapple.      
           -Tuna belly          

279
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:48,653
 going into the tempura batter. 

280
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,855
  Give it a nice little float.  
             -Yeah.             

281
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,257
 How's that beef coming, Hunter?

282
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,658
 It's looking good.             

283
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,661
   So I've got the ogo on there.

284
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,863
       Fantastic. One more piece
              for good measure. 

285
00:09:58,865 --> 00:09:59,931
           All right.           

286
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,532
Before before you toss          
     the sauce,                 

287
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,135
sprinkle some of that           
Hawaiian salt on the beef first.

288
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,137
         Hawaiian salt.         
       Is that a sea salt?      

289
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,738
Yep, Hawaiian rock salt.        

290
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,740
          Now get that          
       bug juice all over.

    -That bug juice makes it.   

293
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,586
               The bug juice,   
 the old famous "Triple-D" line,

294
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,754
 you could put it on a flip flop
              without question. 

295
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,957
    You get acid, you get sweet,
          you get a little funk.

296
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,293
    Is there something fermented
                  in there?     

297
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,962
      No. Maybe the cockroaches?
                   No, no.

299
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,099
   One of the more simple dishes

300
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:35,700
                that I think

           but without question,
         over the top in flavor.

302
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:41,573
 Now, do we need any more food, 
    thank you very little --    

303
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:43,307
  how are we going to serve this
                 tuna belly?    

304
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,575
   Just make a couple of cuts,  

305
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,844
      put it on that plate,     
     grab salad on the side,    

306
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,913
     and then we're going to    
  top it off with a veggie mix  

307
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:49,914
         with the sauce         

308
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,916

           good to go.          

309
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,719
         Oh, man, if this is not
            an Umeke's 101 dish,

310
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,587
                 right here,    
           I don't know what is.

311

The fresh tuna belly,           
you can't get any better        

312
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,525
than tuna bell, man -- all that 
fatty oils in that thing?       

313
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,993
      So good.                  

314
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,864
    Tender, super flavorful,    

315
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,065
   the sweet and sour sauce --  

316
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:10,802
       it's not too tangy       
     and it's not too sweet.    

317
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,737
       When you look it up      
     in Flavortown library,

          Carry me out?         

330
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:39,130
 Hi, guys, my dad and my brother
     passed out on the couch    

331
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:42,667

         with you folks,        

336
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,010
   I just want to take a nap.   

337
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,611
  So if you guys can just talk  
        among yourselves        

338
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:56,748

        Been a long time

         -You came 2009.        
 -And there was a lot of people 

349
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,838
          we never had          
    Trinidadian food before,    

350
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,372
          couldn't even         
      pronounce the dishes.     

351
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:22,774
It's called Parlay the Rotary   

352
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:25,376
        Paratha -- paratha roti.

353
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:28,713
  In Trinidad it's also called  
        the buss up shut.       

354
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,315
      Oh, gosh,                 
    don't start.                

355
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,316
           So tell me,          
      what did you send us?     

356
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,118
I send you aloo pie.            

357
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,921
It's a potato patty.            
 It's really simple.            

358
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,858
It's vegan, vegetarian;         
and jerk spicy wings.           

359
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,993
       Uh-oh.                   

360
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:44,195
         -What's it say?        
         -"Bust a lime."        

361
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,797
It's a Trinidad snack.          

362
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,265
          Bust a lime?          

363
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,466
Yeah. Like when you go out      
with the guys there.            

364
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,736
           A hang out.          
         -Look at that.         

365
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:54,005
    I thought you could continue
                to celebrate    

366
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,407
            your wife's birthday
            with a shot of that.

367
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,476
       I appreciate that,       
        she will love me        

368
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,544
 drinking some Trinidadian rum. 

369
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,080
                I didn't know   
            we could send booze.

370
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,882
    You just move               
the goalposts again.            

371
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,350
          ALL: Cheers.          

372
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:07,351
           Delicious.           

373
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,552
 HUNTER: Ooh, that is very nice.

374
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,155
    Let's start cooking this.   

375
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:12,690
 Are we starting with the wings 
    first or the pies first?    

376
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,358
    We can start                
with the pies first.            

377
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,227
   And what is in this mixture  
           right here?          

378
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:20,431
Cumin, cilantro, garlic,        
habaneros, and some salt.       

379
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:23,334
      -And cooked potatoes.     
   -"Aloo" is the Indian word   

380
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,837
for potato -- that's what you're
     using for the filling.     

381
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,572
 And what is in the dough, chef?

382
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:31,242
Flour, salt, Crisco,            
baking powder, and sugar.       

383
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,510
       I'm going to put it      
          in the center         

384
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,512
        and fold it over.       
    -And fold it over, right.   

385
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:35,713
                And how much?   

386
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,582
     As much as                 
you can fit in there.           

387
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,383
         And just a little water
                to seal them?   

388
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,719
Yeah. You can do that,          
or you can just do it           

389
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,321
  with your fingers             
and then use the fork.          

390
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,324
             Use the fork, like,
            the fork is with me.

391
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,859
                 All right.     
              Into the hot oil. 

392
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,393
Yeah.                           
                Hunter and guys,

393
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,062
  Trinidad, come on down, folks.

394
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,397
              So that's going.  

395
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,098
              Let's talk about  
              these jerk wings. 

396
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,867
 I send you ginger,             
garlic and cilantro.            

397
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,803
You blend that together.        

398
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,005
         There's a nice         
      golden brown on this.     

399
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,473
           That's it?           
        -It's deep fried.       

400
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,541
It's got to be good.            

401
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:06,744
   -Cilantro, ginger, garlic.   
          -In the bowl.         

402
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,946
  Now I'm into the dry spices.  

403
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,683
       I had the paprika,       
   the rosemary, the allspice.  

404
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:14,685
       This is some clove,      
        red chili flake.        

405
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,155
    There's some soy sauce there
              and some ketchup. 

406
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:20,424
   Okay, this mixture now goes  
       with this mixture.       

407
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,226
              -Yes.             
           -Holy moly!          

408
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,962
        Come on, that is simpler
        than the burgers, right?

409
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,831
Wait, wait, wait, you're        
throwing me under the bus?!     

410
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:31,636
Pam! Really? I've been          
your friend this whole time!    

411
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:34,038
      And how long is this      
    going to marinate, Chef?    

412
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,307
No marinating, you just --      
straight in the oven.           

413
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,776
     -Straight in the oven.     
  -Covered for 10, 15 minutes,  

414
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:42,046
       and then uncovered       
    for the rest of the time.   

415
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,715
                 All right.     
          So the wings are down.

416
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,984
         Let's try these pies --
           and the mango chutney

417
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:47,318
is what's going to go with that.

418
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,519
              -Yes.             
           -Beautiful.          

419
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:52,122
 Make it look good.             

420
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,591
  Where do I get the heat from? 
              Whoo!             

421
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,861
           -Habaneros.          
    -Pam, they're fantastic.    

422
00:14:56,863 --> 00:15:00,531
         The dough that you make
                is so light,    

423
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,066
    but it's got good chew to it

424
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,003
             and a little sweet 
 coming from that mango chutney.

425
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:07,405
   But this is what you love,   
          a full vegan,         

426
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,407
   what do you call it, aloo?   

427
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,741
                  Aloo pie.     

428
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,610
   You wouldn't miss the meat   
             at all,            

429
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:13,811
      the flavor's intense.     

430
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:14,879
  That's on point.              

431
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,814
            Bob Barker would say
             the spice is right,

432
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:19,951
Okay, please --                 
            Thank you very much.

433
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:23,020
 Okay, so now we have the wings.
 We gonna do a sauce with these?

434
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,156
      No extra sauce, just      
     the dripping from that     

435
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,091
    is what we serve it with.   

436
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,493
                This is rich,   
               lots of flavor.  

437
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,696
Rider's a sucker for wings.     

438
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,299
    Breathe, breathe between    
       the inhaling part.       

439
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,767
   You know what's great also,  
          it does have          

440
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,369
      a little bit of kick,     
        but it's a lot of       

441
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,170
   really full flavored spice.  

442
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,305
 Yeah, good balance.            

443
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:44,375
    It doesn't make you feel    
     like you need a sauce.     

444
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,909
         Pam, delicious.        
           All right.           

445
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,046
          Well, listen,         
   it's been a fantastic show.  

446
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:50,715
       Thanks, everybody,       
     for tuning in tonight.     

447
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:53,250
 We really appreciate having you
          and -- what?          

448
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,585
We still have Justin!           

449
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:55,919
           Oh, Justin.          

450
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,855
    Yeah. Yeah, I'm just here   
          for the ride.         

451
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,923
            Whatever.           
   -It's my buddy Justin there  

452
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:03,161
 in there at La Piazza al Forno,
        see you in a bit.       

453
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:09,900
          Welcome back,         
       "Triple-D Takeout,"      

454
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,702
        we're hanging out       
    in the backyard and, man,   

455
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,706
     we are eating today --     
       eating like kings.       

456
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,041
I've invited some of my favorite
        "Triple-D" joints       

457
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:19,110
    from around the country,    
      let's have a potluck.     

458
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:20,778
    We'll just send the food    
     to my house and Hunter     

459
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,447
        and I will cook;        
we've had tuna belly all the way

460
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,716
          from Hawaii,          
      burgers from Boston,      

461

463
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,792
             We shot            
     at their crazy pizzeria    

464
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:37,462
     and it was his old man     
   that was stealing the show.

              -Hey!             
   -I mean, that was a party.

     of your son as a chef?

Can I save that, because I don't
 think I'll ever hear that ever.

471
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,411
         That was quite         
        a few years ago.

      -Tell me what we got.     

489
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,446
About three years ago, I learned
    about Roman style pizza.    

490
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,315
          It's very new         
      to the United States.     

491
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,718
   I'm the only one in Arizona  
    doing Roman style pizza.    

492
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,187
      We opened up a place      
      called Piazza Romana.     

493
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,588
  You had our Neapolitan pizza. 

494
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,191
      The dough is hydrated     
        about 65 percent.       

495
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:43,460
       This is 85 percent       
      water to flour ratio.     

496
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,796
          This dough is         
     a 96-hour fermentation.    

497
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,599
  So the dough is four days out 
      before when I make it     

498
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,468
      to when I can use it.     
            -Really?!           

499
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,537
   Yeah. Use your fingertips,   

500
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:55,139
         stretch it out,        
     keep it into a square.     

501
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,275
        I love where we're going
             with this, brother.

502
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:58,809
Now those pans are from Rome.   

503
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,278
You want to put a little bit    
    of olive oil.               

504
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,280
        I tried to build a crust
               on this at all.  

505
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,482
    No, no crust.               
You've got a talent!            

506
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,617
Look at this -- some people take
 three or four days             

507
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:07,885
to learn how to do this.        

508
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,820
   I've messed with a little bit
            of dough in my life.

509
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,356
   Place that down              
     in the pan.                

510
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:13,424
         Nice job, Dad.         

511
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,691
                   Tell me      
       what's in the sauce here.

512
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,160
    Just crushed                
San Marzano tomatoes            

513
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:17,562
with a little bit of sea salt.  

514
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,430
That's it.                      
               It's all right.  

515
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,500
Looks good, pop it in           
the oven, 500 degrees.          

516
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:23,701
 Ten to 12 minutes.

   ingredients like you guys.

   that's the same sopressata   

523
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,782

         with last time.        

524
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,253
Does that door stay locked      
right over there the whole time.

525
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:46,190
          Look at this guy, he's
        sabotaging my pies here.

526
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,125
     Please save some sopressata
         for the pizza, will ya?

527
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,328
       Put it in the oven,      
 I don't think you need the pan,

528
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,396
   put it right on the grate.   

529
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:53,798
It'll make it crispier that way.

530
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,267
               That looks like  
              a million bucks.

We're not done with it.

     We have Calabrian chili and
   honey and olive oil, correct?

538
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,818
        That was actually       
         my wife's idea.

  any of these chilies on there?

It's like candy pizza.          

547
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:36,040
