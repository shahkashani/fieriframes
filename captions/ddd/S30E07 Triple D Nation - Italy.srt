00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,633

No, I'm not smelling            
    the carrots.                

345
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:44,062
            Then we have celery,

           then we add the meat.

 How long's the meat            
      gonna go?

    You can put the salsa verde.

 the bay leaves, and the tomato.

370

Water, Sicilian sea salt.

     -Everything's imported?    
          -Everything.

The yeast, specialty flour.     

430
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,427
          Look how gentle it is.

Fork mixers don't heat          
    the dough up.

00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:12,636
We're making the mozzarella.    

436
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,573
Add the blend of hot whole milk 
  and salted water.             

437
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,442
   Melt the curd.               
Kind of push it around.         

438

00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,378
               I can't resist.  

440
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,980
       The rings come off,      
     and it was just so cool    

441
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,517
          to watch him          
      take to it naturally.     

442
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,986
              Like pizza dough, 
      gonna roll it into itself?

443
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,188
Yeah, gonna roll it,            
and then I just pinch it off.   

444
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,655
     That's it.                 
Into some ice water.            

445
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,990
            Let it just seize up
                a little bit.   

446
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,993
And now we'll cut it up         
for the porco pizza.            

447
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,662
                    Mmm.        
               I'm moving in.

449
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,998
                 Seriously.     

450
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,199
               Ow, you bit me!  

451
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,402
      So the tomato sauce?      
   -It's San Marzano tomatoes.  

452
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:45,803
             Sicilian sea salt. 
                 That's it.     

453
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,071
        Push it out to the edge.

454
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,806
                 Our sausage    
             all the way around.

455
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,609

      our house-made mozzarella,

456
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,277
             thin-sliced cetta. 

457
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,279
                Finish it off   
         with smoked prosciutto.

458
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,815
                   Crazy.       
      That thing is rocking hot.

459
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,084
        -Onto the plate.        
      -Take a look at that.     

460
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:03,287

  with the burrata tre colore,  

465
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:15,299

     Italian as you can get.    

466
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:18,636
     We added it to the menu    
         after Guy came.        

467
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,838
        This is a respect       
      for the Italian flag.     

468
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,107
   It's green, white, and red.  

469
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:26,710
      We just take ribbons      
 of mozzarella and make strands.

470
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,979
   This is gonna be the basis   

471
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:31,248
         of the filling

  Add kitchen panna, it's heavy 
cream, but it's reduced in half.

       tomatoes marinated       

474
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:40,791
        with a little bit       
      of capers and garlic.     

475
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,993
         For the green,         
      we've got the pesto,      

476
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,996
      and we're just gonna      
       blend it right in.

480
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,536
   Out of bounds.               

481
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:54,872
   This is beautifully melted   
     house-made mozzarella.     

482
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,474
  We're gonna take our filling  
          that we made,         

483
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,876
      and we're just gonna      
   put it right in the center.

     when you slice into it,    

491
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,563

the prosciutto thinly sliced.

     the bottom of the pan.

00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,452
    This is the first layer.

     this is the lemon curd,
