    WHAT IS THIS--              
JUST A REGULAR OLD LID

00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,776

                 THIS IS        
        A VERY HIGH-TECH GADGET.
YES, I CAN SEE THAT.            

235
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,782
       AND WE TAKE APPROXIMATELY
          HALF OF THE BURGER,   

236
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,653
           AND WE SHAPE IT OUT. 
YOU GOT TO PACK IT              
IN THERE A LITTLE BIT.          

237
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,855
       NEXT THING WE DO IS WE   
     PUT IN THE CHEDDAR CHEESE. 

238
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:20,792
 WE TRY TO KEEP IT A LITTLE BIT 
       TOWARDS THE MIDDLE       

239
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,996
       IN ORDER TO LET THE EDGES
          OF THE BURGER MEET.   

240
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,531
       OTHERWISE, WHEN YOU DO   
     COOK IT, IT FALLS APART... 

241
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
  IT STARTS COMIN'

00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,534
       LAST--THE CHOPPED BACON. 

243
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:33,538
NOW HOW MANY OF THESE BURGERS   
       WILL YOU MAKE?           

244
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,673

259
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,645

285
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,311
                  THEY RAN OUT

287
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,048

   HERE, SAID, "IN THE MEANTIME,
