            JONATHAN:           
   We're making brisket chili.  

371
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,660
   It was cold and I was like,  
 "It's a perfect day for chili."

372
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,795
So we took some leftover brisket
      and made some chili.      

373
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,865
   Start off with diced white   
    onion, seeded jalapeños,    

374
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,201
         minced garlic,         
  a little salt, black pepper.  

375
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,337
       Part of making this      
   a Texas red brisket chili,   

376
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,606
      we've got some stewed     
       tomatoes in liquid,      

377
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,743
          tomato paste,         
    pork stock, adobo sauce,    

378
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,278
          chili powder,         
        chipotle powder,        

379
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,881
  garlic powder, onion powder,  
     cumin, a little sugar.     

380
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,416
    Now that it's cooked down   
            this far,           

381
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,951
         we're gonna add        
     the magic ingredient --    

382
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,253
      our chopped brisket.      

383
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,554
 So we've got a paper boat here 

384
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,557
       filled with some of      
    our favorite corn chips.    

385
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,360
We're gonna fill it up with some
of this beautiful brisket chili,

386
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,161
      we're gonna add a mix     
        of cheddar cheese       

387
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,899
    and jalapeño jack cheese,   
    diced onions, jalapeños.    

388
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,701
         And here we go.        

389
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,235
     Probably the best chili    
         you could have         

390
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,903
         because it has         
       the brisket in it,       

391
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,439
      and then you have the     
  crunchiness, and it's just... 

392
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,574
          It's a go-to.         

393
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:39,310
   The smokiness of the chili   
          with the salt         

394
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:43,180
            is really           
   a great flavor combination.  

395
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,882
        I think I can just punch
               my ticket to --

00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,518
  What's that city you always go
    to with all the good tastes?

 liberally coat this pork butt.

    for up to 10 to 12 hours,   

419
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,695
     about 200, 225 degrees.

423

 This is a mix of cream cheese, 
            cheddar,            

424
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,439

 a little egg wash, some panko.

00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,856
  It melts together very nice.

00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:46,010
       And we'll check in       
     on some more next time     

560
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,278
      on "Triple D Nation."     

561
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,414
You can tell if it's really good
            just by smelling it.

562
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,749
             No! No!            
          Oh, can you?          

563
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,150
        Let me smell it!        

564
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:56,020
         Let me smell it!       

565
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:58,623
         I got ChapStick        
           on my nose!
