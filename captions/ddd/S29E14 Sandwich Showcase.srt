520
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,613
Yeah. Pork.

521
00:17:07,613 --> 00:17:10,080
Falls right apart.

522
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,680
Really good.
Mm.

523
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,946
It's the orange juice in there
that really makes it work.

524
00:17:12,946 --> 00:17:14,546
Sear it off.

525
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:17,080
Some mayo, mustard, and pickles,
and some Swiss cheese.

526
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,346
Roasted pork.

527
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:20,780
Ham on top,
and then into the press.

528
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,380
Oh, Hunter, I thought he was
going to make you one.

529
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,713
That's alright.
You watch Daddy eat.

530
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,213
That's a sandwich
to be known for.

531
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,746
The bread is such
a key part of this.

532
00:17:30,746 --> 00:17:33,946
Nice crust, but very thin
and very light on the inside.

533
00:17:33,946 --> 00:17:35,780
And then you get to enjoy
all the delicious pork

534
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,546
and the ham and the mustard
and the pickle.

535
00:17:37,546 --> 00:17:39,746
That was good.
And the hot sauce?

536
00:17:39,746 --> 00:17:41,180
A spicy Cubano?

537
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,413
Spicy Cubano, yeah.

538
00:17:42,413 --> 00:17:44,646
‐Mm.
‐And it's not too dry either.

539
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,213
A lot of times,
Cubans are dry.

540
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:47,646
Man, that is moist.

541
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:50,080
We're about as far
as far away from Miami ‐‐

542
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,013
from Cuba
that you could find,

543
00:17:52,013 --> 00:17:54,680
and that sandwich tastes like
we're in South Beach, baby.

544
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,913
Delicious.

545
00:17:56,913 --> 00:17:58,480
Two Cuban sandwiches,
coming up.

546
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,520
You get that soft, little crunch
and you get the cheese

547
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,320
and the meat that starts
melting in your mouth.

548
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,053
The pork is the most tender
I think I've ever had.

549
00:18:05,053 --> 00:18:06,986
Vinny's sauce and that little
bit of sweat

550
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:10,220
right up on your forehead ‐‐
that's when it gets great.

551
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,786
I'm got mariachi fries,
Charlie.

552
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:14,486
Anybody that comes in here
one time always comes back.

553
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:16,253
FIERI: But at one point,
they didn't even think

554
00:18:16,253 --> 00:18:17,686
they'd be able to stay open.

555
00:18:17,686 --> 00:18:19,320
There's a story that I heard
about that

556
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,120
someone was shot
in front of the restaurant.

557
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,220
It had nothing to do
with you guys,

558
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,186
and that really affected
the business, right?

559
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:26,320
Yep.

560
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,620
MAN: He says, "I'm not doing
so great.

561
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,020
I think I'm going
to close my doors."

562
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,553
And I says, "No, you're not."

563
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:33,820
The Pasco Police Department
came and raised funds

564
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,153
to keep his doors open.

565
00:18:35,153 --> 00:18:36,486
We put the word of mouth out

566
00:18:36,486 --> 00:18:38,286
and we bought him
a couple more months,

567
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:39,586
and here we are
four years later.

568
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:40,920
FIERI: What's your favorite
thing on the menu?

569
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,053
The Vinny's
chicken sandwich.

570
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:43,286
‐Legit.
‐Legit.

571
00:18:43,286 --> 00:18:44,320
Got Vinny's chicken sandwich.

572
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,920
MAN: Vinny knows his chicken.

573
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,620
Put it in that fresh bread,
and it's just perfect.

574
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,153
What are we going to
next?

575
00:18:49,153 --> 00:18:50,786
Wait, Hunter, you're not
going to wait for your dad?

576
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:52,253
Oh, no.
See, you don't understand.

577
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:53,686
There's a new rooster
in the hen‐house.

578
00:18:53,686 --> 00:18:55,220
‐Oh.
‐Hey, hey, hey.

579
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,820
Alright, Vinny,
watch out for this kid.

580
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,753
This is what's going to happen.
You and I are asleep,

581
00:18:58,753 --> 00:19:00,426
and you're coming to take
over the whole thing.

582
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:01,893
Give me a rundown, Chef.
What's next?

583
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,493
Okay.
A little marinade.

584
00:19:05,493 --> 00:19:06,960
Oil.
Orange juice.

585
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,026
Salt, and the garlic.

586
00:19:08,026 --> 00:19:09,160
‐Paprika.
‐Pepper.

587
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,460
And a little
of the cumino.

588
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,093
What's the next step?
Marinate the chicken.

589
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:14,193
CHARLIE: And it'll stay in there
for 12 hours.

590
00:19:14,193 --> 00:19:15,126
Now, how are we going
to cook them?

591
00:19:15,126 --> 00:19:16,593
On a flat‐top.

592
00:19:16,593 --> 00:19:18,026
Grilled zucchinis.

593
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:19,226
Grilled zucchini in
a chicken sandwich?

594
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:20,926
‐Oh, yes.
‐This I got to see.

595
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,626
Do you like zucchini?
I love zucchini.

596
00:19:22,626 --> 00:19:24,260
Since when?

597
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,160
We're going to do the spicy mayo
for the sandwich.

598
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,026
Great.
For the Zucchini Twins.

599
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:29,726
Mayo down with some paprika.

600
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:31,293
Your dad loves paprika.

601
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:34,360
Sun‐dried tomatoes,
and the kicker ‐‐ the chipotle.

602
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,293
So, the spicy mayo, the bread
that we baked ourselves,

603
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:41,226
and the zucchini,
and the chicken, fresh tomatoes,

604
00:19:41,226 --> 00:19:43,560
red onion, in the panini.

605
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,293
This is the Vinny.
‐This is the Vinny.

606
00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:46,493
Okay.

607
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:54,026
♪♪♪♪

608
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:54,993
Are you not eating
at school?

609
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,460
What's going on?

610
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,033
Guys, that is a phenomenal
chicken sandwich.

611
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,000
The bread, of course,
is outstanding.

612
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,300
The flavors are in balance.

613
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,300
What do you think makes
the sandwich so dynamite?

614
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
HUNTER: The zucchini
and the tomatoes.

615
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,733
I like it.

616
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:13,666
We know you like it,
Hunter.

617
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:14,866
The zucchini melts.

618
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:16,800
It is so creamy.

619
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,633
That's a special
chicken sandwich.

620
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:21,200
SERVER: The Vinny's chicken
sandwich for you.

621
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,566
‐Thank you.
‐It's something very unique.

622
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:24,566
The zucchini.

623
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:26,266
Yeah, zucchini.

624
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,200
You can't beat it.
Mariachi fries!

625
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,233
Vinny's is the place to be.

626
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:32,966
MAN: There's nowhere that has
this combination of flavors

627
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:34,966
along with the warm
and welcoming feeling.

628
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:36,333
‐You guys should be very proud.
‐Thank you.

629
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,500
Congratulations.
I'll leave these two.

630
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,066
Okay.
Okay?

631
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:41,300
Come on, Vinny.
We'll take off.

632
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,700
We'll see you next week.
"Triple D."

633
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,533
Good luck, guys.
Clean it up.

634
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:46,966
So that's it for this trip.

635
00:20:46,966 --> 00:20:48,633
But don't worry,
there's plenty more "Triple D"

636
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:50,400
joints all over the country.

637
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,933
I'll be looking for you
next week

638
00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:55,300
on "Diners, Drive‐Ins &amp; Dives."

639
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,833
Good afternoon, officer.
What seems to be the concern?

640
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,533
Well, Chef,
I know who you are.

641
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:02,206
Hunter,
I know who you are as well.

642
00:21:02,206 --> 00:21:05,473
Christmas Rabbit,
I need to see some ID.

643
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:06,506
Where did he come from?

644
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:08,106
What the...?
