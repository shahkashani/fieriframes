1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,267
           Hey, there.          

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,735
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:07,072
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,007
          This trip...          

5
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:09,408
   This is funky.               

6
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,409
         ...we're doing         
      a little chilling...      

7
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:11,676
I'll be here all week.          

8
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,679
           ...and some          
       serious grilling...      

9
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:14,946
It's gonna be a fat day.        

10
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,149
      ...in Orange County,      
           California.          

11
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:18,484
   That is killer.              

12
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:20,819
          A fresh take          
       on a food truck...       

13
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:22,220
 Look how beautiful             
 that sandwich is.              

14
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,756
          ...firing up          
       some macho Mexican.      

15
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,025
         That's it. I got to go.

16
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:29,161
          I can't handle tortas 
and chilaquiles in the same day.

17
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:31,963
       Then a funky joint       
      in Miami, Florida...      

18
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,364
This is gonna be weird.         

19
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,900
 ...smoking full-flavored hog...

20
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:36,101
 That is outrageous.            

21
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:37,636
      ...with a tiny twist.     

22
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,505
  Winner, winner,               
  pig-wing dinner.              

23
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:41,240
        And on the island       
           of Oahu...           

24
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:42,975
                   This is      
          your work environment?

25
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:44,843
   ...it's a grillapalooza...   

26
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,111
                  Probably      
           the crispiest chicken

27
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,047
      that anybody will ever try
       that has not been fried. 

28
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:50,716
         ...turning out         
       real-deal Hawaiian.      

29
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:54,653
                The true Oahu   
     Huli Huli chicken Mike way.

30
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,722
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

31
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,456
         on "Triple D."         

34
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:11,804
            I'm here            
  in Orange County, California, 

35
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:13,538
         and I'm looking        
        for a taco truck.       

36
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,074
  Now, before you start rolling 
your eyes, listen to this story.

37
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,843
             I hear             
  it's a husband-and-wife team  

38
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,745
     where they're all about    
         sustainability,        

39
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,346
  farm-to-table, and organics,  

40
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:23,549
      and the Mexican food      
        is off the hook.        

41
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:26,485
      This is Tamarindo --      
  scratch-made comida Mexicana. 

42
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:29,388
   Chilaquiles, drunken torta.  

43
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,292
      The food is amazing.      

44
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:34,826
       Just blows me away.      

45
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,828
                   FIERI:       
          It's like Mexican food

46
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,630
    with a California freshness,
                  kind of?      

47
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,166
       WOMAN: You can tell      
 they locally source everything.

48
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,300
   It's reflected in the food.  

49
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,436
          It has to do          
      with Sarah and Pedro.     

50
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:47,239
      FIERI: That would be      
    Sarah and Pedro Resendiz,   

51
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,241
who have been running this truck
           since 2011.          

52
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:51,176
           Fish taco.           

53
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:53,178
Best story you ever hear        
in the restaurant business.     

54
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,048
It's where the line cook meets  
the beautiful waitress,         

55
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,982
   and they go off              
   and get married              

56
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,785
     and open up                
their own restaurant joint.     

57
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:00,786
        That's the story.       

58
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,055
   Drunken.                     
                 Drunken. Heard.

59
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,458
 I am diehard drunken-torta fan.

60
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,194
           Flank steak          
     marinated in Dos Equis.    

61
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,997
   With all kinds of goodness   
     in there -- excellent.     

62
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,399
                  What are      
            we gonna make first?

63
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,602
  We're gonna start             
  with the marinade             

64
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:17,869
for the drunken torta.          

65
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,337
Gonna start with the onions.    
                           Okay.

66
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,739
       Garlic.                  

67
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,207
      Oranges.                  

68
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,542
     Soy sauce.                 

69
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,410
       A little salt and pepper.

70
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,778
  And the cerveza.              

71
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,117
   All right, so,               
we're gonna do flank steak.     

72
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,620
        And we let that marinate
                for how long?   

73
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,422
     Overnight.                 

74
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:40,225
               And we're gonna  
            grill the steak now.

75
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,227
                 We're gonna    
          caramelize our onions.

76
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:45,764
  A little bit of vegetable oil,
                salt and pep.   

77
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,832
            Cook that for about 
            three, four minutes.

78
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,102
               A little cola.   

79
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:51,903
 You glaze them                 
with a little cola?             
                       Yes, sir.

80
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,905
     I like it.                 

81
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,574
                  These are     
             our bolillo rolls. 

82
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:57,609
      They came                 
from the Mexican bakery.        

83
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,713
                Garlic beans.   
A little bean spread            
  on there.                     

84
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,715
                   Both sides.  
It's a little natural mayo.     

85
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,651
You'll just toast them          
      on there?                 

86
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,554
       The steak is ready to go.
Okay.                           

87
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,723
                 Put it back    
              on the flat-top.  

88
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,059
                Queso fresco.   
  Got it.                       

89
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,327
              Bolillo's ready.  
              Put that on top.  

90
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,264
            Some of those onions
                right there.    

91
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,199
                Herbal salsa.   
      Mm.                       

92
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,135
               Local tomatoes.  

93
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:24,536
              Organic arugula.  

94
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,939
I don't see a lot of arugula    
  in Mexican food.              

95
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,408
           Cut it right in half.

96
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,343
And that's all she wrote.       

97
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:32,678
     Drunken torta, right there.

98
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,878
                 Let me know    
               what you think.  

99
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,114
 Look how beautiful             
 that sandwich is.              

100
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,088
  Here's the deal.              

101
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,689
 I got to be honest.            

102
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,358
  I don't like it.              

103
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,425
                Fair enough.    

104
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,294
     I love it.                 

105
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,363
This is an orchestra            
     of flavors.                

106
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:53,565
The meat has great flavor --    
really nice and tender.         

107
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,833
You get a little bit            
   of the citrus,               

108
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,235
    a little bit                
of that acid coming through.    

109
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:57,436
The bean spread on there        

110
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,704
working as the natural mayo --  
     outrageous.                

111
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,439
But the kicker here, baby,      

112
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:05,177
   grilled onions               
with the cola deglazing.        

113
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:08,113
Without question the best tortas
I've ever had in the States.    

114
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:09,648
                     Thank you. 
That's killer.                  

115
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,051
              MAN:              
  I mean, how can you go wrong  

116
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,519
    when it's meat marinated    
            in beer?            

117
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,723
     You will travel to wherever
          they are to have this.
             Yep.               

118
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,791
   How far have you had to drive
         to come and find them? 

119
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,259
     Oh, my gosh, 32 miles.     

120
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,128
 About two hours to get up here.

121
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,196
             Enjoy.             

122
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:25,863
             Where did you learn
                how to cook?    

123
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,865
 Mostly from my mom.            

124
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,468
You know, I was like            
5 years old, sitting, you know, 

125
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,070
   next to my mom,              
watching her cooking.           

126
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,471
               So you learned   
      a bunch of this in Mexico,

127
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,539
              and then you came 
               to the States.   

128
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,674
Yeah, I was that kid,           
      you know.                 

129
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,542
 That's what I love.            
  I just love food.             

130
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,144
      Chilaquiles for Kim.      

131
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,079
             WOMAN:             
   I'm having the chilaquiles.  

132
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,881
            It's made           
  with a fresh tomatillo sauce, 

133
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,417
        and it just makes       
       every bite magical.      

134
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,953
Now we're gonna make            
the chicken chilaquiles.        

135
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,220
         That's it. I got to go.

136
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:52,090
          I can't handle tortas 
and chilaquiles in the same day.

137
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,692
Gonna start with the marinade   
  for the chicken.              

138
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,495
   Achiote paste.               
  Chipotle chilies.             

139
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:57,696
             And adobo. Got it. 

140
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,064
   Vegetable oil.               

141
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,765
 The roasted garlic.            
    Black pepper.               

142
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,767
  Mexican oregano.              

143
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:02,901
     Lime juice.                

144
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,435
        Salt.                   

145
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,837
     And water.                 

146
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,910
     So, this is                
our achiote marinade.           

147
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,247
                    [ Whistles ]
Got a nice kick                 
to it, right?                   

148
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,382
                  Love it.      

149
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,118
    And for that,               
we're gonna use organic chicken.

150
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,453
             Thighs or breasts? 
Thighs.                         

151
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:24,656
      Season it                 
 with salt and pep.             

152
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,725
                And how long    
      will we let this marinate?

153
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:28,393
   Overnight.                   
                     Overnight. 

154
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,729
              Now let's move on 
         to cooking the chicken.

155
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,997
           While that's cooking,

156
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,467
              we're gonna start 
          with frying our chips.

157
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,602
Frying pan for our egg.         

158
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:38,737
                For our what?   

159
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,972
Organic and local eggs.         

160
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,875
      Season it                 
 with a little salt.            

161
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:47,279
These babies are gonna go       
into our tomatillo salsa.       

162
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,752
  Chicken's ready.              

163
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,121
   Tortilla chips.              

164
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:01,226
         Now we're getting some 
        of this achiote chicken.

165
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:02,961
FIERI: Look at that.            

166
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,662
     Screw it up                
with the egg on there.          

167
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,365
      Let's put some more salsa.

168
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,634
               Mexican crema.   

169
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:10,969
               Cotija cheese.   

170
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,571
                  Cilantro.     

171
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:13,405
      Gorgeous.                 

172
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,845
        Chef,                   
this is really amazing.         

173
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,179
This tomatillo salsa            

174
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,248
   with the crema               
and the tender chicken          

175
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,385
 and the chips fried            
just the right way...           

176
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,988
It's tangy, it's spicy,         
 and it's handmade.             

177
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,189
This is righteous, man.         

178
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,591
Amazing. Delicious.             
                      Thank you.

   You can't go wrong with it.

      WOMAN: You just leave     

182
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:40,399
  with that little burn in your 
   mouth that's not too much.   

183
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,733
       It's just perfect.

      to Sarah and Pedro's      

185
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:46,071
 delicious Tamarindo truck food.

You're just making it happen.   

187

        Uh-huh. Totally.        
That's beautiful.

191
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,415
       I mean,                  
 this is ridiculous.            

192
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,416
     ...in Miami, Florida...    

193
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,818
That's some of the best pork    
I've ever had, honestly.        

194
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,221
...a laid-back joint dishing out
        a taste of Texas.       

195
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,222
This is a chili experience.     

196
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,397
     So, I'm here in Miami.     

197
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,798
       Now, this is called      
       the Mimo District.       

198
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
      I'm about a half mile     
    from South Beach, Miami,    

199
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,870
 and this is one of the largest 
 art-deco areas that they have. 

200
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,439
 Now, back in the '30s and '40s,
     this place was rocking.    

201
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,207
    It was like Miami Vegas.    

202
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,010
       Well, they've gone       
     through the good times     

203
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:26,611
       and the bad times,       
       but not to worry.        

204
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,546
    They're on their way back   
       because of a bunch       

205
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,482
   of really cool restaurants   
        and unique shops,       

206
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,417
     and one of the joints      
     that's leading the way     

207
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:33,618
  is right here at The Federal. 

208

 Fried chicken, ready, pick-up.

    When you want good food,    
    you come to The Federal.    

210
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,161
        The venison chili       
         and grit fries.        

211
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,565
    It's completely unique.     
    The flavors are amazing.    

212
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,967
      There's a lot of love     
   and passion into the food.   

213
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,769
   FIERI: Just part of the "do  
     what you love" attitude

     of Colombian-born chef     
          Cesar Zapata.         

215
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,175
  Got tired of working in hotels
     doing the corporate thing. 

216
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,377
                 I just want    
             to do my own thing.

         Ani Meinhold, in 2012. 

218

  They opened The Federal, and  
 it's been craziness after that.

219
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:08,052
So, where did you learn         
      to cook?                  
                        Texas.  

220
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,522
From doing barbecue? Is that    
where the smoker's coming from? 

221
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,725
            Barbecue            
   is standing right outside.   

222
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,729
    The smoking is happening    
   right where you walk past.   

223
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,197
      I haven't eaten meat      
          for 40 years,         

224
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,464
   but when I come to The Fed,  

225
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,268
    I make a major exception,   
     and I eat the pig wing.    

226
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,272
     Buffalo-style pig wing.    

227
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,674
          It's like, basically, 
       the Buffalo chicken wing.

228
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,543
This is funky.                  
        We get them from a farm.

229
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,678
              They raise pigs   
              that have wings.  

230
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,613
      Shut up.

231
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,283
What is this?                   
             Like, a mini shank.

232
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,018
           It's from this part, 
       right here, from the pig.

233
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,886
                 Basically,     
         they're, like, poached.

234
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,688
             Then, what we do is
             that we smoke them.

235
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,823
         Oh.                    

236
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:47,092
    And how long                
are those gonna go on?          

237
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,826
         They're gonna go there 
       for maybe 20, 30 minutes.

238
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,629
Just enough to perfume them     
    a little bit,               

239
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,163
  put a little bit              
  of color to them.             

240
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,498
What kind of smoke was that?    
         A little bit of hickory
                and beech.      

241
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,301
           We're gonna make the 
Buffalo sauce for the pig wings.

242
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,502
 Let's get it going.            

243
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:00,438
            Texas Pete hot sauce
                 as a base.     

244
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,841
               Garlic powder,   
        ginger powder, chipotle,

245
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:06,177
           apple-cider vinegar, 
        Sriracha, Florida honey.

246
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,179
                       We whisk.
Holy butter, Batman.            

247
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:11,249
    One pound. And then we start
        to emulsify the butter. 

248
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,052
   And we'll bring              
the pig wings back in.          

249
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,520
              We're gonna make  
            the seasoned flower.

250
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:18,857
    All-purpose, garlic powder, 
 ginger, onion powder, chipotle.

251
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:19,857
That's definitely Texas.        

252
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,726
        Salt, black pepper. Mix.

253
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,462
Just the natural moisture       
 that's on there --             

254
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,263
  the flour adheres             
      to that.                  

255
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,532
        Now,                    
this is the buttermilk.         

256
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,334
   Dry, wet, dry.               

257
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,068
 Over to the fryer.             

258
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,772
                 Canola oil.    
   350?                         

259
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,075
        So, here's the pig wing,

260
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,744
       brushed with a little bit
        of house Buffalo sauce. 

261
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,212
         And bleu-cheese mousse.

262
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:44,015
Did you dress the carrots       
with anything? Vinaigrette?     

263
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,051
     A little house vinaigrette.

264
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,754
       I mean,                  
 this is ridiculous.            

265
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,423
The shank, the smoke.           

266
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,491
   The wing sauce               
doesn't overpower it.           

267
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,760
It doesn't steal the show.      

268
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,229
     The crunch                 
at the end of it. Oh.           

269
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,365
 That is outrageous.            

270
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,435
That's some of the best pork    
   I've ever had.               

271
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,636
It's a winner, winner,          
  pig-wing dinner.              

272
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:06,838
     Excellent.                 

273
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,374
And if this is a representation 
of the rest of the menu,        

274
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,309
it's gonna be a fat day.        

275
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,777
 The pork wing.                 

276
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,045
                Unbelievable.   

277
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,781
It's not too spicy. It's not    
like it overpowers the meat.    

278
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,383
       It is so, so tasty.      

279
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,385
     We had very innovative,    
         unique dishes.         

280
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,320
  The grit fries are the best.  

281
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,255
              MAN:              
  Venison chili and grit fries. 

282
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:27,192
          It's amazing.         

283
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:29,394
 We're gonna make venison chili.
    Start with some canola oil. 

284
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,996
Farm-raised ground venison.     
                     From Texas.

285
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,197
Okay.                           
         Gonna get this browned.

286
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,000
Smoked brisket?                 
                 Smoked brisket.

287
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:37,936
  White onions, poblano peppers,
          and then we mix this. 

288
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,337
  Sweat them down.              

289
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,539
      Probably for two minutes. 
    Then we add the chili paste.

290
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,875
    Gonna cook that chili paste,
       like, for seven minutes, 

291
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:46,077
               until it starts  
           to get a little dark.

292
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,411
               We add garlic.   

293
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,746
       Comino?                  
                       Comino.  

294
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,549
              A little beer --  
             Make sure we taste.

295
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:52,950
  How is it?                    
                  Oh, it's good.

296
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,018
                That's right.   

297
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,620
  Wow, that's dark.             

298
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,889
               Chicken stock.   

299
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:59,290
          A little salt, season.

300
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,492
    Black pepper.               

301
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:01,693
         Cook this for two hours

302
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:04,762
               until it starts  
        to thicken a little bit.

303
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,632
     Now we add                 
the cilantro bouquet.           

304
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,901
     And then we'll let that sit
            for 15, 20 minutes. 

305
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,435
What is it served with?         
                Some grit fries.

306
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,903
So, we're gonna make grits,     

307
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,238
and then we're gonna make fries 
    out of them?                

308
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,540
                     Exactly.   
This is gonna be weird.         

309
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,143
                Florida milk.   

310
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,714
             Stone-ground grits.
                We mix this.    

311
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:25,450
          A little black pepper,
          Cajun seasoning, salt.

312
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:26,851
 Let this cook down.            

313
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,853
            And once they start 
   to become a little bit stiff,

314
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,121
               we're gonna add  
                 the butter,    

315
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,589
             and then we're just
             gonna emulsify it. 

316
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:34,391
     Next up.                   
                 Cheese -- jack.

317
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:37,962
                          Ready.
Now, we'll take these onto      
a sheet tray, let them cool.    

318
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:43,134
       And then we're just gonna
          slice them into logs. 

319
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:46,270
Into the fryer?                 
                   In the fryer.

320
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,473
          Nice and golden-brown.

321
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,341
    Look at that.               

322
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,443
  This is gangster.             

323
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,613
          Then we got the chili.

324
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,815
               Mexican crema.   

325
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,284
               Cotija cheese.   

326
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:01,018
   Scallion love.               

327
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,487
                  Chipotle.     

328
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,855
               And that's it.   

329
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,625
Mm. That is ridiculous.         

330
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,494
                 Thank you.     

331
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:13,164
 This has the depth,            
the richness, the complexity.   

332
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,299
It's not super-spicy.           

333
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:15,500
Chili shouldn't blow            
   your head off.               

334
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,902
Then you get to the finale,     
   this grit fry.               

335
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,371
It's got that crunch, and you   
got the cheese coming through.  

336
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,640
       This is                  
 a chili experience.            

337
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:24,175
         Like a little symphony.

338
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,110
This is like the philharmonic.  
    Outstanding.                

339
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,645
Very nice, Chef. Fantastic.     
            Thank you very much.

340
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:28,979
             ZAPATA:            
      Venison chili, ready.     

341
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,448
        It's really good.       

342
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,850
     You get a little sweet,    
         a little spicy.        

343
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,053
     The crunch is awesome.     

344
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:38,790
  The place is funky, the staff 
 is cool, and the food is legit.

345
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,325
You are a remarkable chef.      

346
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:41,292
 Big props, man.                
                      Thank you.

347
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,799
            Up next,            
      in Kaneohe, Hawaii...

00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,934
                          Oh!   
      ...a grilling guru...     

349
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,402
               Mike's the man.  
        You got to come see him.

350
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,538
    ...setting up roadside...   

351
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,206
 It's what you got to love about
    coming to the islands, man. 

352
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,243
      ...and inspiring more     
    than just a love of food.   
            Will you marry me?  

353
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,052
          So, I'm here          
on the beautiful island of Oahu,

354
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:11,055
  and I'm right on the border   
  between Kaneohe and Kahaluu,  

355
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,457
    and I'm right on the edge   
       of the Kaneohe Bay.      

356
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,994
       [ Exhales sharply ]      
     Why would I go through     
     such a tongue twister?     

357
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,996
              Well,             
   for a very specific reason.  

358
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:21,332
     You see, I have driven     
  by this place over 100 times, 

359
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,134
      and this is the place     
        that inspired me        

360
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,536
          to get my own         
   Huli Huli-chicken machine.   

361
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,239
      This is the original      
    Mike's Huli Huli Chicken.   

362
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,544
    Two char siu pork plates    
          ready to go.          

363
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,012
         MAN: I love it.        

364
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,948
  You can't really go anywhere  
 else to get this kind of stuff.

365
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,017
           FUSE: Here,          
    half-chicken plate here.    

366
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,618
             WOMAN:             
   Said, "What is that smell?"  

367
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,220
        I said, "Husband,       
  you got to turn back around." 

368
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:44,956
       Hey, char siu plate      
         with mac salad.        

369
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,558
          Everybody knows Reno, 
    the chef here on the island.

370
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,628
 This where I bring             
all my haole family to.         

371
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,963
Every time my haole friends     
come down from the mainland,    

372
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,766
I always bring them to          
Uncle Mike's Huli Huli Chicken. 

373
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,770
                      This guy  
           rocks the house, huh?
 It's great.                    

374
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,908
    FIERI: This guy is owner    
  and Oahu native Mike Fuse...  

375
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,910
         Yeah, I got two        
   Huli chickens ready to go.   

376
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,912
      FIERI: ...who's been      
      putting his own mark      

377
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:12,116
   on the traditional Hawaiian  
 Huli Huli recipe since 2010... 

378
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,451
     MAN: It's slow-roasted.    

379
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,787
  It's got a very smoky flavor, 
           very juicy.          

380
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,657
     FIERI: ...thanks to his    
  custom wood-fired rotisserie  

381
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:23,861
 that keeps juices on the inside
  without burning the outside.  

382
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,995
           So, I've always said,

383
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,997
           since I started doing
             Huli Huli chicken, 

384
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:31,135
 that one day, I would come back
          and recognize the man 

385
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,204
               that showed me   
     the first way how to do it.

386
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,273
    I want you to give everybody
                the rundown,    

387
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:39,276
                the true Oahu   
     Huli Huli chicken Mike way.

388
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,413
You got to first of all         
get 2 1/4 to 3 pounds.          

389
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,615
          Not too big of a bird.
                   Got it.      

390
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,551
  Then you cut it               
  down the center.              

391
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,019
                    Okay.       

392
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,487
  Then we brine it              
in Hawaiian sea salt.           

393
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,556
A little lemon juice, too.      

394
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,624
                    That's it.  
Just for taste. That's it.      

395
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:56,628
       So, we'll let the chicken
               brine how long?  
Overnight.                      

396
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,630
       And what's our next step?
             Gonna make the rub?
   Yeah.                        

397
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:01,966
We got a little salt, paprika,  
little bit of cumin,            

398
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:05,837
pepper, garlic powder,          
      oregano,                  

399
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,638
    a little bit                
 of white pepper...             

400
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,107
                   Onion.       

401
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,642
      And what's this down here,
               a little chili?  

402
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:12,777
That's cayenne pepper.          
         A little cayenne. Okay.

403
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,313
Okay, then we go ahead          
   and mix it up.               

404
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,584
Put it all, rub it in.          

405
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,386
             Just turn and burn.

406
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,620
 Yep, turn and burn.            

407
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,691
    Then you get                
the chicken here, and...        

408
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:28,259
               It's got to go   
             through the thighs 

409
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,394
                 and the top    
            of the wings, right?

410
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:30,995
     And the top                
of the wings, right,            

411
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:33,464
because if you don't get it     
on tight, what happens?         

412
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:34,965
               One part starts  
                to come off,    

413
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,067
          and it starts dragging
                into the fire   

414
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:38,002
              and gets burnt up 
               and falls off.   

415
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,270
Charcoal-crusted chicken.       
       Charcoal-crusted chicken.

416
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,739
        Not a big specialty here
                 at Mike's.     

417
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,607
               All right, so,   
             we're ready to go? 

418
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,675
    Grab my hook.               

419
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:45,610
Cantilever that out.            

420
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,677
                    Yep.        
     Okay.                      

421
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,146
             Okay, pull that up.
And over we go.                 

422
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:49,547
              Over to the fire. 

423
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,350
        FUSE:                   
Okay. Put that down.            

424
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,886
Get it going.                   
                      FIERI:    
             And how long, Mike?

425
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,489
About 40 minutes, depending     
on how hot the fire is.         

426
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,757
           And what kind of wood
                are we using?   

427
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,959
 This is kiawe wood.            

428
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,694
                          Kiawe?
Yeah. It burns very hot.        

429
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,294
 It's like mesquite.            
              Hawaiian mesquite.

430
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,229
Hawaiian mesquite, right.       
                         Got it.

431
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,563
All right, so, what we do is    

432
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:09,901
we just grab this chicken here, 
pull that off the fire.         

433
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:12,236
                [ Whistles ]    
             Look at that, man. 

434
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,305
Take the chickens off.          

435
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:16,708
        Okay,                   
and take that one off.          

436
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,510
 And cut the chicken            
  down the center.              

437
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,245
So soft it's falling apart      
      already.                  

438
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,448
     And we add                 
some macaroni salad, here.      

439
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,649
     Pineapple.                 

440
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,984
Go ahead and put the whole      
half chicken on there.          

441
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,919
And Mike's secret sauce.        

442
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,521
                    Dude,       
          I am telling you what.

443
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,457
             This is even better
             than I remember it.

444
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,796
                     Oh!        

445
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,664
           The skin is so juicy.

446
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,933
                  Probably      
           the crispiest chicken

447
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:44,334
      that anybody will ever try
       that has not been fried. 

448
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,137
                Look at that.   
Good stuff, huh?                

449
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,673
               It's so legit.   

450
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,910
 It's what you got to love about
    coming to the islands, man. 

451
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,147
           Okay, I got          
  two half-Huli-chicken plates  

452
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,815
      with the secret sauce

453
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,886
       I love the chicken.      
    It's very tender, juicy.    

454
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,354
    It has that smoky taste.    

455
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,625
           And "bird"           
    isn't the only word here.   

456
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,894
Mike also puts a spin on pork...

457
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,629
          Roadside dining, baby,
               at its finest.   

458
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:14,432
      ...when we come back.     

459
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:21,472
           Right now,           
   "Triple D" is hanging loose  

460
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:24,208
      on the island of Oahu     
     at Mike's Huli Chicken,    

461
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,144
        an open-air joint       
       firing up the goods      

462
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,613
   in the middle of paradise.   

463
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,749
                   This is      
          your work environment?

464
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,218
  This is it, man.              

465
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,087
  You turn to one side, you got 
  the mountains all around you, 

466
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,889
           and you got          
     the ocean right there.     

467
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,624
        And people just smell it
             when they come by. 
That's it.                      

468
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,625
That's why we have it           
on the side of the road, man.   

469
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,962
  It's just a nice, cool, easy, 
         relaxing place         

470
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:47,265
       to enjoy your meal.      

471
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:52,236
    Two char siu pork plates    
          ready to go.          

472
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,571
             WOMAN:             
      The pork is awesome.      

473
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,172
    It's got a great flavor.    

474
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,308
     The meat's real tender.    

475
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,844
Okay, we're gonna make          
the char siu park, okay?        

476
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,712
    Okay, we got                
a 3- to 4-pound pork butt.      

477
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:04,048
        Boneless, skinless pork.
 Boneless, skinless pork,       
       yeah.                    

478
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:08,986
And what we do is we cut it     
down the center like so.        

479
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,054
  Okay. And what does "char siu"
                 stand for?     

480
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,656
  Red Chinese pork.             

481
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,426
Okay, now what we have here     
is two cups of soy sauce.       

482
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,130
  A little hoisin.              

483
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,732
    Oyster sauce.               

484
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:24,402
    A little bit                
of Chinese five-spice, okay?    
                         Got it.

485
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:27,938
 And brown sugar --             
about six cups, yeah?           

486
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,074
And red food coloring,          

487
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,742
but this is optional,           
 but I like it red.             

488
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,811
                    Okay.       
     About a tablespoon of that.

489
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,114
Okay, set the pork in.          

490
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,550
       And that's all she wrote.

491
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,686
That's all she wrote.           
    See how red?                

492
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:43,421
                     Beautiful. 
Nice and beautiful red.         

493
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:44,755
               Looks just like  
     in the Chinese restaurants.

494
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,891
              And just let that 
        marinate all the way in.

495
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,159
 Exactly. Overnight.            

496
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:49,693
                  We ready?     
  Ready.                        

497
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:54,698
We're gonna skewer these pork,  
   here, like so.               

498
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,734
  Okay. Here we go.             

499
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,104
 Now lift this off.             

500
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,910
              How long is this  
              gonna take, Mike? 

501
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:10,047
About 40 minutes to get         
the barbecue kiawe taste.       

502
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:13,116
And I put it in a little pot,   
      and I --                  

503
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,986
              Let it sit there  
              and steam itself? 
Yeah, steam itself, right.      

504
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,923
Grab this off the fire.         

505
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:20,658
  And take it off.              

506
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,860
 Nice and hot.                  
                   That's what  
              I'm talking about.

507
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,428
And we'll slice it all up.      

508
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:32,002
    We drizzle it               
with a little sauce, here.      

509
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,305
   And we serve it              
with a hot mustard sauce, yeah? 

510
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,044
               Sweet, smoky...  
      and it couldn't be better.

511
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,215
          Roadside dining, baby,
               at its finest,   

512
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:46,417
     in the middle of everything
         you love about Hawaii.

00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:47,685

                killer food.

                 my friend.

        You got to come see him.

       with regular salad.      

517
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,563
    It's got the nice, crisp,   
    almost-burned edge to it,   

518
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:00,965
   which I just love the most.  

519
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:05,303
     The food is excellent,     
 and the ambience is, bar none, 

520
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:08,372
         the best place         
   on this side of the island.  

521
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,642
   And it's the perfect place   
     to hang with my family     

522
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,443

Yes, honey. Aww.

00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,678
Don't expect it to end like this
                all the time.   

540
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,848
   Don't worry. I'll be looking 
for you next time on "Triple D."
