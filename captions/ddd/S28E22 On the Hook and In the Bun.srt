       that extra little flavor.

452
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,317
You can taste the hops in there.
             -Okay.             

453
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,385
       So first, we're gonna add

454
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:56,120
               our two pitches  
            of a local pale ale.

455
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,788
  -Fish and chips is big here?  
             -It is.            

456
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,056
              It is one of our  
              biggest sellers.  

457
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,658
          And we've got a little
              granulated onion  

458
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,925
          and granulated garlic,

459
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,995
             salt, black pepper,
              baking powder...  

460
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,396
         -There you go.         
         -...cayenne...         

461
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,531
         -A good amount.        
        -...some Old Bay.       

462
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,535
  -A whole mess of cornstarch.  
     -Give it a little mix.     

463
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:11,536
            We're gonna add egg,

464
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,604
              a bunch of flour, 
              and whisk it down 

465
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:14,872
                until we get    
        the consistency we want.

466
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:18,475
    You must have               
  a big right arm.              

467
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,543
        Now we're gonna cut down

468
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:20,878
                 some of our    
           Alaskan wild-cut cod.

469
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,814
    -There's no Seattle cod?    
       -There probably is.      

470
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:26,216
I thought I "cod" some          
last time I was up here.        

471
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,953
So smaller, thin slices.        

472
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,354
            Dredge in the flour,

473
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,688
            into our beer batter
                we just made.   

474
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,090
I like the amount of pepper     
      in there.                 

475
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,758
     -Straight to the fryer.    
           -Next step?          

476
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,226
  -Our house-made tartar sauce. 
             -Okay.             

477
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,096
A nice amount of mayonnaise here
               to start with,   

478
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:40,031
       some dill relish...      
       -That's a big dill.      

479
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,766
             ...some pureed-down
            onions and celery...

480
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:42,700
  I like that move.             

481
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,035
          ...salt, black pepper,

482
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:46,704
           a little bit of lemon
       juice and dried parley...

483
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:47,971
   Here it comes.               

484
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,107
         ...hot sauce, and we're
             gonna whisk it up. 

485
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,175
             There's our tartar.

486
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,776
           So now that we got it
                all fried up,   

487
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,513
 get it set up for presentation,
               fresh coleslaw,  

488
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,114
         seasoned hand-cut fries

489
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,183
              and then our cod, 
          and we are good to go.

490
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,919
                   Enjoy.       

491
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:03,720
That's flaky goodness           
    right there.                

492
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:07,525
That's actually, like,          
  the perfect bite.             

493
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,526
         Mm.                    

494
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,194
   But see, that's              
 the ratio you want.            

495
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,262
       I want                   
the right amount of fish        

496
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,429
 to the right amount            
     of batter.                 

497
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,665
   It doesn't take              
    a lot of time               

498
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,934
  to get that size              
    fish cooked,                

499
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,336
so it doesn't soak up           
    a lot of oil.               

500
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,671
   This is tender,              
    falls apart.                

501
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:23,007
   It's not fishy.              

502
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:25,243
I do get a little bit           
    of that beer.               

503
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,713
And when you don't need         
  the tartar sauce,             

504
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:29,814
then you're winning.            

505
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:30,814
     The fish stands on its own.

506
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,282
Well, it actually can't,        
    because it...               

507
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:33,284
                Has no legs.    

508
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,085
            -Exactly.           
        -Technicalities.        

509
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,687
     That's what                
  always gets you.              

510
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:37,888
     That's good                
   fish and chips.              

511
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,690
     Well done.                 

512
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,759
        EMILY: All right.       
   Here's your fish and chips.  

513
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:44,629
     Crunchy and flaky, and     
 the beer batter is perfection. 

514
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:46,631
   I actually love the tartar   
    sauce. It got some kick.    

515
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:48,232
        Fire Circle, J-4.       

516
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,435
     The Red Door is a slice    
         of old Seattle.        

517
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:51,702
      Everyone comes here.      

518
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,504
     We see the same people     
       every time we come.      

519
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,439
     FIERI: Even I'm running    
       into folks I know.       

520
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,108
          This woman right here,
                   Voula,       

521
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,310
               the first time   
        we ever shot in Seattle,

522
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:00,844
    we shot a funky little place

523
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,647
               called Voula's   
               Offshore Cafe.   

524
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:05,249
     We meet the two crazy sons,
               Niko and Sikey,  

525
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,118
             so you find a place
             like the Red Door, 

526
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,119
            and it's nice to see
        these mom-and-pop places

527
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,923
      that are making real food,
             lots of community. 

528
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,257
  Very tasty stuff.             

529
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,391
            Order up.           

530
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:15,860
  MAN #5: They have a wonderful 
        variety of food.        

531
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,061
You can come here for the wings.

532
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,262
 You can come here for the tots,

533
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,530
      so you can come here      
       for a full burger.       

534
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,265
        FIERI: Or take it       
        to the next level       

535
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,533
   with the prime rib classic.  

536
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,868
             GAUNTZ:            
     Beef dip to the window.    

537
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,870
        The beef dip has        
       a fantastic sauce.       

538
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:27,071
   The beef is always tender.   

539
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:28,406
One of my favorites on the menu.

540
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,408
       We're gonna make our beef
             dip sandwich next. 

541
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,542
    Let's see it.               

542
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,610
    So we start off with a nice,
               big prime rib.   

543
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,878
  No bone, there is             
a good amount of fat.           

544
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,348
     Hit it with some stout beer
                 and water.     

545
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,016
   Now we're gonna make our rub,
               a little salt,   

546
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:42,153
  black pepper, rosemary, thyme,
    a little granulated onion...

547
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:43,554
             -Okay.             
    -...fresh minced garlic.    

548
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,756
           We're gonna mix it up
              and rub it down.  

549
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,158
Now how long are we going       
 to roast this off?             

550
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,492
           For about 45 minutes.

551
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,495
Put a nice sear on it           
and give it a nice crust.       

552
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:52,229
    And then we'll be pulling it
              out of the oven,  

553
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,098
         wrapping it tightly and
   putting it in the slow cooker

554
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,701
     for about 4 more hours.    
        -Low and slow...        

555
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:59,637
            And then we're gonna
    cool it down, thin-slice it,

556
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,305
               portion it out   
     to about a 5-ounce portion.

557
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,974
And you're re-heating           
    that in jus?                

558
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,443
                  Correct.      
 Fortify the au jus with garlic,

559
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,712
   black pepper, veggie base.   
             -Okay.             

560
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:09,447
 Put it on the line for service.
                 All right.     

561
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,148
            Now we're gonna make
          our horseradish aioli.

562
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,250
Got to have a little fat        
      on that.                  

563
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,651
        "More fat, more flavor,"
                  they say.     

564
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,852
                 All right.     
         So there's lemon juice,

565
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,854
        minced garlic...        
   -This is my kind of aioli.   

566
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:19,657
         ...Dijon mustard, salt.

567
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,925
Prepared horseradish,           
       got it.                  

568
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:23,394
    ...a couple eggs, then we're
           gonna get them going.

569
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,595
        We're gonna add the oil.

570
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,597
           Slow pour is critical
         for the emulsification.

571
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,999
I'm being hypnotized.           

572
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,333
        And then we're gonna add
               a little water.  

573
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,135
      We can get the consistency
              where we want it, 

574
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,671
      and we got our horseradish
             aioli ready to go. 

575
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,806
Mm, nice little tang,           
good amount of garlic.          

576
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,408
     Let's make                 
that sandwich, homes.           

577
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,944
   Go from the jus              
 onto the flattop...            

578
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,279
           Cover it with cheese.

579
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:44,748
           Let that cheese melt,
             horseradish aioli. 

580
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,418
     I like it.                 

581
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,753
             We got our sandwich
              all finished up.  

582
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:51,589
         Get it nice and toasty,
      the au jus we just made...

583
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:54,958
               ...finishing up  
             with a little tots.

584
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,560
       Not shy                  
on the tots, are we?            

585
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,729
           And we're good to go.

586
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,300
I think what I really like      
      about it                  

587
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,368
is its bread/meat ratio.        

588
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:08,572
The jus has got a good          
 little tang to it,             

589
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:09,773
good crust on the bread.        

590
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,241
The bread is actually           
   super critical               

591
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,511
because it's got to be able     
to really soak it up.           

592
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,579
  I want that big,              
      wet bite.                 

593
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,680
              You don't want it 
            falling apart on you

594
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,048
           after it soaks it up,
                   either.      

595
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,385
  That is the key.              

596
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,920
   Look, squirrel!              

597
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,456
                     ♪♪         

598
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,924
Chef, nicely done, huh?         

599
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,393
                   EMILY:       
     And the beef dip with tots.

600
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,262
   The beef dip is incredible,  

601
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:33,264
and when you dip into the sauce,
          it's perfect.         

602
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,465
         This is Mandy.         

603
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,733
 She is one of our lead cameras 
         on "Triple G,"         

604
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,469
     and her friend, Keith.     
  What do you think of the dip? 

605
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:41,672
     I love the dip and the fact
    that they toasted the bread.

606
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,341
        People don't give       
     the bread enough love,     

607
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:44,609
  and these guys are doing it?  
              -Yes.             

608
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:46,010
  Tavern burger, to the window. 

609
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,277
  It's our home away from home. 

610
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,546
You do what people like,        
give them the consistency,      

611
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:50,547
take care of business.          

612
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,082
      Well done, my friend.     
           -Thank you.          

613
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,551
Watch out for that guy.         

614
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,754
    That's it for this week,    
      but don't you worry.      

615
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,490
 I'll be looking for more joints
     all over this country.     

616
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:03,561
    I'll see you next week on   
  "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."  

617
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:07,365
   I'm here at the Great Wall   
            of China.           

618
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:08,565
  Actually, I got to be honest, 

619
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,368
           I'm here in          
 Seattle, Washington, in the... 

620
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,237
         That was good.         

621
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,306
    If this is some sick way    
      to make me exercise,      

622
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,374
  I'm really not happy with it.
