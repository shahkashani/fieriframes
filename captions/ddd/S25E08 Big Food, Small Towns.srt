          Fill it up with water.

336
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,558
      How long we gonna let that
               cook down for?   

337
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,160
  6, 7 hours until              
all that collagen breaks down.  

338
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,628
                 Strain it.     
  Yes, sir.                     

339
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,829
       And that's the foundation
              of all the gravy? 
 Yes.                           

340
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,097
                 I love it.     

341
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,966
         I mean, that's doing it
       old-school the right way.

342
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,367
Some butter.                    
         Small amount of butter.

343
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,435
 Little bit.                    
                 Build the roux.

344
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,170
I'm gonna add some more         
of the roasted mirepoix.        

345
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,839
Put some flour in there.        

346
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,239
  We cook the flour             
for a couple of minutes,        

347
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,042
    then we go in               
   with our stock.              

348
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,376
              Little demiglace. 

349
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,711
Homemade tomato sauce.          

350
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,046
Do one spoon of beef base,      

351
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,380
  just to amp it up             
    a little bit.               

352
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,583
   Now we got some              
  ground prime rib              

353
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,050
and some flat-leaf parsley.     

354
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,053
           Okay, so you let that
        sit there and cook down,

355
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,921
             and then later take
    the immersion blender to it?

356
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,456
Yes, sir.                       
             And this will go...

357
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,258
      Right on                  
the Mile High Meatloaf.         
                         Got it.

358
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,260
              All right, Chef.  
    Make the magic happen, baby.

359
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,661
 We got our meatloaf            
     seared off.                

360
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,396
 We're gonna go down            
  with a nice scoop             

361
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,065
of our roasted garlic mash.     

362
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,934
One piece of meatloaf,          
another scoop of mash.          

363
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,202
       I get the Mile High thing
                 now, Chef.     

364
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,138
  We're gonna go on             
   with our gravy.              

365
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,005
         Don't be shy with that.

366
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,473
  A little frizzle.             

367
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,275
Some of our veg mix.            

368
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,542
             Start at the knee. 

369
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:19,744
     [ Laughs ]                 

370
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,012
               The thing that   
           impressed me the most

371
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,347
          has been the prime rib
               into the gravy.  

372
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,416
Oh, thank you.                  
                         Wow.   

373
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,751
               Mashed potatoes  
                are spot-on.    

374
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:27,952
         The meatloaf is tender.

375
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:29,687
         You definitely get some
        of that Italian sausage.

376
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,489
  Love the little caramelization
                you put on it   

377
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:32,891
             when you finish it 
              on the flat top.  

378
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:36,895
               This is tender.  
               This is juicy.   

379
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,697
               Oh! Look at me.  
         I can't stop eating it.

380
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,098
             Well done, brother.
Thank you, man.                 

381
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,232
             That's good stuff. 

382
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,633
  Pick up, Mile High Meatloaf.  

383
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,303
      When you take a bite,     
 you get the best of everything.

384
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,172
   Just the way you want it --  
          just perfect.         

385
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:50,108
    I love Vincentown because   
    of the family atmosphere.   

386
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,242
             FIERI:             
 Something that's been important

387
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,711
     since Demetrios started    
     working here as a kid,     

388
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,313
     when his dad and uncles    
        owned the place.        

389
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,781
  Did your dad know             
 that you bought it,            

390
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,382
or had your dad passed?         
                      He passed.

391
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,118
    He's the guy                
  in the blue suit?             
                        Yep.    

392
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,586
Oh, he's happy, man.            

393
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,454
He's got to be proud            
that his kid's taken over...    

394
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,256
           ...and that          
    he's back in the booths,    

395
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,859
   serving up creative twists   
       on diner classics.       

396
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,527
            Pick up,            
  two apple pie French toasts.  

397
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,729
      Breakfast or dinner,      
     that's the dish for me.    

398
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,531
       Melt-in-your-mouth       
           delicious.           

399
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,665
              All right, Chef.  
                  Next up?      

400
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:15,800
  We're gonna make              
    our apple mix               

401
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,402
  for the apple pie             
    French toast.               

402
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,671
Start with some apple juice     
  and brown sugar,              

403
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,272
cinnamon sticks.                
           A little "thinnamon."

404
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:22,740
             What type of apple?
 Fuji.                          

405
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,609
We're gonna let this cook down  
about 10, 15 minutes,           

406
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,411
  until the apples              
 are nice and soft.             

407
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,945
          Okay, up next, Chef...

408
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,348
We got the salted caramel       
for the apple pie French toast. 
                         Get it.

409
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,816
A little bit of water,          
     some sugar.                

410
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:34,218
  This is gonna go              
until the sugar caramelizes.    
                         Got it.

411
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,755
Then we're gonna go in          
with butter, heavy cream.       

412
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,289
             And then to make it
              salted caramel... 

413
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,824
  We add some salt.             
     That's it.                 

414
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,894
               Oh, see, that's  
       the right amount of salt.

415
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,429
             -Yeah.             
     -Mmm. That's dynamite.     

416
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,164
            I don't like sweets,
      but I like salted caramel.

417
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,500
         And the French toast --
             how we making that?

418
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:50,168
      Make our                  
French toast batter.            

419
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,970
Get a thick-sliced white bread  
we get from a local bakery.     
                         Got it.

420
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:53,838
Cook it on our flat top.        

421
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,972
                 We did it.     

422
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,241
One layer of French toast.      

423
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:57,642
       Pile on                  
those cooked-down apples.       

424
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:00,644
Another French toast.           
Another pile of apples.         

425
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,114
One more French toast.          
Some apples for good luck.      

426
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,849
                Those apples    
            really do cook down.

427
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:05,984
               Salted caramel.  

428
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,852
               Is this dessert  
                or breakfast?   

429
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,387
Uh, whichever you prefer.       

430
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,456
  Gonna hit it with             
a little pinch of the crumble.  

431
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,924
    We'll finish                
with some whipped cream.        

432
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,793
   There you go --              
apple pie French toast.         

433
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,527
             All right, so I got
           to call my son Ryder.

434
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,997
                  Ryder is      
      a French toast aficionado.

435
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,265
                 Here he is.    

436
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:24,068
Ryder, I want you to take a look
         at this French toast --

437
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,403
             cinnamon and apples

438
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,672
             with caramel sauce 
             and whipped cream. 

439
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:28,940
           Okay, wow.           

440
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,775
             I'm gonna give you 
  a bite of it right now. Ready?

441
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,479
               How'd it taste?  

442
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,513
                 [ Laughs ]     

443
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,417
                    Yeah.       
       It's like a wedding cake.
