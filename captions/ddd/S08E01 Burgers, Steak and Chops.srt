193
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,263
 I WAS WORKING AT A RESTAURANT, 
  AND WE DECIDED TO GO FOR IT.  

194
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,131
TABLE TWO'S OUT.                

195
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:50,001
I DIDN'T WANT TO WASTE MY       
EXPERIENCE IN FINE DINING.      
    <i> SO HE BROUGHT IT HERE.</i>

       AND A GRILLED ARTICHOKE. 

198
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,807
   I TRY TO MAKE EVERYTHING AS  
  CLOSE TO SCRATCH AS POSSIBLE. 

199
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,210
                        PICK UP!
   <i> LIKE THIS HEAVY HITTER...</i>   

200
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:01,546
 THE PORKCHOPS                  
ARE TO DIE FOR.                 
          <i> DOUBLE-CUT</i>           
     <i> WITH APRICOT RELISH.</i>      

201
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,816
 JUST WHAT I EXPECTED WHEN I SAW
     THE TEE OFF BAR & GRILL.   
YEAH.                           

202
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:08,019
OHH, I BET YOU THEY HAVE A GREAT
  DOUBLE-CUT PORKCHOP IN THERE. 

203
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,689
                  SO WE GOT     
             THE FULL LOIN HERE.
BASICALLY, I JUST               
GO DOWN THE BONE.               

204
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,691
     YOU ACTUALLY TAKE THE TIME 
          TO BUTCHER DOWN.      

205
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,959
    YOU GOTTA GET DIRTY.        
YOU GOTTA GET YOUR HANDS WET.   

206
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:18,363
             I DIG IT, BROTHER. 
           YOU HAVE ME AT HELLO.
  WANT TO GET                   
A NICE FAT CHOP.                

207
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,365
               LOOK AT THE SIZE 
               OF THAT MONSTER. 

208
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,834
          A DOUBLE-CUT CHOP BONE
             IS IN THE CENTER.  

209
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,304
    YOU BASICALLY GOT TWO CHOPS,
         BUT WITH ONE BONE.     
PRETTY MUCH.                    

210
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,507
        WE'RE GONNA BRINE THESE?
YEAH, EQUAL PARTS               
   SALT, SUGAR,                 

211
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,909
 DISSOLVE IT IN HOT WATER,      
AND JUST ADD PICKLING SPICE.    
                YOU GOTTA LET IT

212
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:33,311
       COOL DOWN A LITTLE BEFORE
        YOU PUT THE PORK IN IT. 

213
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,513
      WHEN IT GETS TO ROOM      
 TEMPERATURE, THEN WE'LL PUT IT 

214
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:38,449
                ON THE PORKCHOP.
 POUR IT IN THERE, STICK IT     
IN THE FRIDGE AND LET IT SIT.   

215
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,785
           NOW HOW LONG WILL YOU
              LET THIS GO FOR?  
    I USUALLY                   
SOAK IT OVERNIGHT.              

216
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,921
   WE'LL MAKE THE APRICOT RELISH
       WHILE THAT'S BRINING.    
YEAH.                           

217
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,923
           DIG IT. I LIKE YOUR  
         MIXING BOWL SETUP HERE.

218
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:47,058
          WE'RE GONNA MIX IT ALL
                INTO THIS?      
PRETTY MUCH.                    

219
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,260
OKAY, WE GOT SOME ONION,        
UH, GREEN BELL PEPPERS,         

220
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,930
     A LITTLE                   
RED BELL PEPPERS.               
            I'LL JUST KEEP DOING
              THE CLEANUP HERE. 

221
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:55,000
THANK YOU.                      
                TOMATOES. I LIKE
               THE APRICOT IDEA.

222
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:57,669
THANK YOU.                      
           I'M A GOOD SOUS-CHEF.

223
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:00,738
      I DUMP IN                 
SOME RED WINE VINEGAR.          
               A LITTLE SALT.   
           THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE.

224
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,874
JUST LET THAT REST              
   FOR A WHILE.                 

225
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,276
            THE LONGER IT GOES, 
          THE MORE IT MACERATES.
THE BETTER IT GETS.             

226
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,278
                 SO BRINE CHOP, 
                ACHIOTE PASTE...
SPRINKLE IT IN THERE.           

227
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:08,880
                   A LITTLE OIL.
YEP.                            

228

THERE YOU GO.                   

229
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,317
                  JUST THROW    
             THAT CHOP RIGHT IN.
I LET THE CHOP                  
 DO THE WORK.                   

230
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,353
           IT BECOMES YOUR      
     MORTAR, PESTLE RIGHT THERE.
EXACTLY.                        

231
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,689
    BRINING IT WASN'T ENOUGH.   
IT'S LIKE A BARBECUE AT THE U.N.
EXACTLY.                        

232
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,959
 LOOK AT THAT. THERE'S GONNA BE 
  SOME DYNAMITE COLOR ON THERE. 

233
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:23,628
       OH, YEAH. I GIVE IT      
  THE CRISSCROSS ON BOTH SIDES. 

234
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,965
        I LIKE THE WAY YOU ROLL.
           SEVEN, TEN MINUTES.  
SEVEN, TEN MINUTES.             

235
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,967
OHH!                            
              I SERVE IT WITH   
          DEEP-FRIED SWEET CORN.

236
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:32,169
        NO! THAT'S A NEW ONE.   
    HOW LONG'S THAT GONNA PARTY?
WE'RE AT THREE MINUTES.         

237
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,372
                    THIS IS ODD.
ODD?                            

238
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,042
         YEAH, VERY STRANGE.    
    I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE.
   TO BURN SOME                 
OF THE EXCESS OIL               

239
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:39,644
    OFF IT, I THROW IT          
ON THE GRILL RIGHT BEFORE.      
            A LITTLE CHAR ON IT.

240
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,646
   THEN IT GOES WITH            
GARLIC MASHED POTATOES,         

241
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,181
GRILLED ASPARAGUS,              
 GRILLED APRICOTS               

242
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,116
   TO ACCOMPANY                 
THE APRICOT RELISH.             

243
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,919
 OKAY, SO THEY'RE BLANCHED OFF. 
A LITTLE LEMON JUICE? I LIKE IT.

244
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,321
PUT A LITTLE SALT ON THERE,     
 A LITTLE CRACKED PEPPER.       

245
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,323
     WE'RE READY TO THROW       
THE GARLIC MASHED POTATOES DOWN 

246
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,125
AND PLATE IT UP.                
                           NICE.

247
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,194
SMALL PORTIONS HERE             
    AT TEE OFF.                 

248
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,263
       ASPARAGUS, AND THEN THIS,
         THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.   

249
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:02,601
SO JUST WHEN I GOT DONE         
     SHOOTING 175               

250
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:06,137
       OVER ON THE 9-HOLE,      
 I DIDN'T EXPECT I'D FIND THIS. 

251
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:09,007
 LOOK AT THAT--NICE MEDIUM-RARE 
        ON THAT BAD BOY.        

252
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,542
   DUDE, THAT IS                
SOME PRECIOUS PORK.             

253
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,544
    WOW, IT'S                   
COOKED PERFECTLY.               

254
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,748
A LITTLE BIT OF THAT SALSA      
ON TOP OF THAT. MMM, MMM!       

255
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,150
THAT ACHIOTE RUB                
 ON THE OUTSIDE                 

256
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:21,352
GIVES A LITTLE SPIKE            
OF SOME PEPPER TO IT.           

257
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,621
                           YEAH.

THE TEXTURE.

      FRIED CORN LIKE THIS,     

260
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,360
BUT I LIKE IT.

OF THE BEST CHOPS I'VE EVER HAD.

                   POUR ALL THIS
                  INTO OUR MEAT.

414
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,800

THE SEASONINGS MIXED IN,        

417
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,807

THEN WE START TO CASE IT.       

418

           WE FUNNEL THIS OUT,  
         WE CUT 'EM INTO PIECES.

422
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,284

00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:33,110
AND RED PEPPER.                 
             THIS CAME FROM TOM?

459
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,980
    THIS IS ACTUALLY            
T-BONE'S FATHER'S RECIPE.       

460
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,382
   SO YOU MIX THIS UP, AND THEN 
    WE'RE JUST GONNA RUB THIS.  

461
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:41,118
RUB THAT SIDE.                  
FLIP THAT OVER.                 

462
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,187
                  AND THAT'S IT?
THAT'S IT.                      

463
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:45,656
      SO NOW HOW LONG'S IT GONNA
         GO IN THE SMOKER FOR?  

464
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,058
   ABOUT 16 HOURS,              
BETWEEN 165 AND 175.            

465
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,461
               LOWER AND SLOWER.
     YEAH, IT'S                 
GONNA BE REAL TENDER.           

466
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,331
             WHOA! LOOK AT THAT.
             THAT IS BEAUTIFUL. 

467
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,801
   LOOK AT HOW THE FAT ON TOP   
 OF THIS IS ALMOST INTO LIQUID. 

468
00:18:56,936 --> 00:19:00,204
 'CAUSE ALL THAT FAT HAS BASTED 
   THAT MEAT WHILE IT COOKED.   

469
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,740
    OH, OH! YOU GONNA BREAK THIS
          ALL THE WAY DOWN?     
YEAH.

00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:05,742
         WELL, GIVE ME--JUST    
    GET INTO IT, DOCTOR, DOCTOR.
OKAY.

                     WHOA, OH.  
                   LOOK AT THAT.
ISN'T THAT PRETTY?              

472
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:11,081
               LIKE A FINE WINE.
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

473

            RIGHT THERE. MMM.

        BUT NOT OVERBEARING.    

475
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,455
          THE FAT IN THE MEAT,  
         THAT'S JUST GONNA MELT.

476
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,691
          MMM. IT DOESN'T GET   
      ANY MORE TENDER THAN THAT.
NO.                             

477
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,093
            BUT I DON'T WANT    
         TO FILL UP ON ALL THIS,

478
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,495
