1
00:00:01,736 --> 00:00:03,469
I'm Guy Fieri, and we're rolling
    out on a special edition    

2
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:06,872
     of "Diners, Drive-Ins,     
     and Dives" in Hawaii.      

3
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:08,206
          This trip...          

4
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,942
                        Oh, no. 
      Oh, no.                   

5
00:00:09,944 --> 00:00:12,811
        ...we're cruising       
     around Oahu, Hawaii...     

6
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:16,448
Wow.                            
       ...for a tasty tour      
        of island flavor.       

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,750
Soon as I do this,              
nine buttons are gonna          
break off this shirt.           

8
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,452
      First, at Kaneohe...      

9
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,888
      Have a fish just like that
               in my aquarium.  

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,023
  ...a drive-in that comes off  
          as casual...          

11
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,159
       He's a butchering madman.

12
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:30,028
      ...but is busting out     
        gourmet goodness.       

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,362
Fine dining in Styrofoam.       

14
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,298
           Then a walk          
       on the wild side...      

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,301
        Are you a friendly bear?
        Yeah,                   
but like gangster one.          

16
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:37,769
                Like, "Raar."   

17
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,239
      ...at a joint mixing      
          Hawaiian favs         

18
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:41,974
    with international flair.   

19
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:44,376
        Give you the wham, bam, 
     and the "thank you, ma'am."

20
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,179
   Plus, a family-run hangout   
          in Waipahu...         

21
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:48,847
 Look at this, dude.            

22
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:51,450
       ...with a different      
          island style.         

23
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:53,385
      Where's Filipino food been
                all my life?    

24
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,521
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

25
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:57,589
    on "Triple D" in Hawaii.    

28
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:15,940
  So, this is the first stop on 
 the Great Hawaiian Island Tour.

29
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,944
      Now, I'm in Kaneohe,      
right on the Kamehameha Highway.

30
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,345
  I love coming to this island. 

31
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:22,481
         I've had great         
  "Triple D" joints. Let's see. 

32
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:24,282
     Fresh Catch, Opal Thai,    

33
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,351
       Rainbow Drive-In --      
            Drive-in?           

34
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:29,087
   You know when I hear that,   
 I got to stop and check it out.

35
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,489
    This is Dean's Drive Inn.   

36
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,229
  Dean's has probably the best  
    local food I've ever had.   

37
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,897
   They always got fresh fish.  

38
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,099
              MAN:              
   It tastes like they belong   

39
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,467
  in some five-star restaurant  
           in Waikiki.          

40
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,103
      FIERI: That's because     
owner Dean Mishima brought along

41
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:49,775
   40 years of experience when  
he opened his own place in 2006.

42
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,844
   Teri beef steak              
and boneless short-rib cutlet.  

43
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,846
       And he's keeping it      
          in the family         

44
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,381
        with wife Doreen        
        running the front       

45
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,850
and daughter Melissa helping out
          in the back.          

46
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,119
        DEAN:                   
Beef cutlet, coming up.         

47
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:05,457
      And Dean's cooking up     
         casual gourmet         

48
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,392
          with a style          
     I'm definitely digging.    

49
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:08,860
         I like the bleach, man.

50
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:12,197
    And the locals are liking   
     what Dean's serving up.    

51
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,265
    This is a ginger soy ono.   

52
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,135
   FIERI: Ono -- that would be  
 the popular Hawaiian whitefish,

53
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,404
          a.k.a. wahoo.         

54
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,039
        It's really nice.       
           It's fresh.          

55
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,210
                   Oh, no.      
  Oh, no.                       

56
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,012
[ Chuckles ]                    
             Oh, no. All right. 

57
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,147
   You know how to butcher fish,
                 I take it.     

58
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,149
I know how to butcher           
        fish.                   
                  I'm impressed.

59
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,285
  Now we're gonna portion it up,
                  grill it.     

60
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:38,423
  Grill it, put on              
a nice soy ginger sauce.        

61
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,359
                 All right.     

62
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:41,760
   First, ginger.               
                         Okay.  

63
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,161
       Garlic.                  

64
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,429
    Green onion.                

65
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,630
    Black pepper.               

66
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,898
        Salt.                   

67
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,100
                 Here we go.    

68
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,702
       [ Motor whirring ]       

69
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,572
             You're gonna kill  
             that little thing. 
Kill that thing!                

70
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,709
                 All right.     

71
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,445
Now we're gonna top it off      
with this hot oil here.         

72
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:03,649
                           Okay.
Bring out the flavor.           

73
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,250
           So, it doesn't really
                  cook it.      

74
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,852
      It just kind of opens it, 
     get the real perfume of it.
Yeah.                           

75
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,921
         Now we grill the fish, 
      and that goes on the fish.

76
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:10,989
    Right.                      
                         Dig it.

77
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,592
I'm gonna be dusting it         
with a little flour.            

78
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:15,928
                   Okay, ono.   
   Ono, ono.                    

79
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,763
     Grilling it                
 to a golden brown.             

80
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,733
              What temperature  
           do you serve that at?

81
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,535
       Medium.                  

82
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,204
     All right.                 

83
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,739
     Soy sauce.                 

84
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,008
    There we go.                

85
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,909
                    Wow.        

86
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,086
 That's ridiculous flavor, Chef.
                 Ridiculous.    

87
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,387
         Little bit of ginger...

88
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,558
               ...green onion,  
                 little soy.    

89
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,963
              Simply prepared,  
              simply seasoned,  

90
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,865
             simply outrageous. 

91
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,204
                Outstanding.    

92
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,443
     It's got a light taste     
           of ginger.           

93
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:07,312
      MAN: Not too strong,      
     and it's not too mild.     

94
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,780
        It's just right.        

95
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,181
 How do you explain             
 Dean's Drive Inn?              

96
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,449
              It's fine dining. 

97
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,851
 Just in Styrofoam.             
                       Oh, yeah.

98
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,052
   Favorite thing               
    on the menu.                

99
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:17,155
          By far, the ahi cakes.
                 Hands down.    

100
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,525
    I have a fish just like that
               in my aquarium.  

101
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,794
              What fish is this?
It's a yellowfin tuna.          

102
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:23,662
                    Wow.        

103

        Boy, you get after this.

104
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:29,801
                Look at that.   

105
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,136
               It's gorgeous.   

106
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:34,272
      Okay. Now we're gonna make
                 the cakes.     
   Right.                       

107
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,807
Put in some of these onions,

green onions, black pepper.

             Black pepper, okay.
     Soy sauce,                 
  put in your eggs.             

110
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,749
All-purpose flour.              
                      All of it?

111
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,950
  All of it.                    
                          Okay. 

112
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,886
                  And mix it up.
And mix it.                     

113
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,355
Massage this fish.              
        You're gonna massage it.

00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:51,889
That's why it tastes            
      so good.                  

115
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,291
                 Just enough    
            to bind it together.

116
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,360
   All right, let's make a cake,
                    baby.       
 Okay.                          

117
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:58,830
  And we serve this medium rare 
  or cooked all the way through?

118
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:01,833
    Golden brown                
   on both sides.               

119
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:02,968
     All right.                 

120
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:10,008
Greek chili aioli sauce.        

121
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,644
     All right.                 

122
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,881
             Your little garnish
                is beautiful.   

123
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,451
                 Well, Chef,    
         your flavors are great.

124
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:20,718
        And butchering the tuna,

125
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,987
using all the parts of the fish,
              very impressive.  

126
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,589
               Nice job, Chef.  
                 Thank you.     

127
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,394
    The ahi cakes are moist.    

128
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,129
There's a little crunch in them.

129
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:33,331
           To die for.          
    It's really, really good.   

130
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,900
       What else you got for me?
Broiled teriyaki beef.          

131
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,002
        Teriyaki beef --        
        it is wonderful.        

132
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,138
     It's got great flavor.     
                All right, then.

133
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,007
  Let's make some teriyaki beef.
All right.                      

134

    FIERI: When we come back.

   "Triple D's" hanging loose   

136
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,986
      on the island of Oahu     
      at Dean's Drive Inn.      

137
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,922
    But don't judge the food    
      by its Styrofoam box.     

138
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:01,325
  This chef's putting high-end  
       into his Hawaiian.       

139
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,561
     Just really good food.     

140
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,398
              All right, Chef,  
     now what are we gonna make?

141
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,866
  We're gonna make              
a broiled beef teriyaki.        

142
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,134
You know what I'm using here    
is a bottom sirloin.            

143
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,602
                 Delicious.     
                Great flavor.   

144
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,272
   Just got to cook it the right
   way and cut it the right way.

145
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:15,941
       Mm-hmm.                  

146
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:18,009
         He's butchering madman.

147
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,479
              So, tenderize it  
                a little bit.   

148
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:24,082
Now stack it up, and we're gonna
             make the marinade. 
Exactly.                        

149
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,885
All right, we'll be doing       
some teriyaki sauce.            

150
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,453
     Soy sauce.                 

151
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,490
       Sugar.                   

152
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:32,824
       Water.                   

153
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:36,160
Ginger and some garlic.         
       Ginger, garlic -- got it.

154
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,030
 Just gonna pour that right over
        the beef and that's it. 
Pour it right over the beef.    

155
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,566
          And how long will that
                  marinate?     
Marinate it overnight.          

156
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,774
Okay, this is the teri beef     
that I just cut and marinated.  

157
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,110
     Cook it up                 
about medium, medium rare.      

158
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,711
             Ready to go, Chef? 
Ready.                          

159
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:57,416

That's right.                   

160
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:05,122
               And what's that  
          that's going on there?
It's a teriyaki sauce.          

161
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,792
      Garnish.                  

162
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:11,930
                   That is      
         so ridiculously tender.

163
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:15,667
  Top-selling item.

               I can see why.   

165
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:21,807
               Great texture,   
               super-tender,    

166
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,875
                 little bit     
             on the sweet side. 

167
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,812

Thank you.

      is great.

                 Well done.

 That's it.                     

223
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,118
            But we're gonna make
             a red curry sauce. 
   Yeah.                        

224
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,988
So, I'm gonna start off         
by sautéing this red curry.     

225
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,058
Hit it with some fish sauce     
     real quick.                

226
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,929
Some lemon juice, brown sugar,  
    coconut milk.               
                           Okay.

227
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,731
I'll bring it up to a boil.     

228
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,932
We're gonna hit it with         
a cornstarch slurry to          
thicken it up a little bit.     

229
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,668
             And the ice is for?

230
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,603
   To cool it down              
   and to bring it              

231
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,138
 to that consistency            
    that we want.               

232
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,208
       Gives you the wham, bam, 
     and the "thank you, ma'am."

233
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,744
                    Okay.       
             Green papaya salad.

234
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,012
That is gonna top the hebi.     

235
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,814
So, we're gonna grate           
 this green papaya.             

236
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:19,484
             The texture in this
                 is crunchy.    

237
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,019
          Little green-appleish.

238
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:23,121
Gonna get all the green papaya  
      in here.                  

239
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,757
Tomato, grated carrot,          

240
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,759
  red bell pepper,              
      cilantro.                 

241
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:32,097
And now we're gonna dress this  
  with fish sauce.              

242
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,364
                    Lemon juice.
 Lemon juice.                   

243
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,366
Brown sugar, equal parts.       

244
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,102
Now we're gonna whisk that      
      together.                 

245
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,772

246
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:44,109

Yes, it is.                     

247
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,443
                     Oh!        

248
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,645
               That is exactly  
   how it's supposed to be done.

249
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,249
So, we're just gonna take       
a little portion of this hebi,  

250
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,117
just get a little salt          
      on there.                 

251
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,786
And then we're gonna            
slap it on the grill.           

252
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:59,190
I like to cook it just to where 
it's not quite done,            

253
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,591
  a little bit pink             
   in the middle.               

254
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,060
 So, now we're just             
 gonna plate it up.             

255
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,595
     You can get                
  brown rice here.              

256
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:04,996
       I'm a big brown-rice fan.

257
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,232

       a green-papaya-salad fan.

                 all of it.     

260

I'm just gonna get it           
 right on the rice.             

261
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,739
 We're gonna top it             
 with our red curry             

262
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,273
that we've brought back up      
   to temperature.              

263
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:20,045
   And that is it.              

264
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:31,422
             I just got the acid
             of the vinaigrette,

265
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,957
          sweetness of the fish.

266

267
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:39,230
       The richness of the curry
       but the char of the fish.

268
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:43,234
      It's what really gives it 
     this -- this island flavor.

269
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:46,237
            Really outstanding. 
    This will be one I remember.
Awesome, man.                   

270
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:49,507
   Every bite just gets soaked  
         in the flavor.

      Gourmet plate lunch.      

272

    The fish is fresh-caught,

          with a twist.         

276
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,387
Got a mandarin duck confit      
     coming out.                

277
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,722
      The orange glaze adds     
   that extra little sweetness  

278
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,791
     and oomph to the dish.     

279
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,326
So, we're gonna take            
   our duck legs,               

280
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,727
  arrange them here             
    in this pan.                

281
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,996
    So, we are going to flat-out
                confit this.    

282
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,532
          Now, is this duck fat 
          from other confitings?

283
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,668
This is rendered duck fat       
from other confitings.          

284
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,936
                 Confitings.    

285
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,871
We're just gonna cover this.    

286
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,674
Get some star anise in there.   
It's the star of the show.

291
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,419
Now we're making the orange     
glaze for the duck confit.      
                           Okay.

292
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:40,024
Orange juice, rice vinegar,     

293
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:44,829
 shoyu, star anise,

And at this stage, we're just   
gonna incorporate the sugar,    

297
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,837
  just bring it up.

298
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,773

we're gonna glaze it down.

300
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:00,145

        here.

1 1/2 pieces of these.          

303
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,852
  I keep one whole,             
  and I shred one.              

304
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:11,055
And then we put on the flat top 
to crisp up the skin.           

305
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,556
                   Crisp it up? 
      Yeah.                     

306
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,592
     All right,                 
so the duck is crisped up.      
                          Great.

307
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,861
Again, two scoops of rice.      

308
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:19,063
Put the shredded meat...        

309
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:22,467
      And I put                 
  this whole one...             

310
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,468
              Right up on top.  

311
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,403
   And from here,               
I'm gonna get our choy sum,

314
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:31,342
       And last but not least...
We got our orange glaze.        

315
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:34,279
 Just get the glaze             
all over the plate, there.      

316
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,287
            A lot of star anise,
                  which...      

317
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,690
        has great flavor itself.

318
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:49,560
           But it's much deeper 
          and much more complex.

319
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:50,829
                The way this    
              has come together 

320
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,664
               with the glaze   
    that you put on top of it...

321
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,100
       You got the right balance
                of the sugar.

             FIERI:             
 Up next, one more Oahu stop... 

331
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,262
That was just awesome.          

332
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:25,463
         ...in Waipahu.         

333
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,665
    A joint going hog wild...   

334
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:28,933
               You got a party  
               in your mouth.   

335
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:31,803
    ...with an out-of-bounds    
         pork trifecta.         

336

Fried chicharrón and a rib      
and baked at the same time.     

337
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:47,351
    So, here's the final stop   

338
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,288
 on this awesome Hawaiian Island
        "Triple D" tour.        

339
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,491
  Now, I'm about 10 miles west  
      of downtown Honolulu      

340
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,093
  in an area known as Waipahu.  

341
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,226
    Huge Filipino community.    

342
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,895
        And I'm thinking,       
         "You know what?        

343
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,365
      We haven't done a lot     
 of Filipino food on "Triple D."

344
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,766
    That's where my boy Reno    
   from Fresh Catch comes in.   

345
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,302
  You remember that character.  
Hyah!                           

346
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,572
  He says, "Dude, I got a joint 
      you got to check out.     

347
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,607
   The food rocks the house."   
        This is Elena's.        

348
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,547
Your fried pork is ready.       

349
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,983
I go to his restaurant,         
Fresh Catch. Why this place?    

350
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:20,118
                 This place     
           feels like home, bro.

351
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,921
     The closest I can get      
     to a home-cooked meal.     

352
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,722
             FIERI:             
 And there's a reason for that. 

353
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,057
         Let's just say         
   that owner Richard Butuyan   

354
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,994
 has a very personal connection 
    with the original owner.    

355
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,529
Who's Elena?                    
                    It's my mom.

356
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,197
  Your mom's Elena?             
                         Yes.   

357
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,867
              My mom started it.
      That was back in '74.     

358
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:38,803
 Now Richard's running the joint
    with his sister Mellissa,   

359
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:42,674
  and they're still cooking up  
    mom's Filipino favorites.

 Gisantes is ready.             

361
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,678
 How do you describe            
   Filipino food?               

362
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,746
          Uh, how do you put it?

363
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:51,683
         It's a mixture         
     of Spanish and Chinese.    
Wow.

   on this pork-on-pork feast   
    of belly and fried rice.

           Thank you.

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,559
    Love the pork, the tomatoes,
                 the onions.    

368
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,362
 Just goes perfect, hand-in-hand
              with each other.  

369
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,164
All right, so what is the first 
dish we're gonna make?          

370
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,432
              We're gonna make  
              lechon special.   

371
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:10,635
                So, we start    
            with the pork belly.

372
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,770
We're gonna cut all this        
     into cubes.                
                       Yeah.    

373
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,505
Skin on and everything?         
                        Skin on.

374
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:17,641
Okay, so these aren't cubes.    
  Those are chunks.             
                   Chunks, yeah.

375
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,911
            Gonna boil it first.
Boil it away.                   

376
00:16:19,913 --> 00:16:22,113
So, where are we now?           

377
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,048
      We're gonna make some pork
      with a little fried rice. 

378
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,250
    Pork adobo.

380
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:31,089
           Start with some rice,
                 fry it up.     

381
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,059

     And then some black pepper.

385
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,001
               Garlic powder.   

386
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,203
             Mix it up a little.

387
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,738
                  You know,     
              get the color in. 

388
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,807
             Now we're gonna add
              some pork adobo.  

389
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,342
And what does the "adobo"       
        mean?

00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,046

                Mash it down.   

391

   Now we're done               
     with this?                 

392
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,950

Great.

 That's not a dish?             

394
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:06,957
          Yeah, we're gonna add 
     the lechon special to that.
All right.                      

395
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,027
               The pork belly.  

396
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,031
Now we're gonna deep-fry        
        this?                   
                           Yes. 

397

             a pickled ong choy.

439
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,942
Pickled ong choy.               
               For a side dish  
             for the fried pork.

440
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,677
  What is ong choy?             

441
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:09,413
                 In English,    
             it's water spinach.

442
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,282
            We're only gonna use
                 the stems.     

443
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,816
    You don't use               
     the leaves?                

444
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,552
                     No.        
        That's for another dish.

445
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,654
          And we just cut it up.

446
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,959
       Here, so we're gonna make
                the marinade.   
 Okay.                          

447
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:25,429
      We're gonna start off with
      onions, some fresh garlic,

448
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,965
               garlic powder,   
             some black pepper, 

449
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:31,368
         Hawaiian chili pepper, 
         and some Hawaiian salt.

450
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,437
   And we're gonna finish it off
             with some vinegar. 

451
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,111
               This marinates   
               for a few days.  

452
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:41,912
    And that goes               
with the fried pork.            

453
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,781
        I cook it in the skillet

454
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,717
             'cause if I put it 
             in the deep-fryer, 

455
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,820
            it's gonna get hard,
              like pork jerky.  

456
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,027
       Cut it up while it's hot.

457
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,798
 Look at this, dude.            

458
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,936
     Outrageous.                
   Lots of flavor.              

459
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,705
Little vinegar sauce.           

460
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:12,476
       This is                  
what really makes it.           

461
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:13,678
                    Ong choy.   
   Ong choy.                    

462
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,746
Little bit of vinegar,          
 little bit of heat,            

463
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:18,682
little bit of crunch,           
little veggie piece to it.      

464
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:22,152
Your mom's out of bounds,       
        bro.                    
                    [ Chuckles ]

465
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,155
      Elena.                    
                    Elena.      

466
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:25,856
   Congrats, man.               
     Very tasty.                

467
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,627
 That vinegar just bites at you.

468
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:31,762
              I got to tell you 
                 something,     

469
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,297
      where's Filipino food been
                all my life?    

470
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,366
This is where it's at.          

471
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,167
I know why Reno said,           
"Come check it out."            

472
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,235
It's the real deal, man.        

473
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,737
                 All right, man.
Thanks, brother.                

474
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,373
  So, that's it for this trip!  

475
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,710
   And don't worry -- there's   
  plenty more "Triple D" joints 

476
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:47,110
      all over the country!     

477
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,512

            next week

           and Dives."          

479
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:52,917
                   This is      
             a really nice one. 

480

   That's Randall.

      Randall.                  

482

    Yeah.

               has no handle.   

484
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,157
  Exactly.
