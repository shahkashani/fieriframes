1
00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:02,267
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,736
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:07,139
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:08,673
          This trip...          
               [ Clicks tongue ]

5
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,342
 ...it's full-on meat madness...
Get out of here.                

6
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,212
     ...with some crazy cuts    
         to choose from.        

7
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:14,480
  It's outrageous.              

8
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:15,747
         In Baltimore...        

9
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,015
    Look at that!               

10
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,084
          A chef mixing         
    it up with pork belly...    

11
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:20,218
Ah, that's gonna be good.       

12
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,888
      ...while sliding out      
       the bomb wild boar.      

13
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,756
It's no namby-pamby slider      
    right there.                

14
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,024
     In Washington, D.C....     

15
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,093
    Oh, my gosh.                

16
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:30,695
        ...a spot carving       
    up lights-out pastrami...   

17
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,564
               I want to live   
               by this place.   

18
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,833
       ...and rolling' out      
       righteous chorizo.       

19
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,102
Man, when you say "chorizo,"    
  you mean chorizo.             

20
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,303
        Whoa.                   

21
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:40,572
     Plus, a Jamaican joint     
     in Colorado Springs...     

22
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,440
  I can hear reggae             
 in the background.             

23
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,842
    ...Where the jerk chicken   
           is king...           

24
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:45,110
This is how you do it.          

25
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:47,179
         ...and the goat        
  is something to scream about. 

26
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:48,447
    That's good!                

27
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:50,582
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

28
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,384
         on "Triple D."         

29
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,798
       So you're in a town      
      that you're not from      

30
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,866
 and you're here to see a game. 

31
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,868
       And after the game,      
        where do you go?        

32
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,470
              Well,             
if you happen to be in Baltimore

33
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:13,605
   and you're at Camden Yards,  
        I got one for ya.       

34
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:16,141
 Three blocks north, you'll find
      a funky little place.     

35
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:17,409
  They say they're a beer bar,  

36
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,278
   but they forget to mention   
they got a scratch-made kitchen.

37
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,948
        This is Alewife.        

38
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,083
             A blue catfish taco
               in the window.   

39
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,219
  I got to say it's one of the  
 most unique and creative places

40
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:28,887
         I've ever been.        
WAITRESS: Smoked burger.        

41
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,488
            Oh, yeah.           
    WOMAN: I've tried things    

42
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,091
      that I never thought      
   I would have tried before.   

43
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:33,758
    The food is unbelievable.   

44
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,561
      FIERI: That's because     
       owner Bryan Palombo      

45
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:37,362
 knew he needed an elevated menu

46
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:41,366
to match their serious selection
        of over 90 brews.       

47
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:44,436
    And a little luck led him   
  to Executive Chef Chad Wells  

48
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,237
     when he opened in 2010.    

49
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,573
PALOMBO: He had just moved      
 back to Baltimore.             

50
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:49,841
  He needed a gig,              
and we needed a chef.           

51
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,911
       We met.                  
We clicked real quick.          

52
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,247
     WOMAN: When Chad's here    
      with his creativity,      

53
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:57,382
     it's gonna be delicious    
      no matter what I get.     

54
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,450
Pork belly mac and cheese fries.

55
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,986
              Duck fat fries -- 
                  awesome.      

56
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,721
       You can't go wrong       
        with pork belly.        

57
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:04,589
      There's just so many      
        wonderful flavors       

58
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,791
    that work together great.   

59
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,993
    Pork belly...               

60
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,594
                     Pork belly.
...mac and cheese.              

61
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,729
                 Collard greens.
Collard greens.                 

62
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,799
               Duck fat fries.  
             This is pork belly.

63
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,733
      We're gonna cube it all up
      and then sear it in a pan.

64
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,469
 Got it.                        
                Kosher salt.    

65
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,538
        And ground black pepper.
Now hit 'em with...             

66
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,006
            Chicken stock first.
   Okay.                        

67
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,608
             Plus some pale ale.

68
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,210
      And barbecue sauce that we
      make with some Citra hops.

69
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,344
     Citra hops.                

70
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,946
             This is gonna cook 
        for three to five hours.

71
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:28,880
       Dig it.                  

72
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,149
                 So this is     
             the collard greens.

73
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,817
Get it.                         
        And a little bit of oil,

74
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,485
        some diced onion, bacon.

75
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,153
Got it.                         
           Add the greens to it.

76
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,755
    Love greens.                

77
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:40,492
      Salt, apple cider vinegar,
         a lot of chicken stock.

78
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,960
Oh, it's gonna be good.         

79
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,229
  So let this work              
for a few hours, super tender?  

80
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:45,631
                  Yes, sir.     
That's all she wrote.           

81
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,633
       Next up, we're gonna bang
          out this cheese sauce.

82
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:48,700
              Let's start with  
                some butter.    

83
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:49,968
              This is Gruyère.  

84
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,636
     And then right behind that,
              Palmyra cheddar.  

85
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,904
               This is a local  
              Maryland cheddar. 

86
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,840
               Stir it around   
        and wait for it to melt.

87
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,576
        And then we're gonna add
     our flour, vegetable stock.

88
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,510
     And then we're gonna hit it
     with the immersion blender.

89
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,847
  While I'm mixing it, I'm gonna
  add some heavy whipping cream.

90
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,716
             Start pouring that 
                directly in.    

91
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,652
             We're gonna hit it 
    with some granulated garlic,

92
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:08,653
              Parmesan cheese,  
                kosher salt.    

93
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,255
     Let this go                
   for 30 minutes.              

94
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:13,592
  Next up -- just gonna add some
    noodles to our cheese sauce.

95
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:14,526
     Fire it up.                

96
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,927
                 Start with     
            some duck fat fries,

97
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,997
             our collard greens,
             our mac and cheese.

98
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,866
Rotini.                         
        Holds the cheese better.

99
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,535
     Best part -- We seared some
       of our pork belly, hit it

100
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,938
     with more hot barbecue, get
  a little bit of texture on it.

101
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,472
   Got it.                      
                Right on top.   

102
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,241
    Look at that.               

103
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,280
    Well, this is               
a very composed dish.           

104
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:38,483
    It has a lot                
 of culinary merit.             

105
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:39,817
The greens are spot-on.         

106
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,888
The rotini works perfect.       

107
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,024
Like, the cheese choice         
and a little pork belly on top. 

108
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,026
 The barbecue sauce             
 isn't overpowering.            

109
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,296
     And it eats                
like a well-balanced meal.      

110
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,231
 And duck fat fries?            
  Get out of here.              

111
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,233
If you're gonna eat a fry,      
eat one cooked in duck fat.     

112
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,568
                 Absolutely.    

113
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,570
            Got a pork belly fry
               in the window.   

114
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,838
   MAN: It was sort of amazing  
           to discover          

115
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,506
        all of the layers       
       that existed in it.      

116
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:04,576
    Duck fat fries, honestly,   
       I dream about them.      

117
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,445
              MAN:              
Chad -- always been very willing
       to push boundaries,      

118
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,249
     incorporate ingredients    
   people do not normally use.  

119
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,317
             FIERI:             
 Like finding a way to cook off 

120
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,320
 an invasive species taking over
     the Maryland ecosystem.    

121
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,788
       Snake head in the window.

122
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,924
      You have                  
got to be kidding me.           

123
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,393
 It looks horrible.             

124
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,729
They don't taste like they look.
             They're delicious. 

125
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:25,731
        But if snake head       
        isn't your thing,       

126
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:29,401
 Chad's got another tasty trick 
   up his sleeve -- wild boar.  

127
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,869
     We have a feral hog problem
           in the United States.

128
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,804
I have 'em on my ranch.         

129
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,272
I know about feral hogs.        
                            Yep.

130
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,008
    Well, you got -- You can eat
   good whenever you want, then.

131
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,277
So you're really introducing    
real-deal wild boar?            

132
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,812
                            Yes.
 Wild boar slider in the window.

133
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,415
      I like the wild boar.     
   It's got a lot more flavor   

134
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,950
      than your regular ol'     
      ground pork product.      

135
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,287
        The boar sliders        
      are always delicious.     

136
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,956
   It's sort of that Southeast  
      Asian kind of flair.      

137
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,892
Okay, so here's the ground      
     wild boar?                 

138
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:54,960
                  Yes, sir.     

139
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,496
       So we're just gonna start
                with ginger,    

140
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,564
             lot of kosher salt.
Dig it.                         

141
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:02,767
       Some fresh garlic cloves,
     chopped chives, sesame oil.

142
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,236
     All right.                 
So we'll make up a little paste?

143
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:05,270
                    Yep.        

144
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,040
            We'll mix this right
          into this ground boar.

145
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,241
      What size                 
you gonna form into?            

146
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,642
          About 3-ounce patties.

147
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,844
                  And then      
     they go right on the grill.

148
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,046
Let's do it.                    
               So we start      
             with this salad.   

149
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:15,781
     It goes on top of each one.
Okay.                           

150
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:17,916
            Some daikon sprouts,
              pickled carrots,  

151
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,384
              ginger dressing.  
 Oh, yeah.                      

152
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:22,254
     Sriracha aioli on the buns.
          A grilled boar slider.

153
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:24,322
That's no namby-pamby slider    
    right there.                

154
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,924
                   Oh, no.      
   We don't play around in here.

155
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,794
        The salad on top, little
 bit more of the Sriracha aioli.

156
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,595
And that's all she wrote.       
                            Yep.

157
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,133
The combination was built       
   to go together.              

158
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:38,403
  That boar meat --             
rich, dense, big flavor.        

159
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,605
It cut with the acid            
 of the pickled veg.            

160
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,007
Really nice, bright ginger,     

161
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,541
     little bit                 
of that daikon sprout.          

162
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,810
And then you fortify it         
with that Sriracha mayo         

163
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,079
so you get a little bit         
of that spice coming through.   

164
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,415
 Really a great way             
to use the wild boar.           

165
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,617
  I like the look.              
I like the creativity.          

166
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:53,684
 That's great, man.             

167
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,020
       Wild boar sliders.       

168
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,355
         So, of course, when I'm
    in a beer hall in Baltimore,

169
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,690
             who do I run into? 

170
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:02,160
         Bob from Chaps Pit Beef
     and Sophia from Sip & Bite.

171
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,763
             Wild boar slider --
         Break this down for me.

172
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,365
I like everything about it.     
I love the pickled vegetables.  

173
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,833
I like the dressing on it.      

174
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,302
          Nice ambiance         
       and friendly faces.      

175
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:13,171
     So as two of the "Triple D"
     originals in Baltimore, you

176
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,708
are absolutely voting these guys
in to be on the "Triple D" team?

177
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,977
Absolutely.                     
    The O.G.s have convened.    

178
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,845
        The O.G.s have convened.

179
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,647
    The O.G.s have convened.    
               There ya have it.

180
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,982
   Alewife is my go-to place.   

181
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,117
   This is where I love to be.  

182
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,986
      Good, man. Like the place.
                  It's fun.     

183
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,588

     in Washington, D.C....

               Big playground.

Mega flavor.                    

189
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,234
  I mean, dude, you             
touched the spectrum of flavors.

  "Triple D" travel tip for ya. 

191

     I know nobody there --

by the U.S. Attorney's Office --

195
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,120
      I'm not exactly sure      
        where that is --        

196
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,988
       or you're catching       
      a Wizards game, well,     

197
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,190
 you got to stop by this little,

198
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,459
          we'll call it         
      a carnivore compound,     

199
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:09,461
        where this couple       
  is scratch-making everything.

    This is the Carving Room.

Steak and egg burger.

00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,800
  I've actually eaten here more 
than I've eaten at my own house.

203
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,536
        Pastrami sandwich       
       with Israeli salad.      

204
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,604
      It's not just a meal.     
       It's an experience.

  You can tell that there's so  
much love and history and family

207
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,276
    that goes into everything   
         that they make.

209

      Jewish-Moroccan mom.      

210
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,815
 Everything at home             
was made from scratch.          

211
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,884
You open the fridge,            
it was just produce and meats,  

212
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,486
and if you wanted something,    
 it had to be made.             

213
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,888
      Which is still going      
      on at the dream joint

216

Everything, from scratch.

               in the window.   

218
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,232
 I've been all around the world,

219
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,967
     and I always search out    
           a pastrami.          

220
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,036
         This one right         
     here is right on-point.    

221
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:52,170
  All right, boss.              

222
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,371
That's a huge brisket.          
                 WEIZMANN: Yeah.

223
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,640
               We trim the fat  
         down to about 1/4 inch.

224
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,242
 Okay.                          
    Take some cracked coriander.

225
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,843
Black pepper.                   
                  Ground cloves,

             bay leaves, ground,
                 some sugar.    

227

     Okay.

           That's ready to roll.

228
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,582
So you're gonna lay down        
  the curing salt?              
                          Yep.  

229
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,918
                  Now the rub.  
And this is just as heavy       

230
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,453
as you can get it on?           
                           Yep. 

231
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,522
 This is the flavor. We're gonna
       let it sit for nine days.

232
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:11,656
        Okay.                   

233
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,858
It's been rinsed, cured.        

234
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,794
   Now we're gonna              
give it one more rub.           

235
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,063
               And we're gonna  
               mix two to one.  

236
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:20,198
Two parts black pepper          
      in weight                 

237
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,934
to one part ground coriander    
     to weight.                 

238
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:25,270
                   That's right.
And just lay it on there        
       thick.                   

239
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,539
           Don't hold back.     
           You want a nice crust
           when you cut into it.

240
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,873
                 All right.     
          This is ready to roll.

241
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,274
And throw it in the oven,       
    low and slow.               

242
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,276
             215 all night long.
  Amen.                         

243
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,278
And what are we making          
        now?                    

244
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,481
 Got our homemade mayo, which is
 the base for our chipotle mayo.

245
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:40,084
  We're gonna add some chipotles
               in adobo sauce,  

246
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,754
   all chopped up, fresh garlic,
             ancho chili powder.

247
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,289
   Okay.                        
              Fresh lime juice. 

248
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,024
Let this set up for a little bit
  before we use it?             

249
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,625
                That's right.   
                 You ready?     

250
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,361
       Hit it.                  

251
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,895
              So we're gonna go 
             against the grain. 

252
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,698
    Oh, my gosh.                

253
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,033
             Gonna chunk it up. 
   Okay.                        

254
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,768
Now, what happens?              
        Throw it on the flattop,

255
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,370
         get it a little crispy.
 Okay.                          

256
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,037
              Roasted poblano.  

257
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,706
               Put it on top.   
                 Provolone.     

258
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,374
   And serve this on?           
                  Ciabatta.     

259
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,776
    So that's our               
   chipotle mayo.               

260
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,111
So what do we have here?        

261
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,113
      That's the Moroccan carrot
                   salad.       
Ah, that's good.                

262
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,650
           Little fresh cilantro
                   on top.      

263
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,851
                 All right.     

264
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,020
                There ya go.    

265
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,591
        Mmm.                    

266
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:22,060
 Big, rich sandwich             
   but not heavy.               

267
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,461
Pepper and coriander            
      all day.                  

268
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,863
The combos all work great.      

269
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,531
 Lot of spice coming            
through that chipotle mayo,     

270
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,599
that and the poblano.           

271
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,334
You gonna want some heat        
   on a sandwich,               

272
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:30,935
   this is yours.               

273
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:34,672
        Mmm.                    
    Scratch-made.               

274
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:35,940
   Can't beat it.               
      Nice job.                 

275
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,809
                   Thanks.      
               Appreciate it.   

276
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,310
Tons of flavor in that.         
                        Yeah.   

277
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,346
   WAITRESS: Pastrami poblano   
       with carrot salad.       

278
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:44,215
  This is my favorite sandwich. 
    I haven't had its equal.    

279
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,551
         So much flavor,        
and nobody does it like they do.

280
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,286
           See our turkey burger
               in the window.   

281
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,888
   It's call the Carving Room   
          for a reason.         

282
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,756
      You can actually see      
     them carving fresh meat    

283
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,158
        when you walk in.       

284
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,160
             WOMAN:             
   They've got a test kitchen,  
    so they always say, "Oh,    

285
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,627
   you've got to try something  
         I've just made.        

286
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,830
  I know you're gonna love it." 
                 Big playground.

287
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,166
Absolutely. Every day, we kind  
of roll different stuff out.    

288
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,234
               I want to live   
               by this place.   

289
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,103
         MAN: Everything        
    on the menu is original,    

290
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,639
  and you're not gonna find it  
   at your typical restaurant.  

291
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:10,575
     FIERI: Especially true     
  with this Moroccan tradition. 

292
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:11,910
 One cigar sampler.             

293
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,712
           The cigars           
      are a family recipe.      

294
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:16,080
MAN: It's sort of like a wrapped
  egg roll, except the wrapping 

295
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,515
  is much lighter and flakier.  

296
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:20,185
 And the filling is spiced meat.
What are we into now?           

297
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:22,119
             Making the chorizo 
         for the chorizo cigars.

298
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,188
     Cigars.                    
                    Yeah.       

299
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,389
    Let's do it.                

300
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:27,191
             Got some cilantro, 
    chopped onion, fresh garlic.

301
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,326
   Okay.                        
               Smoked paprika,  

302
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,462
             Hungarian paprika, 
                ancho chili.    

303
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,529
     Very nice.                 

304
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,531
              Got some cloves,  
                  allspice.     
     Okay.                      

305
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,466
                Chili flakes,   
              ground coriander. 

306
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,001
   Okay.                        
            Toasted cumin seeds.

307
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,736
  Very nice.                    
                  Oregano.      

308
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,138
Cinnamon-a-min-a-min-a-min.     

309
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,340
          Cinnamon, kosher salt.

310
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,607
        Okay.                   

311
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:44,675
                 Excellent.     
                 Thank you.     

312
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,544
         Butcher's grind pepper.
All right.                      

313
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:47,878
Chorizo mix made.               
                      Right.    

314
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,280
Now pork butt time?             
                        Yep.    

315
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,548
     Mix it with the seasonings.

316
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,150
  If you don't have             
    pepper spray                

317
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,885
walking alone at night          
    by yourself,                

318
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,352
carry a handful of that.        

319
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,688
      Throw it into the freezer,

320
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,289
                 45 minutes,    
             get it super cold. 

321
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,424
Got it.                         
          And we'll grind it up.

322
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:00,625
    After we come               
 out of the grinder?            

323
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,026
         Cook it up a little bit
               on the flattop.  

324
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,695
              Then, we're gonna 
                let it cool.    
 Very nice.                     

325
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,563
                 And we got     
             our cigar wrapper. 

326
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:06,898
Now, how many different kinds   
    do you make?                

327
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,898
          Three different kinds.

328
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,168
                   We got       
our Moroccan-spiced ground beef,

329
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,171
     the chorizo, which we made,
  and then the corned beef hash.

330
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,639
              Real simple fold. 

331
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:15,840
Little bit of egg white.        

332
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,041
          Just to seal the edge.

333
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,710
             Then we fry 'em up.

334
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:21,513
   These are the Moroccan-spiced
           ground beef cigars...

335
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,781
 Nice presentation.             
        Yes.                    

336
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:27,452
     And chorizo cigars with the
   roasted poblano tomato salsa.

337
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:30,254
                And the last    
  is the corned beef hash cigars

338
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,523
    with our house-made Russian.

339
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,657
So this is Moroccan?            

340
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:33,758
                    Yep.        

341
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,262
        Wow.                    
The chorizo that we made...     

342
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,799
                  Chorizo.      

343
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,534
Man, when you say "chorizo,"    
  you mean chorizo.             

344
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,203
        Whoa.                   
    Mega flavor.                

345
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,772
  I mean, dude, you             
touched the spectrum of flavors.

346
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,745
  Just enough meat,             
  just enough wrap.             

347
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,348
The dipping sauces all pair     
       nicely.                  

348
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,349
  There's all kinds             
     of flavor.                 

349
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,685
           Cigar sampler for ya.

350
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,488
        It's like having        
  a Moroccan experience in D.C. 

351
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,089
  MAN: You get a great crunch.  

352
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,826
  And then you get hit with the 
  spice afterwards of the meat. 

353
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,761
               Order, please,   
              sweet and savory. 

354
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:12,030
 There's no place I'd rather be 
      to have a great meal.     

355
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:15,767
  It's so much more than just a 
 Moroccan menu or a Jewish deli.

356
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,235
I love your attention to detail.
I love your appreciation.       

357
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,703
                       Thanks.  
You're doing great.             
     Congrats.                  

358
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,673
               Appreciate it.   
Lights out.                     

359
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:25,109
             FIERI:             
 Up next in Colorado Springs... 

360
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,111
                Time to eat.    

361
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:27,912
   ...welcome to Jamaica, man.  

362
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,315
 This is so tender,             
    so flavorful.               

363
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,783
    And legit island recipes.   

364
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:33,752
   Mmm, mmm, mmm!               

365
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:43,994
        So I got a great        
    "Triple D" story for ya.    

366
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,264
    Got this married couple.    
  The wife is in the military,  

367
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,998
  and they travel from Nebraska 

368
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,267
       to the Netherlands       
        to Ohio to Maine.       

369
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,470
       And the whole time,      
 they want great Jamaican food. 

370
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,606
      They can't find any,      
so they start to make their own.

371
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,907
        And their friends       
      say, "You know what?      

372
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,142
  Someday, you guys should open 
      your own restaurant."     

373
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,145
  After they get stationed here 
      in Colorado Springs,      

374
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,279
       they do just that.       

375
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,616
   This is Spice Island Grill.  

376
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,417
How long on the festival bread, 
  on the plantains?             

377
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,619
     Ah, I got it three minutes.
Three minutes.                  

378
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,022
            One bite,           
     and I'm on island time.    

379
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,356
                Jerk pork up.   

380
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,625
       The food is amazing      
           every time.          

381
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,228
 FIERI: That's 'cause Claudette 
     and Glenroy Hutchinson     

382
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,696
       know Jamaican food.      

383
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:19,964
       They grew up on it,      

384
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,966
     and when their families    
    immigrated to the States,   

385
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:25,303
   they brought their recipes   
 with them everywhere they went.

386
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,771
You were in the military?       
          I was in the military.

387
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:29,173
Every place you go, you're      
not finding Jamaican food,      

388
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,375
  so you're cooking             
your own Jamaican food.         

389
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,576
          We're cooking         
     our own Jamaican food.     

390
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:32,576
And then your friends           
 are coming around,             

391
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,912
trying your Jamaican food.      
              Yes.              

392
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,446
             FIERI:             
  And that experience paid off  

393
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,849
   when they opened this joint  
            in 2011.            

394
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,317
         Curry goat, table five.

395
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,519
       Curry is a big part      
       of Jamaican dishes.      

396
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,187
        Okay.                   
Here's your curry goat.         

397
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,057
 I cannot think of anywhere else
       in Colorado Springs      

398
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,992
  that you can get curry goat.  

399
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,662
     So this is a piece of goat.

400
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,130
       FIERI:                   
Row, row, row your goat.        

401
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,199
     We cook ours with the bone.
 That's where all the flavor is.

402
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:57,335
       So take as much of the --
        of the meat you can off,

403
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,838
          but we definitely like
           to keep some bone in.

404
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,207
     You want me                
to finish that goat?            

405
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,676
                Yes, please.    

406
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,745
             I got to step back.

407
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:08,679
                We got goat.    

408
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,882
      Make sure                 
I got all my fingers.           

409
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,883
      We gonna add some vinegar,
               add some water,  

410
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,819
      get all this muskiness off
             and all that stuff.

411
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,154
                Now it's time   
              to cook it down.  
    Okay.                       

412
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,422
        We're gonna add some oil
                 to the pot.    

413
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,491
     These pots came all the way
                from Jamaica.   
I couldn't tell.                

414
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,694
             Grandma brought 'em
                from Jamaica.   

415
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,296
          [ Sizzling ]          

416
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,298
                 All right.     
         Add some seasoned salt.

417
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,833
         So we let that sear off
              for a little bit. 

418
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,836
               Then, I'm gonna  
             add a little water.

419
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,638
       We're gonna let this cook
               for 30 minutes.  

420
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,772
   Okay. Next up?               

421
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,574
             We add some oil... 

422
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,108
 To another one                 
of those new pots.              
             ...to another pot, 
               to another pot.  

423
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,511
                   Right.       
         The garlic, the ginger.

424
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,447
             Mix together there.

425
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,648
            And then we're gonna
           add the curry powder.

426
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,917
         This is Jamaican curry.
           See how yellow it is?

427
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,253
               We like to let   
             it fry up a little,

428
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:52,056
     and we get the aroma going.

429
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,658
           Take our cooked goat.

430
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,658
              We just throw it  
              in there with --  

431
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,128
 Everybody in the pool.         
                     Like so.   

432
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,063
You hear it?                    
                 You have to    
              hear that sizzle. 

433
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,999
                Look at that.   
             Oh, smells so good!

434
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,868
           Then, we start adding
             everything else -- 

435
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,670
               green onions --  
            I love green onions.

436
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:10,942
      fresh green thyme, onions,
     and a lot of green peppers.

437
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:13,477
             Last but not least,
                the potatoes.   

438
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,347
And 90 minutes later,           
we're ready to rock?            

439
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,749
              Now we're making  
               rice and peas.   
I've had rice and peas.         

440
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,284
 I've been to Jamaica.          
           And you had the peas?

441
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,619
Can't you tell 'cause of my hair
I've been to Jamaica?           

442
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:22,686
                  Oh, yeah.     
     Ya, man.                   

443
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:23,955
             It's almost there. 

444
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:25,756
                  So we use...  
  Kidney beans.                 

445
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,358
                    Yes.        
        We call everything peas.

446
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,426
    Peas, right.                
            We don't have beans.

447
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,827
           So we have some water
                  boiling.      

448
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,362
              Add kidney beans. 

449
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,630
            We add coconut milk.

450
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,966
         Nice, coconut-y flavor.
Coconut-y flavor.               

451
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:39,804
  Then we add fresh thyme, fresh
     green onions, seasoned salt

452
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:43,107
        and then our special red
  seasoning to help the redness.

453
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,443
             We'll stir this up.

454
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,578
                  And then      
          the garlic will go in.

455
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,514
          And once that's melted
   and boiling, we add the rice.

456
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,651
      We'll cover that, let that
 cook down for about 30 minutes.

457
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,853
   And that's the peas and rice.
They go with the curry goat.    

458
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,188
                    Yes.        

459
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,856
        And our goat's finished,
       and we're ready to serve.

460
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,325
              Nice, good sauce  

461
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:03,194
       and some potatoes and mix
         of everything in there.

462
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:07,531
              So we like to add 
   some extra sauce on the side,

463
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,666
             the rice and peas. 

464
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,935
         Then we add the sautéed
              cabbage, peppers, 

465
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,937
            onions, and carrots.

466
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,706
                Time to eat!    

467
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,477
             What do you think? 

468
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,614
      Mmm. Wow.                 

469
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:27,952
I'm telling you right now,      
this is so tender, so flavorful.

470
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,620
 This has got a kiss            
    of the curry,               

471
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:30,955
little kiss of the thyme.       

472
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:32,423
That is spot-on, 'cause         

473
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:35,026
all that flavor coming out of   
those bones into that stock.    

474
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:36,761
                    Yeah,       
if your teeth are strong enough,

475
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,096
       you can chew the bone up.

476
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,963
     Dr. Latham                 
does not allow me to...         
                     Chew bones?

477
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,632
 No. Not after what             
 we've been through.            

478
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:42,766
Is that right, Gary?            

479
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,234
I like this little cabbage      
    kicker here.                

480
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,636
You know what I think           
is interesting about the rice   

481
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,971
and peas is that you could only 
 have so much meat.             

482
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,108
And so the rice and peas had    
to be a really nice filler,     

483
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,110
and that's really what carried  
the families through.           

484
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:53,444
                   Right.       

485
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:54,579
        Mmm!                    

486
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:57,047
   Mmm, mmm, mmm!               
    That's good!                

487
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,717
   Curry goat with rice and peas
          and cabbage, table 12.

488
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,119
  It's kind of a mellower meat. 

489
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,519
      It's not gamy at all.     

490
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,655
   It's the perfect intensity   
           for curry.           

491
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,857
          Well, it is wonderful,
                 wonderful.     

492
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,393
And I heard they got            
a little music thing            

493
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:09,726
  going on, too.                
                     Oh, yes.   

494
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,395
Polka bands or something?       
Oh, no. Reggae band.            

495
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,063
                         Reggae.
Reggae. Polka, reggae?          

496
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,398
       Polka? [ Chuckles ]      

497
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,067
      You feel like you're      
        on vacation right       

498
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,603
   when you walk in the door.   

499
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:21,205
So we're hanging out            
at Spice Island Grill           

500
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,673
in Colorado Springs,            
      Colorado.                 

501
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,542
 When we come back,             
 we're gonna make...            

502
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,344
I don't care what we make.      
It's gonna be dynamite.         
See ya in a bit.                

503
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,019
         Ah.                    
      See that?                 

504
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:38,156
It's a look of just having      
three plates of goat.           

505
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:39,923
    We're here at               
 Spice Island Grill             

506
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,425
in Colorado Springs,            
      Colorado.                 

507
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,027
She's the one to blame          
      for this.                 

508
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,362
What are we doing next?         

509
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,497
           If you say "Jamaica,"
    what do you think of, right?

510
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:47,832
   Bob Marley.                  
                    No, food.   

511
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,500
  Allspice.                     
                 Never mind.    

512
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,102
Red beans and rice.             
         You think jerk chicken!

513
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:53,171
    Jerk chicken, table six.    

514
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:56,240
        The jerk chicken        
      is an amazing mixture     

515
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,443
     of spices and flavors.     
        It's incredible.        

516
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:01,779
 It's more flavorful than spice,
             to me.             

517
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:02,980
Let's get after it.             
                       Okay.    

518
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,649
               So I have some   
             red cayenne pepper.

519
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,051
                  You know,     
 you can't have too much pepper.

520
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,921
Some paprika, just regular salt,
                   cumin,       

521
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,322
                or "cuhmin,"    
          we call it in Jamaica.

522
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:14,125
This is our secret ingredient --
             some ground coffee.

523
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,659
            Mix it all together.

524
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,728
     We use this as our dry rub.

525
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,597
That's four times the amount    
of cayenne to anything else.    

526
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,467
                 It's jerk.     
     It has to start with spice.

527
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:24,735
Could we just crumble up Rolaids
and throw 'em in there now?     

528
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:27,738
      You won't need the Rolaids
when we add the wet stuff to it.

529
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,406
       It just all balances out.

530
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,742
                  So next,      
           we make our marinade.

531
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,211
     It's gonna be like a paste.

532
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:37,281
    In a blender, we add garlic,
     oil, vinegar, thyme, fresh,

533
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:40,017
                  and lots      
               of green onions  

534
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,886
                 and ginger.    

535
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,621
    There ya go.                

536
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:48,159
  Okay, next up...              
          Chicken leg quarters. 

537
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:49,627
                We brush this   
                with vinegar.   

538
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,296
              Then, we're gonna 
         add the red seasonings.

539
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,699
                 Get it all     
            underneath the skin.

540
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,435
     I guess it takes two people
                 to do this.    

541
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,570
Yeah, it goes a little          
bit faster when we              
do it this way, huh?            

542
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,505
                  We add our... 
 The blend up, yeah.            

543
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,507
              So this is there  
          the flavor comes from.

544
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:07,177
       So this is some -- a jerk
   predone marinade from Jamaica

545
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,380
             to add a little bit
       of extra Jamaica to this.

546
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,183
                And the oil,    
             we just kind of put

547
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,451
      a little bit on it to kind
  of keep it moist on the grill.

548
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:17,454
     All right.                 
Next up -- the grill.           

549
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:18,922
         Look at those beauties!

550
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,725
              Oh, my goodness!  

551
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,393
               If I ate meat,   
          it would have been on.

552
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,262
You don't eat meat?             
              I don't eat meat. 

553
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,063
           I do taste it 'cause,
            you know, I have to.

554
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,098
       Right.                   

555
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,200
                 Chop it up,    
      put that chicken up there.

556
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:31,002
           It's a number-one hit
                 right here.    

557
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,537
               Everybody come   
           for the jerk chicken.

558
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,137
          We get a little sauce.
What is it?                     

559
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,675
       Jerk marinade, little bit
     of spices and some veggies.

560
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,410
                  And then      
          we got some plantains.

561
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,113
                   Voilà.       

562
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,083
  So I've had a lot             
  of jerk chicken.              

563
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:48,819
Everybody has their own style.  
This is how you do it.          

564
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,221
  It's outrageous.              
        Mmm.                    

565
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,755
Tremendous layers of flavor.    

566
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,157
Just look at all the --         

567
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:55,225
how the fat is cooked           
   out of the skin              

568
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,493
   and the skin's               
   nice and crispy              

569
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,562
   and the chicken              
  is just succulent             

570
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,165
 and all the spices             
 and the seasoning.             

571
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,700
  And then it's got             
all the marinade on it.         

572
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,501
        He's trying to tempt me,
                   no, no!      
    And then                    
when you cook it down,          

573
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,703
       you get                  
a little caramelization.        

574
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,705
      And then                  
you dip it into that sauce.     

575
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,573
      And then                  
you just come right over this.  

576
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,108
                     Oh!        
              I'm not looking!  

577
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,510
              I'm not looking!  
   Mmm!                         

578
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:14,845
   Listen. Listen.              

579
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:18,115
  I can hear reggae             
 in the background.             

580
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,450
        Jerk chicken up!        

581
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:22,587
         As a Jamaican,         
I can speak to the authenticity.

582
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,922
       There's just a combustion
                 of flavors.    

583
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,123
    A combustion.               

584
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,257
             It's just awesome. 

585
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,393
          It takes you          
     out of Colorado Springs    

586
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,129
  and into a Jamaican culture.  

587
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,531
            Blessing.           
            Blessing.           

588
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:36,534
          Ever live it,         
    ever faithful, ever sure.   

589
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:37,668
    Awesome job.                

590
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,603
               Aw, thank you.   

591
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,072
So that's it for this road trip.
        But don't worry.        

592
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,142
    We got plenty more joints   
 to find all over this country. 

593
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,743
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

594
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,547
     on "Diners, Drive-Ins,     
           and Dives."          

595
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:51,615
I'm back eating again!          

596
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,484
I'm trying to wrap the show.    
     Good night!                

597
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,085
  It's ridiculous!              
   I've got to go!              

598
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,020
      They keep                 
 sucking me back in!            

599
00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:00,024
  See ya next week.             
I'm going to the gym.
