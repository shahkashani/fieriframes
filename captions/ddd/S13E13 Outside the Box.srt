00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,361
              YOU CAN TRY IT NOW
                 IF YOU WANT.   

109
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:50,996

111
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,767

SO NOW WE LET IT                
   COOL DOWN,                   

112
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:58,436
FILL SOME RAVIOLIS.             
                          RIGHT.

113
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,837

114
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,640

  RUNNING THROUGH THE SHEETER.  

115
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:03,375
         RIGHT. LIGHTLY FLOURED.

116
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,379
              PASS IT THROUGH.  
            WE'LL FOLD HER OVER.

117
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,248
               PASS HER THROUGH.

118

 THE INDENTIONS INTO THE MOLDS. 

121
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:17,589

123
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:19,924

         SO FAR, SO GOOD?       

124
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,660
            EGG WASH IN BETWEEN.
                CLEAN 'EM UP.   

125
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:23,929
    TAKE ANOTHER SHEET OF DOUGH,
          POP IT OVER TOP.      

126
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,863
           TAKE THE ROLLING PIN,
             GO RIGHT OVER IT.  

127
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,467
      I'LL CUT 'EM ON THE MOLDS.
     THROW THOSE ON A SHEET PAN.

128
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:29,734
       THROW 'EM IN THE FREEZER.

129
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,604
  SO THE RAVS ARE NOW FROZEN.   
          FINAL STEP?           

130
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,407
       EGGS, MILK, BLACK PEPPER,
                 SALT.          

131
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,608
                    MIX THAT UP.

132
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,942
       SO NOW INTO OUR FLOUR MIX
             WE'RE PUTTING      

133
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,611
           A LITTLE ONION POWDER
             AND GARLIC POWDER. 

134
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,945
     NOW MIX THAT UP REAL QUICK.

135
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,682
      AND TO OUR BREAD CRUMBS,  
    A LITTLE ITALIAN SEASONING--

136
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:45,617
       OREGANO, THYME, ROSEMARY,
               MARJORAM.        

137
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,487
     SHAKE THAT UP A LITTLE BIT.
    GET THESE INTO THE EGG WASH.

138
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,689
         SO MOVE 'EM INTO THERE.

139
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:51,957
   IT'S NOT HIS FIRST RODEO.    
NO.                             

140
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,625
             NOW THEY'RE COATING
              WITH THE EGG WASH.

141
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,626
  AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GO INTO  
       THE BREAD CRUMBS,        

142
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,895

                          RIGHT.

143
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,630
      COMPLETELY COAT IT.       
        FREEZE IT AGAIN.        
                          RIGHT.

144
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,900
WE REALLY BIND THAT CRUST       
     TO THE RAVIOLI.            

145
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:05,837
NOW WE'LL GET A UNIFORM COOK    
    ALL THE WAY THROUGH.        
                        CORRECT.

146

153
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,650

        IN THE MARINARA.        

155

      THEN YOU GET CRUNCH,      

156
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:26,825

          I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
           THE YEAST TO SPREAD. 

214
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,971
BUILDING A BIGGER STARTER.      
                        EXACTLY.

215
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,707
HIGH FIVE, MAN.                 
  THAT'S AWE--                  
         YEAH, BUDDY. JUST GET--

00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,109
                       OH, DUDE.
           (laughter)           

217
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,310
          YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO
         LEAVE SOMEBODY HANGING.

218
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:27,579
                ALL RIGHT, COOL.
WHOA! ALL RIGHT.                

219
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,848
   SO THIS IS YESTERDAY.        
SO NOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?     

220
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,650
             NOW WE POUR IT     
        IN THE MACHINE. (groans)

221
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:32,784
         THEN WE'RE JUST PUTTING
               EQUAL PARTS      

222
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,719
              OF FLOUR AND WATER
                   IN THERE.    

223
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:35,921
WHAT TYPE OF FLOUR?             
              CAPUTO DOUBLE "O."

224
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,190
  DOUBLE "O"?                   
(clicks tongue)                 
                         UH-HUH.

225
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:39,790
 SO WE'LL MIX THIS THROUGH.     
JUST GONNA SPREAD THE YEAST.    

226
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,993
              IT'LL START RISING
              BACK UP, YOU KNOW.
GOT IT.                         

227
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,194
         GET IT NICE AND SPONGY.
HOW LONG?                       

228
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,595
          UM, PROBABLY ABOUT    
      TWO, TWO AND A HALF HOURS.

229
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,798
             NOW WE'RE MAKING   
          OUR SPONGE INTO DOUGH.

230
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,600
   NOW YOU ADD IN               
ANOTHER 2/3 OF FLOUR.           

231
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,469
                  1 CUP OF SALT.
OKAY.                           

232
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,603
         WE GET HER STARTED     
    TO INCORPORATE A LITTLE BIT.

233
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,606
ONCE IT STARTS GRIPPING A LITTLE
    BIT, THEN WE ADD THE OIL.   

234
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,274
THE OIL SO IT PULLS             
AWAY FROM THE BOWL.             
                         UH-HUH.

235
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:59,611
  YOU LET THAT PROOF            
FOR<i> ANOTHER</i> TWO HOURS?          
          ABOUT TWO HOURS OR SO.

236
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,946
MAN, WHAT A LABOR OF LOVE       
        THIS IS.                

237
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,214
 THIS IS GOING                  
FOR WHAT PIZZA?                 

238
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,683
       BACON AND CLAM IS THE ONE
        WE'LL BE COOKING TODAY. 

239
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:05,884
(inhales)                       

240
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,619
  MY MIDDLE NAME                
IS BACON AND CLAM.              

241
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,554
MY PARENTS WERE HIPPIES.        
        HIPPIES DON'T EAT BACON.

242
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,022
THEY DID--MINE DID.             
                        OH, MAN.

243
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,757
YEAH, RIGHT OFF THE HOOF.       
 NOW YOU'RE IN THE KNOW.        

244
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,826
OKAY, JOE, THIS IS IT?          

245
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,826
                  YES. GRAB     
            YOUR CHUNK OF DOUGH.

246
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,164
                 MOIST.         
        IN AND OUT A LITTLE BIT.

247
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,698
OPPOSITE DIRECTION?             
                        EXACTLY.

248
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,034
 I DON'T THINK THESE ARE GONNA  
COME OUT COOKIE-CUTTER UNIFORM. 

249
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,569
                         OH, NO.
OKAY, LET'S SEE IT.             

250
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,238
                       SEMOLINA.

251
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:29,174
NOW WE'RE CUTTIN' IT.           

252
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,844
THERE YOU GO.                   

253
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,248
                   IT'S NOT EVEN
                  IN ROUND FORM.

254
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:36,982
NO.                             

255
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:37,849
                   BACK IN THE--

256
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,517
  WE'LL PUT IT                  
OFF TO THE SIDE.                

257
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,719
UH, WE'LL END UP, UH,           

258
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,854
MAKING A NEW BATCH OF STARTER   
    OUT OF IT EVENTUALLY.       

259
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,523
                           OKAY.
NO WASTE.                       

260
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:45,924
            THIS LITTLE SCREEN--
              THAT JUST A MARK? 

261
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,592
  WE ALSO SERVE THEM            
ON THESE SCREENS, TOO,          

262
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:48,793
ON TOP OF THE PLATE.            

263
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,061
SEE, WE COOK IT SO HOT,         
THERE'S SO MUCH MOISTURE        

264
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,996
 TRAPPED IN THE DOUGH,          
IF I PUT IT ON A PLATE,         

265
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:52,931
IT SOGS UP QUICK.               
     IT'S GONNA STEAM RIGHT OUT.

266
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,666
YOUR ROASTED GARLIC.            
  WE GO THIN ON IT              

267
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:55,734
'CAUSE IT'S STRONG.             

268
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:57,602
                    FROZEN CLAM.
FROZEN CLAMS.                   

269
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,071
          THAT'S A LOT OF CLAMS.
CHOP YOUR BACON DOWN.           

270
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,606
WE'RE PRETTY GENEROUS           
 ABOUT SUCH THINGS.             

271
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,241
                    BOCCONCINI? 
THAT'S A CILLENCINI.            

272
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,610
   WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
  A BOCCONCINI AND A CILLENCINI?

273
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:06,744
CILLENCINI'S CHERRY SIZED.      

274
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,613
  THE BOCCONCINI'S              
A LITTLE BIT BIGGER.            

275
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:09,948
             I SHOULD TASTE THAT
             AND JUST MAKE SURE.

276
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,016
(laughs)                        

277
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,351
          EXACTLY RIGHT. THAT IS
               A CILLENCINI.    

278

FOR ABOUT A MINUTE.             

281

PROBABLY CLOSER TO 1,500        
     OFF THAT DOME.             

284
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,767
              FIVE, FOUR, THREE,
                   TWO, ONE.    

285
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,368
            THAT IS SMOKIN' HOT.

286
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,074
          GIVE IT A LITTLE SPIN.

287
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,110
      FINAL CRISP ON THE BOTTOM.

288
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,114
                           NICE!

         I LOVE THE SCREEN IDEA.

292
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,392
                            MMM.

                FINISHES IT.

               DUDE! CRAZY GOOD.

299

             NICELY DONE. MONEY.

302
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,613
 I GOT A BACON AND CLAM PIZZA.  

303
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,948

       THAT IT'S SQUARE--       

304
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,683
 I GET MORE--MORE CRISPY CRUST.

00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,819
          CLAM FLAVOR           
   GOES WITH THE CREAM SAUCE.   

306
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,287
      PASTA IN CLAM SAUCE.      

307
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,555
   HE TAKES A LOT OF PRIDE IN   
THE FOOD THAT HE PUTS OUT HERE. 

308
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,926

00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,571
       WE'RE JUST GONNA GRILL IT
          ON THE CHARBROILER.   

424
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:34,772
           (sizzling)           

425
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,908
           WE'RE GONNA MAKE SOME
            CHIPOTLE SAUCE NOW. 

426
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,443
LET'S HIT IT.                   
              WE'RE GONNA START 
             WITH SOME TOMATOES.

427
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,512
                     RED ONIONS.

428
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,047
AND SOME DRIED CHIPOTLES.       

429
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,516
      OKAY, AND THEN WE'RE GONNA
       ADD SOME WHITE ZINFANDEL.

430
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,585
   WHICH YOU DON'T SEE          
GETTING COOKED WITH OFTEN.      

431
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,721
                       CABERNET.

432
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,457
    THEN WE'RE GONNA SIMMER THAT
           FOR TWO HOURS.       

433
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,791
            COOK DOWN, REDUCE IT

434
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,659
              ALL THE WAY DOWN  
            TO ABOUT 10% LIQUID.

435
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,396
      AND THEN WE'RE GONNA BLEND
         THAT WITH SOME CREAM.  

436
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,398
A LITTLE HEAVY CREAM?           

437

438
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,534
SO WE RUN THIS A FEW BATCHES,   
      THEN WHAT'S NEXT?         

439
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,270
         THEN WE'RE GONNA PUT IT
            BACK ON THE STOVE,  

440
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:07,872
       ADD SOME BUTTER TO IT    
  AND CHICKEN BASE, AND LET IT--

441
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,340
AND THAT'LL FINISH IT OUT?      

442
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,741
AND WE'RE GONNA PUT THAT        
 ON THE TACOS NORTEÑOS?         

443
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,877
      WE ARE DEFINITELY GONNA   
   PUT IT ON THE TACOS NORTEÑOS.

444
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:13,811

TO WATER ALREADY.               

445
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:17,014

    BOTTOM SKIRT.               

446

447
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,218
       A LITTLE BIT OF MARGARINE
               IN THERE.        

448
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,886

449
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:23,821
               AND WE ADD SOME  
            PICO DE GALLO TO IT.

450
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:25,689

453
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,294
             OKAY, SO WE GOT    
        THE MINI CORN TORTILLAS.

454

               READY TO PLATE.

                  ON THERE.
