115
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,965

         spice rub mix.         

119
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:01,373
     A little rub-a-dub-dub.    

120
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,774
              [Guy]             
    We're making the dry rub.   

121
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,709
  [Gorilla] We're gonna add the 
  ground cumin, ground oregano, 

122
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,379
         garlic powder,         
       granulated onions,       

123
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,314
           little salt          
      from the lovely sea,      

124
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,249
   some paprika, brown sugar,   

125
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,451
     and some black pepper.     

126
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,586
          Now we put it         
      into the magic mixer.     

127
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,520
 If this thing had an odometer, 

128
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:16,521
       it'd have a million      
      and half miles on it.     

129
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,589
          [Guy] Really?         

130
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:18,857

           [wheezing]           

131
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,525
     Yeah. Sometimes it has     
       a little rod knock       

132
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,726
 in the morning when it's cold. 

133
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,463
           Rod knock.           
     That's an engine term.     

134
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,398

 Did you just say "a mixy-mix"? 

137
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:32,804
  You can't be Gorilla Barbecue 
        and say mixy-mix.       

138
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:36,341
   All right. We got the super  
      combo spice rub mix.      

139
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,609
         I think the rub        
         is about ready.        

140

     -A little tasty-taste.     
             -Yeah.             

141
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,546
    A little tasty-taste goes   
         with mixy-mix.         

142
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,482
          Little sweet,         
      little bit of savory.     

143
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,084
        And we'll give it       
         a little flip.         

144
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:46,952
            More rub.           

145
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,887
    We're ready to throw 'em    
        into the smoker.        

146
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,624
      Two thirty, two forty     
  for about four to five hours. 

147
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:53,625
   The ribs are ready to pull.  

148
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:54,759
  Cut them from the back side,  

149
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,762
      you got a better view     
          of the bone,          

150
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,563
    so they're easier to cut.   

151
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,299
        Look at the juice       
       running out of it.       

152
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,434
  A little bit of a smoke ring. 

153
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,235
    Put a little sauce on it.   

154

         Carolina paste.        

155
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,639
    I love the vinegar. Mmm.    

156
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,640
      How often do you make     
       the barbecue sauce?      

157
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,975
      [Gorilla] Every day.      
       We're going through      

158
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:10,776
       a whole pot daily.       

159
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:12,377
              [Guy]             
  A whole pot that size daily?  

160
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,513
      -Whole pot every day.     
           -[whistles]          

161
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,314
      [Gorilla] For years,      
   we've only done one sauce.   

162
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,782
     Some customers ask for     
   something a little spicier.  

163
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,719
         So I developed         
     a new habanero vinegar.    

164
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:24,589
   Give a little kick to that   
   but not blow your face off.  

165
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,457
   [Guy] I appreciate the not   
    blowing my face off part.   

166
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:27,826

169
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,598

      of a Texas attitude.

172
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,603
    The pork is not competing   
        with the spices,        

173
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,804

      we roll it in butter

       Here you go, papa.       

234
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,524
          [Guy] You are         
    the sole proprietor now.    

235
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,793
      Since 2013, yes, sir.     

236
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,927
     [man] Rich really knows    
        what he's doing.        

237
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,929
   [man 1] Oh, I've had pretty  
  much everything on the menu.  

238
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,931
  [man 2] I'd order everything  
   again that's all wonderful.  

239
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,934
  [Gorilla] Philly cheese steak 
  sandwich with smoked brisket. 

240
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,068
     [Guy] I gotta be honest    
       with you, brother.       

241
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,537
  I think Philly cheese steaks  
    need to come from Philly.   

242
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:53,939
   Well, let's give it a whirl  
     and see what you think.    

243
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:54,939
           All right.           
        I let you do it.        

244
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:58,476
    Olive oil. Got some fresh   
     cut vegetables, onions,    

245
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,412
  bell peppers, the magic rub.  

246
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,280
            We use it           
      to season everything.     

247
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,414
   Some of the fresh brisket.   

248
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,349
 Cut a couple real nice pieces. 

249
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,484
         Barbecue sauce.        

250
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:07,552
    I like where you're going   

251
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,421
   that we got so many flavors  
            in there.           

252
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:10,622
           You call it          
      southwestern Philly?      

253
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,692
   Sure. We'll put some cheese  
    on there, American Swiss.   

254
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:16,428
   Put a little lid on there.   

255
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,496
   Little splash of barbecue.   

256
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,498
          -Chop it up.          
       -[Guy] I gotta see       

257
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,299
    the inside of this thing.   
          Look at that.         

258
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,235
              Mmm.              

259
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,504
       What you do have...      

260
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:26,771
         is a fantastic         

261
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,574
          southwestern          
     cheese steak sandwich.     

262
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:30,975
           Delicious.           

263
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,711
       May have to go home      
     and shampoo my goatee.     

264
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,179
        [Gorilla] I think       
  I might've changed Guy's mind 

265
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,181
         on the Philly.         

266
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,382
              Mmm.              

267
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,849
    It's real deal barbecue.    

268
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,652
       You only make what       
        you're gonna sell       

269
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,853
     and once it's sold out,    
           it's done.           

270
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,389
       Do you have a limit      
    of what people can order?   

271
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,324
        Nope. Not at all.       
       You want 20 racks?       

272
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:47,726
     No problem. Here we go.    

273
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,461
            -We do...           
          -No problem.          

274
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:52,464
     -...84 racks a day bro.    
          -No way, man.         

275
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,798
           [laughter]           

276
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,400
     -[Guy] What's on this?     
      -[Gorilla] All right.     

277
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,468
         Now we got some        
       of my pulled pork.       

278
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,670
      Break it down for me.     

279
00:08:58,672 --> 00:08:59,871
     [Gorilla]<i> We like bone</i>     
         <i> and pork butt</i>         

280
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,340
     <i> 'cause the bone gives</i>     
   <i> it a little more flavor.</i>    

281
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,742
  <i> We don't like to trim them.</i>  

282
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,743
 <i> The fat keeps the pork moist.</i> 

283

     <i> Rub it with my super</i>      
     <i> combo spice rub mix.</i>      

284
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,949
        Put the butts in        
       with the fat cap up      

285
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:14,485
  <i> because we want the fat to</i>   
 <i> render down through the meat.</i> 

286
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,421
    [Guy] And how many butts    
     are you going through?     

287
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,356
      Fourteen butts a day.     

288
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,224
   Cook it for about 14 hours.  

289
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,826
   <i> Let it rest a little bit</i>    
     <i> and then we pull it.</i>      

290
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,095
          <i> We serve it</i>          
  <i> with the sauce on the side</i>   

291

      <i> so you can sauce it</i>      
      <i> at your discretion.</i>      

292
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,299
    When did you start using    
 words like "at my discretion"? 

293
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,367
            [laughs]            

294
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,369
       I want you to look       
       at this smoke ring       

295
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,004
      that is on that pork.     

296
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,773
            Dynamite.           

297
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,641
           Here you go          
     with some pulled pork.     

298
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,644
       [man] The smokiness      
 in his pulled pork is amazing. 

299
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,447
     It's not overpowering.     
        It's more subtle.       

300
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:43,448
            Perfect.            

301
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,849
       [woman] It's moist       
    and it's a little crunchy   

302
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,718
   on the outside and you have  
     the real juicy inside.     

303
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,255
         It pulls apart         
   and it melts in your mouth.  

304
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,659
  [Guy] I think the only thing  
        that we all wish        

305
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,728
     is that there was like

   I want to go the party now.  

351
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,453
    I want to go disco party.   

352
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,255
      Yes, I want to dance.     

353
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,656
    We're going make a crepe.   

354
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:35,326
      The crepes start out      
           with eggs.           

355
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,527
      Like a family reunion     
            in there.           

356
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:37,662
            Exactly.            
           Some milk,           

357
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:38,863
       blend these guys up      
       just a little bit.       

358
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,665
  [Guy] Makes you want to just  
   dive right in, doesn't it?   

359
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:41,732
             [Timmy]            
     And I add in the sugar,    

360
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,534
         a little salt,         
  and then some melted butter.  

361
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:44,669
   [Guy] Is it labor or labor?  

362
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:45,803
         -I don't know.         
          -It's labor.          

363
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,605
      I only took two years     
    of French in high school.   

364
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,206
    [Guy] And now the flour?    

365
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:50,275
             -So...             
              -Oh.              

366
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:52,744
               Oh.              

367
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,546
          We'll be back         
        right after this.       

368
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:58,415
     Welcome back to<i> Diners,</i>    
     <i> Drive-ins and Dives.</i>      

369
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:01,218
              Ugh.              
   So I didn't wanna do that.   

370
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:01,886
      Okay. So, I think...      

371
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:02,887
             [Timmy]            
    We're putting the flour.    

372
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,489
     -[Guy] Need some help?     
     -[Timmy] I don't know,     

373
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,489
      you dropped the whisk     
           last time.           

374
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,259
        [trombone plays]        

375
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,564
           [laughter]           

376
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:13,698
      [Guy] You're gonna go     
          to the mixer.         

377
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,766
             [Timmy]            
    Yes. Throw that in there.   

378
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:15,967
      [Guy] Ugh, it's clean     
        the way you work.       

379
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,503
     [Timmy] It's definitely    
   a messy process regardless.  

380
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,704
    Let me just turn this on.   

381
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:20,905
   [Guy] I've already learned   
          why my crepes         

382
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,374
        are not that good       
 'cause I don't put in blender. 

383
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:24,575
             [Timmy]            
    Yeah. We like 'em smooth.   

384
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:25,977
      Now we'll strain it.      

385
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,445
      All right. So you got     
    this thing nice and hot.    

386
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,445
     You add in your batter.    

387
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:29,981
       [Guy] What is this?      

388
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:30,782
       [Timmy] That is the      
     official crepe twirler.    

389
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,584
   I am so out of my element.   

390
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,519
    Grab your crepe twirling    
             device,            

391
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,720
     spin the batter around     

392
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:36,854
        -just like that.        
            -Awesome.           

393
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,456
     [Timmy] Work the crepe,    
         flip the crepe.        

394
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:39,591
   Let me get down with this.   

395
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:40,725
  -[Timmy] Right in the center. 
       -[Guy] Here we go.       

396
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,326
         I think I went         
     a little too aggressive    

397
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,962
  in my twirling and spinning.  

398
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:47,798
               Oh.              

399
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:50,268
   [Guy] This one wasn't that   
   good there Mary Lou Retton   

400
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,537
           -[laughter]          
         -It was funny?         

401
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,804
       Okay. There's one.       

402
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:56,674
       When Guy was here,       
       he had the Duxelle.      

403
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,543
       [Timmy] The chicken      
         Duxelle crepe.         

404
00:12:58,545 --> 00:12:59,611
              Wow.              

405
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,546
        That's got a lot        
     of unique flavor to it.    

406
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,481
       And the butter rum       
       caramel crepe cake.      

407
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:05,416
   [Timmy] Three crepes down.   

408
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,017
      [Guy speaking French]     

409
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,820
    Then we hit it with just    
   a little bit of the sauce.   

410
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,822
      So I get your butter      
      and some brown sugar,     

411
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,556
          little cream,         
       little bit of rum.       

412
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,690
           -[Guy] Wow.          
       -Three more crepes.      

413
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,293
          -[Guy] Okay.          
  -And we just keep doing this. 

414
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:17,562
        [Guy] Let it cool       
        then we frost it.       

415
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,897
              -Yes.             
        -[Guy] All right.       

416
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,166
 [Timmy] Cream cheese frosting. 

417
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:24,302
    [Guy] Oh, yeah. Wow. Mmm.   

418
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,436
  I've never seen this before.  

419
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:26,904
  [Timmy] It's a great recipe.  

420
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,639
  [Guy] Call the patent office  
        right now, dude.        

421
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,509
        Mmm. That's good.       

422
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,844
 [Timmy] Butter rum crepe cake. 

423
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:37,649
 When I saw that layered butter 
   rum crepe cake on<i> Triple D,</i>  

424
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,852
   I knew it was a done deal.   
       I had to come here.      

425
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:43,721
     [woman] It's one of my     
   favorite<i> Triple D</i> episodes.  

426
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,523
       <i> I could not wait</i>        
      <i> to come back here.</i>       

427
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,858
   [Craig]<i> So Timmy moved on,</i>   

428
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,394
     I've kind of taken over    
       some of his duties       

429
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:50,394
          as has Mitch.         

430
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,796
     Every time I come back,    

431
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:52,864
 <i> I see a lot of the same faces</i> 

432
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,732
   <i> which means they're doing</i>   
       <i> something right.</i>        

433
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:56,401
     [man] It doesn't matter    
        what time of day,       

434
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,037
    you can get your crepes.    
       for your breakfast.      

435
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,539
             [woman]            
      The chorizo Benedict      

436
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,407
      is one of my favorite     
         breakfast here.        

437
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,342
         It is so good.         

438
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:06,878
    [Mitch] Chorizo Benedict.   

439
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,013
 So we're gonna put the chorizo 
       on the grill first       

440
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,616
 and then we're gonna poke some 
   eggs while this is cooking,  

441
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,551
    and those are gonna cook    
   for three to four minutes.   

442
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,153
   While our chorizo is going,  
        we're gonna throw       

443
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,889
       the English muffins      
   on the grill for a second.   

444
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,425
   We're gonna put the chorizo  
     and the English muffin,    

445
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,427
       and I'm gonna grab       
        my poached eggs,        

446
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,629
   and green chili goes on it.  

447
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,630
        In order to make        
      our pork green chili,     

448
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,498
     we're gonna start with     
      a little bit of oil,      

449
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,701
      some garlic, onions,      

450
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,702
           jalapenos,           
        salt and pepper,        

451
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,504
        our green peppers       
          and tomatoes,         

452
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,573
         green chilies,         
         chicken stock,         

453
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:36,908
      Worcestershire sauce,     

454
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,709
         so this is our         
       slow-braised pork.       

455
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:41,312
    And then we're gonna add    
  a roux with butter and flour. 

456
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,448
   And we'll just finish this   
  off with the house potatoes.  

457
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,218
  And voila, Chorizo Benedict.  

458
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,521
  [woman] The pork green chili  
            is great.           

459
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,789
       <i> When you cut into</i>       
         <i> the Benedict</i>          

460

          <i> of the pork</i>

462
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,396

        <i> of the flavors.</i>        

463
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,331
       It's nice and spicy      
      and it's on a muffin      

464
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,465
    <i> but I also get toasts,</i>

      Wild Rice with fries.     

579
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,657
          We start out          
     with our whipped eggs.     

580
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,726
      We add our seasonings     
      to the whisked eggs.      

581
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,862
          Nobody wants          
     a cayenne pepper bite.     

582
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,597
    It's better to add it all   
        to the liquid egg       

583
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,733
      and that way you can      
      get it mixed evenly.      

584
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,600
       Next, we're adding       
          our oregano,          

585
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:57,801
          salt, pepper,         

586
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,804
         and we go ahead        
         and whisk that.        

587
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,472
      Now, we're gonna make     
      the base of the patty     

588
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,806
       with our wild rice,      

589
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,343
     we add our breadcrumbs,    
       our smoked cheese,       

590
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,344
      minced celery, onion,     

591
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,280
     and last is our garlic.    

592
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,715
    Our egg with seasonings.    

593
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:12,750
       We mix it by hand.       

594
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:13,817
       We're gonna make it      
          into patties.         

595
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,752
          <i> We do about</i>          
      <i> six ounce patties,</i>       

596
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:19,557
 <i> throw 'em in the oven at 350</i>  
 <i> degrees for about 50 minutes.</i> 

597
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,758
        <i> Toast our bun.</i>         

598
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,627
    <i> Next, we put our patty.</i>    

599
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,495
 <i> There's a lot of cheese in it</i> 
            <i> already</i>            

600
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,764
         but Minnesota,         
       we love our cheese.      

601
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,699
         <i> To finish it,</i>         
      <i> we put garlic mayo,</i>      

602
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,435
           <i> lettuce,</i>            
    <i> and tomato on the lid.</i>     

603
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,238
    <i> And here's Minnesota's</i>     
    <i> best Wild Rice Burger.</i>     

604
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,974
     [man] Wild Rice Burger.    

605
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:37,908
  [man]<i> The wild rice gives it</i>  
       <i> a great texture.</i>        

606
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,710
       <i> There's some kind</i>       
    <i> of smokiness in there.</i>     

607
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,712
       Something like this      
   just really hits the spot.   

608
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,782
     [woman] The wild rice,     
    it provides like a nutty,   

609
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,250
    <i> very flavorful texture</i>     

610
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:47,451
    <i> that I'm a big fan of.</i>     

611
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:50,387
        [woman] Wild rice       
     is a Minnesota staple.     

612
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:51,422
    It just tastes like home.   

613
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:54,325
     [Jason] Are you blind?     

614
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,260
  [Guy] What? What did you say? 

615
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:57,394
      What are you? Blind?      

616
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,730
           [laughter]           

617
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,599
     [Jason] Since the show,    
       we have gotten busy      

618
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:02,867
     every time it's aired.     

619
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,935
  [Jamie]<i> It didn't really have</i> 
         <i> the capacity</i>          

620
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,338
    <i> for all the excitement</i>     
        <i> for the place,</i>         

621
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,672
 so we, started the food truck. 

622
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:11,475
  <i> Anything that we serve here</i>  
        <i> at the brewpub,</i>        

623
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:12,677
         <i> you can have</i>          
      <i> on the food truck.</i>       

624
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,345
         [woman] I love         
    when I'm working downtown   

625
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,679
            and I see           
    the Northbound food truck   

626
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:16,747
         <i> and I'm like,</i>         
      <i> "Oh, great, lunch."</i>      

627
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,216
     We're really proud that    
          we've become          

628
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:21,885
     <i> such a staple for the</i>

         <i> to share that</i>         

630

 <i> with the rest of the country.</i> 

631

        a few rules here.       

632
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,491
   We're breaking a few rules.  

633
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,693
         You're the guy         
       that can break 'em.      

634
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:30,394
        I think you're an       
        inspiration, man.       

635
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,497
        Corned beef hash.       

636
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,832
        [Guy]<i> Of course,</i>

   <i> There are loads of joints</i>

    Let me ask you a question   
     before we get started.     

644
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,515
        What do you think       
    of this blue on me, huh?    

645
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:52,716
     How's smashing is this?    

646
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:53,850
      -It looks all right.      
            -Really?

00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,653
           -[laughter]
