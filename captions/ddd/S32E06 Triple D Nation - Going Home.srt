00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:36,900
   whose posole calls my name   
      every time I'm home.      

568
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,036
       And Paul in Eureka,      
       whose New York pie       

569
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,171
         is like a bite         
        of the Big Apple.       

570
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,974
But those, ladies and gentlemen,
      aren't the only ones.     

571
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,177
  We'll check out more "Diners, 
      Drive-ins, and Dives"     

572
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:48,045
          next time on          
       "Triple D Nation."       

573
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:49,914
Give me a "time elapsed"        
    thing on this               

574
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,849
where I just sit here           
  for five minutes,             

575
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,384
and then show a temperature     
gauge dropping down.            

576
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,121
Start here with surface         
     of the sun,                

577
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:58,356
down here to palatable.
