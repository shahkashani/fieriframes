of the tomatillo salsa.         

114

   Pickled onion.

Fresh sliced jalapeño,

We're making guajillo salsa.    

158
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,692
    So guajillo, chile de árbol,
                 and garlic?    

159
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,161
And letting it steep            
  for five minutes.             

160
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:06,564
Okay. I'm gonna puree           
the guajillo chilies.           

161
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,099
Add in the chicken broth.       

162
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,102
Add a little bit of salt.

165
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,041
This is one of the mother       
sauces for Mexican cuisine.     

166
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,710
Sauté it with some aromatics    
and a little bit of olive oil.  

167
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,780
 Bay leaves, onion,

168
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,449

169
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,584

170
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,853

than the Italian oregano.       

171
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,455
We're adding the guajillo.      

172
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,658
   Let this simmer              
for about 10, 15 minutes.       

173
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,928

629
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,083

 put it on to smoke?            
                      4 minutes.

636
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,431
All right, so the slaw          
is perfumed with smoke.         

637
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,833

644
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,946
                 All right,     
            to make the sausage,

645
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,982
     we're gonna start with some
         freshly-chopped garlic,

646
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,184
   chopped onion, fresh oregano,
          fresh-chopped parsley.

   Italian?                     
                 Of course.     

648
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,187
          Toasted ground fennel,
                chili flakes,   

649
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,723
             a little red wine, 
              red wine vinegar. 

650
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:40,057
A little bite.                  
               A little salt.   

651
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,592
Fresh-ground pepper.            
   Only way to go.              

652
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:43,060
               Dried oregano,   
               a little sugar.  

653
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:44,862
             There we go. Boom. 
      We're gonna whisk this up.

654
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,731
    Okay.                       
              So we got local,  
                 fresh pork.    

655
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,666
Can't beat it.                  
                 We'll get this 
             all good and mixed.

656
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:51,001
This is gonna rest up           
for at least 24 hours.          
                          Yes.  

657
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:53,604
All right, so now we're         
gonna work on the onions?       
                          Yeah. 

658
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:55,339
So, super-thin-sliced           
     red onions.                

659
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:56,807
                    Yeah.       
         A real low temperature.

660
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,609
Hit it with some salt right off 
the bat, draw out the moisture. 

661
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:00,344
             Exactly. It's been 
           about 20, 25 minutes.

662
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:02,012
               So, our onions   
           break down real well.

663
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:03,948
       I take a little balsamic,
              reduce this down. 

664
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,148
           -Even more?

665
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,417
 And what are these             
     going for?                 

666
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,685
            Red onion marmalade.

667
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:09,086
             In a separate pan, 
  we're gonna make some caramel.

668
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:10,087
       -Now that goes in?       
              -Yes.             

669
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,421
                 We add that    
              into our onions.  

670
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:12,556
  I like it a lot.              

671
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,357
              Season this with  
           a little bit of salt.

672
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,427
Lay it out the cool, and then   
that'll be the beginning

675
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,166
  So the meat's had             
24 hours to marinate.           

676
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,300
            Now we're just gonna
              render some off.  

677
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:24,368
Got to go in small batches.     

678
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,769
You want this to clump          
  up a little bit,              

679
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,438
render some of the fat          
so it doesn't stick.            

680
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,706
So you brown that off.          

681
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,374
         -Brown this up.

682
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:31,642
 And now we're ready            
to start making the pizza?      

683
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:33,243
                 That's it.     
        Stretch it out to order.

684
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,378
            So, we'll take that.

685
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,913
      The dough goes in the oven
            for about 3 minutes.

686
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,917

Get that meat on there.

751
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,244
               First some oil.

             overcrowd our pan. 

753
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:51,048
 You crowd the pan,             
they sit there and steam,

00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,250

to the outside of them.         

755
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,852
So, you'll mark these off and   
then finish them in the oven?   

756
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,521
                    Yeah.

00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:55,438
  They make it fresh every day. 
          It's amazing.         

1109
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,374
               Okay, brother,   
              let's do sausage. 

1110
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,375
We're gonna start off           
with a boneless pork butt.      

1111
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:00,777
Cut it in really thin pieces.   

1112
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,645
 Holy "Pirates of the Caribbean"
                   sword.       

1113
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:03,780
You like that samurai?          

1114
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,048
           Okay, so you're gonna
           make that just so you

1115
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,716
              can just drop it  
          right into the feeder.

1116
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:08,118
  Exactly.                      
                 And that's     
               all she wrote.   

1117
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,452
             So now we're gonna 
                chill this...   
     Yes.                       

1118
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,653
            ...grind the spices.
   Right.                       

1119
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,989
Kosher salt, freshly-ground     
 pepper, dried sage.            

1120
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:14,724
                   Loves pork.  
 Granulated garlic.             

1121
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:15,992
              -Yep.             
          -Dried thyme.         

1122
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:17,994
       -T-T-Thyme. Onion?       
 -A little bit of onion powder, 

1123
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:19,595
rosemary, brown sugar,          

1124
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:22,232
a little bit of nutmeg,         
   cayenne pepper.              

1125
00:38:22,234 --> 00:38:23,733
Some nice, dried chilies.       

1126
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:24,934
             That's a great mix 
                you got, man.   

1127
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,402
Put a little plastic on it.     

1128
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:27,870
     If I don't,                
then it all goes up here        

1129
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,072
  and then I got to             
 scrape it all out.             

1130
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:30,206
       It's not his first rodeo.

1131
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:33,076
We start on low speed           
and work our way up.            

1132
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:37,213
That is awesome. He's pulverized
              this into a dust. 

1133
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:39,215
         You're just gonna blend
       all throughout that pork.

1134
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:41,151
              This is like pro  
            pork sausage making.

1135
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,819
         Good fat to meat ratio.
          That's just primetime.

1136
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,222
Now a cup of ice water.         
                Adding moisture.

1137
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:47,424
             If not, you'll cook
              all your fat out  

1138
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:48,958
          and you'll be a little
          bit on the drier side.

1139
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,094
     -About a 3-ounce patty.    
    -Good looking patty, man.   

1140
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:52,095
                Now we'll go    
                cook 'em up?    

1141
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:53,229
             A little olive oil 
                 in the pan,    

1142
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,165
             and let those cook 
             for a few minutes. 

1143
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,833
                  Flip 'em over.
  Looks money.                  

1144
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,435
      Got some homemade biscuits

1145
00:38:58,437 --> 00:39:01,170
and homemade country            
white gravy, homemade sausage.  

1146
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,639
             Look at that. Mmm. 
               Delicious, man.  

1147
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,642
     The sausage is super moist,
            not overly seasoned.

1148
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,845
                Killer gravy.   
               Nice and silky.  

1149
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,513
         That is great.         
      -Biscuits and gravy.      

1150
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,847
     A great country gravy.     

1151
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,784
    -The sausage is amazing.    
       -Burger with fries.      

1152
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:16,052
             WOMAN:             
  Great people and great food,  

1153
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:17,454
         it just brings         
     the community together.    

1154
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:19,656
   FIERI: Exactly what owners   
        John Pickerel...        

1155
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:20,723
Have you had this one           
       before?                  

1156
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,525
        ...and his wife,        
       Melanie Bajakian...      

1157
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,394
How are you today?              
       ...were going for.       

1158
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:26,863
            A place where people
             could come to meet 

1159
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,665
                  and come      
            on a frequent basis.

1160
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:31,868
And the folks are comin' for all
  the pizza they're firing up,  

1161
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,736
       with a custom-made       
         oven for pies,         

1162
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:34,937
  like prosciutto and basil...  

1163
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:37,006
     Very good. I definitely    
          recommend it.         

1164
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:39,008
    -...classic pepperoni...    
     -Pepperoni and cheese!     

1165
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,343
       FIERI: ...and even       
         herb-seasoned,         

1166
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:43,012
      fresh-roasted chicken     
     for this fan favorite.     

1167
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:45,882
   -Chicken pizza coming out.   
-The chicken's moist and tender.

1168
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,885
Chicken pizza.                  
        The crust is thin       
     and crispy and perfect.    

1169
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,887
     FIERI: And made totally    
          from scratch.         

1170
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,489
 Okay. Pizza dough.             
                  Give it to me.

1171
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:54,290
      Start off                 
with our cold water,            

1172
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:57,026
extra virgin olive oil,         
kosher salt, dry yeast.         

1173
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:59,095
We use a really small           
amount of yeast, too,           

1174
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:00,563
because it's gonna be           
in there for two days.          

1175
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,965
  With the cold water, the yeast
        is now starting to grow.

1176
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:05,235
Right. We're gonna add          
our flour, and then local,      

1177
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:07,570
  whole-wheat flour             
from Woodland, California.      

1178
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,373
Let's turn this baby on.        
It goes about 20 minutes.       

1179
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:11,975
              It's pulled away  
               from the bowl.   

1180
00:40:11,977 --> 00:40:14,110
Then we're gonna go right into  
making our pizza dough balls,   

1181
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:16,045
  portioning it out             
 to about 13 ounces,            

1182
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:18,114
set it in our pizza trays.      
                  Lookin' good. 

1183
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:19,582
  They're gonna go              
  into the walk-in.             

1184
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,451
                       Okay.    
These guys have been in         
the walk-in for two days.       

1185
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:24,120
A little moist to the touch.    
they're ready to be rolled out. 

1186
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:26,389
Dust it.                        
             And you're doing it
  with a sheeter versus by hand?

1187
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:29,125
We start if off this way, about 
two or three times through it,  

1188
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:30,793
and then I'll stretch           
it out a little bit,            

1189
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,795
put a little cornmeal           
   on my pie tin.               

1190
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,330
Now we're ready to top it.      
                        Okay.   

1191
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:36,732
So put some mozzarella,         
     whole-milk,                

1192
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,535
oven-roasted chicken.           
    Not too much.               

1193
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:40,136
               No sauce on this?
      No sauce.                 

1194
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:42,605
  Some spinach that             
we roasted in the oven.         

1195
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,741
Garlic cloves poached in        
a little bit of olive oil,      

1196
00:40:44,743 --> 00:40:46,943
the provolone will be           
  the last topping.             

1197
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,077
             Should've made one 
                for yourself.   

1198
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,947
    Ready to go.                
                     Set it up. 

1199
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,415
       I've seen some big ovens.

1200
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:55,351
I've never seen one on a trailer
    that you tow behind a truck.

1201
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:58,354
      FIERI: This thing is      
 smokin' hot -- 650 on the deck.

1202
00:40:58,356 --> 00:40:59,822
         Should come up         
       in about 3 minutes.      

1203
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:02,225
     -Ready to bring it out.    
      -Look at this thing.      

1204
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:03,559
        Really good looking pie.

1205
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,562
Get a little bit of garlic oil  
  around the edges,             

1206
00:41:05,564 --> 00:41:09,232
sprinkle some fresh herbs,      
some freshly-grated cheese.     

1207
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:11,166
   Okay.                        
             Good looking crust.

1208
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:14,036
        Mmm. I like the spinach.
 Can't beat the roasted chicken.

1209
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:16,039
                Great crust,    
            dynamite pizza oven.

1210
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:18,374
             Package deal, man. 
          It's across the board.

1211
00:41:18,376 --> 00:41:20,176
             Congrats, brother. 
Brick chicken pizza.            

1212
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:23,045
   The chicken is a little bit  
 salty, the cheese is fabulous. 

1213
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:25,314
        -Perfectly crisp.       
     -Biscuits and sausage.     

1214

         hometown feel.

          on how to do it right.

  So, that's it for this trip,  
        but don't worry.

  joints all over the country.

    out the ro--                

1228
