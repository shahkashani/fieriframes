we're talking about.            

130
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:37,809
    It started 21 years ago,    

131
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,744
   when Bob and Donna Creager   
          got married.

As a wedding gift, my father    
gave me this little shack.

00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:55,360
We started just a grill and     
exhaust system and a register.  

138
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:56,828
    And learned real quick...

      I mean, we're almost      
      tartare, right there.     
So that goes back               
on the grill,                   

159
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,469

in the seasoning, too.

         -...to Italian.        

768
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,281
   -Spaghetti and meatball up.  
        -Classic recipe.        

769
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:27,017
-Even this New England standard.
     -Lobster roll and fry.     

770
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,620
 -Lobster roll's the real deal. 
  -Lobster roll in the window.  

771
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:32,222
            Get about 500 pounds
    of lobsters flown in a week.

772
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,556
Get your own little plane       
      for that.                 

773
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:34,825
     All right.                 
So give me the lowdown.         

774
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:37,027
Okay, some boiling water.       
     Salt it up.                

775
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,963
Then, into the pool.            
About 10, 11 minutes.           

776
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:42,199
 Lobsters are ready.            
Put these in the ice bath.      

777
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,566
   -Stop the cooking process.   
              -Yep.             

778
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:44,902
     And these will cool for    
        a minute or two.        

779
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:47,371
 Lobsters are done.             
This is gonna be awesome.       

780
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:49,506
                Pull it out.    
             Pop off the claws, 

781
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,574
       pop off the tail, dice up
     the tail meat, large chunk,

782
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:52,776
              split the claws.  

783
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,712
You got a lot of texture        
coming out of the tail meat.    

784
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:56,713
   It's real nice               
and buttery here in the claw.   

785
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,782
    Nice balance.               
Now goes into a bowl.           

786
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,118
              And then we make  
      the lobster roll dressing.

787
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,320
Holy bucket of mayonnaise,      
       Batman.                  

788
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,455
     -Chopped onion, celery.    
       -Nice dice on that.      

789
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,791
     Yeah. Lemon juice, paprika,
             some salt, pepper. 

790
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,060
     -And we just mix it up.    
       -Nice lobster roll.      

791
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:12,062
You have these shipped in,      
 or someone make --             

792
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:13,597
       -We do, East Coast.      
             -Nice.             

793
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,132
Going a little bit of clarified 
butter on the flat top.         

794
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,401
       -Let them toast up.      
           -All right.          

795
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:19,670
            Good, healthy dollop
                of dressing.    

796
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:21,337
                 We mix them    
             to order each time.

797
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,806
It seems like it should         
  be a two bunner.              

798
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,408
              Nah, you want 'em 
                overflowing.    

799
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,410
          I don't want to get it
                on your hand.   
 I was off.                     

800
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:29,546
       [ Both snickering ]      

801
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:30,947
  Do I want a fork?             

802
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,282
Do you guys think at home       
   I want to talk?              

803
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:33,550
Absolutely not. Wow.            

804
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:35,152
  I want to be able             
to taste the lobster.           

805
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,820
I don't want to have            
too much going on there.        

806
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,355
  It's really good.             
The fact that you guys          

807
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,223
are doing this fresh -- pretty  
impressive, man. Nice job.      

808
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,825
                   SERVER:      
        Lobster roll with fries?

809
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,494
    Just like a lobster roll    
           from Maine.          

810
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,362
 This is everything             
but the salt air, you know?     

811
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:47,431
          -Skirt steak.         
    -All the food is so good.   

812
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:49,299
    -It's a cool place to be.   
       -Full rack of ribs.      

813
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:51,168
            What's your favorite
             item on the menu?  
      Herb roasted chicken?     

814
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,570
  MAN: You can tell these guys  
    slow roast their chicken.   

815
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:55,505
        Do it real right.       
 -What are we gonna make, chef? 

816
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,441
                 Herb butter    
   for the herb roasted chicken.

817
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,309
   A lot of butter              
for a lot of chicken.           

818
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,711
      We do everything big here.
                 All right.     

819
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:02,713
      Softened, unsalted butter.

820
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:04,448
        Start the mixer.        
      Some garlic, shallot.     

821
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,383
           -Shallots.           
        -Chopped chives.        

822
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:08,418
     Some chive.                
Chive just keeps that color.    

823
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,054
Keeps its little form.          

824
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:11,521
         -Some parsley.         
          -Lemon juice?         

825
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,923
       -Lemon juice. Yes.       
             -Nice.             

826
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:14,925
                Salt, pepper,   
             turn it up to two. 

827
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:16,060
               And that's it.   

828
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:18,328
And that gets a chance          
to marry in a day's time.       

829
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,863
             -Yeah.             
-Okay, take that. And off we go.

830
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:20,864
           -That's it.          
           -All right.          

831
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,132
            So we're gonna truss
                  and brine     

832
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:23,666
             some whole chickens
           before we roast them.

833
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,335
  Truss and brine.              
     I like it.                 

834
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:27,204
               Wings go back,   
              across the legs.  

835
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,540
More you keep this all together,
the better it's gonna cook      

836
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:30,874
and the more you're going       
to hold in the juices.          

837
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,676
These things are just going     
to be full of flavor.           

838
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:34,611
                    Yeah,       
        we put them in bus tubs.

839
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:36,747
       Then let's make the brine
   for the herb roasted chicken.

840
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:39,149
  We get some brown sugar, salt,
             some whole cloves. 

841
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:40,550
        Whole black peppercorns.

842
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,019
     Go for it.                 
 A little bay leaf.             

843
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:44,287
   -And then, a grip of water.  
            -A grip?            

844
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,089
        It's about five gallons.
                 Then whisk.    

845
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,557
                   It goes      
               over the birds.  

846
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,425
We're gonna brine this          
  for about a day?              

847
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:52,096
           -24 hours.           
    -So the brine, 24 hours.    

848
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:53,630
      Give them                 
 a little shake dry.            

849
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,032
      -Oh, this is awesome.     
  -Olive oil. Rub it in there.  

850
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,433
                  Add salt.     
         A little bit of pepper.

851
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,236
           And in the oven about
                 40 minutes.    

852
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,838
      -350 in a convection?     
              -Yep.             

853
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,041
Okay, let's rock and roll.      
           Pop it on the cutting
                 board here.    

854
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,176
             Cut off the string,
        take it down at the leg,

855
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:07,711
        We're just gonna mark it
              on the grill now. 

856
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:09,979
  Brush it with some herb butter
           that we made earlier.

857
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:11,582
        -Copious amounts.       
           -Of course.          

858
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,051
 Nice.                          
     Flip it over, brush it with
          some more herb butter.

859
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:16,720
       It's gonna go with mashed
potatoes and sautéed vegetables.

860
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:18,122
 Okay. Looking good,            
    feeling good?               

861
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:20,523
       -Yep, feeling good.      
       -Oh, look at that.       

862
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,927
So you hit the butter confection
   onto the bird.               

863
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,663
You also slathered it           
     on the veg.                

864
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:28,398
              -Yep.             
   -Hmm. Cooked to perfection.  

865
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,868
Mm! I try to tell folks         
 this all the time.             

866
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,736
Might say roasted chicken --    
       mm! --                   

867
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:36,139
  but there's such              
 a wide spectrum...             

868
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,742
of what it really is            
and what it really can be.      

869
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:40,744
Right there, my friend,         
that's what it can be.          

870
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:43,080
  That's dynamite.              
   Out of bounds.               

871
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:44,948
 -Marking herb roasted chicken. 
             -Tasty.            

872
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,751
   Chicken has a nice, juicy,

873
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,353
        The herbs really

    little corner of Mexico.    

919

      -Two chicharron taco.     
  -Very authentic Mexican food.

     -The tacos are awesome.

   -This is my favorite food.

       That's one of the biggest
     taco trucks I've ever seen.

924

      -It's about 35 feet.      

925
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:52,776
 FIERI: But when Rene Valenzuela
   opened this joint in '91...  

926
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:54,177
       First,                   
we looked at cargo vans,        

927
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:55,645
  some little vans,             
some little trailers.           

928
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,047
      We needed                 
  a bigger kitchen.             

929
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:58,114
      Order up.                 

930
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,182
    FIERI: So they got a bus.   

931
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:00,783
 Carne asada burrito            
     coming up.                 

932
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,319
         And since '99,         

933
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:04,655
        Rene is using it        
    to crank out the classics   

934
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:06,589
 he grew up cooking in Mexico...

935
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,591
     Fish tacos.                

936
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,058
We wanted to do food            
that's very authentic,          

937
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,260
very deep in Mexico.            

938
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,595
    ...from fried pork rinds    
       with salsa verde...      

939
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,665
           It's spicy.          
        It's really good.       

940
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:18,135
             FIERI:             
   ...to the Mexican classics   
 with a little vegetarian spin. 

941
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:21,738
  For me, it's the healthy food 
        is what sold me.        

942
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,273
I'm having the veggie burrito   
right now, and it's amazing.    

943
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,476
       My new favorite is       
  the butternut squash tostada. 

944
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:29,813
    FIERI: Yeah. He's putting   
 butternut squash on a tostada. 

945
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:32,082
VALENZUELA: It's still Mexican. 
It's not well known,            

946
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:35,084
and that's something unique     
that brings you to Mexico.      

947
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,887
       -This is delicious.      
          -The squash.          

948
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:38,889
      You wait until you try it.
              It's famous here. 
    Okay.                       

949
00:32:38,891 --> 00:32:40,690
                  We start      
   with butternut squash, fresh.

950
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,492
              Just gonna cut it 
             into large pieces. 

951
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:44,560
 -And where is this recipe from?
            -Yucatan.           

952
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:46,829
So that's it, boil it with      
the seeds and everything in it? 

953
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:47,831
             -Right.            
       -Down in the water?      

954
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:48,965
         -That's right.         
           -How long?           

955
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,633
        Once it boils, about two
              or three minutes. 

956
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,902
           It's got to be tender
              but not too much  

957
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:53,837
             because, otherwise,
             it gets all mushy. 

958
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,438
Don't want to get it mushy.     
     All right.                 

959
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,374
 So now it's boiled             
and cooled a little bit.        

960
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:58,775
   Now we're gonna              
 take the seeds out?            

961
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:00,243
             Right. We also got 
           to take the skin out.

962
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:01,911
    -We're gonna chop it up?    
             -Right.            

963
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:02,980
And what's the next step?       

964
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:05,181
               We're gonna put  
    a little bit of oil, onions.

965
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:08,118
        -Red bell pepper.       
  -Tomatoes, habanero peppers.  

966
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,119
    [ Whistles ]                

967
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:10,453
             I'm gonna put just 
             a little bit before

968
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,522
     I add the butternut squash.

969
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:14,190
            -Squash.            
   -Now, the butternut squash   

970
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:15,859
                is gonna get    
           a little softer here.

971
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:16,994
     We're gonna                
  just cook it down             

972
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,528
so it's a little bit            
    more tender?                
                   That's right.

973
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,529
           -We ready?           
          -We're ready.         

974
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,264
             So we're gonna top 
            our tostada with it.

975
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,266
Looks like he's putting         
a fruit cocktail on there.      

976
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:26,336
       Now put tomatoes, onions,
            cilantro and cheese.

977
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,405
          There you go.         
         -That's a lot.         

978
00:33:28,407 --> 00:33:32,075
               You can do it.   
                There you go.   

979
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:34,411
It's got good texture.          
Tostada is nice and crunchy,    

980
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:37,914
  and the squash is             
not fall-apart soft.            

981
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,951
The mixture of the red bell     
pepper and the onions           

982
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,020
 and that little bit            
   of the habanero              

983
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,690
   was really done              
   the right way.               

984
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:47,891
 I'd order it again             
   in a heartbeat.              

985
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:49,692
           -All right.          
       -It's really nice.       

986
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,027
           -Thank you.          
   -Butternut squash tostada.   

987
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,229
    It's crispy, very light.    

988
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:56,233
   Great flavor you can't find  
       at a lot of places.      

989
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:58,535
            Two tacos chicharron
     y speciale, rice and beans.

990
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,237
   MAN: The Taco Bus, there's   
  really nothing else like it.  

991
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:02,906
        This one was here       
  before food trucks were cool. 

992
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:04,373
  The nice thing is             
we don't move it around.        

993
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,442
 People can find it.

     Anytime, day or night.     

995
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,445
  If you come here at 4:00 a.m.,
               they're hungry.  

996
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,381
              They're all part  
             of Taco Bus Nation.

997
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,782
  Wait. Wait. Wait.             
How late are they open?         

998
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,317
             They're open 24/7.

              Cochinita pibil.  

1001
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:17,921
   It's the best Mexican food   
        in West Florida.        

1002
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:19,255
              Two steak tacos.  

1003
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,258
Anybody that's into this kind of
   food knows about Taco Bus?   

1004
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,525
             -Yeah.             
        -Oh, absolutely.        

1005
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:25,528
  -Can I get a torta chilorio?  
    -I can go home now, dude.   

1006
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,532
         We'll wrap up the torta
  for lunch later, for lunching.

1007
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:30,333
    Do me a favor               
 and wrap up the bus            

1008
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,469
and take it to my casa.         

1009
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:34,404
           -All right.          
           -The bomb.           

1010
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,805
           Up next...           

1011

       I've got something       
    for all of your cravings.   

1012
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:40,143
     I think you're gonna be    
     really surprised, Guy.     

1013
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:41,478
    -Delicious. Really nice.    
             -Yeah?             

1014
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,680
 And I would absolutely eat that
         on a flip flop.        

1015
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:45,082
That's one of my favorites      
  of all of these.              

1016
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:46,083

        and wicked smoky.       

1019

       Hi, Guy and Hunter.      
 This is Peggy from New Jersey. 

1026
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:13,009
   My husband and I have been   
to several "Triple D" locations,

1027
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:15,145
    and by far, our favorite    

1028
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:18,348
     is The Meatball Stoppe     
      in Orlando, Florida.      

1029
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:22,619
  I highly recommend everybody  
      get there right now.      

1030
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:23,886
 Not only is the food delicious,

1031
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,688
       but they are truly       
       like family to us.       

1032
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,491
We were there in October for our
    10th wedding anniversary,   

1033
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,293
   and my mom had passed away.  

1034
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,962
     We went there for lunch    
   because I needed a mom hug,  

1035
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,398
           and I truly          
     got that from Isabella.    

1036
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,300
        Isabella and Jeff       
        pulled up chairs.       

1037
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,635
 They sat at the table with us, 

1038
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:42,305
   and we just shared memories  
   of our wonderful families.   

1039
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,040
     I think they have over     
      a dozen meatballs now     

1040
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:47,043
    to pick from -- each one    
    is better than the next.    

1041
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:51,113
   And it is always so hard to  
figure out what you want to eat.

1042
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:55,919
    They have the best pasta,   
    the best soups, polenta,    

1043
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:57,453
      which is to die for.      

1044
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:00,256
   And I would absolutely eat   
      that on a flip-flop.      

1045
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,058
   And I hope that if you get   
        a chance to visit       

1046
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,726
       The Meatball Stoppe      
      in Orlando, Florida,      

1047
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:06,129
  that you tell them I said hi. 

1048
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:07,797
             That was a good -- 
    That was just down to Earth.

1049
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,799
That's one of my favorites      
  of all of these.              

1050
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:10,934
          That's really awesome.

1051
00:36:10,936 --> 00:36:13,537
That was just genuine,          
 right to the point.            

1052
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:15,805
 And then, to throw             
a little flip-flop at the end...

1053
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,807
   And I would absolutely eat   
      that on a flip-flop.      

1054
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,811
  Yeah, straight from the heart.
                  Love it.      

1055
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:23,213
