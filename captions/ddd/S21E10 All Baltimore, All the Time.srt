1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,133
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,601
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:07,005
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,340
          This trip...          

5
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,876
What in the wild, wild world    
of sports is going on here?     

6
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:12,077
 ...the Camaro's headed east... 

7
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,412
         Let me get in.         

8
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:15,414
       ...for a big taste       
     of Baltimore, Maryland.    

9
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,616
 One of our favorite            
  "Triple D" towns.             

10
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,151
            First...            

11
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:20,953
That is no fakin' bacon         
    right there.                

12
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:23,021
        ...a place going        
        farm-to-table...        

13
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,289
This is what everybody          
   is looking for.              

14
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,892
      ...getting meticulous     
         with the meat.         

15
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,293
     I'm a freak                
   for the cheek.               

16
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,229
       Then across town...      
Looks like me dancing.          

17
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:32,097
        ...a family-owned       
         local legend...        

18
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,099
That's outrageous.              
          ...cooking up         
        coastal classics.       

19
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:37,569
I come to Maryland, I want the  
bomb crab cakes, you deliver.   

20
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:40,639
     And in the Fell's Point    
         neighborhood...        
Let's get after this.           

21
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,374
     ...a joint dishing out     
         killer pizza...        

22
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,444
Can't go wrong.                 
    ...alongside a wild vibe.   

23
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:46,845
This is like you said,          

24
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:50,181
"One day I'm gonna put up       
all cool skateboard stuff       

25
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,051
and have beer, and all my       
friends can come over."         

26
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:55,386
     That's all right here,     
    right now on "Triple D."    

29
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:10,669
  I'm here in Baltimore, a town 
   known for a lot of things.   

30
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:13,071
       Let's see, you got       
  the Super Bowl champ Ravens,  

31
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,407
      you got the Orioles,      
    you got the Inner Harbor,   

32
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,743
   you got my new restaurant,   
        Guy's Baltimore,        

33
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,211
    in the Horseshoe Casino,    

34
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:22,014
 but do you really think about  
 this town for a farm-to-table? 

35
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:23,882
         Well, you will         
   after you visit this joint.  

36
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:24,983
       This is Clementine.      

37
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:32,691
    Comfort food on steroids.   
                     Burger up! 

38
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,426
    Like a nice neighborhood    
         sort of place.         

39
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,830
             FIERI:             
 Exactly the kind of place chef 
 and owner Winston Blick wanted 

40
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:39,631
    when he opened this joint   
             in '08.            

41
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,032
Tell me about the name          
      Winston.                  

42
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,168
        That's an inherited name
           from my grandfather. 

43
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,903
       My mother was supposed to
              be Winston Page.  

44
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,705
   That would have              
    been awkward.               

45
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:48,640
            She's Winifred Page.

46
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:51,043
Winnie's a great name. I've got 
a good friend named Winnie.     

47
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:53,378
     Hi, Winnie.                

48
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,113
What kind of restaurant         
   is Clementine?               

49
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,382
        Primarily farm-to-table.

50
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:58,784
  He really respects the meat.  

51
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:02,454
    It is processed and aged    
       and cured in-house.      

52
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,922
                Meatloaf up!    

53
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,324
   The bacon-wrapped meatloaf   
           is awesome.          

54
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:10,062
    WOMAN: The bacon grease     
    drips into the meatloaf.    

55
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:11,596
         It's delicious.        

56
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,265
I assume you're gonna make      
   your own bacon.              

57
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,600
                  Exactly.      

58
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:15,867
That's a good-looking pig.      

59
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:19,238
    We are first gonna trim away
    some of what we don't need. 

60
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,872
      We're gonna use all of it,

61
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,609
 but we're not gonna be using it
            for the pork belly. 

62
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,411
   Now we're gonna              
    give it a...                
                    Dry rub.    

63
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:29,147
                Brown sugar.    
                Kosher salt.    

64
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,616
                  Cinnamon.     
                Ground glove.   

65
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,552
                  Cayenne.      
            Ground black pepper.

66
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,354
           And some curing salt.

67
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:38,289
Let the dry rub sit on there    
     for a week?                

68
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,958
                    Yep.        

69
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,426
And then what's gonna happen    
when this comes out?            

70
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:42,694
                We smoke it.    

71
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:43,762
  What kind of wood             
 we smoking it with?            

72
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,764
               Usually alder.   

73
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,032
Let's get in the meatloaf.      

74
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:51,036
        We begin with a panade, 
        which is bread and milk.

75
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:53,305
                Ground chuck.   

76
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,040
               Ground brisket.  

77
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:57,242
             Ground short rib --
               a coarse grind.  

78
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,711
Little textural difference.     
                        Exactly.

79
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:02,180
                   One egg      
             per pound of meat. 

80
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,549
 Good little ratio.             
And the sweated mirepoix.       

81
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,650
                  Mirepoix.     

82
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,653
               Smoked paprika.  
                   Cumin.       

83
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:09,454
                Chili powder.   

84
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,456
           Worcestershire sauce.

85
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,392
           Coarse ground pepper.
                Kosher salt.    

86
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,995
                  And mix.      

87
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,997
          That's it right there.

88
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,866
       We are gonna slice bacon.

89
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,804
Mmm. I can smell the smoke      
  on that already.              

90
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,874
    There we go.                

91
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,809
       Doctor.                  

92
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,945
                  And then      
           we lay out our bacon.

93
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,814
That is no fakin' bacon         
    right there.                

94
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:39,017
                Then we apply   
           the meatloaf mixture.

95
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,086
             Make sort of a log.
                 That's it.     

96
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,789
     Now we're gonna wrap it up.

97
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,359
Now we're done. Go in the oven. 
     What temp?                 

98
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,094
              350, 45 minutes.  

99
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,563
    Bring it out,               
    let it cool?                
                       Yes.     

100
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,165
   Let it congeal.              

101
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,500
Slice it in portions, and how   
do we reheat it for service?    

102
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,602
                We reheat it    
            on a sizzle platter.

103
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,104
     What are we                
gonna serve it with?            

104
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:02,640
     Start with mashed potatoes 
     with smoked Gouda cheese...

105
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,909
             greens as in kale. 

106
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,044
    Look at that.               

107
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,447
           That is the meatloaf.

108
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:11,016
That's a healthy portion        
       there.                   

109
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,319
 And a little gravy.            

110
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:18,456
          Mushroom, rye whiskey,
            and a little cream. 

111
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,092
         Bacon wrapped meatloaf.

112
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,964
The greens are out of bounds.   
And I mean outrageous.          

113
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:30,368
Mmm. The mashed potatoes        
    are on point.               

114
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,939
 This is fantastic.             
        Mmm.                    

115
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,275
And the meatloaf is up there    
in the best meatloafs I've had. 

116
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,544
 You let that bacon             
 just cook through,             

117
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,146
really bring that flavor in.    

118
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,014
That just takes you home.       

119
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:46,952
I mean, that is just real good, 
 simple comfort food            

120
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,353
done incredibly well.           

121
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,021
                I appreciate it.
Seriously, man.                 

122
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,756
          I truly appreciate it.
The bomb.                       

123
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,626
   The bacon wrapped around it  
makes it really moist and juicy.

124
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,361
        And taste exactly       
         like it should.        

125
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,696
              MAN:              
 The savory aspects of the bacon

126
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,564
     tied into the sweetness    
         of the meatloaf        

127
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,700
 just makes it really excellent.

128
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:04,435
I got to start a show called,   
like, "The Baltimore All-Stars."

129
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,705
   To kick it off,              
my buddies Bob and Donna,       

130
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:10,909
who have the best pit beef,     
in my opinion -- Chaps Pit Beef.

131
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,778
 How many years ago             
did we shoot "Triple D" there?  

132
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,981
              2008.             
  So out of a place             
that serves primarily meat,     

133
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,048
  you're down here              
  having meatloaf.              

134
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,249
How is it?                      
         It's delicious.        

135
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,118
         Couldn't do any better.
       So are the greens.       

136
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,586
The greens are the bomb.        

137
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,455
           Of course,           
    you know this character,    

138
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,257
       the wonderful Sofia      
        from Sip & Bite.        

139
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,793
       One of the craziest      
 that you'll find in Baltimore, 

140
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:30,328
   you see this farm-to-table   
     attitude in this place.    

141
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,864
 You see more of that happening 
          in Baltimore?         

142
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:36,668
Yes, a lot more organic         
and more locally grown.         

143
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,403
       I think Baltimore's      
  becoming a food destination.  

144
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:39,404
     We hope so.                

145
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:45,076
 Winston is a person with a lot 
  of integrity about his food,  

146
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,878
   and that's why we eat here.  

147
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,212
       FIERI:                   
Now, when we come back,         

148
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:52,617
chef has got a pig treat for us 
made out of the cheeks.         

149
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,619
   Asian-braised pork cheeks.   

150
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,287
            Might be            
    one of my favorite cuts.    

151
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,423
        Another home run.       
You guys ready for this?        

152
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,324
    We'll see you               
  in a little bit.              

153
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,830
    Welcome back.               

154
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,832
"Triple D" hanging out          
in Baltimore, Maryland,         

155
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,834
 one of our favorite            
  "Triple D" towns              

156
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,103
 that you can find              
 with Chef Winston,             

157
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,239
who has this funky joint        
 called Clementine.             

158
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,042
      This place is one of      
      the cornerstones of       
      this neighborhood.        

159
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:20,178
            The vibe            
  is comfortable and friendly.  

160
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,581
  The food is outstanding here. 

161
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,650
From his charcuterie room       
to making his own bacon         

162
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,787
to taking now the cheeks        
from the head of the hog.       

163
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,989
       One of my favorite       
          cuts of pork.         

164
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,790
               Pork cheeks up!  

165
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,525
      It's a little sweet,      
      it's a little savory.     

166
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,128
  It's an extremely comforting  
           dish to me.          

167
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,864
                What we have    
           is the head of a hog.

168
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,399
It's a cheeky fellow.           

169
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:45,270
      One of the most flavorful 
   and lean cuts are the cheeks.

170
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:46,738
              That's the cheek. 

171
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,073
     I'm a freak                
   for the cheek.               

172
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,677
   We're gonna add black pepper.
               Chopped garlic.  

173
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,880

174

                 Palm sugar.    
              And kosher salt.  

175
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,551
And how long are we             
gonna let this cure?            

176
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,419
                 Overnight.     

177
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,555
So the cheeks have had their day
to sit there with the rub.      

178
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,490
      We add Kaffir lime leaves.

179
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:08,826
   Bruise them some just to get 
some more fragrance out of them.

180
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,296
                 Lemongrass.    
               Minced garlic.   

181
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,364
              Black peppercorn. 

182
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:13,865
    Lots of it.                 
    I like that.                

183
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,301

              Sweet soy sauce.

               The pork stock.

Just about halfway up.

 Okay, let's do it.

00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:32,717
         Coconut rice, bok choy,

 Just falling apart.            

194

             Little green onion 
                and cilantro.

   that cheek is.               

198

You get the richness            
of this heritage pork...        

199
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,546

233
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,592
     That was 40 years ago.     

234
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:22,127
   Now they've turned it into   

235
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,528
       a super-successful       
       seafood restaurant       

236
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,997
   that seats over 500 people,  

237
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,932
and the crab cakes are the bomb!

238
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,701
 This is Jimmy's Famous Seafood.

239
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,339
             Seafood Ecstasy up!

240
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,210
          Their seafood         
   has always been top-notch.   

241
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:42,180
     It's a family business.    

242
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,182
       The recipes have         
       been carried on for      
       a number of years.       

243
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,687
      FIERI: Those recipes      
   come from Jimmy Minidakis,   

244
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,090
 who opened this place in 1974, 

245
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,225
       raising his family       
      on the second floor.      

246
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:58,296
     And since his passing,     
    his sons and wife, Foula,   

247
00:09:58,298 --> 00:09:59,764
   are carrying on his legacy.  

248
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,832
               Got mussels up!  

249
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,767
         It's a blessing        

250
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,902
    to carry one man's dream    
   that started with nothing.   

251
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,371
You're the chef?                
              Yes.              

252
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,906
 You're the manager,            
 front of the house,            

253
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,108
and you're the boss.            
            Backbone.           

254
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,309
I know who the boss is.         

255
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,778
          Crab cake up!         

256
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,713
 MAN: It's always worth a trip  
 to come down to East Baltimore 

257
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,449
  and have a Jimmy's crab cake. 

258
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,251
   The crab cake is literally   
     the size of a baseball.    

259
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:22,520
      All lump, no filling.     

260
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,990
Now, whose recipe is this?      
                       Father's.

261
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:27,258
   So we're gonna take about 30 
 eggs, give them a little whisk.

262
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,861
          Next up -- mayonnaise.

263
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,863
              I'll mix that up. 

264
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,865
            We're gonna go with 
       our Worcestershire Sauce.

265
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,333
   Worcestershire.              

266
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,068
        Okay.                   

267
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,737
                Black pepper.   

268
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,271
                 Rock salt.     
     Okay.                      

269
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,873
              House seasoning.  
  Not too much.                 

270
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,209
                Dry mustard.    
                Wet mustard.    

271
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,878
    And next up?                

272
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,413
 Now we're ready to start making
               the crab cakes.  

273
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,815
         The crab is local from 
  the eastern shore of Maryland.

274
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,852
So what goes first?             
            First, couple ladles
                of the sauce.   

275
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,821
           Chopped bread crumbs.

276
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,356
                  Parsley.      

277
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,624
                  Crabmeat.     

278
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:05,763
By weight, this is 95% crab,    
5% binding ingredient.          

279
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,498
 That's outrageous.             

280
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,368
   Now we're gonna make the crab
   cakes into 8-ounce portions. 

281
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:14,105
That's how big it is?           
What is it, like crab meatloaf? 

282
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,706
                Pretty much.    

283
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,610
  Put our house seasoning on top
    and a little bit of butter. 

284
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:20,644
How we gonna cook it?           

285
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,281
                350 degrees,    
              about 15 minutes. 

286
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:27,986
           Here's our crab cake.

287
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,787
How many come with an order?    
                     One or two.

288
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:30,921
 Let's just do one.             

289
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,324
I've got to watch this          
petite dancer's figure.         

290
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,660
       We're gonna serve it with
       our house-made crackers. 

291
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,731
                Tartar sauce.   
             Our cocktail sauce.

292
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,539
 That's ridiculous.             
Look at the size of that lump?  

293
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,208
It doesn't need to be           
 dipped in anything.            

294
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,476
Here's the deal, bro.

   There's places               
   that you go to               

297
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:56,281
'cause they've been around      
      forever.                  

298
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:57,882
       This is                  
 that kind of place.            

299
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:01,218
I come to Maryland, I want the  
bomb crab cakes, you deliver.   

300
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,620
                Thanks, bro.    
   Nice job.                    

301
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,824
           The outside          
      is absolutely crispy,     

302
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:08,960
   and then you prick into it,  
 and it's nothing but crabmeat.

             ahead of his time.

authentic things really were,

00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,466
And then really good food,      
      as well.                  

459
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,535
    MAN: You can get burgers,   

460
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,070
     you can get appetizers     
     like the risotto balls.    

461
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:29,473
      Gooey on the inside,      
     crispy on the outside,     

462
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,875
and the perfect pre-pizza snack.

463
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,945
     All right,                 
let's get after this.           

464
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:34,946
              So risotto balls. 

465
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,147
       Little bit of canola oil.

466
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:38,216
      Go in with some mushrooms.

467
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,818
                 Go in with     
          a little yellow onion.

468
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,486
               Veggie seasoning.
Little veggie seasoning?        

469
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,423
      Little bit of kosher salt.
          Little bit of pepper. 

470
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,559
               Sauté that out   
      for three or four minutes.

471
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,628
               We're gonna add  
              our arborio rice. 

472
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,630
                  Let that      
           get a little toasted.

473
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,366
White wine?                     
        Whole lot of white wine.

474
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,901
                   Whole milk.  
   Whole milk.                  

475
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,903
Let this cook down...           
               About 15 minutes.

476
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,505
We're gonna add the Caesar Blend
  cheese, a little heavy cream. 

477
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,841
        After the risotto cooks 
       for about 15, 20 minutes,

478
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:07,245
        we add it to a hotel pan
        to cool in the walk-in. 

479
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:09,981
    There we go.                

480
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,515
The white wine in that --       
      gangster.                 

481
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,117
You didn't overcook it.         

482
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,721
     So we're gonna scoop, put a
     little divot in the center.

483
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:19,056
                [ Chuckles ]    
              Add some cheese.  

484
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,658
A little mozzarella cheese      
      surprise.                 

485
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,927
Drop in Italian breadcrumb.     
How many come with an order?    

486
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,062
                    Six.        

487
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,897
    I like this.                

488
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,466
                Risotto balls   
              are all finished. 

489
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,002
And what kind of sauce          
we serving them with?           

490
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,403
              Our pizza sauce.  

491
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:39,210
  It's good risotto             
   just by itself.              

492
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:42,013
Then you add a little bit       
of mozzarella cheese in it.     

493
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,548
   Lightly fried.               

494
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,482
Not even really fried --        
  just warming it.              

495
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,351
You get that wine and mushroom  
flavor coming through           

496
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,620
  from the risotto.             

497
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:53,156
Pizza sauce -- It's a nice,     
bright, fresh tomato flavor.    

498
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,292
                    Yeah.       

499
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:56,294
That's a nice, simple           
Arancini rice ball --           

500
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:57,628
whatever you call it.           

501
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,696
 Well done, brother.            

502
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,899
   The chef makes the risotto   
      at perfect al dente,      

503
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,836
and so you have this combination
          of textures.          

504
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:09,774
  Excellent for soaking up the  
drinks that you'll be consuming.

00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,049

Great food, great people.       

509

I'm friends with, like,         
half of the staff, and...

              half the country.

 Yeah, that's true.             

512
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,724
This is like when we were kids  
    and you said,               

513
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,061
"One day I'm gonna put up       
all cool skateboard stuff       

514
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,998
and play really awesome music   
and make pizza and have beer,   

515
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,067
 and all my friends             
   can come over."              

516
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,067
         I couldn't have said it
               better myself.   

517
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,869
   That's exactly               
   what this is.                

518
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,539
               That's exactly   
               what this is.    

519
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,807
   So, that's it for this road  
     trip, but don't worry.     

520
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,877
    We got plenty more joints   
 to find all over this country!
