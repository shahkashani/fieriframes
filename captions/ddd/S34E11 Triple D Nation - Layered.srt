        and tomato paste.       

353
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,889
        We use very nice,       
         fresh tomatoes.        

354
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,692

    want to use the outside.

             right off the bone.

365

             falls off the bone.

 and then bake them for an hour,

cooked together with the meat.
