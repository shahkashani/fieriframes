00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:03,602
 Hey, everybody. I'm Guy Fieri, 
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:06,538
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

3
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:08,073
          This trip...          

4
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,808
Let's get it on!                
                     Get it on! 

5
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:13,078
...we're sticking a knife       
into the craft movement of meat.

6
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:14,079
               I am a big fan   
                  of that.      

7
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:16,548
  In San Carlos, California...  

8
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,017
               Load up the car. 
   ...the Belgian beer pub...   

9
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:21,352
        Wait till you see this. 
    ...perfecting pastrami...   

10
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:23,088
         The things I got to do 
         for you guys at home.  

11
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,490
        ...and taking on        
        a Philly legend.        

12
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:26,825
           You sure you want    
       to go through with this? 

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,027
Got to go to Philly,            
        bro.                    

14
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:30,162
         The culinary assassin. 

15
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,632
   And in Portland, Oregon...   
                    Good to go. 

16
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,900
         ...a righteous         
       Americana joint...       

17
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:37,002
   Get after that!              

18
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,238
       ...going whole hog       
         tip to tail...         

19
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,572
         That should be illegal 
              right there.      

20
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:44,242
...right next to great-grandma's
      legit fried chicken.      

21
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,244
 Ready for your life            
   to be changed?               

22
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,311
                  Let's go,     
                   buddy.       

23
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:48,313
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

24
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:51,050
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

25
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:06,064
     I love food, and I know    
     that's pretty evident.     

26
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,867
  But there's particular types  
   of food that I really dig,   

27
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,402
   and pastrami's one of them.  

28
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:12,671
  I'm talking about old-school, 
       real-deal pastrami,      

29
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,739
  the kind of pastrami you get  
        on the East Coast       

30
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:15,874
   when you go to Katz's Deli   

31
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,543
     in the Lower East Side     
          of Manhattan.         

32
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,077
So, if you're on the West Coast,

33
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,213
      I hear you got to go      
   to San Carlos, California,   

34
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:24,082
   right between San Francisco  
          and San Jose          

35
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:26,285
   and check out this joint --  
           The Refuge.          

36
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:31,490
 Swiss and mustard.             

37
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:34,092
   Everybody is over the moon   
    about the pastrami here.    

38
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:35,560
     The Reuben.                

39
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,762
    It just really literally    
      melts in your mouth.      

40
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,564
     What do you think of this? 
It's the best.                  

41
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:40,298
 Like, you'd have a wedding cake
      made out of pastrami.     

42
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:41,834
      Oh, yeah.                 

43
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,635
 MAN: It must be the ingredients
           or the love          

44
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,703
      that they put into it     
    that makes it fantastic.    

45
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,772
             FIERI:             
    It's a little bit of both   

46
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:50,175
 'cause owner Matt Levin's been 
 working to perfect his recipe  

47
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:51,643
        since he was 16,        

48
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,913
   and the pastrami old guard   
          was no help.          

49
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,781
  Deli guys are -- They'll kick 
     you right out of there.    

50
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,317
 I had to figure it out myself. 

51
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,923
     FIERI: So he brought in    
      his own heavy hitter,     

52
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,591
     Chef Michael Greuel...     

53
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,661
     Tell me he doesn't look    
 just like a culinary assassin. 

54
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,734
 ...to give old-school pastrami 
    a try on the West Coast,    

55
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:20,739
  and they're piling it up high 
        on this sandwich.       

56
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,741
  Toasted slaw 19.              

57
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:23,675
                The flavor's    
                just amazing.   

58
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,544
             You can't beat it. 

59
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:26,545
                So, what are    
               we gonna make?   

60
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,747
GREUEL: We're gonna do          
    the Toasted 19,             

61
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,014
our pastrami sandwich.          

62
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,283
                So, it brines   
                 for a week,    

63
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:33,084
         then it gets coriander 
            and black pepper,   

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,686
         and then it gets smoked
              with hickory.     

65
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,954
    Mm-hmm.                     
                           Okay.

66
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,523
           We're gonna throw it 
           in the steamer now?  

67
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,159
          Okay, first,          
  we're gonna get the drip pan  

68
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,961
'cause we're gonna use this     
      for the lacquer           

69
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,229
     that we're                 
  gonna make later.             

70
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:45,998
                  The what-er?  
 The lacquer.                   

71
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,100
         All right, fire it up. 

72
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:49,234
But we've got to steam it       
     for four hours.            

73
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,169
                  Steam it      
               for four hours.

                Mother Mary.    

75
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,507
   Okay, somebody should get in 
        some heavy sponges      

76
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,976
             'cause this --     
         Wait till you see this.

77
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,182
     If you don't have anywhere 
            to put that,        

78
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,383
              you can put that  
                 in my car.

80
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,954
     Look at that, just tender. 

81
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,126
                  Michael,      
             that's outstanding.

82
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:19,131
               Whoa-oh, whew!   

83
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,133
You put the drippings           
     in the pan.                

84
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:24,269
    Brown sugar.                

85

    Black pepper.               

86
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,872
        And a cup of coriander. 
Correct.                        

87
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,207
Then reduce it.                 

88
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,942
     We're gonna reduce it more?

89
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:33,678
          Yes, by half          
 'cause it's making a "lacquer."

90
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:34,780
                A "lacquer."    

91
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,115
                  Okay.         

92
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:38,650
   Let's do this.               

93
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,552
  Then we trim off              
    all the fat.                

94
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:42,754
                Look at that.   

95
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,559
 What I do is I section it off, 
     dip it in the lacquer.     

96
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,160
  Then we slice it.             

97
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,762
             For every sandwich?

            of ridiculous.      

102
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,174
 So, now I'm toasting the bread 
         on the flattop.        

103
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,309

    coleslaw, Swiss.            

105
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,915

 we put the meat on.

          once a week.          

116
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,815
      WOMAN: Literally just     
   falls apart in your mouth.   

117
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,616
     It's a fix. [ Laughs ]     

118
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:47,152
             FIERI:             
       Addicting as it is,      

119
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,620
some people don't even come here
          for the food          

120
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:51,022
   because they also are known  

121
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,425
   for having 18 Belgian beers  
             on tap.            

122
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:56,094
        MAN: The pastrami       
      and burgers and fries     

123
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,030
      just seem to go great     
       with Belgian beer.       

124
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,665
  FIERI: Speaking of pastrami,  
       burgers, and fries,      

125
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,835
    Michael and Matt decided    
   that's a killer combo, too.  

126
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:04,836
The pastrami burger.            

127
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,572
 We're making the patty         
for the pastrami burger.        

128
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:08,740
                 Very nice.     

129
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:11,976
    I'm basically               
 gonna cure the meat            

130
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:13,311
with salt and pepper            
 before I grind it.             

131
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,913
So, I'm gonna let this cure     
    for a little while,         

132
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:15,914
and then we're gonna put it     
      in the grinder.           

133
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,182
              Okay, fire it up. 

134
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,517
         Beautiful red color -- 

135
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,719
             The meat was almost
             at a frozen state, 

136
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,521
       so it goes through nice, 
        doesn't smear the fat.  

137
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:24,456
                 That's it?     
                  One run?      

138
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,391
    One run.                    
                   Nicely done. 

139
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:27,925
       And now                  
       we'll make some patties. 

140
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,861
   All right, so,               
I put some oil down.            

141
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,063
It's gonna be a half pound      
      of burger meat.           

142
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,599
                 Seriously?     
             And why in the oil?

143
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,401
Because we're gonna put it      
   on the flattop next,         

144
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,271
 and it helps preserve the meat 
       a little bit more,       

145
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:42,240
       and it also gets it      
 so it doesn't stick to the pan.

146
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:46,011
    Throwing down               
  the butter first.             

147
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,879
                   Butter?      
                 Big burger.    

148
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,548
I'm gonna get a nice sear       
         on it.                 

149
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,083
I'm gonna press it down         
  just a little bit.            

150
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,087
                Look at that.   

151
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,490
Throwing down some butter.      

152
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:02,561
                 That crazy     
              Russian dressing? 

153
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,029
  That's the crazy              
  Russian dressing.             

154
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,630
Okay, I'm gonna slice           
  the pastrami now.             

155
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,170
     I dipped it                
   in the lacquer.              

156
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,505
   That's gonna go              
    on the base.                

157
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,708
 Melted Swiss cheese            
   on the burger.               

158
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,642
                   Oh-oh!       

159
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,044
       Top it off               
with a little sauerkraut,       

160
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,579
    a little more               
  Russian dressing.             

161
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,183
            The things I got do 
           for you guys at home.

162
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,184
             It's intimidating. 

163
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,520
             It's rather large. 

164
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,664
                The pastrami    
               is ridiculous.   

165
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,068
             The burger         
     is way out-of-bounds juicy,

166
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,736
               and the lacquer  
               is ridiculous.   

167
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:47,539
          I like the pepper     
     being incorporated into it.

168
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,606
                   I mean,      
             it's dynamite, man.

169
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,275
             I just have nothing
              to say. Awesome.  

170
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,376
                    Nice job.   
  Thank you.                    

171
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,012
  It's amazing.                 

172
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,081
 Just melt-in-your-mouth juicy. 

173
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,148
     Just tastes delicious.     

174
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:58,150
               FIERI: I've had  
             a pastrami sandwich

175
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,951
                 that almost    
              has taken me out. 

176
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,553
         But when we come back, 

177
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,823
       the culinary assassin    
   is gonna let loose with what?

178
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:05,990
  Cheesesteak Wit.              

179
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,158
              Cheesesteak Wit.  

180
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:09,027
                   See you      
              in a little bit.  

181
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,038
                Welcome back.   

182
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,773
                 Hanging out    
              with Chef Michael 

183
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,643
             here at The Refuge 
               in San Carlos.   

184
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,379
           Now, we have just had
           a pastrami experience

185
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,514
              that is something 
              of another world. 

186
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,916
                 But the man    
               says I can't go  

187
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,851
   'cause I got to stick around 
            for the...          

188
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,852
  Wit Cheesesteak.              

189
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,654
           The Wit Cheesesteak, 
                   okay?        

190
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,389
                  So, with      
             or without cheese, 

191
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:40,525
       Philly cheesesteak       
but made here on the West Coast.

192
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,394
         So, you sure you want  
       to go through with this? 

193
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,595
Got to go to Philly,            
        bro.                    

194
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,697
         The culinary assassin. 

195
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,066
        I got                   
   a rib eye here.              

196
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,534
             Beautiful rib eye. 

197
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,936
       I'm gonna take off       
  all the silver skin and fat.  

198
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,204
         So we're gonna break it
              into pieces,      

199
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,405
           freeze it, slice it? 

200
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:55,740
   Correct.                     
                     Excellent. 

201
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:57,542
        What are we into now?   
     We're on to making the...? 

202
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,010
 Now we're gonna do             
 the cheese sauce.              

203
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,812
  First, we're gonna start off  
         with the roux.         

204
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,146
                  Okay, so,     
                some butter.    

205
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:04,616
We're gonna cook the roux       
    until it's nutty.           

206
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,618
          We're gonna put       
   a little bit of color on it. 

207
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,819
               We're gonna go   
                   to tan?      

208
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,020
     Yeah.                      
                 Flour goes in. 

209
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,989
Okay, and letting that go       
      a little bit.             

210
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:13,825
   Okay, and then               
 I pour in the milk.            

211
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,227
                   Give it      
               a little stir.   

212
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,962
 When it starts to simmer,      
then I add the cream to it.     

213
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:21,766
          I assume that's       
   "meg of the nut," or nutmeg. 

214
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:22,833
      Correct.                  

215
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,436
      The salt.                 
   Thank you, bro.              

216
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:25,704
                There we go.    

217
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,706
   Tabasco.                     
              Ooh, I like that. 

218
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:29,907
      Okay.                     

219
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,277
         As you can see,        
 it's almost thickening up here.

220
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,012
    When it comes               
    to a simmer,                

221
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,781
  then I can start              
 adding the cheese.             

222
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,985
                This is
