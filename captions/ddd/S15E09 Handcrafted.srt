IN THE PAN GOING AWAY FROM YOU. 

104
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,933
I'VE DONE THAT.                 

105
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,268
        "HERE'S OUR SAFETY TIP."

106
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,405
  GET A HARD SEAR ON THAT,      
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA FLIP IT,   

107
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,141
   FINISH IN THE OVEN.          
TAKES ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.       

108
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,945
OW.                             
            THAT'S HOT IN THERE,
                  AIN'T IT?     

109
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,681
YEAH, YOU KNOW?                 

110
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,083
    THEY DON'T CALL IT          
THE REFRIGERATOR, YOU KNOW?     

111
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:48,219
A LITTLE SMOKED TOMATO BROTH.   
A LITTLE MAC 'N CHEESE HERE.    

112
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,089
   SO ELEGANT FARMER DOESN'T DO 
  THOSE LITTLE ELEGANT PORTIONS.

113
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,358
   NO, YOU'LL NEVER             
LEAVE HERE AND GO HOME          

114
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,361
AND HAVE A BOWL                 
OF CEREAL, EVER.                
           ESPECIALLY ME,       
    'CAUSE HOME'S IN CALIFORNIA.

115
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,764
  YEAH, EXACTLY, THAT'S         
A LONG WAY FOR YOU TO GO.       

116
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:01,633
 SO THIS IS THE GREENS THAT WE  
CUT THE PEPPERS UP IN, YOU KNOW.
                            YEP.

117
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,505
           OH, MY GOSH, BROTHER.

118
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,907
  YOU GET THAT LITTLE BIT OF THE
 SMOKE COMING FROM THE TOMATOES,

119
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,377
           BUT IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
          SMOKED THE WHOLE FISH,

120
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:15,580
         SO THE FISH STILL HAS  
       ITS TRUE BALANCED FLAVOR.

121
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:17,582
        YOU TASTE THE FRESHNESS,
              SUPER TENDER.     

122
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,851
      I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF   
  YOU TOLD ME THERE WASN'T FLOUR

123
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:22,387
                ON THAT FISH,   
            GREAT CRUST ON THAT.

124
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,323
  AND THEN THE COLLARD GREENS,  
YOU'VE GOT ABOUT AN HOUR ON 'EM,

125
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,992

AND THE SMOKED PEPPER.          

126
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,529
                THAT LITTLE KICK
                OF THAT PEPPER--

127
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,198
          NOT THE HEAT, BUT THAT
          ROASTED, SMOKED DEPTH,

128
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,802

144
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:14,172
   IT'S A SLOPPY SLOPPY JOE.    
        IT'S DELICIOUS.

147
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:21,179
  WE'RE GONNA START WITH        
THE VEGETABLES, OLIVE OIL.      

148
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:24,182
WE GOT CARROT.                  
                 CARROT, CELERY,
                     ONION.     

149
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,585
     A LITTLE SALT              
TO GET 'EM SWEATING OUT.        

150
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:30,054
NUTMEG, SOME CLOVE,

152
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,858
AND WE'RE GONNA                 
COOK THAT DOWN.                 

153
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,795
NOW WE'RE GONNA START           
  THE GROUND BEEF.              

154
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,130
THIS IS 80-20 ANGUS BEEF.       

155
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,666
LEAVE IT KIND OF CHUNKY.        
                           OKAY.

156
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,468
  ALL THE GROUND BEEF           
AND THE FAT AND JUICES,         

157
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,537
 MIXED IN WITH                  
THE VEGETABLES.                 

158
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,539
   WE'RE GONNA ADD              
A LITTLE BROWN SUGAR,           

159
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,608
       KETCHUP,

161
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,680
            SO HOW LONG IS THIS 
           GONNA COOK DOWN THEN?

162
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,748
THIS IS GONNA GO ABOUT A HALF   
 AN HOUR, OR A LITTLE LESS--    

163
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,752
20, 30 MINUTES.                 
            IT'LL BREAK DOWN    
       JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE...

164
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,621
YEAH.                           
          SOFTEN UP THE VEGGIES.

166
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,240
              SO THIS ISN'T     
        SUPERHEAVY TOMATO BASED.

167
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,242
          THERE IS TOMATO IN IT,

168
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,644
                 BUT YOU GET    
             MORE OF THE SPICES.

169
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,980
          BUT THE MEAT'S GOT    
      REAL GOOD MOUTHFEEL TO IT.

        AN ORCHESTRA OF FLAVORS.

241
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,811
 THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE FLAVORS

TO THE SLICER.                  

308
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,767
  IT'S LIKE A TICKER TAPE PARADE
          IN FLAVOR TOWN.       

309
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:05,710

I'LL PLATE IT.                  

315
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,056
I WISH THAT MY FATHER-IN-LAW    
       BOB WAS HERE.            

316
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:22,060
   WE LOST BOB TO CANCER.       
THIS WAS THE KIND OF STUFF--    

317
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:25,262
 GO AROUND, FIND KILLER DELIS   
IN THE GREATER PROVIDENCE AREA. 

318
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,332

                THESE TWO FIRST.

351
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,495
                      OKAY, EGGS

352
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:06,631
      AND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER.

353
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,365
SO NOW WE MIXY MIX.             

354
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,968
     NOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE       
THE FILLING FOR THE TORTELLINI. 

355
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,904

OKAY.                           

356
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,906
THE BASIS OF IT                 
 IS THE BEEF.                   

357
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,908
                   THE BEEF     
              AND THEN THE PORK.

358
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,910
SO WE GRIND BRASATO.

360
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,448

361
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,985
                WE PUT IN       
        THE PARMIGIANO-REGGIANO.

362
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,987

                 THE MOISTURE.  

364
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,725
                       AND SALT.

365
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,927
            PASTA IS NOT SALTED,
              SO IT WILL ABSORB 

366
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,397
            SOME OF THE SALT    
        FROM THE FILLING ITSELF.
GOT IT.                         

367
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,432
SO WE MIX IT BY HAND, RUN IT    
 THROUGH THE GRINDER AGAIN      

368
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,401
TO REALLY COMBINE EVERYTHING,   

369
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:46,136
THEN THE FILLING'S READY TO GO  
 INTO THE TORTELLINI MACHINE.   
                        CORRECT.

370

      LOOK AT THAT.             
AND IT'S JUST THICK ENOUGH      

373
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,746
     AND JUST                   
AT THE RIGHT SPEED              

374
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,282
  THAT IT JUST                  
ROLLS ITSELF UP.

377
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:06,891
AND I'LL START OFF              

378
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:09,961

NO WAY.                         

382
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,708
                 IT'S ABOUT FOUR
                   TO A SECOND. 

383
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,843
THAT IS SO COOL.                

384
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:29,113
              AND THAT IS YOUR

429
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,036
      SO THEREFORE
