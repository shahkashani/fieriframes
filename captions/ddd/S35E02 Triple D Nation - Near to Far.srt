87
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,786
              That's the batter

88
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,721

89
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,724
Sun noodles out of Hawaii.      
That's the Cadillac of noodles. 

90
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,526
     All right,                 
so we dropped the noodles.      

91
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,727
                  Cook them     
          for about two minutes.

92
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,596
To me, this is one of           
the most important factors.     

93
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,398
You have to have the ability    
to drain that water off,        

94
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
and you have a backup           
going at the same time.         

95
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,068
         Once one of the baskets
      gets a little too starchy,

96
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,536
               we switch over   
              to the other one. 

97
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,140
      Flush the water, cycle it.
              We're good to go.

Smart man. Super smart.         

99
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,344
And then we build a bowl        
  from the noodle.              

100
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,413

101

343
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:01,019
               My flavor jets   
            have just turned on.

344
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,956
  Boston is one of those cities 

345
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,691
         known for their        
     melting pot of flavors.    

346
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:11,229
 You've got Korean, Vietnamese, 
      Colombian, Pakistani.     

347
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,430
      I mean, you name it.      

348
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,166
          Back in 2012,         
  I just couldn't help myself.  

349
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,434
      I had to go check out     
   everybody's go-to favorite,  

350
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,436
  that tried and true Italian.  

351
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,038
Sausage cacc and ziti.          

352
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,574
  And they're still kicking out 
       some killer dishes.      

353
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,377
             This is            
    Italian Express Pizzeria.   

354
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,179
        Don't be skimpy.        
            Let's go.           

355
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,448
 Tastes just like my grandmother
          used to make.         

356
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,517
 I think Guy picked a great spot
          for his show.         

357
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,518
             I agree with that. 

358
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,787
I've heard that I look like Guy.

359
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,855
     I've know Jimmy and Jon    
      for almost 50 years.      

360
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,123
   They've got a golden heart   

361
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,125
       and a golden touch       
in the kitchen, that's for sure.

362
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,660
      FIERI: That would be      
        long-time buddies       

363
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:45,930
         Jimmy Iannuzzi         
      and Jonathan Harker.      

364
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,265
             What does Jonathan 
                  do here?      

365
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,602
Jonathan looks great,           
takes care of himself,          

366
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,871
     and I work                 
a million hours a week.         

367
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:54,004
                   Really?      
    Yeah.                       

368
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,774
          That's nice, Jonathan.

369
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,075
 People can't forget            
  these two faces.              

370
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,478
      Or the Italian dishes     
      they're cranking out.     

371
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,614
      Where'd you learn to cook?
 My grandmother.                

372
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,015
                  Dig it.       
Yep. Nonni.                     

373
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,350
   When we were on "Triple D,"  

374
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:08,219
 we made our homemade fettuccine
    with our frutti di mare.    

375
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,088
         Frutti di mare,        
           here it is.          

376
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,957
Now we're gonna make            
my famous pasta sauce, marinara.

377
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,158
                   Famous?      
    Famous.                     

378
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,560
                      Okay.     
Everything here's famous.       

379
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:16,560
   Everything's world-famous.   

380
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,028
        You know, we said       
        it was back then,       

381
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,165
      but now it really is.     

382
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,833
Fresh chopped onions.           

383
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:22,700
               Chopped garlic.  

384
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:24,635
Starting to smell good?         
                    Fantastic.

just dump this in here.

While he's doing this, my flavor
       jets have just turned on.

387
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,109
              There's something 
             about tomato sauce.

388
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:32,577

fresh chopped basil.

                low and slow.   

393

Magic's gonna happen.

00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,082
 We want to be here.            

568
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:48,218
 So what we decided was we would
    just really expand our patio

569
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,089
                to be able to   
        accommodate more people.

570
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:54,024
              Another benefit,  
     we've been able to catch up

571
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,226
          on a lot of our bills.

572
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:56,294
       Look at that, huh?       

573
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:59,363
I got a Lamborghini.            
  I got a Ferrari.              

574
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,499
         We have two red Vespas.
   I got a Bentley.             

575
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:03,700
    I don't have                
 any of that stuff.             

576
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,836
      You guys                  
  are awesome, man.             

577
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:06,903
           -I get it.           
        -Thank you guys.        

578
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:07,939
     I'm a fan.                 

579
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:12,710
 When you've got multiple mayors
     busting down your door,    

580
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,645
 you know you hit the big time. 

581
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,180
And so do the fellas at Kaedama,

582
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:19,317
      who introduced ramen      
  to the residents of El Paso,  

583
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,185
            and Paul            
    at Boston Burger Company,   

584
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,186
      who's naming burgers      
         after big shots        

585
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,922
    and taking over the town.   

586
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,390
      Plus there are plenty     
         of other places        

587
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,792
 knocking them out of the park, 

588
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:30,060
    and we'll check them out    
 next time on "Triple D Nation."

     [ Laughs ]                 

590
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,063
   Show me what Sammy looks like
               when he dances.  

591
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,999
  Oh, he's like...              

592
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,467
That's how Sammy dances.        
                   Really?      

593
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,135
Swear to God, just like that.   
   I wouldn't call that dancing.

594
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:40,137
     I'd call that having a tic.
Yeah, your boy's moving around. 

595
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:41,339
Yeah, there's something         
      going on.                 

596
