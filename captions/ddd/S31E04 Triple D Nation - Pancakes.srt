00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,554
        Yep.                    
 A little sweetness.            

112
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,155
         -Nice job, man.        
        -Thank you, sir.        

113
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,624
                    Wow.        

114
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:48,093
 FIERI: But these days, he's got
     an even swankier stack     

115
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,695
       for the a.m. crowd.      

116
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:51,496
   MILLER: Green-onion pancakes,
              with duck confit. 

117
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,698
So, if it wasn't enough         
that you took us down           

118
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,166
  pancake and pork,             

119
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,502
now you take us down            
  pancake and duck?             

120
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:58,770
               Exactly, yeah.   

121
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,039
 MILLER: We season our duck legs
        with salt, sugar,       

122
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,640
          curing salt,          
        and peppercorns,        

123
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,776
    bay leaf, thyme, garlic,    
           and brandy.          

124
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,912
       And then we dip it       
     directly into the fat.     

125
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,980
     Then it sits overnight,    
and then we put it into the oven

126
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,784
    for about 2 1/2, 3 hours    
    and crisp it up in a pan.   

127
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,853
To make our buttermilk pancakes,
          we use eggs,          

128
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,255
    buttermilk, flour, salt,    
        and baking soda.        

129
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,725
We just put them on the flat top
till they're golden on one side.

130
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,459
         We sprinkle it         
       with green onions,       

131
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,194
         turn it over --        
        it's ready to go.       

132
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,463
   We put the the pancakes on,  
      duck confit on there.     

133
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,466
     We get a little arugula    
        tossed in sesame,       

134
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:30,735
      and our hoisin maple      
    that goes over to finish.   

135
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,672
 MAN: Two green-onion pancakes, 
          duck confit.          

136
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,540
             That's hoisin maple
              right there, yes. 

137
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,941
There's only a few people       
    in this world               

138
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,345
that can put hoisin sauce       
and maple syrup together.       

139
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:42,413
                [ Chuckles ]    

140
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,617
  It's Peking duck              
with a scallion pancake.        
                 Mm-hmm.        

141
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,018
You know, like a Chinese        
  scallion pancake.             

142
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,220
                 Yeah, yeah.    
                    Yeah.       

143
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:51,690
You naturally get the sweet     
  from the hoisin.              

144
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:52,957
 Beautifully confit.            

145
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,826
    It's rendered               
  all the way down.             

146
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,962
    Tender meat.                
               Yeah, good.      

147
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,897
    Delicious --                
 I mean, delicious.             
               Thank you, sir.  

148
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,500
I think I might like this       
     better than                

149
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,134
the pulled-pork pancakes.       
                 Well, yeah.    

150
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,103
       -I mean, seriously.      
   -I don't mind that at all.   

151
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,205
 MAN: It's really great to have,
       like, Asian flavors      

152
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:10,509
    mixed with North American   
      traditional pancakes,     

153
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,043
   so adding the green onions   
            in there            

154
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,378
   with the hoisin maple syrup  

155
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,847
    is like a completely new    
       pancake experience.      

156
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,182
       You get the pancake      
         deliciousness,         

157
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,184
       and the duck confit      
        is unbelievable,        

158
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,720
        and that's, like,       
         a game changer.        

159
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:22,921
How many are coming in          

160
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,923
  for bacon, eggs,              
  and hash browns,              

161
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,792
and how many are coming in      
for the sensational creations?  

162
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,194
               You know what?   
         We get a lot of just --

163
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,996
 you know, they're coming in for
    the standard bacon and eggs.

164
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:34,299
    But, yeah, weekends -- stuff
  like this definitely blows up.

165
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,270
  -Someone says you're moving?  
        -We're moving --        

166
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,405
  just down the street that way,
       about a block and a half.

167
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,007
 How much bigger is             
   the new place?               

168
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,208
            About 20 more seats.

169
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,476
But a bigger kitchen,           
better accommodations.          

170
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:45,877
               Bigger kitchen,  
             better all around. 

171
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,746
 I opened a little French bistro
                 as well --     

172
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,414
                Wagon Rouge,    
               so there go...   

173
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,216
 No. It's not called            
    Wagon Rouge.                

174
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:52,617
          -It sure is.          
           -I dig it.           

175
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:53,885
     All right,                 
 what else you got?             

176
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,687
         We got a grilled cheese
          tomato soup coming up.

177
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,355
   So, old school.              

178
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,024
              This is nostalgia 
                with a twist.   

179
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,358
             MILLER:            
 Our grilled cheese is basically

180
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,293
   a cheddar, Swiss, and goat.  

181
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,596
  We put it on a couple slices  
           of brioche.          

182
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,631
           Goat gives           
      a little tang to it.      

183
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,433
        Sear it in a pan        
      with a bit of butter,     

184
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,635
         into the oven,         
    and smoky tomato soup --    

185
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,637
      we smoke our tomatoes     
     for a couple of hours,     

186
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,307
  and we add a bouquet garni -- 
  parsley, bay leaf, and thyme. 

187
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:18,043
   Sweat off a bunch of onions  
        with some garlic.       

188
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,178
       We put our tomatoes      
        into that, sauté,       

189
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,446
     blend it up with cream.    

190
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:22,914
           Tomato soup          
        in a little bowl.       

191
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,082
   You got a little basil oil   
       on there, croutons,      

192
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,051
            and slice           
   the grilled cheese in half,  

193
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,220
    put a little pickle spear   
           through it.          

194
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,657
    MAN: One grilled cheese,    
       smoky tomato soup.       

195
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,059
  -Oh, you get the goat cheese. 
             -Yeah.             

196
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,995
Something as simple as a        
grilled cheese and tomato soup, 

197
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:40,132
but have it elevated in         
the unique ways you do things.  

198
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:42,066
             -Yeah.             
      -It's dynamite, man.      

199
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,134
    This is just                
 kissed with smoke.             

200
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,469
              Yeah, we don't go 
                 too heavy.     

201
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,603
You still get the tomato.       

202
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:46,872
   The basil oil's              
 a nice little add.             

203
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:48,139
                 Yeah, yeah.    

204
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,474
  Oh, all day long.             

205
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,676
Even in Canada, you guys had    
tomato soup and grilled cheese? 

206
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,711
        -Even in Canada.        
           -Delicious.          

207
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,214
       WOMAN: The soup has      
  a really nice smoked flavor.  

208
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,883
   The grilled cheese sandwich  
           is amazing.          

209
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:02,487
 It's ooey-gooey, cheesy -- very
  tasty, very nice combination. 

210
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,423
       -That's done right.      
      -Thank you very much.     

211
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:05,690
    -I mean, congrats, buddy.   
          -Thanks, man.         

212
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:06,758
       -I'm happy for you.      
      -Thank you very much.     

213
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,893
  I'll come see you             
  at the new place.             

214
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,360
        -Please do. Yeah.       
  -It won't take me six years.  

215
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,762
                     No.        

216
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,900
     I love those "Triple D"    
        Canadian joints.        

217
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,300
      I mean, it just goes      
         to show you --         

218
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:20,505
     Flavortown's reach goes    
     way beyond the borders.    

219
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:23,241
    Now, next up, I'm heading   
        to Austin, Texas,       

220
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,844
   where this barbecuer swears  
        that good bark...       

221
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,579
   Look at that --              
 great color on it.             

222
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,981
    ...depends on good bark.    

223
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,050
  It's bad on pits,             
 but great on meat.             

224
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,185
          Well, this is gonna be
              a new one for me. 

225
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,223
 FIERI: I was in Austin, Texas, 
          back in 2008,         

226
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,958
          so of course          
     I went sniffing around     

227
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,260
  for some real-deal barbecue,  

228
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,963
        and I could smell       
    the mesquite a mile away.   

229
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,498
        Whoa!                   

230
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,968
  The food was legit, but, man, 
     it was<i> smoky</i> in there.     

231
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,436
     This is Green Mesquite.    

232
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:55,240
                     ♪♪         

233
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:58,376
  I really enjoyed the episode  
 on "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

234
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:01,513
  Green Mesquite is one of the  
 best barbecue places in Texas. 

235
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,181
    It's the barbecue version   
        of home cooking.        

236
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,516
        The mesquite wood       
        that they use --        

237
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:05,984
 it gives it a distinct flavor. 

238
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,518
        Three-meat plate.       

239
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,724
FIERI: And it's the only kind of
 wood owner Tom Davis will use. 

240
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,993
DAVIS: For me, green mesquite   
had the best flavor,            

241
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,661
the most consistent flavor,     

242
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,797
and as long as it was           
less than a year old            

243
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,332
  after it was cut,             
it's considered green.          

244
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:21,800
           So, does that give it
                 a snappier,    

245
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,334
           a little peppier bite
                   to it?       

246
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,870
  It's bad on pits,             
 but great on meat.             

247
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,138
                   DAVIS:       
          Here we go on the pit.

248
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,607
  Are you breathing             
in the middle of this?          

249
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:29,807
       -Barely breathing.       
         -Like Aquaman.         

250
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,743
      I'm trying not to breathe,
                  actually.     

251
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,544
              This is gonna be  
              a new one for me. 

252
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,882
       Guy had never tried      
   pure mesquite-smoked food.   

253
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,217
              -Mmm.             
   -I suffer for my customers.  

254
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,418
    Yes, you do.                

255
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,354
 Are you even there?            

256
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:45,022
                 The ribs --    
            give me the rubdown.
Okay, we got here --            

257
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,024
                 You get it?    
          "Give me the rundown"?

258
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,025
         "Give me the rubdown"? 

259
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,426
     Here we go.                
 We got brown sugar,            

260
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,295
    onion powder,               
we got your garlic powder.      

261
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:52,631
      Kind of the usual suspects
               to make a rub.   
      That's right.             

262
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:55,367
  Paprika, cayenne,             
which I know you love.          
                   Right.       

263
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,434
    You rub it in               
    really good.                

264
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,636
You don't fool around.          
 You got it, use it.            

265
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,971
               Look at that --  
             great color on it. 

266
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,239
       That'll make a nice bark.

267
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,707
         Now, how long are these
              gonna go on for?  

268
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:03,908
  4 1/2 to 5 hours.             

269
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,844
 Here come the ribs!            
 Here come the ribs.            

270
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:07,979
              Okay, you want to 
                 get yours?     

271
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,380
 Share and share not            
       alike.                   

272
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,648
                You be Cher.    
               I'll be Sonny.   

273
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,783
     All right.                 
Let's go cut these and eat them.

274
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:13,918
                Look at that.   

275
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,852
           They're just dripping
              right out there.  

276
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,588
             Boy, they're juicy.

277
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,922
                   This is      
             the barbecue sauce?
     Uh-huh.                    

278
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,724
                    Mmm.        
                    Mmm!        

279
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,325
       Our barbecue sauce       
      at Green Mesquite --      

280
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,594
        we make it here.        

281
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:24,729
  I looked at the ingredients.  

282
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,464
    I said, "I can make this    
        the way I want."        

283
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,133
     So that's what we did.     

284
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,669
          Now, how do you do it?

285
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,271
       No, no.                  
On top of the ribs, please.     

286
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,540
      My mother                 
 might be watching.             

287
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:38,743
                    What?       
      We're in barbecue country.

288
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,479
   DAVIS: After "Triple D," we  
 expanded to two more locations.

289
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,814
  We have three altogether now. 

290
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,350
  FIERI: Tom's also not manning 
      the smokers anymore.      

291
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,352
 For that cough-inducing duty...

292
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:48,953
               It's horrible.   
               It's horrible.   

293
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,956
   ...Joe Reese has stepped up  
          to the plate,         

294
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,358
and he's keeping the fires going
         with newcomers,        

295
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,295
  like the loaded baked potato  
      stuffed with brisket.     

296
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:00,231
 We season it with black pepper,
          kosher salt,          

297
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:03,835
        granulated sugar,       
     and dried red peppers.     

298
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,770
  Then we'll put it on the pit  
          and smoke it          

299
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:10,108
   for a minimum of 15 hours.   

300
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,978
 I'm gonna chop up some brisket 
 and mix it with barbecue sauce.

301
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,647
    We have the baked potato,   

302
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:20,585
      and we'll add butter,     
       sour cream, cheese.      

303
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,254
   We'll add the chopped beef.  

304
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,256
      Stuffed baked potato.     

305
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,726
      MAN: The baked potato     
    with sour cream, cheese,    

306
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:31,262
    with the chopped beef --    
     it's a heck of a meal.     

307
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,931
    -Now tell me about wings.   
     -Margarine first, okay?    

308
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,399
         Just throw it over here
           and just let it melt?

309
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,202
    That's right.               
The brown sugar next,           

310
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:38,670
chili sauce after that.         

311
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,337
-I'm gonna just stand back here.
         -That's right.         

312
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,674
           'Cause the way you're
        whisking and whipping...

313
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:43,741
                  Now some      
             regular hot sauce? 

314
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,276
 Louisiana Hot Sauce            
     right here.                

315
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,212
   What you do is               
 you smoke it first             

316
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:50,215
for approximately one hour      
   at 200 degrees.              
                   Really?      

317
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,083
  Now they're out of the smoker.
     Now they go into the fryer.

318
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,085
       For a minute and a half. 
This is just gonna be           
     the crisp.                 

319
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,419
                There we go.    

320
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,022
 Take my wing sauce, and kind of
             pour it like that, 

321
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,691
      kind of shake them around.

322
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,826
   FIERI: You scare me with that
            winging and saucing.

323
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,161
       DAVIS:                   
 And there they are.            

324
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,363
                 That's hot.    
                    Mmm.        

325
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:06,698
    The wing is nice and tender,

326
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,832
         a lot of great moisture
                   to it,       

327
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,500
               not too spicy.   

328
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,503
      That's a really good wing.

329
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,238
  I'm interested in             
     trying one,                

330
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,640
    but I figured               
I'd just get a big...

345
