612
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,376

Grilled chicken.                
                   Let's do it. 

616
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,182
We take a whole chicken,        
   we split them,               

617
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,651
 put a couple slits             
in there so the wings           

618
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:54,852
    will lay flat               
when we're grilling it.         

619
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:55,720
                    Okay.       

620
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:57,121

a little bit of lemon juice.    

622
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,994

  in the marinade.

Get them nice and covered.      

624
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:06,797
      So, now we're gonna hit it
              with the dry rub? 

625
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,766
We're not gonna be shy          
about putting it on.            

626
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:13,404
You wanna cover it with foil,   
let it marinate overnight.      

627
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,472
     Then we'll go to the grill.

629
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,541
All right. So, we've            
been grilling this chicken      

630
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:18,743
  about 45 minutes.             

631

00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:41,998
WOMAN: The very first time      
we came, he bought me           

1057
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,066
    one of those                
smoked mackerel pieces.         

1058
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:45,268
                  Romantic.     

1059
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,136
The salmon -- It's so good.     

1060
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,205
                Grab a fork.    

1061
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,407
        Mmm.                    

1062
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:51,741
       I put on 30 pounds       
      since I've been here!     

1063
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,943
     Thanks to the e-mailers    
      who got me down here.     

1064

         relax, enjoy your meal.

1065

   This is, like,               
  fifth generation.             

1066
00:36:57,282 --> 00:37:00,483
    The place itself has been   
    family-run for 56 years.    

1067
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:03,152
   Co-owner Michael Lathrop's   
        uncle was the guy       

1068
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:04,421
    with his name on the sign   

1069
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:06,956
        and the good idea       
    to turn a backyard hobby,   

1070
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,225
          smoking fish,         
        into a business.        

1071
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,361
              Yeah, Ted Peters. 
   He took it from the backyard,

1072
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:12,962
                stuck it out    
             in the front yard, 

1073
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,765
   and kind of waved the traffic
         down as it would go by.

1074
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:18,100
            And people would put
         the brakes on, back up,

1075
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:19,502
                  and say,      
            "What's that about?"

1076
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:23,106
 Today, folks are still jamming 
on the brakes for smoked salmon,

1077
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:26,108
   mahimahi, and the hometown   
        favorite, mullet.       

1078
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,444
              In here, through  
           the John Wayne doors?

1079
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,646
        Yep.                    

1080
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:31,847
     Still made the same way    
       by the same family.      

1081
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:33,249
This is our fishmonger          
    for the day?                

1082

   he's fifth-generation here.  

1083
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,454
  Nice to meet you.             
It's like a piece of history.   

1084
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:38,988
    I just shook                
  the Liberty Bell.

1086
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,925
           So, what I'm gonna do
              is run some salt  

1087
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,328
        light over all the fish.

1088
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,197
             And then, we'll put
     our mixture on all of them.

1089
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,932
And what is the mixture?        

1090
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,066
              Our secret sauce. 

1091
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:51,200
Well, you gotta give me         
   a basis of it.               

1092
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,602
 Are we tomato based            
 in here? Are we...             

1093
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:53,737
             Yeah, tomato base. 

1094
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:56,273
I can see oil in it.            
But you're not stirring it up.  

1095
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:57,740
You're not putting a lot on.    

1096
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,743
        No, it's just real light
   just to keep it from burning,

1097
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:01,344
         give it a little color.

1098
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:03,546
               Just pick it up  
              by the tray here. 

1099
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:06,949
   Just slide it in the cart and
 take it over to the smokehouse.

1100
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,352
I've never taken my smoked fish 
 for a walk before.             

1101
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:12,489
  All right. Just take the tray 
     and slide it in there.     

1102
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:16,359
       So, I guess that you have
             be a family member 

1103
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:18,361
             or you have to have
           the eagle-span reach.

1104
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:19,496
              Did you see that? 

1105
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:21,030
   MICHAEL: Yeah, little guys   
       don't do this well.      

1106
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,299
       What are we smoking with?

1107
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:23,700
        This is red oak.        

1108
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:25,368
     What's going to happen     
        in a few minutes,       

1109
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,903
    you're going to have such   
    a concentration of smoke    

1110
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:29,839
          in there that         
      it's gonna be equally     

1111
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:31,841
  seeping out of all the trays. 

1112
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:34,244
      Do they go in at a certain
         location to start with?

1113
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:37,313
     Yeah. You want the raw     
       fish on the bottom.      

1114
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,582
         And as you add,        
          you raise up.         

1115
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:40,984
           You don't just set it

        That is mahi and mullet.

1137
