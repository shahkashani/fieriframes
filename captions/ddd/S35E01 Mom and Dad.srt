00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,007
   We tracked down              
this funky little spot.         

672
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,208
  Mind you, this is             
   all last night.              

673
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,010
You know, I was talking         
to you last night.              
               Right.           

674
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:02,746
     So let's go                
 from the beginning.            

675
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,348
Are people of El Paso,          

676
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,416
  are they tuned in             
to what great ramen is?         

677
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,552
Valencia: Most in El Paso had no
              idea what it was, 

678
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:09,953
           so it had to be good.

679
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,822
               We're the ones   
     that introduced them to it.

680
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:13,757
  -You got to set the bar high. 
             -Yeah.             

681
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,025
I had the dipping ramen.        

682
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,360
             Yeah, that's called
                 a tsukemen.    

683
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:19,362
          Instead of the noodles
      sitting inside of a broth.

684
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:20,764
                  The broth     
               is on the side.  

685
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,699
  And it is a dish              
I hadn't had before.            

686
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,635
        It's concentrated broth.
 It's thicker, a little saltier.

687
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:28,571
   You dip your noodles in there
             and then eat them. 

688
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:32,109
   FIERI: But the crown jewel   
 of this place is the tonkotsu. 

689
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:33,377
                The tonkotsu,   
          that's the house bowl.

690
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:34,578
      VALENCIA:                 
That's our flagship.            

691
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,246
              Tonkotsu, no egg. 

692
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,581
  What are we using             
 to build the stock,            

693
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,717
      the base                  
of this great ramen?            

694
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,519
                  VALENCIA:     
            Pork feet and water.

695
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,121
     -Pig's feet and water.     
     -Pig's feet and water.     

696
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:46,056
          And it's going to boil
                for 12 hours.   

697
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,391
That's a lot of pig's feet.     

698
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:49,792
We're heads and feet            
   above the rest.              

699
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:52,262
  Now we're going to make the...
         which is the seasoning.

700
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,796
       The...                   
sets kind of the tone           

701
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:55,465
for what the flavor of the bowl 
    is gonna be.                

702
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,267
           Yeah. This is all the
       personality of each bowl.

703
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,735
         Minced garlic.         
             -Okay.             

704
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,671
    Dashi, It's as smoked bonito
    flake powder, minced ginger.

705
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,406
        Salt.                   
 We're a good team.             

706
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,541
I'm going to start work here    
  on my off weeks.              

707
00:24:05,543 --> 00:24:06,943
             -Sugar.            
           -That's it.          

708
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,278
              That's the batter 
                right there.    

709
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,080
        -So the noodles.        
          -Sun noodles.         

710
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:13,216
Sun noodles out of Hawaii.      
That's the Cadillac of noodles. 

711
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,884
     All right,                 
so we dropped the noodles.      

712
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:16,086
                  Cook them     
          for about two minutes.

713
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,955
To me, this is one of           
the most important factors.     

714
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,757
You have to have the ability    
to drain that water off,        

715
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,759
and you have a backup           
going at the same time.         

716
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,427
         Once one of the baskets
      gets a little too starchy,

717
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:25,895
               we switch over   
              to the other one. 

718
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,498
      Flush the water, cycle it.
              We're good to go. 

719
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,700
Smart man. Super smart.         

720
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,836
And then we build a bowl        
  from the noodle.              

721
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,771
             -Right.            
    -So the...goes in first.    

722
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,174
    These noodles in here later.
              Ladle this broth. 

723
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:39,376
Look at the color of that broth 
just from cooking down          

724
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,378
  those pork feet.              
      Love it.                  

725
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,846
        Mix that into the broth.

726
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:43,981
     Scallions.                 

727
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:47,384
        The sirens are going off
       with flood in Flavortown.

728
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:49,453
          -Narutomakis.         
          -Pork belly.          

729
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:53,256
Blackened garlic oil.           
Right there, it's ready to go.  

730
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,457
              Where do you go?  

731
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,793
I go broth. I just want to see  
what the broth is like.         

732
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:59,663
                     ♪♪         

733
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,330
         It's creamy. It's rich.

734
00:25:01,332 --> 00:25:04,334
It coats your mouth, your salt's
  right, your seasoning's right.

735
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,870
               That's a pretty  
      broad spectrum of flavors.

736
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,872
                     ♪♪         

737
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:13,543
          I ate that ramen bowl.
             I am "good night." 

738
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,412
     Last meal I had last night,
     the first meal I had today.

739
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:17,747
             SERVER:            
      Here's your tonkotsu.     

740
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:20,884
        The flavor pops.        
    Saltiness, not too spicy.   

741
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,352
  The pork belly is delicious.  

742
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,688
 It breaks apart on your tongue 
     as soon as you eat it.     

743
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,822
            So fresh.           

744
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,157
The meat was tender,            

745
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,359
complemented the noodles        
     very well.                 

746
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,894
             WOMAN:             
  What I love about this place  

747
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,430
  is that you finish the bowl,  
      you get another one.      

748
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:35,699
You can order Kaedama.          
Once your noodles are done,     

749
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,500
get a whole other batch         
of noodles in there.            

750
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:40,037
It's like two bowls in one.     

751
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,305
        How many different types
    of ramen are we doing, Gabe?

752
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:43,440
 We offer six bowls.            

753
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:44,507
There's a couple of bowls       

754
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,043
that have an El Paso flair      
      to them.                  

755
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,310
  The chipotle one.             

756
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,511
We decided to incorporate       

757
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:49,980
a little bit of spice           
   into our bowl.               

758
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:52,315
    We're going to start off    
with making the seasoning mix --

759
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,317
  onion powder, garlic powder,  
         ginger powder,         

760
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,786
         smoked paprika,        
         and some salt.         

761
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,653
           Sprinkle it          
     on our chicken breasts     

762
00:25:57,655 --> 00:25:59,189
    and stick it in the oven.   

763
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:00,857
   We're going to make our...   

764
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,392
     which is our seasoning     
          for the bowl.         

765
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,460
  Salts, sugar, smoked paprika, 

766
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,597
     fire-roasted tomatoes,     
      whole garlic cloves,      

767
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,400
    miso paste, a little bit    
     of water, some onions.     

768
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,135
           And last is          
      the star of the show,     

769
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,737
       the chipotle pepper      
        and adobo sauce.        

770
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,739
  We're just going to go ahead  
        and blend it up,        

771
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,541
         and right there        
        it's ready to go.       

772
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:19,275
     So this is the chicken     
        we just roasted,        

773
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,610
 ready to brown on our flattop. 

774
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,345
 So now we're ready to assemble 
       our chipotle bowl.       

775
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,748
    We're going to put our...   
            noodles,            

776
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,017
     gonna pour a little bit    
    of veggie broth in there,   

777
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,618
     scallions, sweet corn,     

778
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,553
  fire roasted diced tomatoes,  
            chicken,            

779
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:34,958
   one of our marinated eggs,   
  sesame seeds, chile threads.  

780
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,359
             Chipotle, order up.

781
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,761
        The chipotle bowl       
         is my favorite.        

782
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,362
    Spices are balanced out.    

783
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,031
  It's like a tomato-y chipotle

00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,303
       First, we're gonna       
      mash up our avocados.     

895
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,371
    We're gonna add tomatoes,   

896
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:42,972
       chopped red onion,       
        pickled jalapeño.       

897
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:44,107
           Got to have          
     a little heat in there.    

898
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:46,042
       Fresh-cut cilantro,      
          black pepper,         

899
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:48,111
   salt, and some lime juice.   

900
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:49,713
         And we're gonna        
     mix that all together.     

901
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:52,748
 We're good with the guacamole. 
 We're all set and ready to go. 

902
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,784
  That is certified Angus beef. 

903
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,853
       We'll add the bacon      
  and the hot dog to the grill. 

904
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,721
        It's all gonna go       
      on top of the burger.     

905
00:30:58,723 --> 00:30:59,990
      Once it's all cooked,     
        at the very end,        

906
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:01,457
    we're gonna fry our egg.    

907
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:04,260
     Complete our burger --     
 lettuce, two slices of tomato, 

908
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,329
little sprinkle of black pepper.

909
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,064
  We're gonna plate the burger  
         on top of that,        

910
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,934
      guacamole, house-made     
 pickled red onions, fried egg, 

911
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:12,735
        that Papi sauce,        
        which is ketchup,       

912
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:16,806
    a lot of sugar, paprika,    
  sriracha, white wine vinegar. 

913
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,140
Then just a little bit of water.

914
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,877
        Turn up the heat.       
     Mix that all together.     

915
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,078
           Mix that in          
      with some mayonnaise,     

916
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,415
    and it's a sweet, tangy,    
      creamy deliciousness.     

917
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,550
          The Big Papi.         

918
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,085
   Big Papi's a big name here.  

919
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:31,620
      That's why they have      
  a big burger named after him. 

920
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:34,824
      A filling, flavorful,     
     just an amazing burger.    

921
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:37,360
  MAN: It's huge, and the sauce 
     is really, really tasty    

922
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:38,628
       and totally unique.      

923
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,030
      I've eaten here many,     
       many, many a times,      

924
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,099
     and every single burger    
       is very, very good.      

925
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,500
    The Big Papi's excellent.   

926
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,701
The big mac burger is very good.

927
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,637
       The Sophie burger's      
      phenomenal, as well.      

928
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,872
   The Sophie burger is one of  
  our most popular burgers now. 

929
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:51,507
       Sophie is actually       
         a real person.         

930
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,443
  She's a tour guide in Italy.  

931
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:54,844
       So we're gonna make      
     our lemon vinaigrette.     

932
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,313
         We're gonna add        
a little olive oil, lemon juice,

933
00:31:57,315 --> 00:32:01,518
   honey, some Dijon mustard,   
  salt, pepper, white vinegar.  

934
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,186
      And we're just gonna      
         whisk that up.         

935
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:05,588
  We're gonna take our burger,  
         give it a flip.        

936
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,857
  Top that with some prosciutto 
        and goat cheese.        

937
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,925
      It's not gonna melt.      
  It's gonna get a little soft. 

938
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:10,860
   We're gonna add our salad,   

939
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,261
         the house-made         
       lemon vinaigrette.       

940
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,863
      Burger right on top.      

941
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:17,133
    Crushed candied walnuts,    
    balsamic glaze, fig jam.    

942
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,803
       And there it is --       
 a little bit salty, very sweet,

943
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:21,805
     and just a little nuts,    
         like Sophie is.        

944
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:24,140
      WOMAN: Sophie burger      
     has that perfect taste     

945
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,674
       of sweet and tangy       
        at the same time        

946
00:32:25,676 --> 00:32:26,609
   because of the goat cheese.  

947
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,943
            WOMAN #2:           
     You have the prosciutto    

948
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:29,412
     and you have to fig jam    
      with the vinaigrette.     

949
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,815
   It balances everything out   
          very nicely.          

950
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:34,083
        You totally recommend it
 to anybody that's a burger fan.

951
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:37,086
        Highly recommend.       
 It's wicked awesome.           

952
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,888
Give me a hug.                  
                  Alright.      
  That's what I'm talking about.

953
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,825
 There you go. See?             
                  [ Laughs ]    

954
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:43,126
     Sophie's got a burger.     

955
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,694
     Big Papi has a burger.     

956
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,096
        And I'm assuming        
     at some point in time,     

957
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:48,031
        "Triple D" burger       
        is in the works.        

958
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,566
        Am I right, Paul?       

959
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:51,835
       Alright, coming up,      
   we're staying in Boston...   

960
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,236
           You smell the garlic.
                You smell --    

961
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:54,570
         I'm saying it like him.

962
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:57,573
  ...where these Italian dudes  
     are cooking up classics    

963
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,108
       that you just can't      
         get enough of.         

964
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,411
               My flavor jets   
            have just turned on.

965
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,315
  Boston is one of those cities 

966
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,050
         known for their        
     melting pot of flavors.    

967
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:11,588
 You've got Korean, Vietnamese, 
      Colombian, Pakistani.     

968
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,789
      I mean, you name it.      

969
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:15,525
          Back in 2012,         
  I just couldn't help myself.  

970
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:17,793
      I had to go check out     
   everybody's go-to favorite,  

971
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,795
  that tried and true Italian.  

972
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,397
Sausage cacc and ziti.          

973
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,933
  And they're still kicking out 
       some killer dishes.      

974
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,736
             This is            
    Italian Express Pizzeria.   

975
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,538
        Don't be skimpy.        
            Let's go.           

976
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,807
 Tastes just like my grandmother
          used to make.         

977
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,009
 I think Guy picked a great spot
          for his show.         

978
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:33,876
             I agree with that. 

979
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,146
I've heard that I look like Guy.

980
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:38,214
     I've know Jimmy and Jon    
      for almost 50 years.      

981
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,481
   They've got a golden heart   

982
00:33:39,483 --> 00:33:41,483
       and a golden touch       
in the kitchen, that's for sure.

983
00:33:41,485 --> 00:33:43,019
      FIERI: That would be      
        long-time buddies       

984
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,289
         Jimmy Iannuzzi         
      and Jonathan Harker.      

985
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:47,624
             What does Jonathan 
                  do here?      

986
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:50,960
Jonathan looks great,           
takes care of himself,          

987
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,229
     and I work                 
a million hours a week.         

988
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,363
                   Really?      
    Yeah.                       

989
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,166
          That's nice, Jonathan.

990
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:58,434
 People can't forget            
  these two faces.              

991
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,837
      Or the Italian dishes     
      they're cranking out.     

992
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,972
      Where'd you learn to cook?
 My grandmother.                

993
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,507
                  Dig it.       
Yep. Nonni.                     

994
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:05,842
   When we were on "Triple D,"  

995
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:08,578
 we made our homemade fettuccine
    with our frutti di mare.    

996
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,446
         Frutti di mare,        
           here it is.          

997
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,316
Now we're gonna make            
my famous pasta sauce, marinara.

998
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:14,517
                   Famous?      
    Famous.                     

999
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,918
                      Okay.     
Everything here's famous.       

1000
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,919
   Everything's world-famous.   

1001
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,387
        You know, we said       
        it was back then,       

1002
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,657
      but now it really is.     

1003
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,192
Fresh chopped onions.           

1004
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:23,192
               Chopped garlic.  

1005
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,994
Starting to smell good?         
                    Fantastic.  

1006
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,663
   Take our sauce,              
just dump this in here.         

1007
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,933
While he's doing this, my flavor
       jets have just turned on.

1008
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:31,601
              There's something 
             about tomato sauce.

1009
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:33,069
           You smell the garlic.
