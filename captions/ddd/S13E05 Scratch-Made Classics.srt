00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,543
                  UNTIL IT GETS 
                 NICE AND THICK.
LET'S TALK ABOUT                
  MAKING PIE.                   

198
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,277
        SO WE'RE GONNA START OFF
         WITH OUR SAVORY DOUGH, 

199
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,747
           AND WE'RE GONNA START
            IT OFF WITH BUTTER. 
OKAY.                           

200
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,817
     JUST A LITTLE MEDIUM SPEED,
          SALT, ICING SUGAR,    

201
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,885
            ONE WHOLE EGG YOLK. 
           GIVE THAT A GOOD MIX.

202
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,488
               FLOUR. SO WE HAVE
                OUR DOUGH HERE, 

203
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,490
              AND WE JUST PUT   
           A LITTLE BIT OF WATER

204
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,458
              JUST TO MOISTEN IT
                 A LITTLE BIT.  
ALL RIGHT.                      

205
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,827
 TAKE THIS, ROLL THIS,          
WRAP THIS, REST THIS...         
                            YEP.

206
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,630
AND WE'LL COME OUT, ROLL IT OUT.
   WHAT'S OUR NEXT ADVENTURE?   
       WE JUST FORM 'EM BY HAND.

207
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,499
              WE FILL THIS WITH 
             OUR TURKEY POT PIE.

208
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:57,835
 AND THEN WE TAKE OUR TOP, BRUSH
  BOTH SIDES WITH SOME EGG WASH.

209
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,837
                WE JUST CRIMP IT
                 RIGHT IN THERE.

210
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,307
ADD A LITTLE POKE THERE SO      
THE STEAM DOESN'T BUILD UP.     

211
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,309
              WE'RE GONNA PUT IT
                IN THE OVEN...  
OKAY.                           

212
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,977
            FOR ABOUT 25 MINUTES
                   AT 325.      

213
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,513
                 TURKEY POT PIE.
BRING IT.                       

214
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:11,582
                    THERE WE GO.

215
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:14,452
YEAH, YOU OPEN THAT UP          
     RIGHT THERE.               

216
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:16,454
MMM.                            

217
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,723
I LOVE ALL THE COMPONENTS--     

218
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,725
THE HERBS, ROSEMARY.            
                ROSEMARY, THYME.

219
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:24,396
    RIGHT OFF THE BAT.          
YOU GET THE SMOKINESS. MMM.     

220
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,132
I MEAN, I THINK THE TURKEY HAD  
SOME REALLY NICE FLAVOR TO IT,  

221
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:29,600
BUT AS SOON AS YOU WARM IT UP,  
      IT EVEN BRINGS OUT        

222
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,602
A LITTLE BIT MORE,              
     BUT, UH,                   

223
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,939
 THE CRUST IS JUST              
BOMB DOT COM FLAKY.             

224
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,608

         AND THE CRUST.

                OF THE POT PIE?

IT'S AWESOME. THERE'S SO MANY   
    VEGETABLES. PERFECT.

          CORNED BEEF.          

231
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,825
                  FAVORITE THING
                   ON THE MENU? 
PROBABLY THE PORK CHOP.         

232
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,960
I'M HAVING THE MEAT LOAF.       
IT'S BETTER THAN MY MOM'S.      

233
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,429
    THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS     
   ON THE MENU THAT ARE GOOD,   

234
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,031
        BUT THE BURGER'S        
      THE GO-TO, FOR SURE.      

235
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,367
 <i> AND IT'S BEEN THE GO-TO SINCE</i> 
   <i> BACK WHEN MARK WAS A KID.</i>   

236
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:04,369
WE USED TO COME HERE,           
AND THEY HAD A BURGER           

237
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,371
   THAT WE USED                 
TO EAT RELIGIOUSLY.             
                 THAT'S WHAT YOU
                   SURVIVED ON? 

238
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:09,307
YEAH.                           
GREAT BURGER, HANDMADE PATTY.   
  HOMEMADE BUN. DELICIOUS.      

239
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:12,576
  WITH A MEAT MARKET NEXT DOOR, 
IT BETTER BE A DANG GOOD BURGER.
IT IS.                          

240
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,779
                   HOW YOU GONNA
                   START IT OFF?
BARBECUE SAUCE.                 

241
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,248
           THAT'S A GOOD WAY    
      TO START IT OFF. LET'S GO.
  WE START OFF                  
WITH CANOLA OIL,                

242
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,250
AND THEN WE ADD OUR ONIONS      
       AND GARLIC,              

243
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,385
AND WE SWEAT THAT OFF.          

244
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,387
SO THE GARLIC AND ONIONS        
ARE WORKING. WHAT'S NEXT?       

245
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,124
         3 OUNCES OF WILD TURKEY
                 IN HERE.       
I LIKE YOUR OUNCES.             

246
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,325
        THEN WE ADD A LITTLE BIT
        OF VINEGAR, PEPPERCORNS,

             CHIPOTLE PEPPERS...

           SOME DARK MOLASSES,  
        A LITTLE TOMATO PASTE...
 OKAY.                          

249
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,667
          BAY LEAVES, CINNAMON--
CINNAMON?                       

250
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:38,169
   YOU NEED ALL THOSE BACKGROUND
       FLAVORS. BROWN SUGAR.    
AND?                            

251
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:41,072
                       TOMATOES.
A LITTLE SALT, SOME FRESH       
  CRACKED BLACK PEPPER,         

252
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:44,409
  AND HOW LONG'S                
THIS GONNA SIMMER?              
           FOR ABOUT 25 MINUTES.

253
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,877
OKAY. ARE WE MAKING HAMBURGERS, 
  OR ARE WE MAKING MEAT LOAF?   

254
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,480
       WE ARE MAKING HAMBURGERS.
OKAY, ROCK 'N' ROLL.            

255
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,482
          WE GRIND OUR OWN MEAT,
            AND THEN FROM HERE, 

256
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,551

               MUSTARD--DIJON...

WORCESTERSHIRE, TABASCO.        
                   BREAD CRUMBS.

258
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,022
PERFECT FOR MEAT LOAF.          

259
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,026
             WHAT'S UP WITH THIS
               MEAT LOAF THING? 

260
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:04,162
        ONIONS, FREE-RANGE EGGS,
       ROSEMARY, THYME, PARSLEY.

261
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,097
        YOU WANT TO SEASON IT UP
                 FOR ME?        

262
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,431
YEAH, I'D LOVE TO.              

263
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,433

THE FRESH CRACKED PEPPER.       

264
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,435
A LITTLE SALT.                  
            THEN WE MIX THIS UP.

265
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,905
 YOU'RE GONNA PUT               
THIS ALL TOGETHER.              
                AND THAT'S IT.  
             THAT IS OUR BURGER.

266
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:16,975
WANT ME TO GET YOU A LOAF PAN   
       TO PUT THAT IN?          
         ALL THESE LITTLE JOKES.

267
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,910
      COME ON, IT'S A HAMBURGER.
         ABOUT 5 OUNCES WE DO.  

268
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,445
      FORM IT                   
RIGHT INSIDE THERE.             

269
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,447
SO YOU GIVE THAT MEAT A CHANCE  
    TO REST A LITTLE BIT.       

270
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,249
    A LITTLE OIL ON THE FLATTOP.
            THERE WE GO.        

271
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:26,184
MMM, LOOK AT THAT.              

272
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,186
               SO MAYO, LETTUCE,

00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,588
            WITH OUR BURGER--   
         IT'S BEEN ON THE GRILL.

274
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,590
                  TAKE IT OFF.  
               BARBECUE SAUCE...

275

                          BACON.

276
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,130
           AND THEN A LITTLE MIX
              OF WHITE CHEDDAR  

277
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,931
             AND ORANGE CHEDDAR.

278
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,933

SALAMANDER.                     

279
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,935
               JUST TO MELT THAT
                  CHEESE DOWN.  
OKAY.                           

280
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:48,339
  BURGER COMES OUT OF THE SALLY,
         RIGHT ONTO HERE.       
AND THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE.       

281
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,208

(whistles) NICE.                

282
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,210
   I DON'T TYPICALLY            
CUT MY BURGERS IN HALF,         

283
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,678

THIS IS NOT SHORT OF FLAVOR.    

286
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,889
I PICK UP A LITTLE BIT          
   OF THE ROSEMARY.             

287
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,825
     THE BARBECUE SAUCE         
HAS DEFINITELY GOT SOME KICK.   

288
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,295
AND THE BACON...                

289
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:13,764
DOESN'T FALL SHORT              
  BY ANY MEANS.                 

290
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,167
AND THE FACT THAT               
YOU DID EVERYTHING              

291
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,837
EXCEPT FOR RAISE THAT STEER     
   AND MAKE THAT BACON--        

292
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,906
PRETTY GOOD DEAL.               
    NICE JOB.

SUGAR FOR THE YEAST.            

345
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:32,237

                 LET THAT BLOOM.

348

349
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:41,312

              WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR.

350
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,047

351
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,383
A LITTLE BIT OF TEXTURE, BECAUSE
  IT'S FAIRLY COARSELY GROUND.

00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,391
             SO NOW WE MIX THIS.

355
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,193
            WE'RE GONNA COVER IT
              AND LET IT RISE.  

356
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,596

                WILL THIS MAKE? 
  ABOUT 20. SO WE'RE            
GONNA CUT THIS IN HALF,         

358
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,733
   AND THEN WE'RE               
GONNA CUT EACH HALF.            

359
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,802
WE ROLL 'EM OUT

                           OKAY.

360
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:07,805
AND THEN YOU LOOP IT AROUND     
    FORMING A PRETZEL.          

361
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:10,475
        HOW MANY BATCHES OF THIS
           DO YOU MAKE A WEEK?  
WE MAKE IT FRESH                
   EVERY DAY.                   

362
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:13,144
 YOU'RE GONNA TAKE ALL THIS TIME
      TO HAND-ROLL PRETZELS.    

363
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,612

                 FOR PUNISHMENT 

364
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:18,349
             OR YOU JUST HAVE   
         AN ISSUE WITH SLEEPING.
IT'S THE RIGHT WAY              
     TO DO IT.                  

365
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,284
                  I-I'M DOWN

SO WE MAKE THE LYE SOLUTION.    
 THAT'S THE FOOD-GRADE LYE.     

367
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,755
PUT THE LYE IN THE BOTTOM       
   OF THE BOWL, SALT,           

368
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,424
WARM WATER, AND WE STEP         
  BACK A LITTLE BIT,            

369
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,093
'CAUSE IT'S GONNA               
   BUBBLE UP.

371
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,097
THESE HAVE BEEN CHILLED,        
AND THEY HAVE THEIR SKIN,       

372
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,965
SO THEY'RE REALLY EASY          
   TO DEAL WITH...              
                           OKAY.

373
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,967
ESPECIALLY SINCE WE'RE GONNA    
   PUT 'EM IN HOT WATER.        
                DUNK 'EM ALL IN.

374
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,503
DUNK 'EM ALL IN.                

375
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,304
     LYE WATER MAKES            
THAT BEAUTIFUL BROWN COLOR      

376
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,973
AND A NICE GLOSS.               
                             AH.

377
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,042
   WHAT IS THE CHEMICAL REACTION
       THAT'S HAPPENING HERE    

378
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,210
                THAT'S GIVING IT
               THIS BROWN COLOR?

379
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:48,713
 IT'S THE SAME REACTION THAT    
HAPPENS ON THE OUTSIDE OF MEAT  

380
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:51,315
WHEN YOU SEAR IT.               
      REALLY? IF I WANTED TO GET
         A LITTLE MORE TAN...   

381
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,451
BAD IDEA. SALT.                 

382

             AT WHAT TEMP?      
400.                            

383
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,388
SEVEN TO EIGHT MINUTES.         
        WHILE WE'RE DOING THAT, 
       WE MAKE THE CHEESE SAUCE.

384
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,190

OUR SHALLOTS AND ONIONS.        

390
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,734
NOW WE'RE GONNA                 
 ADD THE BEER.

    AND ADD OUR ANDOUILLE.
