00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:03,736
           Hey, there.          
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,338
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,606
          This trip...          

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:08,874
Camera's not on, is it?         

5
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:10,809
   I'm getting in the ring...   
                    Let's roll. 

6
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,611
      ...with some serious      
       Flavortown champs.       

7
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,280
 This is like an extra week now 
           at the gym.          

8
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,282
           Round 1...           

9
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,683
        Phoenix, Arizona.       

10
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,352
      What?                     

11
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:24,356
 A one-two combo of comfort food
      and wicked workouts.      

12
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:26,224
  It's like culinary Christmas. 

13
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:27,559
           Round 2...           

14
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:28,627
    Okay, hit it.               

15
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,095
    ...Leucadia, California.    

16
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:32,631
  The beach-town taco shack...  

17
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,233
           I can see your saliva
                right now.      

18
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:37,635
   ...putting wicked moves...   
Everything's in balance.        

19
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,304
   ...on the traditional taco.  

20
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,005
             All-American Dream.

21
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:41,973
      Word!                     

22
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:44,175
       And in Mount Airy,       
         Pennsylvania...        

23
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,045
      the knockout punch...     

24
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,112
       This is a new one for me.

25
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,914
        ...of sensational       
        southern cooking.       

26
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,316
I'm so happy you like it.       

27
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:53,051
              Oh, I am so happy 
                you made it.    

28
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,922
     That's all right here,     
    right now, on "Triple D."   

29
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:12,203
          I'm down here         
      in Phoenix, Arizona.      

30
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,405
    I love coming down here.    

31
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,673
         The weather --         
   I mean, those warm nights,   

32
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,909
        sitting outside,        
    listening to great tunes,   

33
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,478
       eating great food,       
 hanging out with your friends. 

34
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:21,813
     I mean, I wish someone     

35
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,482
 could make a restaurant concept
          around that.          

36
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,552
       Oh, yeah, they did.      
        This is The Duce.       

37
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:33,492
            Pot pie.            

38
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:34,893
    Slick Willy, come on up.    

39
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,361
          Enjoy, buddy.         

40
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:37,428
     There's nothing like it    
           in Phoenix.          

41

      [ Record scratches ]      

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,898
Is this normal in Phoenix?      

43
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,033
         This is a great place  
       to hang out. Look at it. 

44
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:43,168
                 I mean,        
         you have everything -- 

45
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:46,104
   shopping, boxing, food, bar. 

46
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,372
  Shopping, boxing,             
   food, and bar.

 Steve and Andi Rosenstein love.

49
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,912
        It's almost like        
    our personal playground.    

50
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,180
         So what did you guys do
               in Chicago?      

51
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:56,582
    We had a clothing company   

52
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:58,450
         that we started        
      right out of college.     

53
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,585
      We sold the business      
            in 2006.            

54
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,187
             FIERI:             
   Before heading to Phoenix,   

55
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,924
 setting up shop in a warehouse 
      area called The Duce.     

56
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:11,063
 Here Steve whips them in shape 
 while Andi runs the kitchen -- 

57
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,998
 a.k.a. an airstream trailer -- 

58
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,134
         and cranks out         
     her family favorites...    

59
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,936
 Order up. Pot pie.             

60
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:20,272
          ...which are          
       very, very unique.       

61
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:21,673
We're baking in this?           

62
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:22,874
           We're baking in that.

63
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,009
 This I got to see.             

64
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,211
             We're gonna start  
           by making the dough. 

65
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:30,749
   Flour, a little kosher salt, 
      a little bit of sugar.    

66
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,953
         And we're gonna cut in 
               our butter.      

67
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,755
      Wow.                      

68
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,690
               Pulse that in.   

69
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,158
                  Okay.         

70
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:42,560
    Get in there.               

71
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:43,896
       Form it into a big ball. 

72
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,163
   Let this rest?               

73
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,032
              And let it rest.  

74
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,572
     Flatten it out a little bit
       so it's easier to roll.  

75
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:54,840
              Okay, good to go. 

76
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,576
     And we use the tops of our 
     mason jars to cut a circle.

77
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:01,779
              Build the bottom, 
               form the sides,  

78
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:03,582
       and then I've got to cut 
             the tops out.      

79
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,918
              Here we go.       
       And you power-bake them. 

80
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,119
These go in the oven            
     what temp?                 

81
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:10,188
     You pop in the oven at 350,
         two, three minutes.    

82
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,123
                We're gonna get 
                in the filling? 
We're gonna make                
  the filling.                  

83
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:13,592
 Start with butter.             

84
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:16,728
         You feel that it's okay

85
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:19,197
         to give copious amounts
         of butter in your food 

86
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,066
              because you have  
               a boxing ring?   

87
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,068
   I fatten them up.            
Steve trims them down.          

88
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,870
    We're gonna add             
boneless chicken thigh.         

89
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,605
               Get so fly       
         with the chicken thigh?

90
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,072
It doesn't dry out as much      
    as white meat does.         

91
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:29,675
     We tried it                
  with white meat.              

92
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,875
I'm gonna brown that.           

93
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,011
We're gonna add in a little     
      chopped onion,            

94
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,814
  add diced celery,             
and a little carrot,            

95
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,148
a little kosher salt.           

96
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,750
    We're gonna add             
a little chicken stock,         

97
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,553
  and we're gonna               
  let that simmer.              

98
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,355
 So while that's browning,      
we're gonna make the roux.      

99
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:46,090
We're going to start            
with a little butter.           

100
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,692
Whisk in a little flour         

101
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,361
  Let that thicken              
    a little bit.               

102
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,096
               Okay, you want   
             the chicken stock. 

103
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:54,432
    Heavy cream.                

104
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,568
Stir that till it thickens.     

105
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,104
             So the roux goes in
              with the chicken, 

106
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:02,307
         and now the corn,      
   so it stays nice and tender. 

107
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:03,508
      Parsley.                  

108
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,511
           We'll let it continue
              to tighten up.    

109
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,447
        Okay, so,               
we have these baked off.        

110
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,581
Now you're gonna fill them.     

111
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,851
         All the way to the top.

112
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,853
  That's a nice little portion  
     you're giving in there.    

113
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:18,924
       We're gonna top it with  
       the circle of pie dough. 

114
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,526
   And then we're gonna pop them
           in the oven.         

115
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,329
     And they're ready to taste.

116
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,802
    Smoking hot.                

117
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:32,271
      Mmm!                      

118
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:33,871
Really nice flaky crust.        

119
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,273
And the key is that corn.       

120

00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:04,008
     Minimum 95%, and sometimes 
       it hits as high as 98%.  

237
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,810
That means tacos with everything

238
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:08,413
     from free-range chicken    
       to grass-fed beef.       

239
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:10,682
          But you know,         
 being this close to the water, 

240
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,617
 it's all about the fresh catch.

241
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,352
 How far are we from the beach? 
        A couple blocks?        

242
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,787
         Yeah, a couple blocks. 

243
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,291
He makes a brilliant            
     fish taco.                 

244
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,158
       I guess when you call it 
             the Cousteau,      

245
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,495
     you should have "brilliant"
       somewhere in that name.  

246
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:26,097
   Cousteau Taco.               

247
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,032
   Inspired by Jacques Cousteau 
             himself.           

248
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:29,834
           So what would he eat 
                the most of     

249
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,903
     if he's out on the<i> Calypso</i> 
             out to sea?        

250
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,306
Well, I'm out on a limb.        
   I'm gonna say fish.          

251
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,975
                  There you go. 
Okay, hit it.                   

252
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:37,976
                 Fish tacos.    

253
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,176
         I make the spice rub --

254
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,846
                oregano,        
         onion powder, cayenne, 

255
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:44,983
                paprika,        
         black pepper, sea salt.

256
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,784
      This will go on the fish. 
Excellent. Next up.             

257
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,522
Next up is crema,               
which is sour cream...          

258
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,256
    two tablespoons of cumin... 
[ Whistles ]                    

259
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,325
Salt and lime juice.            
                            Yes.

260
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,661
   You got the dry rub          
for the fish, the crema.        

261
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,463
Next up?                        
                  Let's go.     
           Let's cook the fish. 

262
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,932
         Halibut -- Californian.

263
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,935
  Got a little bit              
  of our dry rub.               

264
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,736
       So, I'll let this saute. 

265
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,071
Tortillas go down?              
                            Yep.

266
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,074
       Flip the fish.           
       It's nice and blackened. 

267
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,274
                 Finish it off. 

268
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,610
  Looking nice in there.        
That's a big, hearty taco.      

269
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,078
         Put the crema on here. 

270
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,680
         A little cabbage slaw. 

271
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,148
                Salsa cruda.    

272
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,283
                Mango, yeah.    

273
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,417
Good-looking fish taco.         

274
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,219
              I love cilantro.  
              Rice and bean it. 

275
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,087
                  This is       
           just mouth-watering. 

276
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,123
           I can see your saliva
                right now.      

277
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,892
                There you go.   

278
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:30,762
                         Tasty. 
Hot and tasty.                  

279
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,500
    That's bordering            
into a gourmet fish taco.       

280
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,768
Everything's in balance.        

281
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,703
      Slaw's great,             
the fish is really fresh.       

282
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:39,771
 Not over-seasoned.             

283
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,572
You can actually taste          
   the fish in this.            

284
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,507
      Nice salsa,               
a little bit of crema,          

285
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,111
good cumin coming through.

              Mmm!              
 That is a rock-star fish taco.

Well done.                      
                     Very nice. 

288
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:50,648
                     Well done! 

289
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:51,983

This is right at the top.       

293

  You want to keep those going. 

297

     It's funky enough          
that if you're not a local,     

298

00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:38,623
                 Immutable?

     It's like a combination    
 of a lot of different cultures.

341
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,376
           What's the first dish
             we're gonna make?  

342
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,844
     We're making               
North African chicken.          

343
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,215
  Chicken quarters rubbed with  
  cumin and oregano and garlic. 

344

                 Let's roll.    

345
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:11,322
Cumin, dry oregano, salt,       
 pepper, minced garlic.         

346
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:12,524
                 Right in       
           with the dry spices? 

347
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,325
      Right in                  
with the dry spices.            

348
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:17,262
It gets mixed together,         
  and then olive oil.           

349
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:18,729
  Squeeze, squeeze,             
  squeeze, squeeze.             

350
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,198

 aren't as strong as I thought.

00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,162
              MAN:              
   I always look at the menu,   

469
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,231
but then probably half the time,
 I end up with the pulled pork. 

470
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,900
             Here's the deal -- 
             We're hanging out  

471
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:25,035
   at Mount Airy, Pennsylvania, 
        with Chef Valerie.      

472
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,838
         When we come back,     
     she's gonna make a dessert.

473
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:30,041
              What's it called? 
Sour cream pound cake.          

474
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,176
       See you in a little bit. 

475
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,352
 Welcome back -- "Triple D" here
 in Pennsylvania in Mount Airy, 

476
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,154
             right outside      
       of downtown Philadelphia,

477
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,355
     hanging out with Chef Val. 

478
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,823
           And I got to tell you
               something --     

479
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,425
         This has been          
         an experience.         

480
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:51,896
           Now to finish out    
       this culinary adventure, 

481
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,564
           what are you making? 

482
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,066
      I'm making                
sour cream pound cake.          

483
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,637
So, this is a family recipe     
    from my Aunt Netta,         

484
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,639
who was a great cook.           

485
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,042
                Make it happen. 
     Butter                     
at room temperature.            

486
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,978
       So we're gonna cream it. 
We're gonna cream it.           

487
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,115
Sour cream.                     

488
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,317
Now I'm gonna add               
the sugar.                      

489
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,653
That's gonna cream              
for a while.                    

490
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:18,255
Combine the salt                
and the flour                   

491
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,924
and just mix it up              
a little bit with a whisk.      

492
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:22,059
And now I'm gonna               
beat the eggs.                  

493
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:25,997
So I'm gonna start adding the   
flour and the eggs alternately. 

494
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,465
             Want me to slurp   
           some of the eggs in? 

495
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,667
 Yeah, just about half of them. 

496
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,569
       I used the word "slurp." 

497
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,840
               And that's it.   

498
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:45,683
        Bake this at 325,       
and it takes an hour and a half.

499
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,685
                  Okay.         

500
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,620
           So it's had a chance 
              to cool down now. 
Mm-hmm.                         

501
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,359
        And then it gets        
  a little bit of whipped cream 

502
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,494
  and a little bit              
 of powdered sugar.             

503
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,197
                 And that's it. 
That's it.                      

504
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:08,039
                  Mmm.          

505
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:09,373
               This is my kind  
                 of dessert.    

506
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,209
           I don't like dessert 
             to be too sweet.   

507
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,579
              I hate when it's  
             so light and fluffy

508
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,113
               that it doesn't  
                have texture.   

509
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,648
That you can't taste it!        
         I know!                

510
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,583
 There's a little tang to this, 
    a little richness to it.    

511
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:22,119
           Put some strawberries
               on that. Ohh.    

512
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,988
                Blackberries.   

513
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,456
        Forget about it.        
        Collard greens.         

514
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,558
         Put some collard greens
          right on top of that. 

515
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,663
   WOMAN: I don't know exactly  
       who Aunt Netta was,      

516
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,864
   but I would have loved her.  

517
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,399
             Thank you so much. 
You're really welcome.          

518
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:36,601

                 Chef Val.

         without question.      

520
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:45,476
  So, that's it for this trip.  
        But don't worry.        

521

            next week

525
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,686
  How do you get the sprinkles  
            on top?!
