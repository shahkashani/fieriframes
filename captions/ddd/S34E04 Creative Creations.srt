00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,200
           Hey, there.          

2
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:03,668
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,605
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

4
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,173
          This trip...          

5
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,541
        Whoa!                   

6
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:11,877
 ...we're cruising into creative
       culinary creations.      

7
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,679
 This is outrageous.            

8
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:16,081
 Like boundary-pushing biscuits 
          in Virginia.          

9
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,616
You're the biscuit king?        

10
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,818
          Dough daddy.          
The dough daddy.                

11
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,354
   FIERI: Childhood favorites   
      gone wild in Vermont.     

12
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,891
It sounds like a college        
dorm-room concoction.           

13
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:28,027
    And in Ottawa, Canada...    
                           Dude.

14
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:30,295
      ...a spot smashing up     
          both sweet...         

15
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,197
                   This is      
         a destination doughnut.

16
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:33,565
         ...and savory.         

17
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,700
  I'm just 100% letting you know
             I'm stealing this. 

18
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:40,973
                     ♪♪         

19
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:43,108
        I'm into history,       
    I'm into the old school,    

20
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,045
  into the nostalgia and I love 
  to see that it's coming back. 

21
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,512
       People are getting       
         into the cars,         

22
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,314
    the way they're dressing,   
    the way they're cooking.    

23
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:52,250
So I'm here on the Old North End
     of Burlington, Vermont,    

24
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,319
         where two gals         
    are taking it old school.   

25
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,655
      You're gonna dig it.      
     This is Butch & Babe's.    

26
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,725
         Flipping cakes.        

27
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,259
 On a scale of zero to legit... 

28
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,528
                  It's on legit?
         Just delicious.        

29
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,730
         The Big Butch.         

30
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,398
  WOMAN: All those flavors that 
       you know and love,       

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,333
      but they shake it up      
      a little differently.     

32
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,734
    FIERI: That offbeat menu    

33
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,070
       is brought to life       
      by Chef Jaclyn Major,     

34
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,139
       and that funky vibe      
         is a throwback         

35
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:16,608
     to owner Kortnee Bush's    
        family business.        

36
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,810
                   FIERI:       
              Butch and Babe's? 

37
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:18,877
     That's my grandparents.    

38
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,412
      They were in banquets     
          and catering          

39
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,814
       for about 40 years       
           in Chicago.          

40
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:23,815
       So, you do this, and what
       kind of restaurant is it?

41
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,950
          An eclectic,          
      neighborhood hangout.     

42
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,152
              What is the menu, 
                    Chef?       

43
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,754
   Produce-driven,              
    grandma chic.               

44
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,622
               Oh, whoa, whoa,  
              back up a second. 

45
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,691
         There's, like, millions
           of cookbooks of that.

46
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,626
I like to make old-school,      
   classic dishes               

47
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,094
with my own modern twist.       

48
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,563
  I got Mac and cheese pancakes 
          with hot dog.         

49
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,498
     Mac and cheese pancake     
         is ridiculous.         

50
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,634
  The crispiness that comes out 
     from the melted cheese     

51
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,236
       is beyond favorite.      

52
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:45,504
  Let's talk about              
 what we're making.             

53
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:46,505
         Well, we're gonna start

54
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:47,772
             with the buttermilk
               pancake batter.  

55
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,508
Well, I guess we do.            
           I guess we do. Ready?

56
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,176
I mean, it's gonna be tough     
to keep up with this one,       

57
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:52,310
I can already tell you.         

58
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,379
       Flour, salt, baking soda.

59
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,114
I could probably leave          
and you could just host         

60
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,849
the rest of the show            
by yourself if you want.        

61
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:58,816
                  Kind of.      

62
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,119
      Eggs, buttermilk and, Guy,

63
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,854
              we're just mixing 
             the pancake batter.

64
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,122
Are you still doing it?         

65
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,190
Alright, she's doing            
 a great job, folks.            

66
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,860
 Diners, drive-ins,             
and grandma recipes show.       

67
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:09,460
                    Yes.        
What's up next?                 

68
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,330
               Habanero syrup.  
Habanero syrup?                 

69
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:13,532
            Vermont maple syrup,
                  grade A,      

70
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:16,868
       dark color, robust taste.

71
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,536
We might be related.            
                        I know. 

72
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,939
Alright, so maple syrup         
  and the habanero.             

73
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,006
          Bring it up to a boil.

74
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,675
                We let it sit   
          for about three hours.

75
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,744
  We've got a bucket of wieners,
               bucket of mac,   

76
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,880
      bucket of Vermont cheddar.
Okay.                           

77
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:30,616
      Buttermilk pancake batter,
               hot-dog slices,  

78
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:33,218
             we're gonna put in 
          cooked elbow macaroni,

79
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,220
            our Vermont cheddar,
               press it down.   

80
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,488
   I'm impressed.               

81
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,824
   Spray the top of our pancakes
            with nonstick spray.

82
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,093
Flip them over on the cheese.   
You're making a gigantic skirt, 

83
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:42,628
 you're getting all             
that crunchy cheese.            

84
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,697
       Scallion, habanero maple,
              and we enjoy it.  

85
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:51,770
                     ♪♪         

86
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,239
 This is outrageous.            
  The crunchy part              

87
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,241
 and the creamy part            
of the mac and cheese.          

88
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,510
It's the saltiness of something 
you don't get enough of,        

89
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,512
  which is hot dog,             
and then you dip it over here   

90
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:04,849
into a slightly spicy           
   Vermont maple.               

91
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,317
      It's all                  
 my favorite things.            

92
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,920
It sounds like the weirdest     
   thing I've seen              

93
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:11,056
on a menu in a long time,       
 and it is so legit.            

94
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,257
     Well done.                 
        Whoa!                   

95
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,592
                    Wow,        
            that was a hot snap.

96
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,261
                   Hot dog      
        mac and cheese pancakes.

97
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,997
   You get the sweet, you get   
  the spicy, you get the tangy. 

98
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,131
          It's killer.          

99
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,734
It sounds like a college        
dorm-room concoction.           

100
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,336
  Sunshine board in the window. 

101
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:25,470
        WOMAN #2: Butch & Babe's

102
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:26,805
                 is a great     
          Burlington restaurant.

103
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,873
It's real deal.                 
             It's the real deal.

104
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,875
         She always uses        
       local ingredients.       

105
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,144
        Mmm.                    

106
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:33,144
         We're not gonna be able
                   to talk      

107
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,679
              between your wows 
               and your mmm's.  

108
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,215
I don't know if I'm supposed    
 to talk about this,            

109
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,083
  but I'm actually              
 a vegetable farmer.            

110
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,084
           What, is there, like,
                 some secret    

111
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,753
          vegetable-farmer cult?
                    Shh.        

112
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,022
Jackie is one of the few chefs  
I know who will say,            

113
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,758
"Just give me a surprise box    
of whatever's in season,"       

114
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,759

00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,450
   Must have been               
some kind of special dog.       

230
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,319
Alright, so a great biscuit     
    starts with?                

231
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:35,587
              White Lily Flour. 
Okay.                           

232
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,321
     Cold vegetarian shortening.
Got it.                         

233
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:40,992
      It's gonna cut up to about
    pea-size pieces of fat here.

234
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,927
              Cold buttermilk,  
              salt and pepper.  

235
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,130
            Bring this together.
             I'm gonna fold it. 

236
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,264
 How many times you             
  gonna layer that?             

237
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,665
                Four layers.    

238
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,067
Can't see that he's ever done   
 this before, right?            

239
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:52,136
              Go straight down  
  and straight up. Do not twist.

240
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,271
    There you go.               

241
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,606
                 375 degrees    
               for 16 minutes.  

242
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,609
       Butter these bad boys up.
Beautiful.                      

243
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,277
              We're gonna make  
            the Tasso ham gravy.

244
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,545
              First is gonna be 
                  our ghee.     

245
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,213
Clarified butter.               
                    Shallots.   

246
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,482
 Okay.                          
                 Tasso ham.     

247
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,349
      Tasso ham                 
   right in there.              

248
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,152
                  Flour here.   
Make your roux.                 

249
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:10,288
       House-made chicken stock,
   heavy cream, salt and pepper.

250
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,291
 Once this gravy comes together,
             the toppings await.

251
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,292
  Good, good, good.             

252
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,227
              We're gonna start 
               with more ghee,  

253
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,496
                 Tasso ham,     
              shallots, shrimp. 

254
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,164
That's a lot of shrimp          
   for a biscuit.               

255
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,101
      Garlic, fresh lemon juice,
             some shrimp butter.

256
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,636
        Okay.                   
                  Add our gravy.

257
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,239
        Now it's ready to plate.
       Got it.                  

258
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:31,009
               Scoop of grits,  
       pour a whole bunch there.

259
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,744
This is kind of illegal,        
   I would think.               

260
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:38,450
Love the Tasso, love the big    
grits, flaky biscuit,           

261
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:40,451
 gravy's not heavy,             
   not too salty.               

262
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,588
 This is definitely             
a rainy Sunday dish.            

263
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,390
I eat that in the middle of     
week, I'll be asleep here.      

264
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,792
         Yeah, we should sell it
             with pajama pants. 

265
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,460
    Or a Snuggie.               
                    Even better.

266
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,129
 Right up my alley.             

267
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,465
     Well done.                 

268
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:55,200
                  Black Dog     
             working in the pan.

269
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,868
          The biscuits          
      are light and fluffy.     

270
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,404
      The shrimp is tender      
         and delicious.         

271
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:02,273
          I mean, they have made
             the biscuit trendy.

272
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,943
   FIERI: Which is par for the  
  course on this side of town.  

273
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,812
 MAN: The Fan is a neighborhood 
  that is a staple of Richmond, 

274
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,214
   everybody knows what it is.  

275
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,683
       The Fancy Biscuit,       
 it's such a wonderful addition.

276
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,551
 It's got a real Southern vibe. 

277
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,886
  THOMPSON: Plating grit tots.  

278
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:18,089
 I love the ham and cheese grit,
        fried into a tot.       

279
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,158
   WOMAN #3: Who doesn't love   
     when you fry something     

280
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,425
     that's already amazing?    

281
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,560
      They're really good.      

282
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,095
   Alright, chef.               
What are we gonna get into?     

283
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,497
         THOMPSON: Our Tasso ham
          and cheddar grit tots.

284
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,966
              We're gonna start 
             with chicken stock 

285
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,300
       that we put in our grits.

286
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,837
             Some chicken bones,
      cold water here, mirepoix.

287
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,440
        I got to sauté this baby
               with bay leaf.   

288
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,174
   Parsley, thyme.              

289
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:38,509
          Garlic and peppercorn.

290
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,510
 Tri-color, got it.             

291
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,845
        And then I get a string.

292
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,714
Where's your string?            

293
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:44,115
               In your pocket.  
  Okay.                         

294
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,517
                Chest pocket.   
    Nope.                       

295
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,917
                     No?        
Your chest pocket.              

296
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,586
              My chest pocket.  
          That's what you meant.

297
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,587
If you had a magic trick        

298
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,055
    and that was                
 in my chest pocket,            

299
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,457
 we were gonna have             
a whole different show.         

300
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,059
   Boom. This is gonna cook down
        for about two hours now.

301
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,260
 Now, look at those,            
   those are some               

302
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,929
stone ground right there.       
                 That's right.  

303
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,997
           No instant down here.
Now, come on now.               

304
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,933
 No self-respecting             
 Southerner, right?             

305
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,068
         Extra virgin olive oil,
               some Tasso ham.  

306
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,469
Tasso Ham. Shallots.            

307
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,471
               We're gonna add  
     our homemade chicken stock.

308
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:08,740
                A little bit    
               of heavy cream.  

309
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,341
Now, were you making grits      
before you worked here?         

310
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,943
             Being in the South,
        it's one of those things

311
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,344
        you do when you grow up.
You better know how.            

312
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,146
I think you've got to do it     
to graduate eighth grade.       

313
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,549
    Stone-ground grits. Now, you
      can't walk away from this.

314
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:18,816
 You can't walk away            
     from this.                 

315
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,752
       It'll burn to the bottom.
It'll burn it to the bottom.    

316
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:21,953
                Then you fail   
              the eighth grade. 

317
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:22,953
     You go back                
all the way to kindergarten.    

318
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,089
              Salt and pepper.  

319
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,590
             Probably gonna take
               about an hour.   

320
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:26,957
Well, you have a good time.     
 I'll be right back.            

321
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,293
    I'm gonna go                
   check the car.               

322
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,561
                      Thank you.
Keep it up. Doing good.         

323
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,762
              Guy, we're ready! 

324
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,232
I'm making grits with this dude.
    I got to go.                

325
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,768
Talking to my kid about grits.  
He's a big grit fan.            

326
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,304
             So this is gonna be
some extra-sharp cheddar cheese.

327
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,373
  I need to do this             
in the name of science.         

328
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,775
  The grind on this             
     is so big.                 

329
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,443
   You're getting               
 really big pieces.             

330
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,846
  Lots of texture.              
    That's grits.               

331
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,780
             We're gonna add it 
              to a sheet tray.  

332
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:50,848
    Let it cool.                

333
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,384
             Cut these in about 
               one-inch dices.  

334
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,519
        Okay.                   

335
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,054
       This is just some regular
                 old flour.     

336
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,189
             Fry them for about 
               three minutes.   

337
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,725
      Drain them off. Throw them
        right in here like this.

338
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,261
             Our sriracha aioli,

00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,363
 with our pistachio             
    pastry cream.               

450
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,432
                Don't tell me   
          you're gonna flip this

451
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:28,833
            and do the raspberry
             on the other side. 

452
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,035
The French call it a gelee,     
but I call it a jam.            

453
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,170
                 Sacre bleu.    

454
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,905
      Top with                  
  raspberry pearls.             

455
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,040
       I don't even like sweets.
            My mouth's drooling.

456
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,308
                I don't know    
           what to do with this.

457
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,909
    People eat it               
in many different ways.         

458
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,445
                   I want       
           to bite it like this,

459
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,247
             but it's gonna get 
     half of the jam up my nose.

460
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:45,450
          I'm gonna jam the jam.

461
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,984
               I'm gonna be on  
             the rowing machine 

462
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,519
           for a week with this.

463
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:51,856
                     ♪♪         

464
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,857
        Is there any on my face?
You are good.                   

465
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,460
     You're not being very nice.
                 Delicious.     

466
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,263
          You know what you need
             is an eyewash kit. 

467
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:01,199
         How am I looking there?
            Bob in Saskatchewan?

468
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,867
      Awesome. It's not as sweet
              as I anticipated. 

469
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,869
                The execution   
                is masterful.   

470
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:09,273
           The balance of flavor
    is really well orchestrated.

471
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,541
             I don't want to say
             you get a saltiness

472
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:13,344
         of the pistachio cream,
     but it's not a heavy sugar.

473
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:18,082
            It's a rich, earthy,
                nuttiness...    

474
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:21,152
    balanced with the sweet tang
             from the raspberry 

475
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,953
        and then a little bit of
   that cinnamon coming through,

476
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:26,223
             but it's the light,
                fluffy layers   

477
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,427
              of the lacquered  
               doughnut, bro.   

478
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,763
       I'm the least dessert guy
              you've ever seen  

479
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:32,964
             and that's probably
              the most doughnut 

480
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:35,499
                 I've eaten     
           in the last 40 years.

481
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,834
                   This is      
         a destination doughnut.

482
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,037
               One of the best  
               I've ever had.   

483
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,838
 Pistachio raspberry            
  O-Towners are up.             

484
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,573
  The pastry cream is perfect.  

485
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,876
Little bit of salty, some sweet.

486
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,043
    Something like 80 layers.   

487
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,578
        100,                    
but I'm not counting it.        

488
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,047
      Maybe it's 80% butter     
         and 100 layers.        

489
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,716
It's 80% kitchen and 20%        
dining room is what it is.      

490
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,852
       -Croque madame up.       
 -How many square feet is this? 

491
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,254
 MATHIESON: This is             
about 3,500 square feet.        

492
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,589
        Dude. What's over there?
Our kitchen.                    

493
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,591
             All that kitchen is
            for that dining room

494
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:01,792
              or is there like  

495
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,728
               an 8,000-person  
          banquet hall upstairs?

496
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,062
       I wish.                  

497
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,465
Art Is In is a very well-known  
place here in Ottawa.           

498
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,732
            This is flavor dome.

499
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,068
      I only came here for      
 the breakfast and the pastries 

500
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,204
      and then I found out      
        about the pizzas.       

501
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,139
      FIERI: And this joint     
     isn't just laying down     

502
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,207
     regular pizza toppings.    

503
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,808
Spaghetti with a chance         
    of meatballs.               

504
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,811
MAN #2: You've got this mountain
   of spaghetti in the middle.  

505
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,011
   You look at it and you go,   
          "Oh, my gosh,         

506
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,413
   we're gonna have fun here."  

507
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,215
       Now I've had a half pound
                  of sugar,     

508
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,416
             when we come back, 
    we're hanging out over here.

509
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:26,818
              We're gonna make  
              spaghetti pizza.  

510
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,685
  We'll see you in a little bit.
             Alright, let's go. 

511
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:30,888
            FIERI: Welcome back.

512
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,558
          "Triple D" hanging out
        in little Italy, Ottawa.

513
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,826
             We're at Art Is In.

514
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,694
             His name's not Art 
                and he is in,   

515
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:37,694
              but it's artisan. 

516
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,363
             FIERI:             
   His name is actually Kevin,  

517
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,166
   and he's the master behind   
   the pieces of culinary art   

518
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,968
 at this bakery and restaurant. 

519
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,770
 Two spaghetti with             
a chance of meatballs.          

520
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,438
 WOMAN #4: You're not gonna get 
     anything like spaghetti    

521
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,573
   with a chance of meatballs   
    anywhere else in Ottawa.    

522
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:50,908
       MAN #2: Spaghetti's      
          in the middle         

523
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,976
 and you've got the nice crust. 

524
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:53,311
       Best pizza around.       

525
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:54,712
          Alright, so let's make
              the dough first.  

526
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,647
    Right. Water.               
I'm gonna add the starter.      

527
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,049
       How long has this starter
                been living?    

528
00:16:58,051 --> 00:16:59,851
    Eight years.                
Someone killed the starter once.

529
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,319
        And they don't work here
                  anymore.      

530
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:04,055
   Baker's flour.               
It's about a 14% protein flour, 

531
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,389
 so it's elastic-y.             

532
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:08,192
Organic whole wheat flour,      
tiny bit of yeast, salt.        

533
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,927
                       Got it.  
    Mix the dough               
  for four minutes.             

534
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,395
     Let it rise                
for an hour and a half.         

535
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,197
Fold. I'm gonna let it sit      
for another two hours           

536
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,265
and then we fold it again.      

537
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,466
 Then we let it sit             
    another hour                

538
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,334
and then we can process it      
  into pizza dough.             

539
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,203
           I can't even keep up.
           I'm reading the story

540
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,005
             and get up tomorrow
         and had a good morning.

541
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,208
And then we shape it            
per order for every pizza.      

542
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,076
                 Of course.     
Yes.                            

543
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,144
                Pesto is up.    

544
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,879
Olive oil, lemon juice,         
  garlic, walnuts,              

545
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,081
Parmigiano-Reggiano,            

546
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,816
  salt and pepper,              
    some parsley,               

547
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:33,684
 basil, arugula adds            
this pepperiness to it.         

548
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:34,952
                  I dig it.     

549
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:37,955
  I'm just 100% letting you know
             I'm stealing this. 

550
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:39,023
   It's all yours.              

551
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,758
            Light on the garlic,
             heavy on the herbs.

552
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,960
     Love the arugula. Wow, man.
Thank you.                      

553
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,762
             Last but not least,
               the meatballs.   

554
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,164
      So I have                 
  some ground veal,             

555
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,232
a house-ground beef chuck,      
  our bread crumbs.             

556
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,101
    This is made                
 from our pretzels.             

557
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,969
     Raw onion,                 
Parmigiano-Reggiano,            

558
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:55,506
some nutmeg, oregano,           
pepper, salt, garlic.

560
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:58,242
Some parsley, two eggs.         
                A little binder.

561
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,977
Do you think you can add        
a little bit of the cream?

             Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

    absorb some of the moisture.

00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,716
      These go                  
  on the pizza raw.             

565
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,518
     As it cooks, all that stays
                on the pizza    

566
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,653
          and builds the flavor.

570
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,326

571
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,394
          And I don't wear white

579
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,408

without cheese first.           

580
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,410
                  Yes, 650.

585
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:40,418
Two minutes.                    
          Which one do you want?

586
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,486
      Big one.                  
And we will do the spaghetti    

587
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,420
