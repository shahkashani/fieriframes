  for a little bit.             

80
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:01,580

 You're a gangster.             

87
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:15,394
We're gonna brush it            
  with some butter.             
                           Yes. 

88
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,462

    and how long?               

89
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:20,632
           For about 45 minutes

91
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,271
           Then we just cut them
                  into 15.      

92
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:29,775
 I like this as just            
one big biscuit monster.        

93
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,213
  Brisket's cooled,

00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,282

                    Yes.        

96
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,419
     Add a little vegetable oil,

97
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,954
                diced onion,    
       and some minced jalapeño.

98
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,490
Holy jalapeño, Batman.          
              It's pretty spicy.

99
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,628
Now we're gonna add a little bit
           of chipotle peppers. 

100
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,962
      In adobo.                 

101
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:54,299
      In adobo, and we just cook
      for about a minute or two.

102
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,301
            Now we're gonna work
              with our brisket. 

103
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,902
         So, we're gonna get rid
           of some of this fat. 

104
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,970
                  Not much.     

105
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,438
         Then against the grain,

106
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,774
             we're gonna cut it 
       in about one-inch strips.

107
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:05,777
 Okay. Now we're gonna just chop
       and pull with the knife. 

108
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,512
                I don't like    
              to over-shred it. 

109
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,047
             Kind of pot roasty.

110
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,316
You pot roastied it good,       
though. I like it with the beer.

111
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,851
   Now we're just gonna put this
                in the bowl.    

112
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,786
Before I eat it all.            
        Mmm.                    

113
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:17,656
        We're gonna add a little
        granulated garlic, salt,

114
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:20,459
               smoked paprika,  
      and a little black pepper.

115
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:23,594
       And then we're gonna add 
    that chipotle sauce to this.

116
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,663
We're pouring that on top.      
                            Yep.

117
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,464
      This all                  
gets mixed together?            

118
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,666
                   Right.       

119
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,068
           Okay, now we're just 
        gonna make our sandwich.

120
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,137
                 Gonna take     
           a little bit brisket.

121
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,338
    Heat that up.               

122
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,841
        And then we're gonna add
        some caramelized onion. 

123
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:38,810
                    Slice       
        of white cheddar cheese.

124
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,345
       And then we're gonna just
            pop it in the oven. 

125
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,480
                    Just        
         until the cheese melts.

126
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:44,949
             About two minutes. 

127
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,884
                  Brisket.      

128
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:49,954
Look at that tender,            
   cheesy biscuit.              

129
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,023
                 We're just     
               gonna slice it.  

130
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,158
              Add a little bit  
            of clarified butter.

131
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,894
     That's just                
  what that needed.             

132
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,230
Hot meat on the biscuit.        

133
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,299
            We want those juices
               on there, too.   

134
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,969
       Chipotle guacamole sauce.

135
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,872
           And that's a chipotle
              brisket sandwich. 

136
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:12,710
 That's ridiculous.             

137
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,379
    The brisket's               
  cooked perfectly.             

138
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,380
   Not too salty.               

139
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,716
    Got good fat,               
but not too much of it.         

140
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,052
That biscuit screams            

141
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:22,186
for anything that you want      
    to put on it.               

142
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,055
You got a nice little burn      
 from the jalapeño.             

143
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:27,659
    Cools it off                
with the chipotle crema.        

144
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,195
     And enough                 
  for seven people.             

145
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,330
 But delivered with             
the culinary techniques         

146
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,798
 that you put to it,            
      spot on.                  

147
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,400
                 All right.     

148
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:36,668
              Chipotle brisket. 

149
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,204
       Brisket's amazing.       
 It's got a little sweet smokey.

150
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:42,674
        Cheddar brisket.        
    Oh, melts in your mouth.    

151
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,743
        It's fun to have        
   this kind of food out here.  

152
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,744
   Well worth the drive, too.   

153
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,748
       FIERI: Or how about      
     well worth the flight?     

154
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,084
      The planes flying overhead
           making all the noise 

155
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,219
            were these gentlemen

156
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,621
           from the Thunderbirds
              out of Las Vegas. 

157
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,423
MAN: We were flying overhead and
smelled some pretty great food, 

158
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,291
          so I decided,         
      "Hey, we got to land      

159
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,426
          and come here         
       and check it out."       

160
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,694
               Not a bad move.  

161
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,163
           How many performances
              do you do a year? 

162
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,564
    We'll do 60 shows a year.   

163
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,434
   This year we're performing   
at about 34 different locations.

164
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:12,637
 We get to represent so many men
  and women that are deployed.  

165
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,773
                 What a job.    

166
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,577
   FIERI: As for me, I'm gonna  
    hang out a little longer.   

167
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,178
         Not a bad gig.         

168
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,047
              Crispy pork belly 
               in the window.   

169
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,381
  I don't even know             
    what to say.                

170
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,182
       When we come back.       

171
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,324
             FIERI:             
     In Parkland, Wisconsin,    

172
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:35,527
 you don't need a citation to go
    to The Kounty Quarthouse.   

173
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,262
      Just a big appetite.      

174
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,797
              MAN:              
   Food is absolutely amazing.  

175
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:41,533
 Everything here is scratch-made
       and it's wonderful.      

176
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,734
   FIERI: And it's bringing in  
       all kinds of folks.      

177
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,837
       We have a lot of seniors,
       we have a lot of foodies.

178
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,539
        Country folk, city folk,
           all kinds of people. 

179
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,808
 Even the Air Force Thunderbirds
           dropped in           

180
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,010
           for a taste          
    of Beth Cherny's kitchen.   

181
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,945
You come to a funky little joint
                  like this     

182
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,480
             on a country road. 
             What do you think? 

183
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:56,948
     I love it.                 
  It's good. Great.             

184
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,550
      WOMAN: Beth, I know,      
      puts her whole heart      

185
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,218
         into everything        
       she makes homemade.      

186
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,220
              Crispy pork belly 
               in the window.   

187
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,422
 MAN: Pork belly's kind of like 
  a mix between bacon and ham.  

188
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,557
        It's meat candy.        

189
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,758
       FIERI:                   
What are we making now?         

190
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,294
          Okay, we're gonna make
            the braising liquid 

191
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,628
                   for our      
            pork belly sandwich.
  Okay.                         

192
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,965
         I start with some water
            and some soy sauce. 

193
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:17,635
           Add some brown sugar.

194
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:21,840
 Little oil, some minced garlic,
         and some black pepper. 

195
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:24,842
        I don't like to submerge
            the entire fat top, 

196
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,512
   just so that some of the fat 
 can braise of the belly itself.

197
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,180
           This goes in the oven
                 uncovered.     

198
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,116
   Uncovered for?               
                     375.       

199
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,450
    For how long?               
                       2½ hours.

200
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,919
  Dig it. Next up?              

201
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,988
   We're gonna make the dressing
                for our slaw    

202
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,790
              that goes on top  
             of the pork belly. 

203
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,592
               Vegetable oil.   
  Got it.                       

204
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,861
                 Soy sauce.     
              Red wine vinegar. 

205
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,929
      And a little black pepper.

206
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,598
          We just whisk that up.

207
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:48,866
   Green cabbage.               

208
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,134
        Plain old green cabbage.

209
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,069
                  Carrots.      

210
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:53,138
    Green onions.               
   And a little...              

211
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,407
                  Cilantro.     
...cilantro.                    

212
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,941
  Okay, now we're gonna assemble
       the pork belly sandwich. 

213
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:57,942
     All right.                 

214
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,145
              We're gonna take  
               our pork belly   

215
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,581
             that's been braised
              and cooled down.  

216
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:09,287
           And then we're going 
     to dredge it in rice flour.

217
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,156
 What are you doing             
   with rice flour              

218
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,824
      out here                  
  on County K Road?             

219
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,426
      It's crispier and lighter.

220
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:15,627
     All right,                 
now we're gonna deep-fry it?    

221
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:16,561
                         Yes.   
       Great.                   

222
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,566
              We're gonna take  
           a warm ciabatta roll.

223
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,569
           Wasabi mayo and then 
          our crispy pork belly.

224
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:25,971
     Ridiculous.                

225
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,305
       And then we're gonna take
                a little bit    

226
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:28,239
       of our slaw that we made.

227
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,107
                We dress it.

     You really get to taste    
  the full flavor of the food.  

342
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,095
                   Thai noodles.
    I'm having the Thai bowl.   

343
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:48,566
    It's full of vegetables,    
    noodles, and spicy curry.   

344
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,301
        When we make curry here,
          we don't mess around. 

345
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,036
           A lot of Thai curry, 
        you see it really thick.

346
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,037
          We make it as a broth.

347
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,038
     So, here's some lemongrass.

348
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,439
       We make a lemongrass tea.

349
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,174
   FIERI: How long              
do we let this steep?           
                     20 minutes.

350
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,176
        Okay.                   
                Now fresh basil.

351
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,511
               Gonna push this  
                down in there   

352
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,446
      'cause we got to make room
                for cilantro.   

353
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,648
      Serranos.                 

354
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,716
                   Garlic.      
Got it.                         

355
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,050
                Lemon juice.    

356
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,251
          And then the galangal.

357
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,387
        This stuff takes flavor 
        to a whole nother level.

358
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,256
                  Sea salt,     
          evaporated cane juice.

359
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:13,391
Evaporated cane juice?          
                It's very fancy.

360
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,859
             Gluten-free tamari.

361
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,594
       Little coconut milk here.

362
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:19,164
                  And then      
             the lemongrass tea.

363
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,000
  Drop the hammer.              

364
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,003
                Do it. Do it.   

365
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,138
   Gonna strain it              
    through here.               
                        Exactly.

366
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,140
                  The rest      
           of our lemongrass tea

367
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,975
                and the rest    
            of our coconut milk.

368
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:35,146
We got water boiling.           
                   Rice noodles.

369
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:39,083
         Now we're going to add 
  our broccoli, red bell pepper,

370
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:43,087
          zucchini, thin-sliced,
          grass-fed local beef. 

371
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,023
   So, when this starts boiling,
             add the red onion. 

372
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,292
              The meat cooks up 
                really quick.   

373
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,694
         It's super thin sliced.

374
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,095
                 Garnishes.     
         Put a little mung bean.

375
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,230
Oh, I love mung bean.           

376
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:53,364
      Carrots.                  

377
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,432
                       Cilantro.
That's a lot of cilantro.       

378
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:55,767
               But, you know,   
       it's really good for you.

379
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,635
Scallion.                       
          Oh, you got the touch.

380
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:59,237
        Okay.                   

381
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,043
      Oh, yeah.                 
 It's an orchestra.             

382
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,578
It's all these flavors          

383
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,113
and all these textures          
together in one bowl.           

384
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,182
   Tender noodles,              
    great broth.                

385
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,317
   You could soak               
   anything in it.              

386
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,384
You're rocking this, girl.      

387
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:17,821
        Keow!                   

388
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,192
   It's my very favorite dish.  
    It's really tasty stuff.    

389
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,928
     Always just a pleasure     
         coming in here.        

390
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:24,995
    I don't know                
  what you're doing             

391
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,196
      next time                 
you're in Jackson Hole          

392
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,133
besides snowmobiling or hiking  
with seaweed snacks,            

393
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:31,602
but when you have a chance,     
make sure you make time.        

394
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,939
Come down to Lotus Cafe.        
Girl's off the hook!            

395
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,810
             FIERI:             
 Up next in Lancaster, Oregon...

396
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:40,745
     It's crazy.                

397
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:42,880
        ...a place known        
      for going all out...      

398
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,949
I'm gonna take the rest         
of the month to enjoy this.     

399
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,284
     ...in taking their menu    
           to the max.          

400
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,386
Look at that hummingbird bite   
  I took out of it.             

401
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,763
 So, I'm here on the 99E highway

402
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,965
         about 17 miles         
      from Eugene, Oregon,      

403
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:04,569
 97 miles from Portland in this 
    little farming community.   

404
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,905
 Now, this is an unincorporated 
     town called Lancaster,     

405
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,374
and the lady that owns the town,

406
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:12,043
  well, her son happens to own  
  the only restaurant in town.  

407
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:13,911
         Now, you think         
       that's interesting,      

408
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,446
   wait till you see the menu.  

409
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,916
        This is Junkyard        
     Extreme Burger & Brats.    

410
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,722
    KIM: I've got a Wisconsin   
         and a Chicago.         

411
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,124
 I'm a big eater and I like big 
  hamburgers and big hot dogs,  

412
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,258
   and this is definitely it.   

413
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,861
  You can expect to get messy.  

414
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:33,330
   We never suffer from lack    
   of food when we come here.   

415
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,666
  FIERI: And that's how owners  
Craig and Kim Zumwalt like it --

416
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,067
          big and bold.         

417
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,537
          After working         
    in Nashville's music biz,   

418
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:42,607
     Craig headed back home     
  and opened this place in '06. 

419
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,609
FIERI: How many people          
live here in Lancaster?         

420
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,743
                   CRAIG:       
             Probably about 30. 

421
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:46,811
        Wow.                    

422
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,213
 Is this a trailer?             
            It's a race trailer.

423
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,081
And then you built the shed     
   on next to it?               

424
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,350
                    Yes.        
   Awesome.                     

425
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:55,352
     And they're definitely     
   trying to kick it into gear  

426
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,756
     when it comes to their     
  high-octane signature burger. 

427
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,358
I've got a big block.           

428
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,093
The burger is bigger            
    than my head.               

429
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:03,294
     That huge.                 

430
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,229
     This is just explosion     
      of taste, literally.      

431
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:08,232
   I mean, 'cause there's just  
   so many ingredients in it.   

432
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,367
              We're gonna make  
                a big block.    

433
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:10,902
FIERI: Big block, okay.         
                    Let's do it.

434
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:13,237
              We have our bread 
            made for us. Then --

435
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,238
       Koosh!                   

436
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,574
      We need to put some butter
                  on that.      

437
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:19,043
       Bring a little parmesan, 
      put it right across there.

438
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,311
                  Bring out     
              some burger here. 

439
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,380
 Looks like about a half-pounder
             right there to me. 

440
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:24,181
Yeah, that works.               
         We'll get two of those.

441
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,651
It's a one-pound burger?        
         Yeah. One-pound burger.

442
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,585
 Now we're gonna just throw this
             on here like this. 

443
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,388
     We're just gonna take this 
    and concave it a little bit.

444
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,390
            Grab a little onion.

445
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,060
               Gonna throw on   
          a little bit of bacon.

446
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,362
Going right in the middle.      
                            Yep.

447
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,264
           Gonna smash her down.

448
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:43,334
             Get it caramelized 
                 real good.     

449
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,169
      Now we're gonna cut a hole
      in the middle of the bun. 

450
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,672
         We're gonna add an egg.

451
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,941
    Now we're gonna add a little
          cheddar cheese sauce. 

452
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,144
              About like that.  
Put a little cheddar on the top.

453
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,478
Is this the family plan?
