          THREE OR FOUR MINUTES,

101
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,434
                 CRISP THAT SKIN
                  A LITTLE BIT. 
      WE'LL HAVE IT             
HEAT THROUGH TO THE BONE.       

102
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,502
                 SET THE REST   
               OF THE PLATE UP--

103
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,905
              SOME POLENTA,     
         SOME GRILLED ASPARAGUS.

104
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,973
           THEN WE TAKE IT OUT. 
                BEAUTIFUL.      

105
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,642
         THIS IS THE LOVE TOWN. 

106
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,644
           THEN WE FINISH IT    
      WITH A LITTLE GOAT CHEESE.

107
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:09,180
IT'S ONLY TAKEN 16 DAYS         
  TO MAKE THIS DUCK.            

108
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,450
OH, MY GOSH.                    

109
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,986
DUDE, THAT'S BETTER             
 THAN DUCK CONFIT.              

110
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,521
THIS HAS GREAT SEASONING.       
THIS HAS DEPTH OF FLAVOR.       

111
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,457
      THE SAUCE                 
IS SWEET AND SAVORY.            

112
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,259
THE CHEESE REALLY GOES WELL     
     WITH THE POLENTA.          

113
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,195
IT'S RIDICULOUSLY LONG          
      TO DO THIS.               

114
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,063
IT IS SO WORTH IT.              

115
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,399
            WE'VE WORKED ON THAT
                FOR A WHILE.    
MMM. GREAT JOB, BROTHER.        

116
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:28,800
                         THANKS.
REALLY.                         

117
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,802
                   DUCK CONFIT. 

118
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:33,271
      ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.     
  IT FALLS RIGHT OFF THE BONE.  

119
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,941
                 THE POLENTA    
             ADDS A NICE FLAVOR.
        OFF THE CHARTS.         

120
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,542
    THESE ARE ALL MY RECIPES.   

121
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,012
       I MADE ALL THOSE IN      
 THE FIRST FEW YEARS I WAS HERE.

122
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,481

       NORMALLY FIND IN A DINER.
      (woman) OKAY, THE MUSSELS.

123
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:45,817
REALLY TENDER.                  
     GRILLED SALMON ON TOP      
   OF A SALAD--REALLY GREAT.    

124

HOW WE GONNA PLAY BALL?

   THAT WE MAKE, GARLIC.        

131
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,770

                           OKAY.

136
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,650
THEN WE'RE GONNA THROW IN

               NOTHING LIKE     
         HOMEMADE CHICKEN STOCK.

137

     THESE ARE                  
NEW MEXICO CHILIES.

      THEN WE'RE GONNA PURéE IT?

142
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,729

            AND THOSE SKINS.    

143
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,931

              THE CHILI ON,

00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,609
       AND WE'RE JUST GONNA TRY 
       TO GET AS MUCH AS WE CAN 

148

       WE'RE GONNA COVER THIS UP

151
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:54,018
           AND PUT IT IN WALK-IN
               FOR TWO DAYS.    
NOW IT'S GETTING READY          
 TO GO TO THE SMOKER.           

152
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:56,488
SO THIS BAD BOY, WITH THAT KIND 
    OF FLAME, CAN GET HOT.      

153
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:59,023
     ON THE TOP SHELF SO IT GETS
     AS MUCH SMOKE AS POSSIBLE. 

154
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:01,026
AFTER IT DOES HALF AN HOUR      
      IN THE SMOKER,            

155
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,228
       PULL IT OUT,             
THEN IT GOES INTO THE OVEN.

                ISN'T THAT COOL?

158
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,369
IT WASN'T THAT BIG OF A DARE.   
I JUST WANTED TO EAT IT. MMM!   

159
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:14,706
WE'RE JUST GONNA HEAT IT UP     
  WITH A LITTLE STOCK...        
               PORK STOCK.      
        THAT'S LIKE MY GATORADE.

160
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,574
AND A LITTLE BIT                
  OF THE SAUCE.                 

161
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,044
 THAT'S SOME GOOD LOVE          
     RIGHT THERE.               
         WHAT IS IT SERVED WITH?

162
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,912
GRILLED CORN, BLACK BEANS,      

163
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,882
           PAPAYA SALSA         
   AND A SIDE OF CORN TORTILLAS.

164
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,520

MMM. THAT PORK OPENS UP         

166
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,457

  IN THAT SAUCE.                

167
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,126
             IT LOVES THE SAUCE.
IT DOES.                        

168
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:37,128
  NOT TOO SPICY. YOU CAN        
STILL TASTE THE PORK. MMM.      

169
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,596
IT'S COMPLEMENTED               
 BY THE PEPPERS.                

170
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:41,266
      THE BEANS ARE TENDER.     
 THE CORN'S GOT GREAT SWEETNESS.

171
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:44,002

    GOT SOME SWEETNESS, TOO.    

173
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:50,074
     JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT      
         OF SEASONINGS.

      RIBS WITH HOT SAUCE.      

175
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,346
      IT COVERS ALL POINTS      
     FROM FLAVOR TO TEXTURE.    

176
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,881
  IT'S CONSISTENTLY WONDERFUL.  
                   I LOVE THE Q.

177
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,284

223
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,793

   WITH INSTANT MASHED POTATOES.
INSTANT MASHED POTATOES?        

227
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,469

            ARE NOT CONSISTENT. 

229

            HAVE TOO MUCH WATER.

230
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,475
              THEN THE DUMPLINGS
                COME OUT FUNNY. 

231
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,610

   NOW WE DUMP SOME FLOUR HERE, 
           DUMP IT OUT.         

237

       THIS IS PRETTY CLOSE.    

238

                CUT IT UP.      

240
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:30,035
AND THEN YOU JUST GIVE 'EM      
   A LITTLE ROLLY-ROLL?         
                       OH, YEAH.

241
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:33,371
      WE SALT THE WATER AND THEN
         THROW ALL OF THEM IN.  

242
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,640
AND THEN WHEN THEY FLOAT,       
     THEY'RE READY?

           PUT 'EM IN THE PAN.  

244
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,710

SO IT'S AN UNSALTED BUTTER?     

245

WE SHOVE THAT IN THE OVEN.      

248
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,519

NOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE            
THE PAPRIKASH GRAVY.            

249
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:50,321

00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,660
       TOMATO PASTE. LET THAT   
     HANG OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT.

252
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,596
 THEN WE'VE GOT SPANISH PAPRIKA,

  WELL, I ALWAYS SCREW THAT UP--
       MARJORAM OR WHATEVER.    

257
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:12,544
                  WELL, I KNOW  
                 WHAT I'M DOING.

258
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,812
"OR WHATEVER."                  

259
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,414

262
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,088

WITH SOME FLOUR WITH SOME WATER.

263
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:27,158
    THEN I ADD SOME SOUR CREAM. 
   WE LET IT COOK AND STRAIN IT.

264
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,094
      STRAIN IT                 
AFTER WE THICKEN IT?            

265
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,495
           YES, BECAUSE YOU WANT
            A NICE CLEAR SAUCE. 

266
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:34,265

 AND GOES INTO THE SAUCE, OKAY?

       GIVE YOU SOME DUMPLINGS. 

269
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,904

OR DO YOU JUST THINK I'M HUNGRY?

270
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,839
    OUR PORTIONS                
ARE ON THE BIG SIDE.            

271

     SAUCE IS REALLY FLAVORFUL. 

276
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,652
 THE MOST UNIQUE PART ABOUT IT--
         THE SOUR CREAM.        

277
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,988
             IT HAS A LITTLE BIT
              OF A TANG TO IT.  

278
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,323

                 GET USED TO IT?

279

      OF MY GRANDMA'S PAPRIKASH.
REALLY?                         

283
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:11,136
