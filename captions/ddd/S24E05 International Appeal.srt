00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:02,667
 Hey, everybody, I'm Guy Fieri, 

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:03,936
     and we're rolling out,     
 looking for America's greatest 

3
00:00:03,938 --> 00:00:06,672
   diners, drive-ins, & dives.  
          This trip...          

4
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:07,740
                    Agh!        

5
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:09,408
   We're crossing the country.  

6
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,475
 It's a great idea.             

7
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,477
  To get a taste of the world.  

8
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,279
               This is really   
             gonna be the bomb. 

9
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:16,348
        In San Francisco.       
              Yes!              

10
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,083
      A joint cranking out      
          the Cuban --          

11
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,685
Handmade, scratch-made.         

12
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,686
  and platefuls of Puerto Rico. 

13
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,222
Let me take 18 more bites       
 and check this out.            

14
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,358
         In Key Largo --        
       Living on the edge.      

15
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,293
      an island of Italian      
         I'm gonna die.         

16
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,963
            served up           
     with an oldschool spin.    

17
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:33,031
  Like little tears             
     of angels.                 

18
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,766
 And in Stockton, California -- 

19
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,835
             This is crazy-good!

            into total flooding.

22
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:43,108
           revving up           
      the fiery favorites.      

23
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,576
               Oh, that's hot!  

24
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,444
     That's all right here,

29
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:07,065
   if you woulda told me that   
  I was gonna be driving around 

30
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,735
 to random parking lots, looking
 for food trucks, I woulda said,

        "You are crazy."        
           All right.           

32

  You are crazy because that's  
     exactly what I'm doing.    

33
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,140
            I'm here            
    in Stockton, California,    

34

00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,145
     and that's a food truck    
 serving up Laotian street food.

36
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:22,747
      This is Green Papaya.

        -It's top-notch.        

41
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,158
  I got nam khao at the window. 

42
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,759
 Not a lot of places            
     like this.                 

43
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,628
            Not a lot           
     of Laotian food trucks,    

44
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,330
  not in my travels, at least.  

45
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,298
       Which is what drove

done Thai or Lao food.

        I'm gonna do it!"       
          -There we go.         

49
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,773
         -From there on.        
 -How do you describe Lao food? 

50
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,776
It's spicy, sour, bitter.       

51
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,978
Order for kham tien.            

52
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,913
          The kham tien         
      is a very common dish     

53
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:57,249
          that we eat,          
   almost like Vietnamese pho.  

54
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:01,186
It's spicier and much more sour,
   versus the Vietnamese pho.   

55
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:02,321
         GUY: What're we        
        gonna make first?       

56
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:03,589
   We're gonna do               
 the chicken broth.             

57
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:06,391
  So we have water,             
 chicken soup base,             

58
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:09,327
    salt, sugar,                
  just those three.             

59
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,396
And then, we're gonna put       
   our chicken in.              

60
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,131
So while that is cooking,       

61
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,933
   we're gonna go               
and make our noodles.           

62
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,334
       People buy noodles,      
            you know.           

63
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,603
  Where do you buy              
 your noodles from?             

64
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:19,872
       G&G Market, one of       
   my favorite grocery stores,  

65
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:22,741
    and also has the greatest   
      Asian food selection.     

66
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,743
  -Rice flour, tapioca starch.  
             -Okay.             

67
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,814
  So I'm gonna pour             
my hot water in there.          

68
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,016
 And your mom would do this all 
  the time when you were a kid? 

69
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,085
   I would have to              
wake up early, early,           

70
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:34,686
before I go to school,          
    to help her.                

71
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,755
     The things that I find     
         in food trucks:        

72
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,957
     making her own noodles.    
        -It's more fresh.       

73
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,158
       Want me to sprinkle      
      a little down for ya?     

74
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,094
        Yes.                    
 You're doing good!             

75
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,496
You probably done this          
   a lot of times,              

76
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,764
       this kind of thing.      
    -I've never made noodles    

77
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,299
           in a truck           
     with a girl named Mony.    

78
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,701
      It feels like a giant     
          marshmallow.          

79
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,106
     That's gonna be a nice,    
     big, thick noodle, huh?    

80
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,574
              -Yes.             
   -So noodles are done. Okay.  

81
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,244
We are going to make the        
garlic oil for the soup.        

82
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:01,046
          As a garnish?         
              -Yes.             

83
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:03,781
So we're gonna heat up          
  some oil, garlic.             

84
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,850
     We're gonna                
   make it brown.               

85
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,452
             Got it.            

86
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:10,054
   This is ground               
 Thai chili pepper.             

87
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,323
   We're gonna put              
  paprika in there,             

88
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,991
   for the color.               
       Sugar.                   

89
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,127
And then, that's it.            
We turn the heat off.           

90
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,129
And then, we're gonna add       
 our garlic back in.            

91
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:19,530
  We're just gonna              
    let it cool.                

92
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,334
 Now, we're going to            
  peel our chicken,             

93
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,469
        just big chunks.        
             -Okay.             

94
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,938
So, now, we're going to         
  make our noodles.             

95
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,608
 This is just that simple broth 
 that we cooked the chicken in. 

96
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,009
Waiting for the water

      Don't watch it, then.     
  "A watched pot never boils."  

98
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,813
         -Okay, I'm not.        
     -You never heard that?     

99
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:35,814
         No.                    

100
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,483
        Don't look at it.       

101
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:39,751
      You're looking at it.     
     -I saw you. I saw you.     

102
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:40,952
     -I saw you look at it.     
              -No.

       -I saw<i> you</i> staring.      

104
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,423
          I'm checking.         
     You just looked at it.     

105
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:47,492
     It was nice knowing ya.    
            -[Laughs]           

106
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,894
   So here we go.               

107
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:52,497
    Okay. My mouth just went    
      into total flooding.      

108
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,032
Now, we're gonna add            
    the chicken.                

109
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,168
      Look like                 
 it's almost ready.             

110
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,235
 I'm not gonna look             
       at it.                   

111
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,436

113
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,707
      I love chicken noodle     
            soup, so.           

114
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,976
             -Yeah?             
 -Especially with fresh noodles.

115
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,112
Little bit of cilantro,         
      scallion,                 

116
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,315
  and then garlic.              

117
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,383
          There we go.          

118
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:15,988
      Chili oil                 
   and lime juice.              

119
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,789
 There you have it.             
   Mix it all up.               

120
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,124
All the flavor in there.        

121
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,592
     [laughing]                 
It's very, very hot.            

122
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,927
      Yeah, I can see that.     

123
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,295
      It's like a volcano.      

124
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,867
      Mmm. Superflavorful.      
     Definitely getting some    

125
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,468
         of that garlic,        
      little bit of spice.      

126
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,604
   Love the acid from the lime  
        getting in there.       

127
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:36,675
   The chicken's moist, gives   
  that little creaminess to it. 

128
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:38,410
            Mmm! Oh.            

129
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:44,883
 These noodles got some texture 
  and some bite and some girth. 

130
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,885
       This is crazy-good!

133
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,893
         It has a very authentic
             taste to the soup, 

134
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,095
          just like with my mom.

     -Broth is outstanding.     

137

           [Laughter]

  This is a papaya.

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,450
been boiled, sliced.            

225
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,919
     Didn't see that coming.    
      -This is the Lao nam.     

226
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,321
It's the cured pork,            
fermented cured pork.           

227
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,656
     I love fermented pork.     

228
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,058
    A little bit                
   of sugar here.               

229
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,994
And then lime juice,            
      cilantro,                 

230
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,729
  and a little bit              
      peanuts.                  

231
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,597
  Now the scallion.             
Put 'em all together.           

232
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,800
And we're ready to put 'em      
in the plate for you.           

233
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,604
Top it off with a little        
bit of ginger, mint.            

234
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,073
We're going to make it          
like a lettuce wrap.            

235
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,276
              Ahhh!             

236
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:32,476
It's a long process.            

237
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,279
              Mmm.              
    A lot going on in there.    

238
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,613
       I just got a little      
         hit of ginger.         

239
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,081
       I got a little bit       
        of the red chili.       

240
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,349
         I got a little         
        bit of the curry.       

241
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,884
      Now, I just got some      
       of the salty pork.       

242
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,620
       I got the sweetness      
        of the pork skin.       

243
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:45,957
        The whole while,        
   I'm getting a crunchy rice.

247
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:54,699
  You get the sweet, the sour,  
the little spice from the chili.

248

        You have anything       
        like that before?

 Little salt and pepper and sear

322
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,091
             So now, we're gonna
       plate it, a bowl of rice.

323

00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,490
     When did you come over     
           from Italy?          

445
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,893
                  In 1962.      
                  I was 21.     

446
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:04,028
     What year did you open     
 your first restaurant in Miami?

447
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,295
                    1968.       

448
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,231
         Robert followed        
     in his dad's footsteps     

449
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,300
 and opened this joint in 1992, 

450
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,635
       doing his own take       
     on the family classics.    

451
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,504
               Truffle lobster  
                mac & cheese.   

452
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:16,841
  Truffle lobster mac & cheese  
         is to die for.         

453
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:20,178
       The pasta is fresh.      
     It's made from scratch.    

454
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,179
           Well, we have a pasta
                extruder here   

455
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,447
           that my father bought

456
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,383
     and handed down to me.     
       -Beautiful machine.      

457
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,518
      We're gonna make a version
             of cavatelli here. 

458
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,053
          You have two different
             kinds of semolina. 

459
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,055
               One's grainier.  
             One's more powdery.

460
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,391
           Put 'em in the hopper
           of the pasta machine.

461
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,793
       Salt-pepper-garlic powder
                combination.    

462
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,061
  Then, we go in with the eggs. 

463
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:40,798
      We add water, until we get
            the desired texture.

464
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,066
          Look at this.         

465
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,335
       Can I just have one      
      of these in my house?     

466
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,271
               Ah!              
    Look at how gentle it is.   

467
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:48,806
    Throw me some soft music    
      behind this, please.

00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,609

            Gorgeous.           

471
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:57,881
      We're gonna take our whole
          fresh Florida lobster.

472
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,818
     We're gonna let it cook    
       for a few minutes.       

473
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,887
             And we're gonna add
            our celery, carrots,

474
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,822
           and onions.          
         -Little garlic.        

475
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:07,291
           Cracked black pepper.

476
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,693
                 Our brandy.    

477
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,361
     Brandy makes it dandy.     

478
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,895
             Gotta add my water.

479
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,498
        Now, how long is        
      this gonna sit here?      

480
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,698
              About 2.5 hours.  

481
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,899
            Awesome.            

482
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:16,967
           Strain it.           

483
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,369
                  Let's get     
             our frying pan hot.

484
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,837
                 Some of our    
               reduced stock.   

485
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,638
                Ready to add    
              our heavy cream.  

486
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,973
     Let that reduce a bit.     

487
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,909
        We're gonna add a little
          roux to thicken it up.

488
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,311
                Then, we have   
           a combination Asiago,

489
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:30,181
             Fontina, Parmesan, 
                 mozzarella,    

490
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,982
         little smoked Provolone
                  in there.     

491
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,785
       Living on the edge.      
      -Fold in our lobster.     

492
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,387
          There we go.          

493
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,189
                Our housemade   
                 cavatelli.     

494
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:41,192
          There's a ton         
       of cheese in there.      

495
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,660
           And housemade truffle
                breadcrumbs.    

496
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:44,795
 And then, we're gonna throw it 
       in the Salamander,       

497
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,397
   toast off the breadcrumbs.   
          -Pop 'em in.          

498
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,332
 And then, we're ready to serve.
       -We're ready to go.      

499
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,700
          Look at that!         

500
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,674
              Mmm.              
  That lobster is outta bounds. 

501
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,409
      Real truffles are one     
      of my favorite things     

502
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,411
      in the entire world.      
      It can add little bit     

503
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,079
   of essence, that little --   

504
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,549
    That little kiss parlays    
    so well with cream sauce,   

505
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,285
          with lobster.         

506
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,288
          Pasta's nice.         
   It's got great chew to it.   

507
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,955
 The breadcrumb is so necessary.

508
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:15,092
    Need a little bit of that   
     crunch coming through.     

509
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,493
          Nicely done.          

510
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,296
               Lobster truffle  
                mac & cheese.   

511
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:19,830
   It's succulent               
   and delicious.               

512
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,899
            Done exactly the way
                it should be.   

513
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:24,768
  All right, some good friends  
  of mine here, Jim and Maria.  

514
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,837
         This is exactly        
     what I'm talking about:    

515
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,574
      East Coasters coming      
       down to Key Largo.       

516
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:32,443
 In Key Largo here,             
there isn't Italian food        

517
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,778
and this is the place.          

518
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,712
   Sausage and peppers pasta.   

519
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,648
      Veal chop Florentine.     

520
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,783
           All right.           
     What're we making next?    

521
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,518
                Our veal chop   
             cutlet Florentine. 

522
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,053
         I'm gonna die.         

523
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,655
    The veal chop Florentine    
 is like eating a dinosaur bone.

524
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,724
  It's a huge piece             
  of veal, breaded,             

525
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,525
smothered with mozzarella       
 cheese, mushrooms,             

526
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,728
   prosciutto ham.              

527
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,996
     How're we making this?     

528
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,597
        We're gonna trim it down
                a little bit,   

529
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,000
           leave the bone on it.

530
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,202
                pound it out    
             into a veal cutlet.

531
00:18:58,204 --> 00:18:59,537
          dust it in some flour.

532
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:00,604
              'Kay.             

533
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:01,805
                  Drown it      
              in some egg wash. 

534
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,140
                  Make sure     
              you cover it all. 

535
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,742
         And then what's        
      this concoction here?     

536
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,143
              Panko breadcrumbs 
                 with a lot     

537
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,213
            of shredded Parmesan
               cheese in 'em.   

538
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:12,416
       Drench our sizzle platter
                in olive oil.   

539
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,018
             You want olive oil 
               on both sides.   

540
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,953
     And this is just gonna     
    roast right in the oven?    

541
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,421
           That's it.           
           -What temp?          

542
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,423
                  We do 425     
              about 20 minutes. 

543
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:22,860
         We're gonna top it with
         prosciutto, mozzarella.

544
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,164
                 All right.     
            We are going to make

545
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,798
              our Marsala wine  
                 reduction.     

546
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,567
              Little olive oil. 
            We're gonna throw in

547
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:33,104
                some butter.    
              Sliced mushrooms. 

548
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,639
         We're gonna add a pinch
             of chopped garlic, 

549
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,974
              salt and pepper,  
        flour for our thickener.

550
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:39,710
           And then, we're ready
           for our Marsala wine.

551
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,845
           Very nice.           
    And that's all she wrote.   

552
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,382
             Our wilted spinach.

553
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:47,517
            Our porcini risotto.

554
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,987
    Look at this chop, dude.    

555
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:52,856
    Were you the food stylist   
for the Fred Flintstone cartoon?

556
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,991
                 [ chuckle ]    

557
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,593
             Marsala wine sauce.

558
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:59,864
    That's about as oldschool   
  Italian American as it comes. 

559
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,767
   Just soaking up that sauce.  

560
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:09,073
         Tender, salty,         
       crunchy, garlicky.       

561
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:12,009
         I think you got        
      all the E's in there.     

562
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:16,880
  The mushrooms, the creminis,  
        and that Marsala,       

563
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,683
 just a touch of that sweetness.
            -Mm-hmm.            

564
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:22,152
   I mean, it's dynamite. It's  
 exactly what you want it to be.

565
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,554
      Veal chop Florentine.     

566
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,556
   It is fabulous.              

567
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,691
 The most incredible            
  thing about it is             

568
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:30,093
      the sauce                 
 is just delicious.             

569
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,896
     You got a lot of great     
    restaurants in the area,    

570
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,398
  but to know all the history,  
      sharing your recipes      

571
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,833
       and your experience      
         with your son,         

572
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:38,035
  you're doing it right, buddy. 
     You're doing it right.     

573
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:41,706
        -Thank you, sir.        
           -Nice job.           

574
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,641
   So that's it for this trip!  
        But don't worry!        

575
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:46,777
 There's plenty more "Triple D" 
  joints all over the country!  

576
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,512
     I'll be looking for you    
          next week, on         

577
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,714
  "Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives." 

578
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:51,848
     We're gonna do mofongo?    

579
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,317
 Gotta be ready for my mofongo. 

580
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,252
 Gotta get mofongo exercise on. 

581
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,253
               Stretch it out.  
                 Here we go.    

582
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,189
     I am the mofongonator.     

583
00:20:58,191 --> 00:20:59,824
  I don't know that you can say 
       that on television.
