    <i> PLACE NAMED TIOLI'S...</i>     
<i>CIAO BELLA.</i>                     

209
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,464
            YOU SAID IF WE KEEP 
            THE NAME "TIOLI'S," 

210
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,799
   BUT WE'RE JUST GONNA THROW   
 "CRAZEE BURGER" ON THE END, AH.

211
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,134
    WE STARTED WITH             
1,000 BURGERS A MONTH,          

212
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,271
AND NOW WE'RE DOING 7,000.      
         7,000 A MONTH.         

213
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,206
   I'VE GOT THE GATOR BURGER.   

214
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,476
 I GET TO EAT ALLIGATOR BURGER, 
         AND YOU DON'T.         

215
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:00,345
               WHAT PART OF     
          THE ALLIGATOR IS THIS?
THIS IS THE SIRLOIN.            

216
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:02,547
   FIRST WE CUT IT              
A LITTLE BIT SMALLER.           

217
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,749
                  ANYTHING ELSE 
                 GOING IN THERE?
<i>NEIN,</i> NOTHING.                  

218
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,484
                   NADA.        
           HMM, GROUND-UP GATOR.

219
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,620
         DO YOU EVER SERVE TATER
               WITH GATOR?      
NO.                             

220
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:11,222
                   JAMES SPADER 
                   LIKES GATOR. 

221
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:13,425
            OKAY, SO YOU GIVE IT
                A LITTLE PAT.   

222
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:15,694
   SO YOU COULD JUST KEEP MAKING
    THEM LIKE THAT, BUT THAT--  

223
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:18,096
               THAT'S A BIG ONE.
NOW THIS IS ALMOST 7 OUNCES.    
   YOU'RE GONNA EAT HIS.        

224
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,697
ABSOLUTELY.                     

225
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:22,033
      I MEAN, THAT'S, LIKE,     
THE SURFACE OF THE SUN, BROTHER.

226
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,703
                           WHOA!
 WE PUT THE BURGER ON.          
THIS SIDE IS NOT SO HOT.        

227
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,272
       YEAH, OH, YEAH, WHERE    
   IT'S WHITE, NOT SO HOT THERE.

228
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,373
NOW THE HOMEMADE SEASON--       
  THIS IS SALT, PEPPER,         

229
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:32,110
PAPRIKA AND GARLIC POWDER.      
              AND THAT'S IT--   
           JUST A LITTLE TICKLE.

230
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,445
 FOR THE GRAVY, WE NEED         
A LITTLE BIT WATER FIRST.       

231
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,447
             I DON'T KNOW THAT  
          I'VE SEEN MANY GRAVIES

232
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,650
              START OUT         
     WITH JUST WATER IN THE PAN.

233
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:41,719
                  DRIED BANANAS.
  <i> AND EVEN MORE DRIED FRUIT--</i>  
  <i> APPLES, APRICOTS AND PLUMS.</i>  

234
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:45,256
CREAM AND CURRY.                
        ALL RIGHT, THIS IS ODD--

235
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,659
        DRIED FRUIT, SOME CURRY 
      AND A LITTLE BIT OF CREAM.

236
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,861
               THAT'S YOUR IDEA?
YES, MY IDEA.                   

237
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,731
              RIGHT UP THERE    
           WITH THE CRAZY PART. 

238
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,266
      BURGER BUNS,              
JUST A LITTLE BIT CRISPY.       

239
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,268
                    IS IT READY?
YES, WE GOT IT.                 

240
00:08:57,304 --> 00:09:00,805
     AND THEN OUR RECONSTITUTED 
         CURRY FRUIT DRY...     

241
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:03,808

242
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,079
THAT'S GREAT.                   

243
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:11,682
    I GOT TO TELL YA, I NEVER   
 THOUGHT I WOULD REALLY LIKE IT.

244
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,019
    LOOK AT THAT.               
MMM. THAT'S AWESOME.            

245
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,419
GREAT FLAVOR TO IT.             

246
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,223
AND THE CURRY FRUIT THING--     
      YOU KNOW WHAT?            

247
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,957
THAT'S CRAZY!                   

248
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,959
         ACTUALLY TASTES        
       LIKE A PORK CUTLET.      

249
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,228
(man) SEEMS LIKE ALL THE FLAVORS
      MELD TOGETHER TO MAKE     

250
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,897
      ONE VERY FINE BURGER.     

251
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,233
 THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF BURGERS.
   IT'S PRETTY FAR OUT THERE.   

252
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,301
  THIS IS THE KANGAROO BURGER.  

253
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:32,437
(Lothar) WE HAVE THE MEAT       
     FROM AUSTRALIA.            

254
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,772
THIS ONE'S REALLY LEAN,         
        90-10.                  

255
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,641
               IT'S A MARSUPIAL.
YEP.                            

256
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,443
               BIG WORD FOR ME. 

257
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:42,113
  SO NOT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON IT
    SO IT DOESN'T BECOME TOUGH. 
OH, NO. NO. NO.                 

258
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,382
                SO THIS IS READY
                     TO GO?     
THIS IS FINISHED.               

259
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,385
 SAME THING--PUT IT ON          
THAT NUCLEAR-HOT GRILL?         
      LET'S PUT IT ON THE GRILL.
                  YES.          

260
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:50,655
 MAGIC SEASONINGS--SALT, PEPPER,
   THE PAPRIKA AND THE GARLIC.  

261
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,057
     THIS WE SERVE              
WITH HORSERADISH CREAM.         

262
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,260
                  MAYONNAISE,   
              I HAVE SOUR CREAM.
OKAY.                           

263
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,528
 A LITTLE BIT                   
OF HORSERADISH.                 

264
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,064
  ALL RIGHT, I LIKE             
THE WAY THIS IS GOING.          
                      SOME SALT,

265
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,365
                 WHITE PEPPER...
ALL RIGHT.                      

266
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,267
            NOT THE BLACK ONE-- 
           AND THE LEMON JUICE. 

267
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:03,335
THERE WE GO.                    

268
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,470
AND SO THE WHITE PEPPER,        
     SO IT DOESN'T--            

269
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,405
 THE BLACK PEPPER               
DOESN'T STAND OUT.              
                            YES.

270
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:10,074
                      MAKE MY...
(whistles) I'D LIKE TO SEE      
 THIS ON A BAKED POTATO.        

271
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,609
KEEP ON THIS HERE.              

272
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:13,878
 ONE OF THE THINGS I TALK ABOUT 
  WHEN YOU'RE COOKING BURGERS,  

273
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,613
                 USE A REALLY   
               HIGH TEMPERATURE.

274
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:18,082
 YOU WANT TO LET IT GO FARTHER, 
    PUT IT TO THE COOL AREA,    

275
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,885
         BUT SEAR BOTH SIDES,   
     REALLY PUT A NICE CRUST ON.
YOUR BURGER.                    

276
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,620
THAT'S IT, HUH?                 
                       HAVE FUN.

277
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,556
I DON'T KNOW THAT I--           
                         TRY IT.

278
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,023
TRY IT?                         
                         TRY IT.

279
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,159
YOU TRY IT, TOO.                
                           OKAY.

280
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,431
     RIGHT NOW ON TRIPLE "D"    
  SOMEONE'S ENJOYING THE BURGER 

281
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,167
A LITTLE BIT MORE               
 THAN THE HOST.                 

282
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:39,037
PRINCESS BITE,                  
  CRAZY BITE.                   

283
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,238
 GREAT FLAVOR,                  
NOT OVERCOOKED,                 

284
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,774
HORSERADISH CREAM SAUCE         
 IS DYNAMITE ON THERE.          

285
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,311
 I LIKE THAT.                   
AND SO DID YOU.                 

286
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,913
              YEAH. OF COURSE,  
             I LIKE WHAT I COOK.

287
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:51,182
                     OH, SORRY. 

288
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,184
THIS IS GETTING                 
OUT OF CONTROL.                 

289
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,986
 IT'S VERY LEAN. IT'S VERY GOOD.

290
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,388
  IT'S VERY UNIQUE. IF I DIDN'T 
KNOW IT WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT,

291
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,524
  I WOULD THINK IT'S HAMBURGER. 

292
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,592
   THEY HAVE THE BEST BURGERS   
            IN TOWN.            

293
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,995
        THE BURGER--IT'S        
     AN ALL-AMERICAN THING.     
                   LOOK AT THIS.

294
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,330
       <i> AND, REMEMBER...</i>        
THERE WE GO.                    

295
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,365
     <i> SERVED UP BY A COUPLE</i>     
    <i> OF DUDES FROM GERMANY..</i>    

296
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,201
        I NEED THE BRIE.        
 <i> IN AN OLD ITALIAN RESTAURANT.</i> 

297
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,137
     IT'S A CRAZY VARIETY.      
          <i> YOU THINK?</i>           

298
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,005

         <i> CREAM SAUCE...</i>        

299
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,941
  IT'S GOT A GOOD BALANCE TO IT,
     A LITTLE TANGINESS TO IT,  

300
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,944
           JUST MELLOWS IT OUT. 
  <i> AND CHECK OUT THE VENISON.</i>   

301
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,413
 IT'S MILDLY GAMEY, BUT I THINK 
 IT'S OFFSET BY THE SWEET CREAM 

302
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,816
   AND THE WINE-INFUSED PEARS   
         THEY PUT IN IT.        

303
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,150
     IT'S REALLY QUITE GOOD.    

304
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,685

                      SANTORINI?

305
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,421
     HALF LAMB, HALF BEEF.      
IT'S EXOTIC.                    

306
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:32,423

      1/2 POUND BEEF.           

307
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:35,493
         OH, HOW BIG OF A BURGER
                 IS THIS?

I'M THE OVER-FLIPPER.           
        YOU'RE THE OVER-FLIPPER.

323
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,530
YES.

THE TZATZIKI AND THE LAMB       
     AND THE BEEF--             

327
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:22,273
MAN, THAT'S IT.                 

328
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:23,874
  AND THE SAUCE--IT'S AMAZING.  

329
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,145
  THE LAMB AND SAUCE ALTOGETHER 
  MAKES A REALLY GREAT BURGER.  

330
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:29,080
        THIS IS NOT LIKE        
   YOUR REGULAR BURGER JOINT.   

331
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,149

THE CEMITA IS ALWAYS STANDARD.  

355
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,972
     THE ONLY THING

                IT'S DIFFERENT. 

359
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,647

  WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THIS PLACE,

             IS THE POPULAR ONE.

370

372
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,476
   LITTLE BIT OF CHOPPED ONIONS,
       LITTLE BIT OF CLOVES,    

373
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,678
       NOT A LOT, JUST A LITTLE,
            BLACK PEPPER--      

374
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,880

   OF BLACK PEPPER IN MY HOUSE, 

375
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,150
      SO I PUT A LOT OF THAT IN 
     THERE--SOME GROUND OREGANO,

376
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,884
    LITTLE BIT OF WHITE PEPPER, 

377
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,087
                THREE WHOLE

SO A LITTLE AJO.                

378
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:18,156

       OR ELSE I GET IN TROUBLE.

380
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,094
     THEN I GRAB A LITTLE BIT   
 OF BREADCRUMBS, ABOUT YEA MUCH.
      YEA MUCH.                 
SHOULD WRITE THIS DOWN.         

381
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,663
           THEN WE GET OUR MILK.
     ABOUT HALFWAY,             
IT'S NOT REALLY HALFWAY.        

382
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,232
             DEPENDS ON WHERE   
           YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT.
RIGHT, IT'S ALL PERSPECTIVE.    

383
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,568
IT'S ALL PERSPECTIVE.           
           A LITTLE BIT OF SALT.

00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,838
          THEY DIDN'T TEACH ME  
         CULINARY COOKING STUFF.

386
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,307
YEAH, WHAT DO THOSE             
DATES MEAN, ANYWAY?             
                  YEAH, EXACTLY.

387
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,910
THIS LOOKS LIKE IT COMES        
  FROM THE PORK LOIN.           
                  YEAH, EXACTLY.

388
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,844
             GONNA LET IT SOAK. 

389
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,647
  YOU BREAD 'EM                 
AND THEN FRY 'EM?               
    I WOULD PREFER TO LET IT SIT
          FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.    

390
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:46,517
  IF I FRY 'EM RIGHT AWAY, A LOT
    OF THE BREAD WILL COME OUT. 

391
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,186
                         SORRY. 

392
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,988
NOW IT GOES TO THE FLATTOP?     
           JUST FOR A SECOND    
     WHILE I GET MY BREAD READY.

393
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:52,190
THAT'S A FAMILY RECIPE.         

394
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,392
I HAVE A GENTLEMAN

395
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:56,127
    MAKES THAT                  
EXCLUSIVELY FOR ME.             

396
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,596
SO I GRAB A LOT OF AVOCADO.     
               THAT BECOMES     
           A NATURAL MAYONNAISE.

397
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,464
            YEAH.               
SOME CHIPOTLE GOES ON THERE.    

398
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,467
THE ADOBO--THEY BECOME LIKE     
 THIS MOLASSES-TYPE SYRUP.      
        IT JUST MASHES RIGHT IN.

399
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,003
OUR PORK LOIN.                  

400
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:07,805
      THIS CHEESE--             
IT'S CALLED QUESO OAXACA.       
           THAT'S QUESO A-LOTTA.

401
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:11,075
            I DON'T KNOW WHY    
       YOU CALL IT QUESO OAXACA.
PAPALO--MY MOM GROWS THIS       
  FOR ME IN THE SUMMER.         

402
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,410
IT'S VERY PUNGENT,              

403
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,079
BUT IT GIVES THE CEMITA         
A WHOLE WORLD OF TASTE.         
                            WOW.

404
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,348
             THAT MAKES ARUGULA 
             TASTE LIKE ICEBERG.

405
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,882
                     (whistles) 

406
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,018
PUT SOME OLIVE                  
 ON THE TOP.                    
       AND THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE.

407
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:22,286

422

           THIS IS WHAT'S CALLED
            A MORITA CHIPOTLE.  

429
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,265
              I THINK MORITA    
           USUALLY MEANS SMALL. 

430
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,200

 CALLED. THAT'S WHAT I CALL IT. 

452
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,781
   I SLICE UP SOME PINEAPPLES   
AND ADD SOME VINEGAR, SOME WATER

453
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,583
             AND SOME OF THE RAW

454
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,518
BUT YOU ONLY PUT                
 THE LIQUID IN.                 

455
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,920
I CAN KEEP THAT, 'CAUSE THAT CAN
  LAST ME FOR A COUPLE MONTHS.  

456
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:05,189

460
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,397
AND THEN FINALLY WE JUST TOP OFF
     THE POT WITH JUST WATER    

461
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,733
           AND LET IT BOIL FOR  
        ABOUT SEVEN EIGHT HOURS.
ARE WE GONNA STRAIN IT?         

462

00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:00,904
           THE MORE THE BETTER. 

513
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,974
           A LITTLE BIT OF SALT,
              WHITE VINEGAR.    

514
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:06,643
IN CASE YOU JUST TUNED IN,      
  THAT'S NOT A MARGARITA.       

515
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,779
              WE'RE GONNA GRAB  
             OUR PORK SHOULDER. 

516
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,315
         WE'LL LET THIS MARINATE
            FOR A LITTLE BIT.   
TWO, THREE HOURS.               

517
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,117
IS THIS GOING ON A ROTISSERIE?  

518
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,386
     IS THAT WHERE              
THE ARABE PART COMES IN?        
                           YEAH.

519
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,588
ONCE WE GET 'EM ALL MARINATED,  

520
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:20,057
    THEY WE COME OVER,          
AND WE STACK 'EM UP LIKE--      
    WE'RE GONNA MAKE A BEAUTIFUL
      BALL OF MEAT, MY FRIEND.  

521
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,926
PARTYIN' IN CHICAGO             
WITH A BALL OF MEAT.            

522
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,061
   THE ONIONS, PORK SHOULDER,   
 ONIONS, PORK SHOULDER, ONIONS. 

523
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,464
 WHY CAN'T IT BE PORK SHOULDER, 
  ONION, PORK SHOULDER, ONION,  

524
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:28,533
PORK SHOULDER?                  
     BECAUSE I DON'T WANT IT TO.

525
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,201
IT'S ALWAYS YOUR WAY.           

526
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,535
I LOVE SHAWARMA...              
                        SIMILAR.

527
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:32,870
IN REAL GYRO.                   

528
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,404
OH, HAPPY.                      

529
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,673
            TUCK THAT IN THERE. 

530
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,076
 I AM JUST OUT OF               
MY MIND RIGHT NOW.              

531
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,345
THINK I COULD FIT THAT          
      IN THE CAR?               

532
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,215
  THEY JUST SLICE IT UP AND DOWN
           TO START WITH        

533
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:46,617
    AND JUST LET THE JUICES FLOW
         ALL OVER THE PLACE.    

534
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,553
 YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE. THOSE 
ARE TEARS FROM THE FLAVOR ANGEL.

535
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,555
         PUT THAT ON THE FLATTOP
            FOR A LITTLE BIT.   

536
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,691
    GET CHARRED ON THE OUTSIDE. 

537
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,559
            YOU DON'T USE       
    A REGULAR EVERYDAY TORTILLA.

538
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,428
               WHAT YOU USE     
           IS A REAL THIN PITA. 

539
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,363
                 WHAT WAS THAT  
               RIGHT OVER THERE?
THAT'S JUST MEAT THAT FELL.     

540
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,832
THE ONLY THING A TACO ARABE     
TAKES IS THE CHIPOTLE SAUCE     

541
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,901
   THAT WE PURéE                
FROM THE CHIPOTLES.             

542
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,772
                         MMM.   

543
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:10,040
         OH, YOU'RE NOT READING 
              MY MIND? OH.      

544
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:13,044
      MEAT'S SUPER TENDER.      
IT'S GOT GREAT FLAVOR BY ITSELF.

545
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,312
         HERE'S THE FUNNY THING 

546
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:17,715
   IS THAT CHIPOTLE HAS A LITTLE
      BIT OF SWEETNESS TO IT,   

547
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,784
         A LITTLE BIT OF SPICE, 

548
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,785
              BUT IT COMPLEMENTS
                 IT PERFECTLY.  

549
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:24,855
                THIS IS BANANAS.
                BANANAS IS GOOD.
<i>PLáTANOS.</i>                       

550
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,857
                THIS, BAR NONE, 
                WITH THE SAUCE, 

551
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,859
           WITH THIS RIGHT HERE,
             THE SECRET SAUCE,  

552
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,394
       MAKES IT ALL WORTHWHILE. 

553
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,396
              THIS ENTIRE PLACE 
             IS VERY AUTHENTIC. 

554
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,798
                      AL PASTOR.
     THE FOOD IS GREAT.         
CAN'T GET THIS ANYWHERE ELSE.   

555
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,267
   EVERY TIME I COME TO CHICAGO,
    I MAKE A POINT TO COME HERE.
A GO-TO SPOT.                   

556
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,869
             ENJOY, MY FRIENDS. 

557
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,872
   YOUR GRANDMA AND YOUR PARENTS
    HAVE TAUGHT YOU RIGHT, MAN. 
THANK YOU.                      

558
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,341
  SO WAS THAT A MONEY ROAD TRIP 
            OR WHAT?            

559
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:47,878
    I'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME ON   
 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

560
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,680
     YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL LIKE? 

561
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,882
             MAYBE YOU COULD PUT
             A LITTLE HAT ON ME 

562
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,951
             AND THROW A PEANUT 
              ONCE IN A WHILE.  

563
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,686
     (chattering like a monkey) 

564
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:57,822
               YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
(mumbles)
