So, today, we're making         
the Wilma & Frieda              
breakfast tart.                 

130
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,792
                    Okay.       
             Let's get into it. 

131
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,994
   We're going to start         
with the blueberry compote.     

132
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,529
I got fresh blueberries,        

133
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:27,132
  some lemon juice,             
and granulated sugar.           

134
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,533
             We're going to let 
               that cook down.  

135
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:31,136
  In the meantime,              
we're going to make a slurry.   
                        Okay.   

136
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,604
So this is cornstarch           
     and water.                 

137
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:33,872
                There we go.    

138
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,074
It's going to get thick, and    
then it's going to cool down,   

139
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,943
  and we're going to use        
that in our breakfast tart.     

140
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:38,944
             We're going to make
               the dough now?   

141
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,078
        Yes.                    
                   Awesome.     

142

  kosher salt, nutmeg,          

146
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:51,356
 some vanilla extract,

147
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,691

00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,493
         Yes.                   
And we have ice water.          

149
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:55,893
So, this is all going           
  to pull together,             

150
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,562
   and we're going              
   to roll it out.              

151
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:58,963
           Don't get any of that
             on my blue shirt.

        All right.              
Down to about a centimeter.     

154
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:06,304
And then we're going to use     
     a pastry cutter.           

155
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,772
               Time to party.   

156
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,307
And we go the other way.        

157
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,177
       And this is where        
the blueberry compote comes in. 

158
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,514
And we take one more piece      
    and some egg wash,          

159
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,049

163
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:23,521
               That's going to

       Yes.

  "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives,"  

219

220

    that we would come across   

223
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,975
    a gluten-free restaurant

    This is Maui Brick Oven.    

225

       left on the first pizzas.

226
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,649
      You'll never believe      
     that it's gluten-free.     

227
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,718
        I got the breaded       
mozzarella sticks coming at you.

 gluten-intolerant?

231
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,457
     FIERI: Which is exactly    
      what dad-and-son duo      

232
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:41,927
    Terry and Chad Covington    
        was hoping for --       

233
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:45,597
    a joint losing the gluten   
     but keeping the flavor.    

234
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:46,931
       About 6 years ago,       
           I found out          

235
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,600
      I had this condition      
     called celiac disease.     

236
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,468
      My son, who is a chef     
       on the big island,       

237
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:51,603
            was also            
       sick with it, too,       

238
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,672
      so we decided to open     
       up this restaurant       

239
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,474
    because he can still cook   
   and I had something to do.   

240
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,809
          FIERI: I had a chef on
           "Guy's Grocery Games"

241
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:01,145
         that made a gluten-free
         pizza dough, and it was

242
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:03,615
       some of the best pizza   
     we'd ever seen on the show.

243
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,950
 I bet you our pizza crust will 
  be as good as that or better. 

244
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,285
                    Okay.       
              I'm down with it. 

245
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,887
     The crust has a really     
          nice crunch.          

246
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,555
    I can't really tell that    
        it's gluten-free,       

247
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,357
    'cause it tastes really,    
          really good.          

248
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:13,491
                  How do we     
              start to make it? 

249
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,427
  CHAD: We got our              
  pizza-flour mix.              

250
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:16,862
             It's a gluten-free 
             flour that you buy?

251
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,163
        Yes.                    
                    Okay.       

252
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,031
And so what do you got in there?
You got rice, potato.           

253
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,300
       Tapioca                  
and then brown rice.            

254
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,169
   So, this is just             
our Italian seasoning.          

255
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,304
        Salt.                   
                     Okay.      

256
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,106
                Olive oil, eggs,

257
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,241
      our gluten-free beer      
      to get some carbonation...

258
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,108
                   Okay.        

259
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,510
...and activated yeast.         

260
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,112
 Then we let that go            
 for about a minute,            

261
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,113
  put it in a bowl,             

262
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,781
  and let it proof              
 for about an hour.             

263
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:37,983
   And we're going              
   to parbake it.               

264
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,918
      This looks like the hubcap
             from "Cobra."      

265
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,653
               Remember when    
           Sylvester Stallone...

266
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,054
           Sly, are these yours?

267
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,189
  What we're going to do is     
spread it out with a spatula.   

268
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,859
        Look at this little     
  feathering technique you have.

269
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,661
   You got to give it           
a little bit of an edge.        

270
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:50,929
                 I like it!     
 There we go.                   

271
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,330
 And then we're going to pop it 
 right in the oven.             

272
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,598
            And what temperature
            are we running that?

273
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,534
        550,                    
   3 or 4 minutes.              

274
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,536
           A little bit of crust
                to it. Wow.     

275
00:08:58,605 --> 00:08:59,871
 Now we're going to             
  make our sausage              

276
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,806
       for our                  
Paradise Pesto Pizza.           

277
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,075
          WOMAN: I love         
    the Paradise Pesto Pizza.   

278
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,678
    The sausage is absolutely   
           delicious.           

279
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,547
So, what we're going            
to do now is just make          
the seasoning blend.            
                       Got it.  

280
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,416
  Got our paprika,              
   ground pepper,               

281
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,552
Himalayan pink sea salt,        
 and Italian seasoning,         

282
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,287
   garlic powder,               

283
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,957
    chili powder,               
  ground-up fennel.             

284
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,491
                A lot of it.    

285
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:21,759
             Nice little dry rub
                put together.   

286
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:22,961
    Now our pork.               

287
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,162
            Start hitting this  
          with a little dry rub?

288
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,630
   Yep, perfect.                
                     All right. 

289
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:28,033
  So this goes in the cooler    
  24 hours, and we bring it out,

290
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,301
                   you grind it,
