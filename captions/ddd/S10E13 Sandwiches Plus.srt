        IT'S INCREDIBLE.        

116
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,937

IS HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH.         

122
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,351
  W.O.G.s MEANS                 
WITHOUT GIBLETS.                
             JUST GONNA DO OIL, 
              SALT, AND PEPPER.

     IN THE BOWL?               
       YEAH, JUST GET IN THERE. 

128
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,899
                THIS IS THE WAY 
               WE LIKE TO DO IT,

129
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,969
             'CAUSE YOU GET     
      THIS NICE DARK MEAT HERE. 
LOOK AT ALL THAT FLAVOR.        

130
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,905
   WE ALWAYS HAVE LOTS OF BONES 
    AROUND TO MAKE FRESH STOCK. 
YOU MAKE ALL YOUR OWN STOCK?    

131
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,975
                         WE DO. 
  MMM. JUST A LITTLE SALT       
AND PEPPER AND A GOOD ROAST.    

132
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,911

  WHAT ARE WE OFF TO, BRAD?

MILL THE FLOUR, TOO?            
       WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT.

OKAY, SO GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN.   
I'M JUST GONNA GET THESE READY,

               PUT THAT ON TOP. 
TO LOCK IT IN.                  

138
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,659
              WE JUST SMOKE 'EM 
            RIGHT ON THE STOVE. 
IT'S GONNA GET SMOKY.           

139
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,862
45 MINUTES YOU LET IT ROLL.     
DUDE, YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT THAT.

140
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:33,765
LOOK AT THE GREAT SMOKE         
       ON THAT.                 

141
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,134
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, MAN.         
   THOSE ARE SMOKED.            
     THEY'RE DEFINITELY SMOKED. 

142
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,471
      THEY KIND OF PURéE BETTER 
     WHEN THEY'RE A LITTLE WARM.

143
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,806
              SO WE HAVE        
       OUR PURéED SMOKED ONIONS.

144

               MAYONNAISE.      

145

   NOTHING LIKE                 
A LITTLE FOOD LUBE.             
                 YEAH. (laughs)

WHAT WAS THAT CALLED?           
           WOR-CESTER-SHIRE.

  HAVE YOU EVER READ THE LABEL? 
WOR-CESTER-SHIRE.               

149
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:55,019

OKAY, SO WE JUST ADDED IN       
  THE WOR-CESTER-SHIRE.

00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,824
     PEPPER AND A LITTLE LIQUID 
     SMOKE, SUGAR, KOSHER SALT. 

152
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:02,294
   THIS IS JUST                 
FOR THE QUESADILLA?             
                    YEP. IT IS. 

153
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:04,295
DUDE.                           
                       (laughs) 
                    STIR IT UP. 

154
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:06,297
          THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE. 
WE'LL LET THIS MARRY.           

155
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,299
                  THAT'S RIGHT. 
THE SMOKED ONION SAUCE          
       IS MADE.                 

156
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:09,768

JUST STIR THAT UP.              

160
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:19,244

               AND SIMMER?      
YEP, FOR HALF AN HOUR.

     WOR-CESTER-SHIRE           
IS ACTUALLY WOOS-TER-SHEER.

     YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO GET 
  ALL HIGH-TECH ON ME. COME ON. 
(laughs)                        

164
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,987
                  I WAS TOLD    
            THERE'D BE NO MATH. 
 (laughs)                       

165
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,856
I LOVE THIS GUY.                
                       OH, MAN. 

166
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,858
           I THINK I MIGHT HAVE 
              PULLED SOMETHING. 

167
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,328
   OKAY, SO WHAT                
ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?            
           LADLE SOME OF THAT   
       BARBECUE SAUCE ON THERE, 

168
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,397
   SOME OF THAT PULLED CHICKEN, 
         SOME MOZZARELLA,       

169
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,064
     LITTLE SLICE OF RED ONION, 
               CILANTRO.        

170
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:42,200
         POP IT ON THE FLATTOP. 
ALL RIGHT.                      

171
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,269
WE'RE LOOKING GOOD.             
READY TO CUT IT UP.             
                           OKAY.

172
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,671
    SO YOU GOT A LITTLE BIT OF  
    THE SWEET AND SPICY GOING ON

173
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,206
WITH THE BARBECUE SAUCE         

174
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:52,543
 AND THEN THAT GETS DIPPED      
INTO THIS SMOKED ONION DIP.     
                            YEP.

175
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,879
              WHOA! REALLY GOOD.

176
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,349
 THE DIP, THE SMOKE IS NOT THAT 
        FILLS YOUR NOSE,        

177
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,417
      PALATE'S SHOT,            
CAN'T TASTE ANYTHING ELSE.      

178
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,553
   STANDARD QUESADILLA,         
TOASTED, DONE THE RIGHT WAY     

179
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,154
WITH A GOOD AMOUNT OF CHEESE.   

180
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,557
  FOR A DIP THAT COMPLEMENTS    
A QUESADILLA, IT'S NOT A SALSA. 

181
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,559
SO THIS TAKES THE WHOLE         
   QUESADILLA THING             

182
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,628
 OUT OF THE LATIN FLAIR,        
A WHOLE NOTHER DIRECTION.       

183
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,629
DUDE, THAT ROCKED.              

184
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,966
BARBECUE CHICKEN                
  QUESADILLA.                   
        IT'S DELICIOUS,         
         AND I LOVE IT.         

185
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,836
    IT'S GREAT WITH THE CHICKEN 
       AND THE BARBECUE SAUCE.  
IT'S ITS OWN ECLECTIC MIX.      

186
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,573
        THE SMOKED ONION SAUCE, 
                 COME ON.       
        I KNOW. I PUT IT        
      ON EVERYTHING HERE.       

187
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,975
             YOU COULD PUT THAT 
                 ON ICE CREAM.  
      I PUT IT IN MY BEER.      

188
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,311
I LOVE MIXING EVERYTHING IN.    
  I LOVE HANGING OUT HERE.      
       TABLE 26, PLEASE.        

189
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,045
      IT'S A STAPLE OF SPOKANE. 

190
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,181
IT'S A PLACE YOU WANT           
  TO COME BACK TO.              

191
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,650
 IT'S A PLACE YOU WANT          
      TO HANG OUT.              
              BROTHER, I GOT    
       TO TELL YOU SOMETHING... 

192
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,852
IT WAS A PLEASURE.              
                  FUN PLACE,    
              PERFECT ATTITUDE, 

193

              IN A SANDWICH.    

201
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,976
    YOU KNOW THE FUNNY THING    
        ABOUT TRIPLE "D"        

202
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:01,179
      IS THE LOCATION NAMES     
DON'T ALWAYS SEEM TO MAKE SENSE.

203
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:04,382
    LIKE IN OMAHA, NEBRASKA,    
   WE WERE AT CALIFORNIA TACO.  

204
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:06,584
      WELL, THEN WE WERE IN     
    ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO,    

205
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,119
     AT THE STANDARD DINER,     

206
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,121
       AND IT WAS ANYTHING      
          BUT STANDARD.         

207
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,324
 THEN WE HAD FERNDALE, MICHIGAN,
        AT THE FLY TRAP.        

208
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,392
      I DIDN'T SEE ONE FLY      
       IN THE WHOLE PLACE.      

209
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,794
SO HERE WE ARE ON THE SOUTH SIDE
         OF MINNEAPOLIS

       SOUP OR SALAD WITH THAT?

SHORT STACK.                    

219
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,282
    WE ABSOLUTELY ALWAYS DIE

                         B.L.T.

298
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:55,547
  I'VE GOT SOME CARROTS, ONIONS,
  CELERY, FRESH ROMA TOMATOES,  

299
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,348

00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,960
 I'M GONNA DO THE BEEF,         
THE SAUSAGE THAT I MADE.        

305
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,695
     YOU MAKE YOUR OWN SAUSAGE? 
YEAH.                           

306
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:13,431
         OH, OF COURSE, YOU DO. 
ABOUT 1/3 SAUSAGE,              
    2/3 BEEF.                   

307
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,033
               AND THEN TAKE IT 
              AND LET IT BROWN. 
I'M GONNA ROLL IT UP.           

308
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,103
                        REALLY? 
    I DON'T WANT IT             
TO REALLY "BROWN" BROWN.        

309
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,904
I'LL BAKE IT WITH WATER.        

310
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,306
   SO IT KEEPS THE MOISTURE IN  
 THE AIR WHILE THIS IS ROASTING 

311
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,175
SO IT DOESN'T DRY IT UP.        
                         RIGHT. 

312
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,311
                BAKE IT FOR     
           A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR

313
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,579
      AND THEN I LET IT SET     
 IN THE REFRIGERATOR OVERNIGHT, 

314
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,115
SO IT CUTS NICELY.              

315
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,583
WHAT'S NEXT?                    
   WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE COMPOTE 
     FOR THE MEATLOAF SANDWICH. 

316
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,652

OKAY.                           

322
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,265
PULL IT OUT OF THE REFRIGERATOR 
        AND UNWRAP IT.          
                   IT'S COOLED. 

323
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,532
MM-HMM.                         
                   SLICE IT UP.

         LOOK HOW DENSE THAT IS.

325
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:52,470
I LIKE TO USE A LITTLE BIT

326
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,739

               AND THEN COMPOTE.

334

            THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

335
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,561

339
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,372

       ALSO IN THE MEAT ITSELF? 
IN THE SAUSAGE.
