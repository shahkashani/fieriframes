231
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,552

                          RIGHT.

                THIS IN THERE,  

247
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,322
     EGG'S WORKING AS A BINDER, 
    FLOUR'S WORKING AS A BINDER.

248
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:00,058
       NOW WE PUT THE MEAT DOWN.
I COVER.                        

249
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,327
         AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.    
     SO THE POTATO, AS IT COOKS,

250
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,996
        IS GONNA SOAK UP THE FAT
           OF THE GROUND BEEF.  

251
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,532
   YOU HAVE THE BEEF FLAVOR, BUT
    YOU CUT IT WITH THE CHICKEN.

252
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,534
        OKAY, SO WHEN THEY START
         TO BROWN A LITTLE BIT,

I SHOULD COVER IT.              

256
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,276
           SO WE'VE GOT THE NICE
             CRISP GOING THERE, 

257
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,211
         BUT NOW WE REALLY NEED 
        TO INTENSIFY THE HEAT...
YES.                            

258
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,346
       TO MAKE SURE WE COOK THAT
       MEAT ALL THE WAY THROUGH.
YES, YES.                       

259
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,347
                  TEN MINUTES   
               IT STAYS COVERED.

260
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,683
   OKAY, IT'S READY.            
WE PUT IT ON THE PLATE.         

261
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,585
                   HERE YOU ARE.

262
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,291

264
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,797

      OF, LIKE, A LATKE.        

265
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:44,168
   THEN YOU GET                 
THE SAUSAGE INSIDE.             

266
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,904
IT'S NOT OVER SEASONED          
    BY ANY MEANS.               

267
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,906
CRISPY, CREAMY, SALTY,          

268
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,641
WITH SOME MEAT.                 

269
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,844
RUSSIAN COMFORT FOOD.           
  THAT'S DYNAMITE.              

270

I LIKE A LOT OF THIS FOOD.      

274
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,458
I LIKE THE FOOD THAT--          
    IT TAKES TIME.              

275
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,462
IT'S NOT QUICK, INSTANTANEOUS.  
  IT'S LOW AND SLOW COOKING.    

276
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:13,331
            YOU NEED

00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,514
          WE'RE CUTTING THE BEEF
          FOR THE SHANGHAI TACO.

415
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,584
 (whistles) DUDE,               
THAT IS HUMUNGOUS.              

416
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,587
THIS IS A BEEF CHUCK ROLL. WE'RE
   GONNA TAKE THE LEATHER OFF.  

417
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,656
THE LEATHER.                    
                  TRIM, LIKE,   
              THE BULKY FAT OUT,

418
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:16,460
  BUT WE'RE GONNA LEAVE A LITTLE
     BIT OF THE FAT. WE WANT--  
  'CAUSE WE WANT                
SOME OF THE FLAVOR.             

419
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:19,130
          NOW WE'RE GONNA CUT IT
            INTO CHUNKS OF, UH, 

420
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,799
             NOT MORE THAN, SAY,
                4 OR 5 INCHES.  

421
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,334
 JUST SO IT CAN                 
ROAST DOWN NICE.                

422
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:26,070
WHAT ARE WE GONNA               
SEASON THIS WITH?               
                    GRILL SHAKE.

423
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,072
HIT 'EM WITH THE SHAKE.         
                  SO WE'RE GONNA
                   ATTEMPT THIS,

424
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:31,208
   BUT WE'RE GONNA ADD SOME, UH,
    VINEGAR--SOME WHITE VINEGAR.

425
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,478
             KEEP IT MOIST AND--
TO JUST BLOOM IN THE AIR.       
  I LIKE THE FIST CUP.          

426
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,614
               JUST A LITTLE BIT
                   IS ENOUGH.   

427
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,150
                  THE LOOSE TENT
                 IS GOOD ENOUGH.

428
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:41,084
            JUST WANT TO RETAIN 
           SOME OF THE MOISTURE.

429
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,086
   AND WE'RE READY FOR THE OVEN.
350?                            

430
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,823
                   350, 3 HOURS.

431
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,825
ALL RIGHT, SO NOW WE'VE         
 GOT THE ROASTED MEAT.          

432
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:51,428
             CUT IT DOWN INTO   
          THE SLICES AND CHUNKS.
RIGHT.                          

433
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,096
SEAR IT OFF.                    
                     SEAR IT UP.

434
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,432
  PUT SOME MORE TEXTURE TO      
THE OUTSIDE OF IT, ALL RIGHT.   

435
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:58,702
        THE PARTS THAT SHRED    
   ARE GONNA CONTAIN THE SAUCES.

436
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,973
            HERE'S THE BEEF.    
       CRUSHED BLACK BEAN SAUCE.

437
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,442
                   WASABI SAUCE.

438
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:07,511
                VEGETABLE STOCK.
WHY IS YOUR VEGETABLE           
     STOCK PINK?                

439
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,513
             IT'S OUR HOUSE, UH,
               VEGETABLE STOCK. 

440
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,515
         WE ADD SOME RED CABBAGE
                  TO IT.        

441
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:14,452
OH, 'CAUSE IT LOOKED LIKE       
 DISH SOAP FOR A SECOND.        

442
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:17,988
THAT'LL CLEAN YOU OUT.          

443
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,790
                 STIR THAT,     
            PUT SOME HEAT IN IT.

444
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:23,126
       THIS IS GONNA COOK DOWN  
     FOR, UM, ABOUT THREE HOURS,

445
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:26,264
                        LID OFF.
TO EVAPORATE, OKAY.             

446
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:29,233
   AT THAT TIME, WE'LL BE ADDING
      SHREDDED SALTED RADISH.   

447
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:31,202
AND TOFU?                       
                           TOFU.

448
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:34,272
LET IT ALL COOK DOWN, EVAPORATE 
  OFF A BUNCH OF THE LIQUID,    

449
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:37,208
TIGHTENS UP.                    
                     WE STORE IT
                     OVERNIGHT, 

450
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,144
                 SO IT MARINADES
                 WITH THE SAUCE.

451
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:42,980
     THEN SCOOP IT OUT          
AND HIT IT ON THE FLAT TOP.     
                            YES.

452
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:47,218
TOFU AND THE TRIPLE             
   THREAT MEAT.                 

453
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,286
MAN, YOU LOAD IT                
 FULL OF MEAT.                  

454
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,956
           THIS IS A HOUSE SLAW.
 GETTIN' SAVAGE                 
WITH THE CABBAGE.               

455
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:55,025
    AND THIS IS A TSUNAMI SAUCE.
      IT'S A WASABI SOUR CREAM. 

456
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,427
WHERE'S THE BROWN               
   COME FROM?                   
                     THE WASABI.

457
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,131
MUST BE TOASTED                 
FOR DEEP FLAVOR.                

458
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,102
IT IS RICH.                     

459
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:07,771
I THINK ONE OF THE FLAVORS THAT 
IS PROBABLY THE UNDERLYING THEME

460
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:11,041
IS THAT BLACK BEAN PASTE,       
     AND I LOVE IT.             

461
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,043
WHEN YOU EAT THIS,              
 YOU DON'T EAT IT               

462
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,045
JUST, LIKE, TO GET IT DOWN      
   AND GET THROUGH IT--         

463
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,047
YOU EAT IT, AND YOU TAKE        
  A BITE AND SAVOR IT           

464
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,049
AND YOU THINK ABOUT IT          
      AND YOU--                 

465
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,652
THIS IS WAY MORE                
  THAN A TACO.                  

466
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,987
MMM.                            

467
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,722
    WHERE WERE YOU              
WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL?          

468
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,059
   I MEAN, THIS--               
I WOULDN'T HAVE LEFT.           

469
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,594
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING            
   GOING ON HERE.               

470
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,596
  YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT       
OF A DEEPER ISSUE GOING ON,     

471
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:34,598
YOU KNOW, AND I DON'T KNOW THAT 
COUNSELING'S REALLY GONNA WORK. 

472
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,068
    THIS IS YAYO TACO,          
AND THAT'S HOW THEY DO IT.      

473
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,404
SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS ROAD TRIP,
        BUT DON'T WORRY,        

474
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,473
