  AND THEN TURNED INTO A DINER  
          BACK IN 2006.         

212
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,527
      NOW FROM WHAT I HEAR,     

213
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,596
  THERE AIN'T NOTHING STANDARD  
    ABOUT THE STANDARD DINER.   

214
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,130
ORDER IN.                       

215
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,066
                 I GOT HOT FOOD 
                  READY TO GO.  

216
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,068
IT'S CLASSIC DINER FOOD,        
    BUT IT'S UPSCALE.           

217
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,070

     YOU CAN GET HAMBURGER,     
    OR YOU CAN HAVE AHI TUNA.   

219
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,208
       THE VARIETY              
IS WHAT MAKES THIS PLACE.       

220
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,611
   YOU GET SOMETHING DIFFERENT  
    EVERY TIME YOU COME HERE.   

221

      YOU KNOW THAT SAYING,     
  "GET YOUR KICKS ON ROUTE 66"? 

222
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,283
   WELL, THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING  
     WITH THE BACON BURGER.

A CLASSIC CAR DEALERSHIP.

292
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,427
             THAT WAS DELICIOUS.

WHEN I SAW THE RAISINS.         

293
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,429
I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT.           
                   IT SCARED YA?

   SESAME OIL AND SESAME SEEDS. 

314
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,276

TO A GOOD TEMPURA BATTER

     THE TEXTURE OF THE TUNA

344
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,811

                      ALL RIGHT.

512
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,950
SALT, WHITE PEPPER, THYME.      
                          THYME.

513
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,952
 WE'RE GONNA MAKE A SAVORY SAUCE
        OUT OF IT ANYWAY,       

514
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:45,089
   SO I THINK THE THYME         
GOES WELL WITH THE CHEESE.      
                           OKAY.

515
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:47,558
WE'RE GONNA TAKE OUR ONION,     
    WINE AND BUTTER...          
                           OKAY.

516
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,560
    ADD THE ROUX,               
COOK IT ALL TOGETHER.           

517
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,562
SO WE'VE GOT OUR BéCHAMEL       

518
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:53,564
JUST ABOUT TO THE CONSISTENCY   
 WE WANT IT--NICE AND TIGHT.    
            IT TIGHTENS UP NICE.

519
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,499
  NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD           
A BUNCH OF SEASONINGS--         

520
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,501
    DRY MUSTARD,                
SALT, WHITE PEPPER...           
                   PAPRIKA FOR  
                 A LITTLE COLOR.

521
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,036
PAPRIKA.                        

522
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:01,639
         NOW WHAT KIND OF CHEESE
            ARE WE GONNA ADD?   
WE USE THREE KINDS.             

523
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,707
I'M GONNA USE PARMESAN.         
 I'M GONNA USE ASIAGO.          

524
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:06,043
AND I'M GONNA USE               
 SHARP CHEDDAR.                 
                DO YOU ADD IT IN
                ALL AT ONE TIME,

525
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:08,579
                 OR DO YOU GO   
               LITTLE BY LITTLE?
I PRETTY MUCH ADD 'EM           
   ONE AT A TIME.               

526
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,581
    GET THIS                    
MELTED IN THERE,                

527
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,583
     AND WE'LL ADD              
THE OTHER TWO CHEESES.          

528
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,585
 IF YOU WANT TO DUMP THAT ASIAGO
 IN, THAT'D BE GREAT. PARMESAN. 

529
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,587
I LIKE THAT, SO YOU GET A LITTLE
   BIT OF THE SWEET AND SHARP   

530
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,589
                 FROM THE ASIAGO
                  AND THE PARM  

531
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,591
             AND THE CREAMINESS 
              FROM THE CHEDDAR. 

532
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,726
   OKAY, CHEESE SAUCE IS DONE.  
 WE'LL TAKE THAT WITH THE PASTA,

533
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,728
             PUT IT IN THE DISH 
                AND BAKE IT.    

534
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,730
       SHOULDN'T WE TASTE THAT? 

535
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,199
        THAT'S CREAMY GOODNESS. 

536
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:30,201
               IT'S LIKE        
       THE COLORADO CHEESE RIVER

537
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,203
           RUNNING RIGHT THROUGH
                FLAVOR TOWN.    
MACARONI.                       

538
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:34,238
               SO EVERY TIME    
           SOMEBODY ORDERS THIS,

539
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:36,207
              YOU COOK THE PASTA
                   TO ORDER?    
YES, SIR.                       

540
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:38,142
  THAT'S WHAT YOU DO            
IN ITALIAN RESTAURANTS.         

541
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:40,211
YOU COOK YOUR PASTA FIRST.      
           NO, I'M DOWN WITH IT.

542
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,346

      I'M PICKIN' UP WHAT YOU'RE
         LAYIN' DOWN, BROTHER.  

543
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,948
        YEAH, AND THEN SOME MORE
            ON WOULD BE GOOD.   
A LITTLE BIT MORE CHEESE.       

544
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,551
IN THE OVEN SHE GOES.           
          ABOUT TEN MINUTES     
     OF KNICK KNACK PADDY WHACK?

545
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,553

I LIKE TO GET IT--YEAH.         
                         REALLY?

546
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,822
         OH, SO YOU REALLY LIKE 
          TO LET IT CARAMELIZE. 

547
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,824
I LIKE NICE AND BROWN           
     ON THE TOP.                

548
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,359
                  LOOK AT THAT. 

549
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,628
         THERE'S NOT MANY PLACES
            YOU FIND ANYMORE    

550
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:00,297
       WHERE YOU GET CUSTOM-MADE
            MAC AND CHEESE.     

551
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,900
             MMM, THAT'S CREAMY.

           THAT'S MAC AND CHEESE
               RIGHT THERE.     

553
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,904

     REALLY NICE, VELVETY, MMM.

THANK YOU.                      

555
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:12,243
     YOU'RE CAPTAIN CREAMY NOW. 

556
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:15,579
       MY SON HUNTER OR RYDER   
     WOULD GO BANANAS FOR THIS. 

557
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:18,249
                  DO YOU KNOW   
               WHAT BANANAS ARE?
KIND OF LIKE ORANGES?           

558
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:19,717
              BANANAS ARE GOOD. 

559
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,585
          SILLY CAPTAIN CREAMY. 

560
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,320
       THE MAC AND CHEESE       
   WAS EXCELLENT, JUST RIGHT.   

561
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,855
       IT'S COMFORT FOOD.       

562
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,857
     GOOD EATING EXPERIENCE     
       ALL THE WAY AROUND.      

563
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,392
     THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS.     

564
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,795
 THIS IS SATISFYING MY HUNGER.  
  THAT'S WHAT                   
I LIKE TO HEAR.                 

565
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:33,331
  I KNOW. I SAID I DIDN'T LIKE  
         BREADED WINGS.         

566
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,265
    I JUST DIDN'T FEEL GOOD,    
      I GUESS, TO SIT HERE      

567
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,267
   AND NOT EAT ALL OF THEM...   

568
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:40,004
      AND THE FRIED CHICKEN     
     AND THE MAC AND CHEESE.

573
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:53,284

           and Dives."          

575
