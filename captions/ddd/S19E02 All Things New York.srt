           Hey, there.

00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:03,802
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:07,072
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,273
          This trip...          

5
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:09,274
       Live from New York!      

6
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:11,143
     ...it ain't no skit...     
                       What up? 

7
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:13,746
         ...just a taste        
        of New York City.       

8
00:00:13,748 --> 00:00:15,147
                 All right,     
            this is now obscene.

9
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,015
      In Astoria, Queens...     

10
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,884
Flavor town.                    
                    Flavor town!
                           Wow. 

11
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:23,888
    ...the funky indie diner,   
  dedicated to doing it right.  

12
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,024
         I'm gonna have to back 
  for another round of hot yoga.

13
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,493
        On the Lower East       
         of Manhattan...        

14
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,696
        Wow, look at this thing.
      ...one man's mission      
         to go local...         

15
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,965
           You're that hardcore?

16
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:35,633
   ...is paying off big time.   

17
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:39,438
            That is an enormous 
roast-pork dinner in a sandwich.

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,640
  And in Eureka, California...  

19
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,241
I used to get spanked           
with something like this        

20
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,910
when I was a little kid.        
                 Me too. Me too.

21
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:47,446
 ...an authentic slice of NYC...

22
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:49,047
When you can hold it            
   with one finger              

23
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,515
and it doesn't buckle,          
    that's legit.               

24
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,852
          ...served up          
   next to a serious Sicilian.  

25
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:56,188
Little more girth to it.        
                         Mm-hmm.

26
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,522
  Just what I need.             

27
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:00,125
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

28
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,661

           and Dives."          

31
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:18,009
  So, I'm right over the bridge 
         from Manhattan         

32
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,077
       in Astoria, Queens.      

33
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,412
     You remember Astoria --    

34
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,880
we went and visited The Sparrow?

35
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,683
 Anyhow, you want to talk about 
 an area with a lot of history  

36
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,418
     and a lot of character,    
           this is it.          

37
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,287
And speaking of characters, wait
 till you check out this joint. 

38

     This is Queens Comfort.

00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,430
     It's just mind blowing.    

41
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,299
       The Egg Mc'Ruffin.       

42
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,299
           I love it.           
         This is great.

00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,768

00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,236
   The food here is unmatched.  

45
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:45,771
      Donnie makes it work      
         fantastically.

  in his low-budget film career

 to open up this joint in 2011.

drive-by on his mind ever since.

52

 my dream come true.

  Yeah.

        Are you married, Donnie?
Um...                           

55
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,725
                    [ Laughs ]  
Okay, I'm not married yet.      

56
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,261
I've been in a relationship     
   for five years               

57
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:11,797
and I just recently bought      
       a ring,                  

58
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,464
but I haven't proposed yet.     
                      Very nice.

59
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,200

         his hands full

61
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,471
  that keeps this place packed. 

62
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,273
    This is like                
an eclectic-funk menu.          

63
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:24,542
     Enchiladas and burgers     
        and comfort food.

    Anything you can imagine.

     Or Donnie can imagine.     

66
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,349
      And he's digging deep     
         for inspiration        

67
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,151
 on this Queens Comfort classic.

Down by Law, table six.         

69
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,220
  Down by Law chicken sandwich  
           is amazing.          

70
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,490
     It's one of                
 my favorite movies.            

71
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,092
     It's about                 
these three characters

That was the inspiration        
  for the sandwich.             

74
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,564
We're using like a bunch        
of different elements in there. 

75
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,300
So, we're gonna smoke           
these chicken breasts.          

76
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:52,303
                 This thing     
            looks like it's new.

77
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,773
             Where did you learn
               to smoke meat?   

78
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,709
I just read the instructions    
  when I bought it.

                 [ Laughs ]     

80
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,046
                  How long      
          are these gonna smoke?

81
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,046
     Two hours.                 

82
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,181
                     So,        
   let's get into the bacon jam.

83
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,450
First we'll add the onions.     

84
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,319
These are caramelized onions.   

85
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,120
       Bacon.                   

86
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,558
Now we're just gonna blend      
this stuff together.            

87
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:16,328
Now we're gonna make            
the rest of the bacon jam.      

88
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,730
  Add water, sugar.             

89
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,265
We're gonna let that            
     caramelize,                

90
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:23,001
and then we're gonna add        
the bacon and the onions.       

91
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:25,203
          That's like pig napalm
                right there.

for like 30 minutes.            

94
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,544
Now we're gonna make the braise 
for the smoked chicken.         

95
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:38,150
Start with orange juice,        
pineapple juice, soy sauce,     

96
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:45,490
sesame oil, honey, molasses,    
Sriracha, brown sugar, bacon.   

97
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,292
So, whisk that together.        
                           Okay.

98
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,494
And we're gonna cover           
    the chicken.                

99
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,562
     Wrap it some foil. How long
     is it gonna go in the oven?

100
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,564
  About 40 minutes.

232
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,021
   I'm here in New York City,   

233
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,422
           right down           
     on the Lower East Side,    

234
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:18,557
      almost by Chinatown.      

235
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,358
 Now, typically when I'm coming 
           down here,           

236
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,826
   I'm looking for a sandwich,  

237
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,962
   going to one of my favorite  
 joints, and that's Katz's Deli.

238
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,031
    But I hear that over here   
       on Orchard Street,       

239
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,365
   there's a chef that has got  

240
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,634
 a 300-mile farm-to-table thing 
            going on.           

241
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,503

    I got to check this out.

              and a short rib.  

244

    Such unique ingredients.    

245

   It's all about what's fresh  
      and what's available.

this meatball-shop thing.

Five locations.

         So,                    
you cats recommended this.      
                           Yeah.

252

        Sandy's the man.        
      The sandwich is delicious.

253
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,462
   Just gangster.

 High praise for chef Sandy Dee,

256
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,670

 this former leather-goods store

257
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,406
 into a 30-seater back in 2013.

     upscale on the downlow.    

260
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,946
      You never really know     
  what's gonna be on the menu.  

261
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,748
     It's always a surprise     
     and it's always good.      

262
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,283
   I'm having the Winter Pig.   

263
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:22,153
    It is a bit of a flavor     
    explosion in your mouth.    

264
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:24,555
So, we're gonna make            
the spice rub right now         

265
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,424
for the pig sandwich.           

266
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,958
First, I'm gonna put in         
some of this coffee grounds.    

267
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,028
        Salt.                   
    Brown sugar.                

268
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,629
 Some Aleppo pepper.            
This is kind of the main...     

269
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,032
               Aleppo pepper!   
           I love Aleppo pepper.

270
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,433
    There you go.               
                        Awesome.

271
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:36,835
 I like 'cause it's             
like a little spice,            

272
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,102
  but it has, like,             
  a smokey flavor.              

273
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,504
We're gonna mix this up.        

274
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:40,838
  Then, I put some              
   in the bottom,               

275
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,573
so there's like a little mat    
for the pork belly.             

276
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,308
Then I'm just gonna lay in      
     the belly.                 

277
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,911
Then we're gonna add            
some more spice rub in on top.  

278
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,479
        What liquid are we using
             to braise this in? 

279
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,647
I actually braise this in beer. 

280
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,917
                     Oh,        
       that's gonna be terrible.

       local,                   

282
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,455
so I have no citrus here,       
 like lemons, limes,            

283
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,924
 anything like that.            
                       Time out!

Yeah.

287
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:07,532
Next, we're gonna add           
  our Sixpoint IPA              

288
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,334

289
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,203
this hyper-lemon twang at the   
end and it really comes through.

       Yeah.                    
                     Got it.    

292
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,876
           What's our next step?
I'm gonna pickle some apples.   

293
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:21,346
So, I start with hot peppers.   
Apple cider vinegar.            

294
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,614
Cinnamon. Bay leaves.           
     Star anise.                

295

  Juniper berries.              

296
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,685

297
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,821
         Should we just go along
             the idea of saying 

298
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,623
        you took every dry spice
                  you have?

301
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:35,760
    Celery seed.                

302
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:37,295
      And then                  
some brown sugar at the end     

303
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,564
so you get a little spicy/sweet 
  balance in there.             

304
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,233
 Bring it to a boil, then let it
         simmer 20, 25 minutes. 

305
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,034
   Then we'll pop the apples in?
Yeah.                           

306
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,170
           What's our next step?
So, we're gonna do              
the brown-butter apple preserves

307
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,372
for the pig sandwich.           
                         Got it.

308
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,307
So, we're gonna start off       
with some butter, brown sugar.  

309
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,309
    The apples in               
and then I'll put cold water in 

310
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,511
and I'll put more sugar in      
and then some salt over top.    

311
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,246
Then we give it some spins      
and just kind of let it cook.   

312
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,514
              Let it cook down. 
Yep.                            

313
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,183
So, it'll take about            
an hour and half to two hours.  

314
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,384
                    Okay.       

315
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,987
This is the pork belly,         
it's been cooking in the oven.  

316
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:06,324
             That's ridiculous. 

317
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,893
 So, I'm gonna slice            
the pork belly first.           

318
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,996

I'm gonna take this bread.      

319
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,331
I use micro-ciabatta            
   for everything.              

320
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,666
And then I'm gonna add the      
brown-butter apple preserves.   

321
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,002
Then we're gonna take our       
cheddar, kind of layer that on. 

322
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,838
Now I'm gonna pop this          
   in the broiler.              

323
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,942

         counters the saltiness.

332
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,630

    MAN #2: Cooked perfectly    
  and the big cloves of garlic  

460
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,316
 and, of course, the thin crust.

461
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,518
          It's the only         
  New-York-style pizza in town. 

462
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,387
      FIERI: And while Paul     
       is altering the way      

463
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,389
         a lot of locals        
      are looking at pizza,     

464
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,591
        he's also fixing        
    to try to change the way    

465
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:43,528
I think about thick-crust pie...

466
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,663
If you don't like deep dish,    
you'll still dig this.          

467
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:48,132
      ...when we come back.

00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:56,641
             FIERI:             
  Triple D's at a joint called  
   Paul's Live From New York.   

469
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,375
   It's in Eureka, California,  

470
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:01,179
   where they're cranking out   
     real-deal, old-school,     

471
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,114
    authentic east-coast pie.   

472
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:04,782
         Second to none.        

473
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,385
  FIERI: I mean, round and thin 
        is definitely in,       

474
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:11,255
   but that doesn't mean that   
square and stout is totally out.

475
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,991
       The Sicilian pizza,      
      the crust is thicker.     

476
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,460
             FIERI:             
    Probably so it can handle   

477
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,929
           a truckload          
     of homemade mozzarella.    

478
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,064
Now, what is a Sicilian?        
              It's a square pan.

479
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,333
 We making focaccia?            
                             No.

480
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,002
Don't make me eat focaccia      
with pizza toppings.            

481
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,671
                 Nope. Nope.    
           Sicilian all the way.

482
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:28,005
     All right.                 
                    There we go.

483
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,608
So, you got a little bit of oil 
      on there,                 

484
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,943
       heavy,                   
almost cast-iron-like pan.      

485
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,411
        Put a little bit of that
                  on there.     

486
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,547
     A little tomato sauce with 
    a little bit of water in it.

487
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,282
       Gives it a little color, 
and it keeps it from drying out.

488
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,552
Okay. So, now you take this,    
and it goes into the proof?     
                        Proofer.

489
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:42,687
Then, you make the pie?         
                           Yeah.

490
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,155
 SO, we've proofed.             

491
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:46,891
Now I'm gonna take some zucchini
              and some squash.  

492
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,830
        Roasted garlic on there.

493
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:56,500
               A little splash  
          of the marinara sauce.

494
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,369
                Throw it in,    
        it's gonna cook halfway.

495
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,772
        Yeah,                   
just like you're baking bread   

496
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,241
'cause it's gonna take that long
'cause it's focaccia bread.     

497
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,843
     Looks good.                
                            Yep.

498
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:09,780
There's the mozz you made.      
              Put that on there.

499
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,849
It's nice and crusty.           

500
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,584
    It's not soft               
like normal focaccia.           

501
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,586
       No. It's a different type
                of focaccia.    

502
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:16,854
       Is it?                   
     [ Laughs ]                 

503
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,589
   I'll admit it now. I'll admit
          it. I can't stand it. 

504
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:22,793
               Romano cheese,   
             a little olive oil.

505
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:23,861
So, in with the focaccia.       

506
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,062
                 All right.     
                 [ Laughs ]     

507
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,797
      How long                  
  is that gonna go?             

508
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,932
         Probably eight minutes.

509
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:32,469
            FIERI: Look at that.

510
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,537
                That's crazy.

   of this thing.               

513
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,478
            The more the better.

514
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,080
I was just telling you,         
when you can hold it like that  

515
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,216
and it doesn't fold up,         
    that's legit.               

516
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,556
It's not super doughy           
and mushy in the middle.        

517
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,959
 The bread sat there            

518
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:57,562
on that thick pizza pan         
with a little bit of oil,       

519
00:19:57,564 --> 00:20:00,698
and it literally fried          
 the bottom of this.            

520
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,100
So, it is so crispy,            
     so crunchy.                

521
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:07,170
This is a cross between a really
nice Neapolitan-style pizza     

522
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,907
with a little more girth        
to it -- just what I need.

00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:11,108
        Mmm.

You kill it, man.               
                    Thanks, bro.

525
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,514
     Excellent thick crust,     
        lots of veggies.        

526
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:20,117
   We can each get the kind of  
pizza that we want and be happy.

                  together.     

529

   I've known this guy forever. 
  What did you think of the pie?

530
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,324
  It's outstanding,             
   and it's great.              

531
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:27,725
 Best pizza is Humboldt County.

        together for you.

   this Flavortown road trip,   

535
