              And you need that 
               for the color.   

224
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,058
    So, then, all               
the pickling spices --          

225
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,792
   cinnamon stick,              
peppercorn, bay leaf...         

226
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:15,927
                 Beautiful.     

227
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:17,195
        ...brown ginger,        
          -Cardamom...          

228
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,130
...yellow mustard seeds,        
    chili flakes,               

229
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,599
       clove,                   
 juniper, coriander.            

230
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,401
 Once it dissolves,             
we're good to cool it down.     

231
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:24,669
                 Fantastic.     
                 All right.     

232
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,937
          Any particular brisket
                you're using?   

233
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,171
We use beef brisket.            

234
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,340
                As opposed to   
            the chicken brisket.

235
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,008
             It's not as popular
              as it used to be. 

236
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,943
It really has fallen            
out of favor lately.            

237
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,945
           Fallen out of flavor!

238
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,613
Put it in a non-reactive        
     container.                 

239
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,416
      Don't give me all the big,
              important words.  

240
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:40,418
     So, we got                 
a plastic bucket here           

241
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,686
with the beef brisket.          

242
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,689
  We're gonna dump              
our cooled brine over the top.  

243
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,291
                 [ Laughs ]     

244
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,626
With a bag of frozen water --   
 ice, as you say --             

245
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,029
we're gonna weight it down      
with a weight on top.           

246
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,631
              -Oh!              
    -So, this brisket's been    

247
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,633
     in a brine                 
  for 10 days here.             

248
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,100
Fill it up with water.          

249
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,302
   Hit this liquid              
     as it cooks                

250
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:58,903
with a little bit more          
of the pickling spice.          

251
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,239
   We'll put it to              
a gentle simmer for 3.5 hours,  

252
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,108
     keep a nice                
little bubble going on.         

253
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,242
                  Going on.     

254
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,110
So, next up, we're gonna        
make the maple mustard          

255
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,912
we're gonna serve with it       
as kind of the dipping sauce.   

256
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,581
             Brisket, mustard --
              they go together  

257
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,916
               like tuna fish   
             and peanut butter. 

258
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:13,317
It might be a stretch,          
but I can work with that.       

259
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,719
     We'll start                
   with egg yolks.              

260
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,054
We'll add a little bit          
   of lemon juice.              

261
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,321
I have two mustards here.       

262
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,724
This is called White Lightning, 
 little bit spicier.            

263
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,126
And this is called Old World,   
 little bit sweeter.            

264
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,529
    Maple syrup.                
Little tip for the home cook -- 

265
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,197
  a nice, wet towel             
under the mixing bowl           

266
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:27,465
frees up the second hand.

     the Moxy Cooking Hour.     

269
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,873
 Add the oil slowly             
into the egg yolk to form       

270
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,208
a nice creamy mixture.

00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,344
           -Luxurious.          
 -And add a little bit of salt. 

272
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,546
Little bit of pepper            
and then we'll give it a taste. 

273
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,149
              I get nice maple. 
             I definitely could 

274
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,418
              go more mustard.  

275
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,353
 Chef, I'm thinking             
a shot of lemon juice, too.     

276
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,821
              And I could also  
             do a touch of salt.

277

           beautiful about this.

 We like to trim off            

282

some of that excess fat --      
      slice it,                 

283

a little bit fresher,           
a little more modern.           

289
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,847
Top it with a little            
   bit of parsley,

     I'm supposed to leave.     

333
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,669
  I got to jump in the Camaro,  
   take off to the next joint.  

334
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,805
   But I'm not going anywhere   
      and neither are you.      

335
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,139
        So stick around.        

336
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,874
         We'll come back        
  to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. 

337
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,076
    Hanging out at the Moxy.    

338
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,877
     Well, the chef's gonna     
       do some more magic.      

339
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,078
        See you in a bit.       

340
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,513
     I still want to go lay down
              in the basement.  

341
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,520
                     ♪♪         

342
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:03,855
                Welcome back.   

343
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,356
              We're hanging out 
   in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

344
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,459
   I'm glad to see that you have
       the Moxy to stick around.

345
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:08,993
     Huh? How'd I use that?     
         -That was good.        

346
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,129
                Funky, little   
                tapas joint,    

347
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,531
        where the chef is taking
            New England classics

348
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,667
              and kind of doing 
            his own little spin.

349
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:18,069
               Tons of respect  
 for the farm-to-table attitude.

350
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,403
       MAN: The chef knows      
       the local farmers,       

351
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,473
   he knows their products --   
    You're tasting the area.    

352
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,742
         I saw there's a big map
    with a bunch of flags in it,

353
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,276
     and those are all the farms
             that you buy from? 

354
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,878
A lot of the farms we use,      
as well as the plaques          

355
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,279
on the wall behind the bar.     

356
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,815
  Knowing how fresh it is just  
   makes it that much better.   

357
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,817
         Goat stroganoff        
        going to Table 2.       

358
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,220
    Had the goat stroganoff.    
      It's very delicious.      

359
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:37,555
              Goat stroganoff,  
   'cause you hear it every day.

360
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,957
We get whole goats right down   
the street from Riverslea Farm. 

361
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,093
So, to start this off,          
we're going to braise pieces    

362
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,095
  of the goat leg,              
 season the meat --             

363
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,130
    salt, pepper.               

364
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,499
    Into the oil,               
sear this on all sides.         

365
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,768
   We're going to               
  add our mirepoix.             

366
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,569
    We've got our               
   aromatics here,              

367
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:52,971
our thyme, fresh bay,           

368
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,440
  garlic, cloves, peppercorns.  
            -Got it.            

369
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,774
   Then we've got               
   our goat stock               

370
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,176
  that we made from             
the bones of the goat.          

371
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,511
                You are just    
        one resourceful machine.

372
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,980
We're going to bring this up,   
    turn it down,               

373
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,982
 do a gentle simmer,            
 till about 3 hours.            

374
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,249
                 Now we have    
            the shreddable goat.

375
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,653
We just pull it into            
this extra pan over here.       

376
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,788
  Those are like, you got enough
    texture on the outside of it

377
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,724
       from the sear, you didn't
        overcook it to the point

378
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:14,392
        where it's just shreddy,
                 dusty goat.    

379
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:15,659
           We got some good fat.

380
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:16,928
            Next up?            
  -We're going to take the jus, 

381
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,529
and we're going to strain it    
  right over that,              

382
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,732
keeps it even moister           
than it is right now.           

383
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:22,734
  -Did you say "even moister"?  
         -Even moister.         

384
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,869
            Is that a town close
               to Portsmouth?   

385
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,405
         Oh, you have Gloucester
          and then Even Moister.

386
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,740
 I heard Flavortown             
  was in the middle             

387
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:30,341
       of there somewhere.      
      -You've got it right.     

388
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:33,744
We're going to saute            
fingerling potatoes, carrots,   

389
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,680
a little fresh, cracked pepper, 
    going to add                

390
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,615
the sour cream into the goat.   

391
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,016
    And now we're               
   ready to plate.              

392
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,418
              Plate this dish.  

393
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,820
The potatoes and the carrots    
to make a little nest,          

394
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,422
    the the goat                
 stroganoff itself.             

395
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:47,292
   -So, it's like a goat moat.  
   -Crispy potato, fresh dill.  

396
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,693
        You gotta have the dill.

397
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,161
     And here's                 
our goat stroganoff.            

398
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,632
                 Outrageous.    
           The sour cream, goat,

399
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,100
             dill combo might be

400
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,635
            one of the best ways
             I've ever had goat.

401
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:59,771
              It is nuts, man.  

402
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:02,840
        You get that little tang
     coming from the sour cream,

403
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,175
           you get the freshness
                of the dill.    

404
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,511
      The potato and the carrots
              cooked perfectly. 

405
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,846
      I think of eat it and fall
             asleep on the couch

406
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,448
             or at the bus stop.
                  Love it.      

407
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,116
          Outstanding.          
        -Goat stroganoff.       

408
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,651
  Creamy, exceptionally tender, 

409
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:16,120
       crunchy and savory       
         and delicious.         

410
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,388
              The way Matt is,  

411
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,524
            the way the food is,
               it's got moxie.  

412
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,792
      The name fits, doesn't it?

413
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:22,393
  Moxy's always your sure bet.  

414
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:23,794
           This is an experience
               you can't miss.  

415
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,195
          I mean, you're an hour
                from Boston?    

416
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,397
             -Yeah.             
      -They're gonna build      

417
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,866
             a high-speed train 
      from Boston straight here.

418
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,268
  You think they'll             
  let me drive it?              

419
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,703
            You can always wish.

420
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,742
             FIERI:             
   Up next, a mother/daughter   
      duo in Los Angeles...     

421
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,477
  You guys are like             
culinary ambassadors.           

422
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,146
  ...putting their family Dutch 
     on Ethiopian favorites.    

423
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,348
              There's something 
        going on in this kitchen

424
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,549
            that I'm not getting
                brought into.   

425
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:51,722
 That was the touch.            
Make sure that one goes.        

426
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,891
Don't cut that one out.         

427
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,262
  So, I'm here in Los Angeles,  
           California,          

428
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,998
   and I'll tell you something  
     funny about "Triple D."    

429
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,999
         I go to a place        
     that I've been before,     

430
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,535
  and I find another "Triple D" 
     joint right next door.     

431
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:05,870
   Wait a second. That rhymed.  

432
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:08,139
         Anyhow, I'm at         
      the Mercado La Paloma     

433
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,642
       to check out Azla,       
        Ethiopian Vegan.        

434
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,144
             WOMAN:             
       You want the gomen?      

435
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,611
              MAN:              
   Man, this stuff is amazing.  

436
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,880
         It is<i> the</i> most         
    authentic Ethiopian food    

437
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:20,017
   you're every going to get.   
    -Can I get the tofu tips?   

438
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,352
            WOMAN #2:           
    Everything here is vegan,   

439
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,087
   but that doesn't take away   
     from the flavor at all.    

440
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,489
        It's really good.       

441
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:26,757
     FIERI: And it's put out    
  by a mother/daughter team --  

442
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,093
    Azla and Nesanet Abegaze.   

443
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,762
     who are serving up food    
        from the homeland       

444
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,763
  with their own family flavor. 

445
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,099
        -Enjoy your meal.       
       -Azla has six kids.      

446
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,301
        We all became vegetarian
             about 15 years ago.

447
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,836
       She had to learn to start

448
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,304
               cooking things   
           a little differently.

449
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,440
-Are most Ethiopians vegetarian?
              -No.              

450
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,575
            90% of our customers
             are not vegetarian.

451
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,310
  You guys are like             
culinary ambassadors.           

452
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,912
             FIERI:             
    In an Ethiopian cuisine,    

453
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:50,247
        it all starts out       
    with the edible flatware.   

454
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,518
     Injera is the Ethiopian    
         form of bread.         

455
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,452
         ...that you use        
      to pick up your food.     

456
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,255
WOMAN: We're going to make      
 our injera batter.             

457
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,655
     So, this is the teff grain.

458
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,525
               It's ground up,  
   quinoa flour, and then water?

459
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,127
      -A little at a time.      
      -A little at a time.      

460
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,329
                     Hi.        
              I'm making bread. 

461
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,999
       -This is too high.       
    -Just do it on the floor.   

462
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:09,334
Mom does it by hand,            

463
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:12,270
She actually says her prayer    
 as she's making it.            

464
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,806
     The prayer is, "Can someone
         please get me a mixer?"

465
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,207
  Right? [ Laughs ]             

466
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,409
          Here, Mommy.          
 -Can we at least put it there? 

467
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:21,612
After she's done with this,     
we'll ferment it for three days.

468
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,014
   So, water will               
  rise to the top.              

469
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,282
             -Right.            
        -Skim off the top       

470
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:25,549
to appropriate consistency.     

471
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,418
             So, we're talking, 
           like, pancake batter.

472
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,954
Yep. Now we're going            
to make our Misir Wot.          

473
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:31,089
         Mister without the "T."
                    Okay.       

474
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,157
 Which is our spicy             
    red lentils.                

475
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,960
        -So, the onions.        
            -Tomato.            

476
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,695
              Why don't we put  
              the oil in first? 

477
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,697
   -We have to cook them more.  
             -Okay.             

478
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,566
       We'll cook the oil       
  for about, maybe, 10 minutes. 

479
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,968
              And the berbere?  
             That's the spices. 

480
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,171
           All of it?           
        -Yeah. Go crazy.        

481
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,440
                 "Go crazy."    

482
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,709
            Add water, and then,
 when the water comes to a boil,

483
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,377
               that's when you  
              add the lentils.  

484
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,779
               How long's that  
             going to cook down?

485
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:56,447
          About, what?          
    An hour, two hours, Mom?    

486
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,382
             -Yeah.             
   -So, I asked the question,   

487
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,784
              and she asked you 
                 in English,    

488
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,519
               and you respond  
              to me in English. 

489
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,388
         I'm not allowed to talk
           directly to the chef?

490
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,590
           [ Laughs ]           

491
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,658
         Okay, now we're        
       making the injera.       

492
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,793
              -Yep.             
             -Whoa.             

493
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,729
   That is only crazy spatula.  

494
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,464
     Holy tortilla, Batman.     

495
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,399
          It feels like         
    a crepe meets a tortilla.   

496
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,468
          It's spongy.          
              Huh.              

497
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,604
 Okay, so the lentils are done. 

498
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:21,739
         A little nutmeg        
       and salt in those.       

499
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:24,141
       This is a curry potatoes,
            carrots and cabbage.

500
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,876
              Okay.             
      So, dip in like that?     

501
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,644
                    Yeah.       

502
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,148
              Okay.             

503
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,416
            All day.            
         It's fantastic.        

504
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,985
         This is lighter        
        than a tortilla.        

505
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,755
   But there's a ton of flavor  
    in that, and it's spicy.    

506
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,292
               Yep. [ Laughs ]  

507
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:44,428
              Yeah.             
     It's not overly spicy.     

508
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,798
   You're just getting a nice,  
      warm heat throughout.     

509
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,833
    Enormous depth of flavor.   

510
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:51,235
    There's only one question   
    that's coming to my mind.   

511
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,039
       It's, "Where's this      
       been all my life?"       

512
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,373
     I don't get blown away     
           very often.          

513
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,976
        It's outstanding.       
    -I'll get the misir wot.    

514
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,645
  It has a little bit of punch. 

515
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,313
  Delicious to eat with injera. 

516
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,848
   The spice is off the chain.  

517
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,517
  FIERI: Because the components 
    are as legit as it gets.    

518
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,385
   Azla goes back to Ethiopia   

519
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,454
           and gets it          
    and brings it back here.    

520
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,857
So you do your own blending     
to make your berbere?           

521
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:15,059
              -Yes.             
    -You make your own style.   

522
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,660
          Berbere just          
      heightens the flavor.     

523
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,496
   It heightens the intensity   
          of the dish.          

524
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,398
   It gives it the extra kick   
       that I really like.      

525
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,667
     This is a place you can    
     easily get addicted to.    

526
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:25,736
   You have all these colorful  
     options to choose from.    

527
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,871
  FIERI: Which includes one of  
     their family favorites.    

528
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,273
We're going to make churro,     

529
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,009
    churro wot in               
our special clay pot.           

530
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:36,214
      Churro is delicious,      
 almost like a stew consistency.

531
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:39,283
   Growing up, whenever it would
   rain, my mom would make this.

532
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,285
  On a cold day, there's nothing
         better than hot churro.

533
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,287
      -Get a little churro.     
  -Yep. You eat it with injera. 

534
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,556
        I eat everything        
        with injera now.        

535
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,959
     Onions and the tomato.     
      That's a lot of oil.      

536
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,293
             But now we're ready
               for the water.   

537
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,029
    So it'll come to a boil.    
   -Now we drop in the flour.   

538
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,498
             So, my mom just got
             back from Ethiopia,

539
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,966
             so these are a few 
                of the beans    

540
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,100
             that go into making
              the churro flour. 

541
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,903
                The garbanzo    
               that's roasted.  

542
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,972
    That's a small garbanzo.    
        And what is this?       

543
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,374
     This is like a type of pea,

544
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:05,910
       and then they grind it up
         with some other spices,

545
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,678
             and that's how you 
           get the churro flour.

546
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,980
             -Next?             
     -Now it's thickened up     

547
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,848
               and we're ready  
          for our minced garlic,

548
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,049
         salt and then jalapeño.

549
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:13,518
     You really get after it    
        with the jalapeño       

550
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,118
     in this Ethiopian food.    

551
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,320
 Okay, it cooks for 40 minutes, 

552
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,322
        and then we serve       
   that alongside with the...   

553
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,790
           -The gomen.          
      -The gomen is, like,      

554
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,926
      an interesting twist      
       on collard greens,       

555

        because it's kale       
       and it's got, like,

00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:27,064
   that Ethiopian kick to it.

   So I gotta go there first.

     There's something going    
       on in this kitchen

      There's no animal fat     
         in that at all.

     Oh, yeah! It's creamy,

00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,299

       gets put into play.

   to taste good.

00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:08,773
         The food tastes

    the more I love her food,
