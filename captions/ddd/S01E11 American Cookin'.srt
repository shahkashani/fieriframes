00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,465
IN THE FRYER?                   
                          RIGHT.

510
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:32,069
     IT MAKES A HUGE TREMENDOUS 
      DIFFERENCE ON THE FLAVOR. 

511
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:33,871

   SOME BACK TO HIM.            
                   I'M NOT GONNA
                     TELL HIM.  

529
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,510
                HE'LL KNOW.     
          HE'LL SMELL MY BREATH,

530
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,646

        <i> OR A DRESS CODE.</i>

                 YOUR SHIRT IN. 

536
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,590
           YOU HAVE TO LOOK NICE
            FOR THE CUSTOMERS.

542
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,669
  SO WHEN THEY WERE DOING IT,   
THIS IS HOW THEY WERE DOING IT? 
                          RIGHT.

            BROKE, DON'T FIX IT.

544
