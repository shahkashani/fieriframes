00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:01,933
         Hey, everybody.        
         I'm Guy Fieri.         

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,603
 And we're rolling out, looking 
 for America's greatest diners, 

3
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:05,603
      drive-ins, and dives.

00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:06,538
      [rock music playing]      

5
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,207
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
           This trip--          

6
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:09,074
           Holy moly.           

7
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:10,609
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
    Triple D's in all caps--    

8
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,511
      as it capital cities.     

9
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:12,878
        That sounds fun.        

10
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:13,812
         I'll try that.         

11
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,547
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
      Like Juneau, Alaska,      

12
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,549
 for a real deal taste of Italy.

13
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,085
    Did that just make you as   
    hungry as it should have?   

14
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:22,821
 GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): Amped-up
   brunch in the DC of Canada.  

15
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:25,557
       This is absolutely       
         a destination.         

16
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,559
  GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): And an 
  old-school spot in Richmond,  

17
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:28,560
           Virginia--           

18
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,496
        It may appear to        
      be your typical deli.     

19
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:31,964
       This is as far from      
        it as I've seen.        

20
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:34,633
GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): --putting
 out show-stopping new releases.

21
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,635
        This is like I've       
        been going to all       

22
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:37,836
 the movies in black and white. 

23
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,838
 And then today, I went to IMAX.

24
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,707
     That's all right here,     
     right now, on "Diners,     

25
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,510
     Drive-ins, and Dives."

      [rock music playing]      

27
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,922
       Now on Triple D, I       
    think I've seen them all.   

28
00:00:57,992 --> 00:00:58,991
  I've seen the delicatessens.  

29
00:00:59,059 --> 00:00:59,658
      I've seen the diners.     

30
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,725
  I've seen the sandwich shops. 

31
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:01,860
  I've seen the corner stores.  

32
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:02,727
          You name it.          

33
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,796
         But I'm here in        
       Richmond, Virginia,      

34
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,932
      where this couple has     
   resurrected an institution.  

35
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,002
  They've brought it back using 
  their own little funky style. 

36
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:15,340
   This is Perly's Restaurant   
        and Delicatessen.       

37
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:16,474
   [inaudible] and beef knish.  

38
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:17,742
         There's nothing        
        I've ever tasted        

39
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,611
 or been to that's like Perly's.

40
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:20,946
     The Perlstein for you.     

41
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,950
    This is nothing like your   
 regular delicatessen or diner. 

42
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:27,018
  GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): That's 
   because Rochelle and Kevin   

43
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,422
     Roberts are mixing his     
  master cooking with the food  

44
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,490
     her bubby used to make.    

45
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:32,357
           I'm Jewish.          

46
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:33,492
               OK.              

47
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:34,826
      And there was nowhere     
        to get this food.       

48
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:35,627
         Where'd you get        
        all the recipes?        

49
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,362
       Family recipes that      
       have been tweaked,       

50
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,431
         collaborations         
     between the two of us.     

51
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:40,699
       They have a lot of       
      items on their menus      

52
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,467
      that you're not going     
    to find in other places.    

53
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,636
    For instance, the potato    
       and duck pierogies.      

54
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:45,837
   Potato and duck pierogies.   

55
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,506
       GUY FIERI: You ever      
     have pierogies before?     

56
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,440
   These pierogies are better   
    than any other pierogies    

57
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,308
       that you can find.       

58
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,844
      Creamy, hardy, moist.     

59
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,645
      All of a sudden, he's     
      taking over the show.     

60
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,247
    He's starting to give the   
    whole description of it.    

61
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,649
   I mean, I just asked him if  
   he'd had pierogies before.   

62
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:58,717
       How are we starting      
         this thing off?        

63
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,051
       We're going to make      
       some pierogi dough.      

64
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,786
         GUY FIERI: OK.         

65
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:01,854
         KEVIN ROBERTS:         
       Eggs, sour cream--       

66
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,721
     That's the way I always    
     make my pierogi dough.     

67
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,657
      KEVIN ROBERTS: Water      
       and salt. AP flour.      

68
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,926
   GUY FIERI: How long are we   
    going to let this mix up?   

69
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:09,661
     For a few minutes, and     
   then we wrap it up and let   

70
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:10,662
  it rest in the refrigerator.  

71
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:11,797
        All right, so now       
       we're going to make      

72
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:12,931
   the cure for the duck legs.  

73
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,336
    White sugar, brown sugar,   
  sumac, and some kosher salt.  

74
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,737
    So, breakfast and lunch?    

75
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,272
  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 

76
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,407
    And you're taking all the   
 time to make confit duck legs? 

77
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,475
            Why not?            

78
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:24,409
       GUY FIERI: Does she      
        let you go home?        

79
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,544
   I mean, or just stay here?   

80
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,012
        She likes it when       
       I'm home, actually.      

81
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,146
              Yes.              

82
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:29,747
    You didn't have to say it   
  in a sultry voice like that.  

83
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,884
     Crushed juniper berry,     
    raw garlic, fresh thyme.    

84
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,753
        Put the duck legs       
         on top of this.        

85
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,354
         And then we'll         
       reverse the order.       

86
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:37,022
       And we do it again?      

87
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:37,689
              Yup.              

88
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,624
The garlic and then the juniper.

89
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,560
        How many days are       
        on your calendar?       

90
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:42,494
         Just the seven.        

91
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,229
         How many hours?        

92
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:44,563
               60.              

93
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,697
         60 hours a day?        

94
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:46,832
      That's what I figured     
        you were working.       

95
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:48,767
         Refrigerate it         
    overnight, and then we'll   

96
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,369
   cook them in the schmaltz.   

97
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:51,436
     The almighty schmaltz.     

98
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,904
       KEVIN ROBERTS: Two       
         to three hours.        

99
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:53,839
     What are we on to now?     

100
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:54,839
       Now we're going to       
       make a roast tomato      

101
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,641
     ketchup, which is going    
      to go into the sauce      

102
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,576
       for the final dish.      

103
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,710
       Going in the sauce.      

104
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:01,380
         Roma tomatoes,         
       and chopped garlic,      

105
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,582
dried oregano, some dried basil.

106
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:04,649
   GUY FIERI: Salt and pepper.  

107
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:05,784
         And roast these        
        off at what temp?       

108
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,720
    KEVIN ROBERTS: 350-degree   
     oven for about an hour.    

109
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,323
      Put it in a container     
       with tomato paste,       

110
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,658
   and puree it until smooth.   

111
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,725
            OK, chef.           

112
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:14,926
   Now we're going to make the  
   filling for the pierogies.   

113
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:19,664
 Boiled potatoes, green onions, 
  some of the duck leg confit,  

114
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,934
     mixed peppercorn blend,    
  kosher salt. Mash it around.  

115
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,604
    Going to add a little bit   
   of that reserved duck fat.   

116
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,472
          So this whole         
       process is by hand?      

117
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:28,807
    And then we haven't even    
      got into the rolling      

118
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,408
        out of the dough.       
       - That is correct.       

119
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:31,542
        Oh, my goodness.        

120
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,544
  And you don't have a sheeter? 

121
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:33,812
    I do not have a sheeter.    

122
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,746
      I'm going to get you      
     one for your birthday.     

123
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:35,614
      When's your birthday?     

124
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,416
     My birthday was Monday.    

125
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,350
        Oh, I missed it.        

126
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,550
             Sorry.             

127
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,153
           [laughter]           

128
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,555
     Maybe at least a bigger    
        rolling pin, huh?       

129
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,757
        That come with an       
         Easy Bake Oven?        

130
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,626
      We'll cut our dough.      

131
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:50,028
  Brush it with a little slurry 
    of cornstarch and water.    

132
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:50,762
           Slurry up.           

133
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:51,829
 KEVIN ROBERTS: Pierogi filling.

134
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,632
      GUY FIERI: How are we     
    cooking these from here?    

135
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,500
   KEVIN ROBERTS: They go into  
     a boiling pot of water.    

136
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,303
   All of this activity going   
    for one item on the menu?   

137
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:58,770
        That is correct.        

138
00:03:58,839 --> 00:03:59,971
       You're a busy man.       

139
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,175
  So we're going to start with  
  duck fat, pierogies, shiitake 

140
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:04,909
        button mushrooms.       

141
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:05,843
    The ketchup that we made.   

142
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,445
      KEVIN ROBERTS: I like     
      to char the ketchup.      

143
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,313
          Oh, me, too.          

144
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,314
             Always.            

145
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:10,648
 KEVIN ROBERTS: Cooked mirepoix.

146
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,650
       Duck stock, cover,       
       and let it reduce.       

147
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,518
       What do we do now?       

148
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,386
              Wait.             

149
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,588
         OK, good talk.         

150
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:17,456
           All right.           

151
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:18,990
             Voila.             

152
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,592
    And we top it off with a    
    little chive sour cream.    

153
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,261
          This is like          
     "Pierogi-- the Movie."     

154
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,163
    [cinematic music playing]   

155
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,735
   I don't know that the word   
    "pierogi" describes this.   

156
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,604
        It's like calling       
        my Camaro a car.        

157
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,473
     It's a vintage hot rod.    

158
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,676
        Great duck-- the        
       duck jus reduction       

159
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,411
   that the pierogi soaks up.   

160
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:40,879
 The vegetables, the mushrooms--

161
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,482
     the little kiss to that    
      roasted tomato sauce.     

162
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,417
        This is like I've       
        been going to all       

163
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:47,618
 the movies in black and white. 

164
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:51,156
 And then today, I went to IMAX.

165
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:51,622
        That's dynamite.        

166
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:52,624
           Thank you.           

167
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,759
         Potato and duck        
       pierogies for you.       

168
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,295
      The filling's really      
      creamy, and it pairs      

169
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,562
  nicely with the tomato sauce. 

170
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:58,697
         This is not how        
       they normally come.      

171
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,365
           - Correct.           
  - This is like pierogi meal.  

172
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,366
      You're aware of that?     
             - I am.            

173
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,500
           - Promise?           
           - Promise.           

174
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:03,501
       Look at the camera.      

175
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,369
        Say, "I promise."       

176
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,237
           I promise.           

177
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,638
      OK, I got it on tape.     

178
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,573
          Need a cup of         
      matz, chicken entr e.     

179
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,441
     Was this a deli before     
       you guys got here?       

180
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:11,643
       KEVIN ROBERTS: Yes.      

181
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:12,911
     ROCHELLE ROBERTS: It's     
      been here since 1961.     

182
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,913
         It's had a few         
     iterations since then.     

183
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,582
       And we of bringing       
      it back to its roots.     

184
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:18,717
    So the tile on the wall?    

185
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,184
 ROCHELLE ROBERTS: Not original.
  KEVIN ROBERTS: Not original.  

186
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:20,785
      GUY FIERI: Wallpaper?     
            Anything?           

187
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:21,787
          The ceiling?          
           - I did it.          

188
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,388
   - You did it all yourself?   
            - Did it.           

189
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,522
         Because behind         
        every great chef,       

190
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:25,857
      there's someone that      
      knows how to lay tile     

191
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,759
 and do plumbing and electrical.

192
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:31,463
  Perly's used to sort of be a  
 greasy hole-in-the-wall diner. 

193
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,798
      Kevin's made it sort      
     of like a modern diner.    

194
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:34,866
        Really beautiful.       

195
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,602
     If we were going to do     
  one more completely wreck it  

196
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:38,937
 for me dish, what would it be? 

197
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:39,871
        Jewish egg rolls.       

198
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,474
      The Jewish egg rolls      
    are one of my favorites.    

199
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:45,010
      The twist they put on     
       it here is amazing.      

200
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,412
    It's always like a Reuben   
   wrapped up in an egg roll.   

201
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,480
       When we come back--      

202
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,448
        Jewish egg rolls.       

203
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:51,649
           Here we go.          

204
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:55,653
        5, 4, 3, 8, and a       
        1, 2, a 1, 2, 3.        

205
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:56,788
          Welcome back.         

206
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,524
     Triple D hanging out in    
 Richmond, Virginia at Perly's--

207
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,459
     old deli from the day.     

208
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,461
       And given new life       
       by husband and wife      

209
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,530
team Kevin and Rochelle Roberts.

210
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,533
   Kevin has really taken the   
    concept of a Jewish diner   

211
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,601
      and made it a little      
        bit more global.        

212
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,270
          I mean, like          
       with the egg rolls.      

213
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,471
      The Jewish egg rolls.     

214
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:17,008
      It's like an egg roll     
    meets a Reuben sandwich.    

215
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:17,742
          I inhaled it.         

216
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,743
  GUY FIERI: What are we into?  

217
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,478
       This is going to be      
      one of the components     

218
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,613
     of the Jewish egg roll.    

219
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:25,550
   Corned beef, bay leaf, all   
    spice berries, cinnamon,    

220
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,887
       mustard seed, whole      
  coriander, mixed peppercorn,  

221
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:32,890
     garlic, cloves, crushed    
      red pepper, mirepoix.     

222
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,025
       GUY FIERI: Got it.       

223
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,560
  KEVIN ROBERTS: All this will  
   get covered with the water.  

224
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,428
    GUY FIERI: And how are we   
    going to let this roast?    

225
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,563
       Three, four hours.       
           Five, six?           

226
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,498
      It all depends on the     
      size of the brisket.      

227
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,766
         Don't show off         
       that you can count.      

228
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,502
         Now we're going        
       to make the kishka.      

229
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:44,702
      It's going to be the      
    binder for our egg roll.    

230
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:45,904
         GUY FIERI: OK.         

231
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,241
   Minced red onion, shredded   
   carrots, Yukon gold potato.  

232
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:49,641
         GUY FIERI: OK.         

233
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,643
       Sweat this in oil.       

234
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,912
   Halfway through we're going  
     to add chopped garlic.     

235
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,048
    Once all the veggies have   
  sweated into our mixing bowl, 

236
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,651
     quick rolled oats, some    
      matzo meal, paprika,      

237
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,521
        coriander, cumin,       
        and chili powder,       

238
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,390
      black pepper, kosher      
         salt, pastrami.        

239
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,524
     We actually patty this.    

240
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,659
   GUY FIERI: All right, chef.  

241
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,461
   So now we're going to make   
 the filling for the egg rolls. 

242
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,663
 Corned beef and some pastrami. 

243
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,466
     Going to give it a few     
 pulses, and then into the bowl 

244
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,402
  with our kishka, sauerkraut.  

245
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:18,603
         We'll take our         
       egg-roll wrappers,       

246
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,339
    brush them with a little    
    of the cornstarch slurry.   

247
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,674
        We have our mix.        

248
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,609
 And then roll up our egg roll. 

249
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,476
           Well done.           

250
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:26,478
   This go down in the fryer?   

251
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:27,545
    KEVIN ROBERTS: Yes, sir.    

252
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,480
     GUY FIERI: And what are    
      we serving this with?     

253
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:29,213
           Amba sauce.          

254
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,348
          A-who-ba-ha?          

255
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,684
  KEVIN ROBERTS: It's a Middle  
  Eastern pickled mango sauce.  

256
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,552
           Just what I          
      expected to get here      

257
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,554
        with my pastrami        
      corned beef egg roll.     

258
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,757
       Start with a little      
     vegetable oil, ginger,     

259
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,492
  coriander, crushed red chili. 

260
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,760
          I think he's          
       just trying to show      

261
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:42,828
 off all the ingredients he has.

262
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:47,365
   And turmeric, brown sugar,   
    kosher salt, lemon juice,   

263
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:47,832
             honey.             

264
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:48,900
              Gone.             

265
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,503
      KEVIN ROBERTS: Water,     
   garlic, white wine vinegar.  

266
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,438
        And the elephant        
      in the room, please?      

267
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,038
      KEVIN ROBERTS: Mango.     

268
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:54,705
           All right.           

269
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,707
Let this cook down and pur e it?

270
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:56,641
  KEVIN ROBERTS: That's right.  

271
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:57,642
     GUY FIERI: Here we go.     

272
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,711
         Plate them with        
         the amba sauce.        

273
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,679
       And we make a honey      
        mustard schmaltz.       

274
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,182
    And they always come with   
  two football-sized egg rolls? 

275
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,083
            Yes, sir.           

276
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:11,590
    If it was just all corned   
     beef, pastrami, or all     

277
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,525
  sauerkraut, it'd be too much. 

278
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:17,662
    The kishka in the middle    
       is a great balance.      

279
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,531
     You get the creaminess     
         of the potato.         

280
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,600
     You get a little bit of    
   the bite of the vegetable.   

281
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:25,604
       The amba sauce got       
       some punch, buddy.       

282
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,338
        We've got Middle        
        Eastern chutney.        

283
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,006
    A lot of power behind it.   

284
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:28,806
      KEVIN ROBERTS: Yeah.      

285
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,542
        You see this cute       
    little thing on the menu    

286
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,210
   that says Jewish egg roll.   

287
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:32,611
        That sounds fun.        

288
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,678
         I'll try that.         

289
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,480
     It's way beyond that--     
        far beyond that.        

290
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:36,281
           Thank you.           

291
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:37,482
      The Jewish egg rolls.     

292
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:38,550
         It's so tender.        

293
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:39,618
       This is delicious.       

294
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,353
      The sauce is nice and     
    tangy, with a little bit    

295
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,488
   of sweetness of the honey.   

296
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,689
       We've got a Reuben       
      wearing creamy slaw,      

297
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:45,824
    a Jewbano wearing fries.    

298
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:48,360
     Everything on the menu     
      is great-- all of it.     

299
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,761
  I'll be back later this week. 

300
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,896
        It may appear to        
      be your typical deli.     

301
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,232
       This is as far from      
        it as I've seen.        

302
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,835
     Nicely done, my friend.    

303
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,436
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
        Up next in Juno--       

304
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,171
          All day long.         

305
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,572
  GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): Legit  
   pasta with an Alaskan edge.  

306
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:02,974
    This is the kind of thing   
  that people are looking for.  

307
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,511
   GUY FIERI: And fired up pie  
that tastes as good as it looks.

308
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,980
     I don't know to eat it     
    or take a picture of it.    

309
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:09,580
      [rock music playing]      

310
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:14,719
       I've said it once,       
     and I'll say it again.     

311
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,389
     You've got to slow down    
     and take a look around.    

312
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,590
   I'm here in Juneau, Alaska.  

313
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,725
      And every other day,      
       thousands of people      

314
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:21,793
   get off those cruise ships.  

315
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,928
     And they walk right by     
    this funky little joint.    

316
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,730
      Where the chef, who's     
    worked through the ranks    

317
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,465
          and studied a         
      little bit in Italy,      

318
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,734
      has opened up a joint     
   where he's scratch-making,   

319
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,537
     hand-making, just about    
     everything on the menu.    

320
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,340
     It's Alaskan food with     
      an Italian influence.     

321
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:38,209
    This is In Bocca Al Lupo.   

322
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:39,411
      Thunder Dome for B4.      

323
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,746
       If you want really       
      amazing Italian food,     

324
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,615
  like this is the place to go. 

325
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:44,683
         Homemade pasta.        

326
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:45,550
      Homemade pizza dough.     

327
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,485
  Going in with two Salsiccias. 

328
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,754
    You can tell in his style   
  of cooking is not from here.  

329
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,156
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
       Yeah, it's actually      

330
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,425
     a little something Beau    
   Schooler brought back from   

331
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,692
 his culinary training in Italy.

332
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:55,693
    What does the name mean?    

333
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,028
         It means "into         
       the wolf's mouth."       

334
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:57,696
       It means good luck.      

335
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,364
        My goodness, I'm        
        learning Italian.       

336
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,432
   So you do wood-fired pizza.  

337
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,399
           What else?           

338
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,700
        Fresh pasta, our        
        own charcuterie.        

339
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,503
    In the summertime, where    
  kind of more seafood-focused. 

340
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,505
  King crab pappardelle for 25. 

341
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:08,573
   The king crab pappardelle?   

342
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:09,840
        It's hard to stop       
    eating, that's for sure.    

343
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:13,778
   Chunks of big, meaty, juicy  
 Alaskan wild-caught king crab. 

344
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:17,382
  And the pasta is perfectly al 
  dente every time you have it. 

345
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:18,383
      It's heaven on earth.     

346
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:19,583
   What are we going to make?   

347
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:20,384
     King crab pappardelle.     

348
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:21,452
       Let's get into it.       

349
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:22,587
      We've got to make the     
      pappardelle noodles.      

350
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:25,790
      Low gluten flour, egg     
   yolks, olive oil, sea salt.  

351
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,858
         You making all         
       the pasta in-house?      

352
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,659
     BEAU SCHOOLER: We make     
     all the pasta in-house.    

353
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:29,593
    We always have a gnocchi.   

354
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,262
     I'll have the ja-naki.     

355
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,130
         I love g-nochi.        

356
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,197
          Gih-no-chee.          

357
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,398
          Gin-oo-chee.          

358
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,601
        I got to knead it       
        'til it's smooth.       

359
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:37,602
          Let it rest.          

360
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:38,737
      Roll with a sheeter.      

361
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,271
         BEAU SCHOOLER:         
      Sprinkle semolina on.     

362
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,338
   GUY FIERI: Cut it by hand.   

363
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:42,406
       BEAU SCHOOLER: Yup.      

364
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:43,007
           All right.           

365
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,075
   What do we got to do, Beau?  

366
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,344
     We've got to basically     
   make like a seafood bisque.  

367
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,011
   And that's our pasta sauce.  

368
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,878
         GUY FIERI: OK.         

369
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:50,682
        Got clove, green        
     peppercorns, bay leaf.     

370
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,817
  We got to grind that all up.  

371
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,819
      Combine it with sweet     
        paprika, ginger,        

372
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,555
         cinnamon, sweet        
     Calabrian chili powder,    

373
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,358
 star anise, allspice, cardamom.

374
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:00,825
            Cardamom?           

375
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:01,559
     BEAU SCHOOLER: Mustard.    

376
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,493
       There's our spice.       

377
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:03,494
    Something got my tongue.    

378
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:04,695
        Is that from the        
        green peppercorn?       

379
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:05,497
   It's that or the cinnamon.   

380
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:06,564
       GUY FIERI: OK, what      
       are we doing next?       

381
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:07,498
           Olive oil.           

382
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,100
 Break down our king crab legs. 

383
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,368
        Then we've got a        
       crab shells, here.       

384
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:10,902
            Garlic--            

385
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:11,703
             Got it.            

386
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:15,573
         Carrots, onion,        
     leeks, fennel, celery,     

387
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,242
   and ginger, and then thyme.  

388
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,577
   We cook all that down, and   
     we add in tomato paste.    

389
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:20,444
        Copious amounts.        

390
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,378
   BEAU SCHOOLER: White wine.   

391
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:22,313
    GUY FIERI: You glaze it.    

392
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,049
        Lemon juice, fish       
        sauce seasoning.        

393
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,049
 GUY FIERI: Good amount of that.

394
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,717
      BEAU SCHOOLER: Cover      
      it with crushed ice.      

395
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:27,918
        You gotta explain       
      this ice game to me.      

396
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,254
       It just allows that      
       broth to like build      

397
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,656
   up real slowly and gently.   

398
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:32,924
      And then by the time      
        it's all melted,        

399
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,326
      it's going to simmer      
      for maybe 30 minutes.     

400
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,461
   So we get a ton of flavor.   

401
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:37,796
       I've never seen it.      

402
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:38,930
       Well, there you go.      
         Come to Alaska.        

403
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:39,797
       We do things cold.       

404
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,067
        I would-- he was        
      waiting to say that--     

405
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:42,600
            I wasn't.           

406
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:43,601
      That just popped out.     

407
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:44,669
 --to say that the entire time. 

408
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,337
        Well, after this        
      simmers, we're going      

409
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,805
 to blend it and then strain it.

410
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,474
         We've going to         
      pappardelle noodles.      

411
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:50,675
    Throw in our bisque base.   

412
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:51,609
  GUY FIERI: Beautiful noodles. 

413
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,211
         BEAU SCHOOLER:         
       Throw in some crab.      

414
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,011
        You're generous.        

415
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,412
         BEAU SCHOOLER:         
      Lemon creme fraiche.      

416
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,681
      GUY FIERI: Gorgeous.      

417
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:59,084
 Finish it off with this sorrel 
  that our buddies are growing. 

418
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:03,755
           Delicious.           

419
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:06,557
    The bisque is really nice   
    and light and refreshing.   

420
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,561
     The crab is not tough.     

421
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,229
        The pasta is the        
       heart of the dish.       

422
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,431
       It is super-tender.      

423
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,767
         And the key is         
       the creme fraiche.       

424
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,970
   Two of my favorite things--  
  crab bisque in a pasta dish.  

425
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,507
          Outstanding.          

426
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,707
          Outstanding.          

427
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,577
      King crab pappardelle     
       over here for you.       

428
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,311
         It is amazing.         

429
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,846
   It's creamy and it's light.  

430
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:32,584
  When you see fresh king crab  
 on a menu, you have to have it.

431
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,385
   Walking in, two meatballs.   

432
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:35,653
           He's always          
      working and evolving      

433
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:36,654
   to make his product better.  

434
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:39,591
       With his background      
     in culinary from Italy,    

435
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,392
   pizza is a big part of it.   

436
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,261
          The Salsiccia         
      pizza is really good.     

437
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,662
   Working a Salsiccia for 15.  

438
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,530
        Fresh mozzarella,       
       roasted red onions,      

439
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:47,665
  and homemade fennel sausage.  

440
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,400
       So you've never had      
     it before, I can tell.     

441
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,068
         Once or twice.         

442
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:50,801
           All right.           

443
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:51,870
         So what are we         
       going to do first?       

444
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,471
   BEAU SCHOOLER: We're going   
    to mill our Alaskan wheat   

445
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:54,672
      for our pizza dough.      

446
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:55,673
   GUY FIERI: You'll sift it.   

447
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,475
         Cool water, the        
       fresh-milled wheat,      

448
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,544
 a high-gluten flour, and yeast.

449
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:00,478
    We mix all that together.   

450
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,480
       And then we let it       
     sit for about an hour.     

451
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,815
      Let the yeast bloom.      

452
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,283
     BEAU SCHOOLER: And then    
       we'll add in salt--      

453
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,350
     four minutes on medium.    

454
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,351
    GUY FIERI: Let it proof.    

455
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,553
    BEAU SCHOOLER: Overnight.   

456
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,488
Portion it, and then it's got to
 sit out for at least two hours.

457
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,689
       GUY FIERI: Got it.       

458
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:12,957
       We're going to make      
      our Italian sausage.      

459
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:16,628
 We've got pork shoulder, fennel
 seed, coriander, sweet paprika,

460
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,231
oregano, Calabrian chili powder,
  sea salt, sugar, curing salt. 

461
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:20,765
         GUY FIERI: OK.         

462
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,966
    And then we'll grind it.    

463
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,702
 We've got a little bit of cold 
  water, some red wine vinegar, 

464
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:27,438
    and then we just bake it    
  off, let it cool in walk-in.  

465
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,773
        And then we will        
       set up for service.      

466
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,574
     GUY FIERI: Just to make    
     it easier to work with?    

467
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:31,843
              Yeah.             
  We're going to make our mozz. 

468
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,978
         Curd, sea salt,        
        190-degree water.       

469
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,780
   It's a little bit different  
      than your bath water.     

470
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,650
     So we'll just drain off    
 this initial really hot water. 

471
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,518
     And we're going to add     
    more water to stretch it.   

472
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:41,853
   Look how beautiful that is.  

473
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:42,987
     It's hotter than heck.     

474
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,722
     BEAU SCHOOLER: Shape it    
   into our little mozz balls.  

475
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,191
          Float it off.         
          Look at that.         

476
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,593
    Just that little pillow.    

477
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,461
      Good amount of salt.      
        Just enough chew.       

478
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,463
      Look at that stretch.     

479
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:53,731
          All day long.         

480
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,867
    Did that just make you as   
    hungry as it should have?   

481
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,668
    BEAU SCHOOLER: We've got    
     our pizza dough, here.     

482
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,537
       GUY FIERI: Gentle,       
     tender, ready to rock.     

483
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:00,871
        Our pizza sauce--       

484
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,540
      California tomatoes,      
      olive oil, sea salt.      

485
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:03,407
           That's it.           

486
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,276
   Sausage that we just made.   

487
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:06,744
    Roasted red onion, mozz.    

488
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:09,546
             So very            
   Neapolitan-style-- minimal.  

489
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,415
     In the oven 750, 800--     

490
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,483
          two minutes.          

491
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:13,351
          Look at that.         

492
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:14,219
            Gorgeous.           

493
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,286
       Love all the char.       

494
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,487
         So we got this         
        garlic oil, here.       

495
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:19,424
       And then sea salt,       
         and here we go.        

496
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,559
     I don't know to eat it     
    or take a picture of it.    

497
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:22,994
        Beautiful crust.        

498
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:26,363
     Crust is the bomb, bro.    

499
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:27,698
       That little kick of      
        the ground wheat.       

500
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,969
  Sweet cheese and the acidity  
   on the fat of the sausage,   

501
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:35,506
       mixed with a little      
     bit of that, will char.    

502
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:36,507
     That's the money bite.     

503
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,510
        And each bite's a       
      little bit different.     

504
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:40,644
            Time out.           
           Thank you.           

505
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:41,845
           Thank you.           

506
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,448
      And Salsiccia pizza.      

507
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,483
     The wood fire brings a     
    nice flavor to the pizza.   

508
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,851
       The sausage of the       
       pizza is fantastic.      

509
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:50,455
The rich, fatty flavor-- it goes
 against the acid of the tomato 

510
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,257
       and the creaminess       
         of the cheese.         

511
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,457
        Ricotta gnocchi.        

512
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,259
        Never disappoints       
        to come in here.        

513
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:56,660
       It's just my spot.       

514
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:57,595
    You're making great food.   

515
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:58,863
        You're making it        
       very approachable.       

516
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,731
    This is the kind of thing   
  that people are looking for.  

517
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,935
You guys are going to love this.

518
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:06,470
  GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): Coming 
   up, a tiny spot in Ottawa,   

519
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,338
             Canada.            

520
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,472
   I'm in the service station.  

521
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,606
  Now I'm in the prep station.  

522
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,075
 I'm over in the delivery area. 

523
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,211
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
 Serving up big-time breakfast, 

524
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,478
       lunch, and brunch.       

525
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:15,280
          Look at that.         

526
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:19,684
         [music playing]        

527
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,852
       I'm here in Ottawa,      
        Canada in an area       

528
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,789
  known as Centertown to check  
 out a joint with a great story.

529
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,591
      So this guy starts as     
     a part-time line cook.     

530
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,861
       He eventually works      
       his way up to chef       

531
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,729
    and then buys the couple    
    out that owns the place.    

532
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:32,797
      Now, it is a small--      

533
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,334
     S-M-ALL-- joint, but I     
     hear the flavor is big.    

534
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,235
          This is Jax.          

535
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,206
      Compote's going down.     

536
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,675
   Taste is what matters, and   
   their food here is amazing.  

537
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,477
       Classy eggs Benny.       

538
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,413
   Homestyle brunch place that  
 kind of feels like your friends

539
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,415
           work here.           

540
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,417
         Ben's got tons         
        of unique dishes.       

541
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,617
         He takes things        
       to the next level.       

542
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:54,685
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
           'Cause Chef          

543
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,353
         Ben Breitler's         
     creativity hasn't been     

544
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,022
  cramped by his lack of space. 

545
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:58,622
         Wait a second.         

546
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,691
   I'm in the service station.  

547
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,425
  Now I'm in the prep station.  

548
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,493
 I'm over in the delivery area. 

549
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,695
 Yeah, it's tiny, but it works. 

550
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,363
         We try and get         
       everything locally       

551
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:07,698
    sourced-- cheese, meats.    

552
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:10,568
       Make all our bread       
   in-house-- little batches.   

553
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,436
         And we do a lot        
        of burgers here?        

554
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:12,637
             - Yeah.            
            - Where?            

555
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,505
     BEN BREITLER: We can do    
      one burger at a time.     

556
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:15,373
          Hurt my head.         

557
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,374
     You're hurting my head.    

558
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,708
      BEN BREITLER: Cheese      
      on the bison burgers.     

559
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:18,976
    The bison burger's great.   

560
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,644
      It comes with a thick     
      cut of peameal bacon      

561
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,447
       on top, some garlic      
   aioli, and a homemade bun.   

562
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:24,515
     Really unique flavors.     

563
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:25,316
         It's delicious.        

564
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:26,584
       What are we making?      

565
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,584
      The peameal that goes     
      on our bison burger.      

566
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:28,452
           The wha--?           

567
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,520
       Peameal pork loin.       

568
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,588
 So we got a boneless pork chop.

569
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,524
     And we brine it, slice     
      it up nice and thick,     

570
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:34,859
  and that's our peameal bacon. 

571
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:35,659
      What's peameal mean?      

572
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,395
        Ground-up yellow        
      peas to preserve it.      

573
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:38,396
         GUY FIERI: OK.         

574
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,598
      So now it's gone from     
     that to using cornmeal.    

575
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:41,933
     OK, so a simple brine.     

576
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:45,736
    Mustard seed, pink salt,    
   fresh sage, cinnamon stick,  

577
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,606
       bay leaves, kosher       
     salt, and peppercorns,     

578
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,674
   Quebec maple syrup, water.   

579
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,076
 So let this simmer 20 minutes. 

580
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,745
  BEN BREITLER: Strain and add  
 a cool brine to our pork loin. 

581
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,413
        How long is that        
       going to brine for?      

582
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,348
     BEN BREITLER: Two days.    
             - Wow.             

583
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,549
            Next up?            
           - Cornmeal.          

584
00:16:58,551 --> 00:16:59,683
  So this is a Canadian thing?  

585
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,419
        I think it might        
       be Canadian, yeah.       

586
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:02,553
        We're just going        
       to roll it in here.      

587
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,489
      I'll let that dry in      
      the fridge for a day.     

588
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:05,556
             Right.             
    BEN BREITLER: Freeze it.    

589
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,358
       Because it's easier      
    to slice when it's cold.    

590
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,359
            Next up?            

591
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:09,827
         Brioche bun for        
        the bison burger.       

592
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,962
   This is getting ridiculous.  

593
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:16,033
 BEN BREITLER: So we got water, 
 yeast, salt, sugar, and flour. 

594
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:17,568
     And we're going to add     
    the eggs and the butter.    

595
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:18,702
     Let it proof overnight.    

596
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,638
     BEN BREITLER: And then     
     roll it out into buns.     

597
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,508
     Add egg wash and sesame    
    seeds and bake them off.    

598
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,575
     Let's make the burger.     

599
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,578
     BEN BREITLER: So ground    
    bison, salt, and pepper.    

600
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,713
       Portion six ounce.       

601
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,447
   And it's going to go on the  
   monster flat-top over here?  

602
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:31,449
      BEN BREITLER: On the      
        monster flat-top.       

603
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:32,650
         GUY FIERI: OK.         

604
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,719
      Our slice of peameal      
      and our brioche bun.      

605
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:37,455
     And then it gets topped    
   with cheddar, two-year-old.  

606
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,589
      Peameal goes on top.      

607
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,325
       Caramelized onion,       
       garlic aioli, here.      

608
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,326
         Patty on there.        

609
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,462
      Greens, house pickle.     

610
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,395
      You made the pickle.      

611
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,263
       I made the pickle.       

612
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,331
    Of course, house pickle.    

613
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,166
          Look at that.         

614
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,269
            Oh, man.            

615
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:53,403
   The bison is nice and rich.  

616
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,206
         The cheddar has        
       got a sting to it.       

617
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,074
          I love that.          

618
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:59,544
         And the peameal        
       bacon is dynamite.       

619
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,212
Can definitely taste that brine.

620
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:03,748
       Great crumb to the       
     bun, delicious aioli--     

621
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,616
    bro, really good burger.    

622
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,485
    Plating the bison burger.   

623
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:08,552
       Tender, delicious.       

624
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:09,620
          Really juicy.         

625
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,222
       Take a look at it.       

626
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:11,556
          Oh, I had it.         

627
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:12,556
        I had the burger.       

628
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:13,690
        You're preaching        
       to the choir, dude.      

629
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:14,692
 MALE DINER: It's indescribable.

630
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,826
        Like the peameal        
       bacon, the cheese--      

631
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,761
        everything works        
      really well together.     

632
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,497
      I never heard to come     
     to Ottawa for the food.    

633
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:20,898
       This is absolutely       
         a destination.         

634
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:24,368
    And this, to me, is kind    
    of one of the landmarks.    

635
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,769
    Jerk chicken, table nine.   

636
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,638
       Everything you try,      
        it's really good.       

637
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,839
      What's your favorite      
       thing on the menu?       

638
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,708
     MALE DINER: I like the     
   banana bread French toast.   

639
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,643
          French toast          
      coming to your side.      

640
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,511
     The banana bread French    
       toast is fantastic.      

641
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:35,780
 It's sort of a brunch dessert. 

642
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,648
      And you get something     
       sweet-- some apple       

643
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:38,649
   compote, some maple syrup.   

644
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:39,650
   What are you gonna make me?  

645
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:41,718
  So this is the banana bread.  

646
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:42,920
        So we're going to       
       start with butter.       

647
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,788
       I'm doing this for       
     you, Ryder, by the way.    

648
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,658
    Ryder loves banana bread,   
   and he loves French toast.   

649
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,859
          Brown sugar.          

650
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,329
  We're just going to cream the 
   butter and the brown sugar.  

651
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,730
          Add the eggs.         

652
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,665
   Yogurt makes it not as dry.  

653
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,734
  Bananas and salt and vanilla. 

654
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,403
    Add the dry ingredients--   
       all-purpose flour,       

655
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,871
   baking powder, baking soda.  

656
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,473
    How many loaves of banana   
   bread will you make a day?   

657
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,541
              Five.             

658
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,744
     It's what I can fit in     
    the oven in the morning.    

659
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,945
        So we're going to       
       make apple compote.      

660
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:11,615
     I've got Granny Smith,     
   cinnamon, and brown sugar.   

661
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:12,883
 Just let that caramelize down. 

662
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,818
      But I still want the      
    apples to have a crunch.    

663
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:15,820
        And right at the        
        end, we're going        

664
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,355
 to add a tablespoon of butter. 

665
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:18,489
       GUY FIERI: Next we       
     make the French toast?     

666
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,290
              Yup.              

667
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,624
     We've got eggs, cream--    

668
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,626
       Keep going, buddy.       

669
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:27,565
 --cinnamon, nutmeg, some salt. 

670
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:30,834
      So it's not an overly     
       sweet banana bread.      

671
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:31,569
               No.              

672
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:32,637
 GUY FIERI: Good flavor, though.

673
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:33,571
   BEN BREITLER: Dredge that.   

674
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,939
    Throw it on the flat-top.   

675
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,442
       Cut it on the bias.      

676
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,578
And do our little plating, here.

677
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,113
       Apple compote that       
        we made earlier,        

678
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:47,051
   house whipped cream, Quebec  
 syrup, and some powdered sugar.

679
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,658
     You know it makes that     
      so good is the apple      

680
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,527
     still has crunch to it.    

681
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:57,395
         This has depth.        

682
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:58,462
         It has texture.        

683
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:01,799
   It has a variety of flavor.  

684
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:04,669
    The banana bread itself,    
  after it became French toast, 

685
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,603
   is 10 times better than it   
    was just as banana bread.   

686
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,072
           Delicious.           

687
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,541
   Whipped creaming the banana  
  bread French toast times two. 

688
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,342
            So good.            

689
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,409
       It's very decadent.      

690
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,745
   It's got that eat cake for   
     breakfast kind of feel.    

691
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,614
      Apple is a fantastic      
          touch on top.         

692
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,549
         Just brings the        
      whole thing together.     

693
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:19,717
         We often get it        
        as a third plate        

694
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,419
  to share between two people.  

695
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,553
     Ben Kamack, patio one.     

696
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,690
    I love this place because   
   the food's always so good.   

697
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:26,757
       GUY FIERI: Whatever      
         is driving you,        

698
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,826
       whatever makes the       
   machine go, is impressive.   

699
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,561
       The folks in Ottawa      
     are lucky to have you.     

700
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:31,562
         Nice job, chef.        
          - Thank you.          

701
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,230
        All right, Ryder.       
       I'll bring it home.      

702
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,298
        Quit texting me.        

703
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,234
   The phone keeps going off.   

704
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,969
So that's it for this edition of
 "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives."

705
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:39,903
      But don't you worry.      

706
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,838
      There's funky joints      
     all over this country.     

707
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,175
       And I'll be looking      
     for you next time on--     

708
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:47,511
            Triple D.           

709
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:49,579
     All the music that you     
     listen here in Jax is--    

710
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,649
      actually, he plays 19     
     different instruments.     

711
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:52,716
    I can play the saxophone.   

712
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:53,651
              See?              
           I knew it.           

713
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,119
         I don't sleep.         
      I play the saxophone.     

714
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:55,852
  GUY FIERI: I know you don't.  

715
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:59,357
       Cowbell would have       
        been impressive.
