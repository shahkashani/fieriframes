               BONELESS CHICKEN,
                GRAVY ALL OVER.

00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,504
         THE BBQ STEAK.         
              NEED A MAHI PLATE.

202
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:56,440
 <i> NOT YOUR STATESIDE STANDARDS</i>  
         <i> AND THIS...</i>           
         THE LOCO MOCO.         

203
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:59,644
 <i> AIN'T YOUR STATESIDE BURGER.</i>  
        IT IS DELICIOUS.        

204
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,046
   RICE AND HAMBURGER AND EGG   
       WITH GRAVY ON TOP.       

205
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,781
        GRAVY JUST MAKES        
       EVERYTHING BETTER.       

206
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,383
      LET'S GET                 
THE GRAVY TRAIN GOING           

207
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,585
    SO WE CAN GET               
THE LOCOMOTION GOING.           
                      ALL RIGHT.

208
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,387
          WE'RE GONNA GONNA MAKE
            SOME CHICKEN STOCK, 

209
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:11,723
              WHICH IS THE BASIS
                FOR OUR GRAVY.  
YOU MAKE YOUR OWN STOCK.        

210
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,325
                     ABSOLUTELY.
AT A DRIVE-IN.                  

211
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,792
                         YES.   

212
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,928
 WE START OFF WITH CHICKEN NECKS
        AND THIGH BONES.        

213
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,130
     SECRET INGREDIENT FOR US-- 
         IT'S DRIED SHRIMP.     

214
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,933
ONE OF THE FOUNDATIONAL ITEMS   
      IS DRIED SHRIMP?          
                            YES.

215
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,334
SHH.                            

216
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:24,669
                   FRESH GINGER.
OKAY.                           

217
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,070
                  DRIED SEAWEED.
LITTLE KOMBU?                   

218
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,739
                 KOMBU, EXACTLY.
                   THAT'S IT.   

219
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,941
OKAY.                           
          AND THEN WE ADD WATER,
            BRING IT TO A BOIL. 

220
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,543
NO BROWNING OF THE BONES...     
                             NO.

221
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,545
NO ADDING VEGETABLES.           
                 ABSOLUTELY NOT.

222
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,147
HOW LONG IS THIS GONNA SIMMER?  
       TWO OR THREE HOURS,      
 AND THEN WE'RE GONNA STRAIN IT,

223
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,749
      AND USE IT FOR OUR GRAVY. 

224
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,285
                 WE START OFF   
              WITH TOMATO PURéE.
FOR THE GRAVY?                  

225
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,886
                 FOR OUR GRAVY. 

226
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:44,022
       NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD      
 SOME CRUSHED GARLIC, SOME SALT.

227
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,625
TOMATO PURéE?                   
           WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE,
             CARAMEL COLORING.  

228
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,427
TOMATO PURéE?                   
             MORE SECRET SPICES.

229
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:51,830
HANG ON. I WANT TO SEE THIS.    
       CHILI POWDER.            
                            YES.

230
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,832
    GRANULATED ONION.           
GRANULATED GARLIC. SUGAR?       
                            YES.

231
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:57,235
 I'M NOT GONNA SAY              
ANY MORE AFTER THAT.            
                        (laughs)

232
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,571
GOT TO KEEP THE INTEGRITY.      
 THIS IS A SECRET RECIPE.       
                   THAT'S RIGHT.

233
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,974
            THEN WE'RE GONNA ADD
             OUR CHICKEN STOCK. 
THIS IS NUTS.                   

234
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,443
AND THIS IS THE GRAVY THAT      
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN SERVING?     
              THIS IS THE GRAVY.

235
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,712
HOW MANY GALLONS OF THIS        
DO YOU GUYS MAKE A WEEK?        

236
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,715
       250, 300 GALLONS A WEEK  
     PROBABLY, EASILY, I'M SURE.

237
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,984
    GRAVY'S REALLY POPULAR HERE.
YOU'RE BRINGING THIS            
    TO A BOIL,                  

238
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,387
 AND THEN YOU HIT IT            
WITH THE FLOUR FLURRY.          
             YES. THICKEN IT UP.

239
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,723
      SIMMER IT A LITTLE BIT.   
   AND THEN IT'S READY TO SERVE.
LET'S MAKE SOME LOCO MOCO.      

240
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,659
        WE'RE GONNA START OFF   
     WITH TWO HAMBURGER PATTIES.

241
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,794
                     RIGHT HERE.
 IS THERE ONION                 
ALREADY IN THAT?                

242

                            YES.
I LIKE IT.                      

243
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,064
         WE'RE JUST GONNA LAY IT
               RIGHT HERE.      

244
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,265
        I'M GONNA PUT SOME GRAVY
                ON THAT.        
WITH THE TOMATO PASTE.          

245
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,868
       TRADITIONALLY YOU PUT    
  A LITTLE BIT ON THE RICE ALSO.
       OH, YEAH.                
OH, YEAH. TALK IT, DADDY.       

246
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,803
         THEN THE EGGS GO HERE. 

247
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,739
   AND THAT'S A LOCO MOCO PLATE.
OKAY.

                      THANK YOU.

LITTLE BIT OF ONION IN THERE.   

252
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:44,482
I THINK IF PEOPLE LOOK AT IT    
          AND SAY,              

253
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,551
"I'VE HEARD OF LOCO MOCO.       
     I DON'T KNOW."

WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME?          
           THE GRAVY            
      IS TO DIE FOR. MMM.

<i>IT'S CLASSIC HAWAIIAN FAST FOOD</i> 

260

269
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,722

278
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,543
         A LOT OF PLACES        
     TRY TO DUPLICATE THIS,     

279
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,680
      BUT IT JUST DOESN'T

          FRESH AND DEHYDRATED. 

288
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,563
      AND THEN WE'RE GONNA BRING
            THIS TO A BOIL.     

289
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,366

           WE CONTINUE TO DO IT.

308
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,407

491
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,985
   AND THEN THIS IS JUST GARLIC 
      PURéED WITH OLIVE OIL.    

492
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,253
    SO WE MIX THIS REALLY WELL. 

493
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,456
               WE'RE GONNA ADD  
            THE STARTER CULTURE.
AND THE STARTER CULTURE         
       IS FOR...                

494
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:46,924
  THERE'S A FERMENTATION STAGE, 

495
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,660
       WHICH IS GONNA TAKE ABOUT
          TWO TO THREE DAYS...  
OKAY.                           

496
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,797
  AND WHAT THAT DOES IS IT EATS 
 THE SUGARS THAT WE PUT IN THERE

497
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,731
     AND IT CREATES LACTIC ACID,
        AND THAT LACTIC ACID    

498
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,268
              WILL LOWER THE pH.
  DUDE, THESE ARE ALL           
PRESERVATION METHODS...         

499
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:58,802
                            YEP.
AND NOT TASTE METHODS.          

500
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:00,804
       BUT ODDLY ENOUGH, THESE  
    ARE ALL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS

501
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,339
          TO THE FLAVOR PROFILE.
OKAY.                           

502
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,608
       NOW WE PACK IT INTO THIS 
        SAUSAGE CYLINDER HERE.  

503
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,612
           LET'S PUT IT UP HERE,
               CRANK IT DOWN.   
THAT'S AWESOME.                 

504
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:10,814
THESE ARE BEEF INTESTINES.      
    AND DO THEY HAVE A POROSITY,
            OR A BREATHE?       

505
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:12,617
  THEY DEFINITELY DO,           
AND DURING THE PROCESS          

506
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:15,219
WHEN IT'S IN THE DRYING ROOM,   
THAT BECOMES REALLY IMPORTANT,  

507
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,754
 BECAUSE IT ALLOWS              
MOISTURE TO ESCAPE.             

508
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,289
   JUST GONNA CUT IT,           
TWIST IT INTO LINKS HERE,       

509
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,426
SO IT DOESN'T COME APART.       
     IT'S GONNA HANG FROM THERE.

510
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,295
AND AT THIS POINT,              
WE TAKE A WEIGHT.               

511
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,297
               HOW MUCH WEIGHT  
             WILL HAVE BEEN LOST

512
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,232
              BEFORE YOU DECLARE
                THAT IT'S DONE? 

513
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:30,701
MOST TIMES PEOPLE WILL PULL     
IT OUT WHEN IT'S 25% OR 30%,    

514
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,637
        BUT I THINK 40%,        
 FOR MY TASTE BUDS, IS PERFECT. 

515
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,639
SO NOW WE'RE GONNA DIP THEM     
 IN A PENICILLIN SOLUTION.      

516
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,908
 IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE PENICILLIN
 ON THE OUTSIDE OF BRIE CHEESE. 

517
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:38,910
IT KEEPS THE OUTSIDE            
    OF THE SALAMI               

518
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,845
MOIST IN THE DRYING PROCESS.    
                THIS IS AWESOME.

519
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,046
WE'RE GONNA PUT IT IN OUR       
  FERMENTATION CABINET,         

520
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:46,517
AND THAT'S GONNA LOWER THE pH   
OVER THIS 2- TO 3-DAY PERIOD.   

521
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,518
                           WHOA.
  AS YOU CAN SEE,               
THAT MOLD HAS GROWN,            

522
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,520
AND YOU CAN SMELL               
THE LACTIC ACID.                

523
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:52,522
 PULL THESE OUT OF HERE AND TAKE
    'EM INTO OUR CURING ROOM.   

524
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,992
NOW THEY'RE GONNA DRY           
   ABOUT 30 DAYS.               

525
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:58,062
                    OH, MY GOSH!
SO NOW WE'RE GONNA              
  HANG THESE UP.                

526
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:01,065
                THIS IS SO COOL.
ONCE WE GET CLOSE               
   TO 30 DAYS,                  

527
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,068
   WE'LL BEGIN TO WEIGH THEM--  
 THAT'S WHERE THE 40% COMES IN--

528
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,604
AND THEN THEY'LL BE READY       
         TO EAT.                
                        LOVE IT.

529
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,939
 THROW THIS UP ON THE SCALE     
JUST TO MAKE SURE IT'S READY.   

530
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:11,142
AND YOU WANT TO SLICE THIS      
       REALLY THIN,             

531
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:13,144
    SO IT ALMOST                
MELTS ON YOUR TONGUE.           

532
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:15,412
(laughs)                        
                           WHAT?

533
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,481
       THE FENNEL--RIGHT THERE. 

534
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:19,483
             NICE INCORPORATION,
                  GOOD FAT.     

535
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,485
                I LOVE THAT     
           LITTLE TINGE OF MOLD.

536
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,420
       I MEAN, THAT COULDN'T BE,
        SERIOUSLY, ANY BETTER.  

537
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:24,888
AWESOME.                        
                         REALLY.

538
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,890
THAT MEANS A LOT,               
COMING FROM YOU.                
                       OH, DUDE.

539
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,960
        SALAMINI BASKET!        
                   UNBELIEVABLE.

540
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,962
                     IT MELTS   
                  IN YOUR MOUTH.
REALLY, THE ONLY PLACE          
        I GO.                   

541
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:34,098
      TWO PASTRAMI MOMMYS.      

542
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,500
       IT'S VERY ORIGINAL,      
  AND EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS.  

543
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:38,102
                        AWESOME.
   COOL, HOPE                   
TO SEE YOU BACK.                

544
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:39,837
              DUDE, NO QUESTION,
                 I'LL BE BACK.  

545
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,839
   SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP,  
        BUT DON'T WORRY,        

546
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:44,308
   THERE'S PLENTY MORE JOINTS   
     ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY.     

547
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:46,310
         I'LL BE LOOKING        
        FOR YOU NEXT TIME       

548
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:48,312
               ON               
 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES." 

549
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:51,349
            (humming)           

550
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,787
              HEY!              

551
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,289
            (humming)
