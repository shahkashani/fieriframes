00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,201
           Hey, there.          

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,669
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:07,139
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

4
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:08,340
          This trip...          

5
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,508
What's that over there?         

6
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:12,310
These are delicious.            

7
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:15,948
        It's buns, beef,        
      and one funky burger.     

8
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,615
  I want my mommy.              

9
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:20,085
     We've got a charcuterie    
     smorgasbord in Denver.     

10
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:21,619
   I want to tour               
    the showroom.               

11
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,954
I want to test drive            
     everything.                

12
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,224
    A worldwide web of flavor   
            in Utah.            

13
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:26,758
    That is good.               

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,360
    And in Juneau, Alaska...    

15
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,360
             You're rocking it, 
                    Bro.        

16
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,963
   ...a chef taking a "bao"...  

17
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:32,364
                Benny's with    
               the bun police.  

18
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,165
         He doesn't carry a gun,
                 just a bun.    

19
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,834
  ...in a tiny little trailer.  

20
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,969
              I mean, Brother,  
            this is outstanding.

21
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,704
     That's all right here,     
           right now,

   I'm here in Juneau, Alaska,  
     right across the street    

26
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,856
  from where all the big cruise 
         ships come in,         

27
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:59,191
     and great news, folks,     

28
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,493
   I have got a special guest.  
    No, it's not an actress,    

29
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,328
     it's not a sports star,    
     it's not a politician.     

30
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,663
 No, it's somebody that's really
       big here in Alaska,      

31
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,132

     Benny Lin from Pagoda.     

35
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,073
  All right, Chef,              
do you like bao buns?           

36
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,741
          Yes, I do. You want me
              to make you some? 

37
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,809
            I can make you some.

38
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:18,944
     No, Benny,                 
we've already done that.        

39
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,679
You've been on the show.        
You're a guest this time.       

40
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,347
We're going to go check out     
a dude that's making great buns.

41
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,016
 This is Bun Daddy.             

42
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,419
    Full Boar coming up next.   

43
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,155
  Bun Daddy has a unique flavor 
           in Juneau.           

44
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:34,893
 I would describe it as a street
 taco mated with a steamed bun, 

45
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,828
  and they created some magic.  

46
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,899
             FIERI:             
All conjured up in a 1968 camper
    by husband and wife team,   

47
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,902
          Laura Steele          
        and Max Goldrich.       

48
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,304
             Where did you learn
              to cook? Just...  

49
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:47,706
    Self-taught.                
 I loved steam buns             

50
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,576
and I couldn't get the ones here
that I wanted to eat.           

51
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:52,243
               It ain't no fun  
       unless you got buns, hun?

52
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,312
      Exactly.                  

53
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:55,247
   The buns are really fluffy   
         and delicious.         

54
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:57,048
      Almost like a cotton      
         candy of bread.        

55
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,251
   We got a Belly of the Beast  
         bun coming up.         

56
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,587
Belly of the Beast is kinda like
     a bacon lover's dream.     

57
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:03,721
  A little bit of veg on there, 
       the sriracha sauce.      

58
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,457
       Unicorn pork buns.       

59
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,858
               So, let's make   
                  the buns.     

60
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,127
            GOLDRICH:           
    We're going to start out    
      with the water here,      

61
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,530
      we've got sugar next,     
  and then we'll add the yeast, 

62
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:14,866
       oil, baking powder,      
     and all-purpose flour.     

63
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,602
         -No eggs, huh?         
              -No.              

64
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:17,869
                 Make notes.    

65
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,804
      So you make all these buns
         in this little trailer?

66
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,139
By scratch every day.           

67
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,741
  Cruise ships run              
  May to September.             

68
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,010
     That's when we're open.    
   -What do you do after that?  

69
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,479
Go to the Legislature           
and work there for a little bit.

70
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,347
                Go from Buns    
               to Legislature?  

71
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,283
             -Yeah.             
  -All right, after it's done?  

72
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:34,018
Proof for about an hour         
or so until it doubles.         

73
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,486
          Portion that.         
        -How many ounces?       

74
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,222
           -2 ounces.           
        -Pretty spot-on.        

75
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,423
  And I roll them.              

76
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,891
             So, you're turning 
            it inside to itself?

77
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,960
   Yeah. Let those              
    proof again,                

78
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,163
    roll it out,                
do a drop of oil on it.         

79
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:46,665
  Fold it in half.              
Throw it in on the steamer.     

80
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,167
       -How long is it go?      
       -10 to 12 minutes.       

81
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,502
        Really impressed.       

82
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,704
    Benny's with the bun police.
             Benny is a bun cop.

83
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,640
         He doesn't carry a gun,
                 just a bun.    

84
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:57,843
             FIERI:             
 Filmed on location with the men
    and women of Flavortown.    

85
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,311
All right, we're going          
to do the pork belly.           

86
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:02,046
   For the glaze,               
first, we will add the sriracha,

87
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,183
rice vinegar, hoisin, and honey.
        -Oh, that's nice.       

88
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:06,685
 Pour some in here.             
    Seal that up.               

89
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,056
Go into the sous-vide           
  for seven hours.              

90
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,458
        176.                    

91
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,793
           Well, I do it at 178.

92
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,194
         Benny, what temperature
                you do it at?   

93
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,195
              -179.             
              -Ooh.             

94
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,464
           -Yeah, see.          
      -Pork belly is done.      

95
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,601
I reserve this extra liquid     
as a sauce to put on top.       

96
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:25,403
Slice up the pork belly,        
hit it with the glaze,          

97
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,339
and throw it in the oven        
for just a couple minutes.      

98
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,808
           -Oh, okay.           
  -Let it get all tacky on it.  

99
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,277
      Tacky not like the outfits
    you wore in Vegas last year.

100
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,946
          See Benny, watch this.

101
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,548
                 Wow, that's    
              got great flavor. 

102
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,417
           -I like it.          
    -Steamed buns, big fatty.   

103
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,485
            Cucumber.           

104
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:42,887
 Green onion, hit it            
   with the sauce,              

105
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,557
and then a little sprinkling    
  of sesame seeds.              

106
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,759
             Here you go Benny. 
             Let's take a bite. 

107
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,062
              Wow.              

108
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,098
             I told him you were
               the bun police.  

109
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,232
              Now, you're going 
            to steal the recipe?

110
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,435
        -Yeah. [ Laughs ]       
     -I think it's dynamite.    

111
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:58,970
           The pork belly itself
                 is spot-on.    

112
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,238
                  It's not

           -Overnight.          
 -And we're going to fry these? 

143
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:59,631
No, we will grill them out      
on the barbecue outside.

So, we're making pickled        
 daikon and carrot.             

146
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:07,239
We'll start with rice vinegar,  
water, sugar, chili flake.      

147
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,907
            I like spicy, I just
       don't think I've ever had

148

   my pickled daikon and carrots
    with that kind of intensity.

149
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,578
I'll put a couple ice cubes     
      into it.                  

150
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,047
       Just so it's not going to
          sit there and cook it.

151
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:20,185
The daikon and rainbow carrots. 
Pour this over the top.         

152
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:23,455
Put it in the refrigerator      
to pickle overnight.            

153

   Oh, yeah.

      noises like Mmm, mmm, mmm.

               That's my line,  
                   Benny.       

167

       Wow, this is good.

                is dynamite.    

169
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,752
   The marinade on the chicken's
              really dynamite.  

170
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,088
                The fact that   
   you're grilling it, home run.

171
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,359
        The kicker is that super
           unctuous creamy Mayo.

172
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:01,959

 the refreshing kick of the acid

174
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,830
 from the daikon and the carrot.
             -Yeah.             

175
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,566

              it's outstanding.

178
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:14,305
    The meat has a little bit   
      of crispiness on it,      

179
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,707

         all the sauces,        

181
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,377
      it just kind of soaks     
       right into the bun.      

182
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,246

        that serves these       
     incredible sandwiches.     

225
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,438
               Hoggie sandwich  
       with an applesauce is up.

226
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,640
  I love The Hoggie. That's one 
        of my favorites.        

227
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:59,444
 The soppressata, the capicola, 
 and then the ham is fantastic. 

228
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:01,913
   Great combination of smoke   
            and spice           

229
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,015
   that then gets rounded out   
          by the aioli.         

230
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,450
                We're making    
            The Hoggie sandwich.

231
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,519
   -This is your style of ham?  
   -This is our style of ham.   

232
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,853
 What muscle is this            
    that we have?               

233
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,256
          So, we could call this
        the inside round muscle.

234
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:13,524
Do we want to call it that or   
are we just going to make it up?

235
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,860
       -No, it's called --      
     -Let's call this the...    

236
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:15,927
              Let's call it the 
                inside round.   

237
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:17,261
...the pig one muscle.          

238
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,329
             No. Make the brine.

239
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,600
             Salt, brown sugar, 
                maple syrup.    

240
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,067
    Pour some...                

241
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,336
             Liquid sugar on me?

242
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:28,206
     Some coriander seed, clove,
              lot of allspice,  

243
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,674
            toasted fennel seed,

244
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,878
         mustard seed, bay leaf,
           celery powder, water.

245
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,146
           Bring it up to a boil

246
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:38,349
              and let it simmer 
              for 5, 7 minutes. 

247
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,884
And then once it's cooled       
 and it's strained,             

248
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:40,886
    you can start               
   the injection?               

249
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,086
                 Absolutely.    

250
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,688
            You get a little bit
         of that liquid in here.

251
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,289
And we'll let this set up       
    for how long                

252
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,358
   before we start              
     to cook it?                

253
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,226
                  10 days.      
                  Tie it...     

254
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:50,028
           -Smoke it.           
    -...smoke it on hickory.    

255
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,296
       Dig it.                  

256
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,564
         All right, Soppressata.

257
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,232
                First we have   
             to mix our spices. 

258
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,034
             Dextrose, which is 
                a pine sugar,   

259
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,570
             Sicilian Sea Salt, 
             Calabrian Chilies, 

260
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:02,239
         and Italian hot pepper,
         sweet Calabrian powder,

261
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,375
            toasted fennel seed,
               garlic powder,   

262
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,778
  black pepper, celery powder.  
            -Got it.            

263
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,514
        So ground pork shoulder,
add our frozen pork fat to that.

264
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,251
               Season this up.  
             Add some red wine. 

265
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,987
          Soppressata going into
            our sown hog casing.

266
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:19,324
      Tie up the end real quick,
 and do lots of loops and knots.

267
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,992
 We're going to loop            
and knot this for the rest      

268
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,194
of the week, Captain,           
or we making a quilt?           

269
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:26,064
          So in the fermentation
     chamber for about 48 hours,

270
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,732
                and then into   
              our drying room,  

271
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:31,136
  which sits at about 60 degrees
             for about 10 weeks.

272
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,536
 Should I just start            
  eating it now...              
                      Not yet.  

273
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:33,538
 ...or wait till it             
 goes on a sandwich?            

274
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,339
                  Not yet.      
      We've got our Soppressata.

275
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,408
   Now what's that              
     over there?                

276
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:38,876
These are delicious.            

277
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,011
  Keep going before             
  I eat everything              

278
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,479
      that goes                 
  on the sandwich.              

279
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,948
I'm going to show you the inside
    of this capicola real quick.

280
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,349
What do we rub that in?         

281
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,486
   Fennel seed, Calabrian Chili,
         a little garlic pepper.

282
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:49,487
     Delicious.                 

283
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,022
             Slice this ciabatta
                right in half   

284
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,757
             and get it toasting
              on the flat top.  

285
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,092
                Garlic aioli.   

286
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,361
      Layer these meats on here,
  so we've got our Berkeley Ham.

287
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:58,096
  Layer these meats             
    in my mouth.                

288
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,631
          Oh, that ham.         
       -It's good, right?       

289
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:02,634
No, this is not good.           
There's not even close to good. 

290
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:05,303
    Good's here.                
This is where your ham is.      

291
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,705
Like skyscraper ham.            

292
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:10,041
     We've got our capicola, our
   Soppressata, pickled peppers.

293
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,243
 If you made those,             
I'm going to just kick you.     

294
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,511
                   We make      
            the pickled peppers.

295
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:14,646
  Of course we do,              
we make the peppers.            

296
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:15,913
                  Tomatoes.     

297
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,916
We also milled this wood,       
and he hand-carved this.        

298
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,786
   Baby romaine that are dressed
    with a red wine vinaigrette.

299
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,590
                     ♪♪         

300
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:28,126
Putting that delicious salumi   
inside of the bread,            

301
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,395
is kind of like putting         
the '68 with a car cover.       

302
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,999
You're hiding all the beauty.   
Except that bread is spot-on.   

303
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,668
     Little acid                
from the baby romaine,          

304
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,804
    the tomatoes,               
and the pickled peppers.        

305
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,140
 That's a definition            
of an Italian deli sandwich.    

306
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,008
       Oh, oh.                  

307
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,144
   Got a Hoggie and applesauce  
         for you, ma'am.        

308
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,346
      The ham has a really      
       great smoke on it.       

309
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,281
            Capicola            
        is just amazing.        

310
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,482
       Brings a little bit      
         of spice to it.        

311
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,417
    You're not going to find    
  a better sandwich in Denver.  

312
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,687
  Anything else you'd recommend 
   for a charcuterie platter?   

313
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,555
FIERI: You have retail.         
People can buy it to-go.        

314
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,357
             We do fresh butcher
                    cuts.       

315
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,625
How many different types        
   of charcuterie?              

316
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:01,760
                   40, 50.      

317
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,094
              -No.              
           -For real.           

318
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,430
I want to tour the showroom.    
I want to test drive everything.

319
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,032
              We're going to do 
   the roast beef sandwich next.

320
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,566
 There is a roast beef for you. 

321
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:11,102
          Super tender,         
        super moist meat.       

322
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:14,038
  I get a craving for this, and 
 I'm in my car, on my way here. 

323
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,507
Bringing the knuckles.          
See you in a minute....         

324
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,076
I can't hang out with him       
      anymore.                  

325
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,811
I'm going to go to jail.        

326
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:24,148
I'm going to end up being       
in trouble in this town.        

327
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,616
    Welcome back.               
Triple D hanging out            

328
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,285
at Il Porcellino Salumi.        
        Huh?                    

329
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,653
     -Did I get that right?     
            -Got it.            

330
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,821
  Denver, Colorado.             
Bill is crushing it.            

331
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,090
    He makes over               
45 different salumis.           

332
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,227
House cures, brines,            
dry ages, you name it.          

333
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,962
    On and on...                
  Way overachiever.             

334
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,365
     The attention to detail    
    they put into the meats,    

335
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,168
 knowing how it's going to come 
out in a sandwich is incredible.

336
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,036
  I'm trying to get everything  
     on the menu right now,     

337
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,370
        but I really love       
         the roast beef.        

338
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,772
   Roast beef sandwich is up.   

339
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,108
    It's a good blend between   
  the meat and the horseradish  

340
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,509
     and the melted cheddar.    

341
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,845
      The arugula gives it      
          a fresh pop.          

342
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:56,781
 The jam is that sweetness that 
 kind of brings it all together.

343
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,516
            So we're going to do
   the roast beef sandwich next.

344
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,918
        We use inside top round.
                We brine it.    

345
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,319
       Got it.                  

346
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:06,724
 So salt, fresh thyme, bay leaf,
             peppercorns, water.

347
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,992
          Bring it up to a boil.

348
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,794
                Cool it down.   
         Then we brine the beef.

349
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,662
And then when we come out,      
  what's the roast?             

350
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,331
       We actually sous-vide it,
 so cook it in a hot water bath,

351
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,933
                 110 degrees    
               for four hours.  

352
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,269
  Hi, have you met              
my friend Overachiever?         

353
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:21,072
        We rub it in beef tallow
              and black pepper, 

354
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,407
and it's going to go in the oven
            for about 20 minutes

355
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,076
               at 350 degrees.  

356
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,211
What else are we going          
  to serve on this?             

357
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,545
           -Onion jam.          
             -Cool.             

358
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,681
            So, we got a hot pan
               with some oil.   

359
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:32,416
  Add our onions, a little salt,
              a little pepper,  

360
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,353
         and let them caramelize
        for three to four hours.

361
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,155
                And get those   
        into the food processor.

362
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:39,557
    Fresh thyme and a little bit
         of that sherry vinegar.

  Oh, just a touch?

367
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,967
       and we'll let that simmer
      and kind of come together.

368
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,235
Simmer down now. All right.     
 What's on the menu?

     -Apple Cider Gastrique.

370
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,638
      We make our own applesauce
                 here, too,     

371
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,041
            so we keep the cores
  and the peels from the apples.

372
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,977
       Locally made apple cider,
            apple cider vinegar,

373
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,445

375

  Strain it out, thicken it with
    a little bit of xanthan gum.

376
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,784
   Can we finally               
 have the sandwich?             

377
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,118
                   We can       
             have the sandwich. 

378

00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,434
    Maybe it just               
 took me some time.             

560
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,202
Hey, Triple XXX team,           
   I'll come back.              

561
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,537
I'll try the burger again,      
     all right?                 

562
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,073
  Peanut Butter in two minutes. 

563
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,741
      It's interesting how      
       the hamburger works      

564
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:11,875
     with the peanut butter.    

565
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,011
I love the sweet and the savory.

566
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,480
       The chips are good.      
   I like how crispy they are.  

567
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:17,748
       Torta de Pierna up.      

568
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,549
WOMAN: You want something hearty
         and comforting,        

569
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,884
  and this is the place to go.  

570
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,019
       FIERI:                   
Everybody that comes            
    here digs it?               

571
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,553
  It's the jewel of our valley. 

572
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,156
     -"Jewel of our valley"?    
             -Yeah.             

573
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:26,290
  I don't even know             
  how to take that.             

574
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,559
   This is a unique restaurant  
           for Logan.           

575
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,494
When you're doing an            
international flair restaurant  

576
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,430
with all different kind of      
flavors from around the world,  

577
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,830
you better make it unique.      

578
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,300
 That is delicious.             
     Well done.                 

579
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,237
  So that's it for this edition 
of "Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives."

584
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:52,049
              Whoa.             

585
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,850
         There's this weird hand
     sticking through the thing.

586
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,152
               Hello. Bye-bye.
