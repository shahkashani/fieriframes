I GOT A FUEGO ON 25.            

178
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,702
       ALL THE SANDWICHES       
        ARE JUST AMAZING.       
    (woman)                     
IT'S DELICIOUS.                 

179
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:21,172
    HE KNOWS                    
WHAT HE'S DOING.                
  <i> 'CAUSE JOHN ATKINSON'S BEEN</i>  
 <i> AT IT FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS.</i>

           I QUIT THE RESTAURANT
           BUSINESS FOR A WHILE,

182
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,446
        JUMP ON A PLANE TO ROME,

183
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:30,448
               AND THAT WAS IT--
                    ITALY.      
AND THAT'S HOW                  
  IT STARTED?                   

184
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:33,585
          THAT'S HOW IT STARTED.
       <i> WHEN HE CAME BACK,</i>      
    <i> HE OPENED HIS OWN JOINT</i>

                FRESH STUFF     

194
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,805
    THERE'S A CERTAIN ELASTICITY
    TO IT WHEN YOU BITE INTO IT.
A TRUE PASTA.                   

195
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,075

00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:44,649
   THIS IS WHAT                 
I'M TALKING ABOUT.              

360
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,117

                 OKAY. AND IT IS
                GOING TO REDUCE.

OKAY. DOUBLE PLASTIC,           
  DOUBLE TIN FOIL--

00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,283
SMELL THE AROMA.                
               THAT'S NUTS, MAN.

375
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,952
        LOOK AT THE SAUCE, HOSS.
THERE YOU GO--                  
NICE AND JUICY.

00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,628
          A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT, 
        A LITTLE BIT OF VINEGAR.

380
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,630
          YOU GET A LITTLE BIT  
         OF THAT BITE IN THERE. 

381
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,699
   SEE HOW THE SAUCE IS COOKED  
 ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO THE CHOP.

382
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,300
  THIS IS THE OLD-SCHOOL STYLE  

383
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,102
       AND PROBABLY THE WAY YOUR

                HOW DO WE PUT IT
                    TOGETHER?   
  FIRST YOU PUT

00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,158
 THEN YOU PUT THE ONION POWDER,

410
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,094

THAT'S WHAT REALLY MAKES        
   A GOOD STOCK GRAVY.          
                         DIG IT.

417

START IT OFF ON THE GRILL.      

467
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,593
WE MARK IT REAL GOOD.

468
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,662

                  ARE WE MAKING?

470
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,600
WE'RE MAKING A, UH,             
  HOMEMADE SAUCE                

471
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:58,736
CALLED A MAHOGANY SAUCE.        
                I GOTTA SEE     
          THE GRAPE JELLY THING.

472
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,338
   FIRST THING WE DO            
IS ADD BUTTER, ONIONS.          

473
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,473
THEN YOU ADD THE BACON.         
             WE'LL NEED THAT FAT
                IN THE SAUCE.   

474
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,809
      WE'RE GONNA LEAVE THE FAT 
      IN THE SAUCE SO IT STICKS 

475
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,945
                TO YOUR RIBS.   
             WE ADD THE KETCHUP.

476
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:09,814
                  THEN YOU ADD  
                THE GRAPE JELLY.
KETCHUP, GRAPE JELLY.           

477
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,749
                            YES.
THAT JUST DOESN'T               
   LOOK RIGHT.                  

478
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:16,153
       OH, IT'S WONDERFUL, DUDE.
             LIQUID SMOKE.      
   GRAPE JELLY                  
AND LIQUID SMOKE.               

479
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:19,557
NOW HOW LONG WILL WE            
   LET IT SIMMER?               
            ABOUT 40 MINUTES.   
        JUST LET IT REDUCE DOWN.

480
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,626
 OKAY, SO WE'RE                 
COOKED DOWN HERE.               

481
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,095
YOU'RE SURE THAT THIS ISN'T     
 PLAYING SOME GAME ON ME.       

482
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:27,298
       IT REMINDS ME            
OF SWEDISH MEATBALL SAUCE.      

483
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,366
           I ACTUALLY USE IT    
       AT WEDDINGS ON MEATBALLS.

484
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:31,903
                           YEAH.
I WAS AT THAT WEDDING.          

485
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:35,105
WHAT DO WE GOT GOING NOW?       
             TAKE THE TRI-TIP,  
          WE SLICE IT REAL THIN.

486
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:38,642
    START IT ON THE FLATTOP,    
 THEN WE WANT TO ADD THE ONIONS.

487
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,644
 YOU SEE WHERE THE MEAT STARTS  
CARAMELIZING. WE TURN IT OVER.  

488
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,646
  AND THEN WE THROW IT          
INTO OUR MAHOGANY SAUCE.        

489
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:45,916
    STIR IT UP IN THERE.        
GET IT NICE AND SOAKING WET.    

490
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,918
AND WE LAY IT OUT               
ON THE SANDWICH.                

491
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:49,921
      LOOK AT THE COLOR ON THE--
             THAT'S CRAZY.      

492

CARAMELIZED ONIONS.             
            TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.

493
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:56,593
A MEAL MADE FOR A KING.         
                  MMM. THAT IS  
                A GOOD SANDWICH.

494
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,395
     THAT MAHOGANY SAUCE, THAT'S
       WEIRD, BUT WEIRD GOOD.   

495
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,264
            YOU WANT TO GO,     
       "OH, IT'S BARBECUE SAUCE.

496
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,266
        NO, NO, NO, IT'S        
 SWEET-AND-SOUR SAUCE--NO, NO." 

497
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,068
                YOU DON'T KNOW  
               WHAT SAUCE IT IS.

498
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,003
        THE TRI-TIP, BY THE WAY,
             IS MEGA TENDER.    

499
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,005
 I LIKE THIS LITTLE THING YOU DO

                 TO THE FLATTOP,

501
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,609

               PUT A NICE LITTLE
                 CRUST ON IT.   
IT'S INTENSE CARAMELIZATION     
      IS WHAT IT IS.

        IT'S VERY TENDER.       
        IT'S VERY JUICY.
