1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,067
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,535
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:06,471
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives. 

4
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:07,873
          This trip...          
                        Boo-hoo.

5
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,742
       ...we're channeling      
     our inner carnivore...     

6
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:11,609
             I can already tell 
        I'm not gonna love this.

7
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,344
          ...with some          
        mega-meaty meals.       

8
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,748
    Don't put it on bread, dude.
             Just give it to me.

9
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,683
      Like a finger-licking     
       Louisville joint...      

10
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:20,585
                 That's no joke.
         ...winning big         
      with their barbecue.      

11
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,621
            That is championship
                right there.    

12
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,556
         And a Hamilton,        
       New Jersey, café...      

13
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:26,358
 A lot going on here            
in a little kitchen.            

14
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,293
          ...serving up         
      sizzling sandwiches.      

15
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,828
  I got to come to              
New Jersey more often.          

16
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,030
      And a funky butchery      
     in Portland, Oregon...     

17
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,299
          It's really fantastic.
        It's, like, stupid good.

18
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:36,868
        ...where everyday       
       is pork-a-palooza.       

19
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,238
    Ridiculous. Don't come here.
              You won't leave.  

20
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,573
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

21
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:44,143
      on "Diners, Drive-ins     
            & Dives."           

22
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,724
           So I'm here          
      in Portland, Oregon,      

23
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,659
      just about 20 minutes     
     from the downtown area.    

24
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,928
  And I don't know what it is,  
   but every time I come here,  

25
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,863
    I either find a real-deal   
          butcher shop          

26
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,264
  or an amazing sandwich joint. 

27
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,400
    So I'm not too surprised    
   when I find both together.   

28
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,268
       And these folks are      
      all about the swine.      

29
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,205
    This is Tails & Trotters.   

30
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:14,739
                 Pulled pork    
               just went out.   

31
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,276
         It's wonderful.        
    I can't stop coming here.   

32
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:18,877
 WOMAN: Here we are.            
We've got your Reuben.          

33
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,745
     There's nothing like it    
      anywhere in Portland.     

34
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,414
    Smoked chop.                

35
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,417
          What they do,         
  what they produce is special. 

36
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,286
       FIERI: All stemming      
   from farmer-turned-butcher   

37
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:29,287
       Aaron Silverman...       
So I've got a Cubano            
   coming up.                   

38
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,157
  ...whose passion for the pig  
   led him to open a meat shop  

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,559
           that's 100%          
      smorgasbord of pork.      

40
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,960
      About 120                 
  different things.             

41
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,963
We bring in the whole pig       
   and use it all.              

42
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:40,499
     The result is a unique     
    northwestern style of ham   

43
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,168
     based on a special diet    
       Aaron conjured up.       

44
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,370
   Their pigs are finished off  
         with hazelnuts,        

45
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,506
 which gives off a nutty flavor.

46
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,174
 That's what we grow            
 out here in Oregon.            

47
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:51,109
     There's enough hazelnuts to
     get these pigs that fat on?

48
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,379
  Oregon raises 98%             
of the country's hazelnuts.     

49
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,248
         Now you're in the know.

50
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,117
             FIERI:             
   And you can take your pork   
         either packaged        

51
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,185
           or stacked           
   into signature sandwiches.   

52
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:02,121
           Two Grinders, please.
  Two Grinders.                 

53
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:04,790
        Grinder's great.        
   It's three different meats.  

54
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,059
        The zesty sauce.        
                  FIERI:        
      What are we going to make?

55
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:08,727
  We're making ham              
  for the Grinder.              

56
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,529
    We start off                
with making a brine.            

57
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,864
So we've got water, salt.       

58
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:13,932
                   Sugar.       

59
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,601
      And then                  
a tiny bit of pink salt.        

60
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:17,803
                      Next up?  
       Toasted                  
tellicherry peppercorn.         

61
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,938
                       Juniper. 
Some whole bay leaf,            

62
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,207
    whole clove,                
and some whole thyme.           

63
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,142
We're going to dilute it        
  with cold water.              

64
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,611
Then we inject the ham          
   with the brine.              

65
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,681
                 Oh, that is    
            my kind of injector.

66
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,082
      I got to get one of those.

67
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,617
And just watch it swell up.     

68
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,085
                 That good?     
     Yep.                       

69
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,154
 They're going to go            
into this brine 10 days.        

70
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,023
   It'll come out,              
we'll give it a quick rinse,    

71
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,224
score the fat a little bit,     

72
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,026
 and 16 to 18 hours             
   in the smoker.               

73
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,428
                         Dig it.
So we're going to make          
 our cured coppa...             

74
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,163
                   Cabana.      
  The Cabana.                   

75
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,431
Right.                          
       It's from the Copacabana.

76
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,500
That's where we sing            
    all day long.               
                 Right, exactly.

77
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,368
         That's where it's from,
             like I didn't know.

78
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,505
It's the money cut. The very top
 of the Boston butt.            

79
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,973
                The shoulder?   
  Exactly.                      

80
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,576
                      Very nice.
  So we're going to             
make up the cure first.         

81
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,444
              Need Kosher salt. 
Cure number two,                

82
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,914
  this has nitrate              
 and nitrite in it.             

83
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,514
              I was hoping so.  
Yeah, there we go.              

84
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,584
Toasted tellicherry pepper,     
   toasted fennel,              

85
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:06,852
some cracked juniper.           

86
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,787
                 Ground bay.    
And some dried thyme.           

87
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,055
 Then we're going to            
    mix this up.                

88
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:12,324
               Rub generously?  
And we'll rub generously.       

89
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,726
And then into the bag.          
     You gonna vacuum-seal this?

90
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,128
I'm going to vacuum-seal them   
    real lightly.               

91
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,664
They're going to sit in the     
walk-in for about four days.    

92
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,799
                 Pushing out    
            the excess moisture,

93
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,400
        bringing in all the salt
                 and flavor.    

94
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,736
    Rinse it off.               
And then the aromatics          

95
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,938
 that we just put on            
are going to get reapplied      

96
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,807
and then trussed up and hung    
between three and four months.  

97
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,009
            That's amazing, man.

98
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,812
So we've got our coppa          
coming out of the aging room.   

99
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,480
                     Aw!        
                 I'm sorry.     

100
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,482
              I didn't mean to  
         get that loud about it.

101
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,750
We're going to test it.         

102
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,685
This is our water activity      
       meter.                   

103
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,889
It'll read the relative         
humidity of the meat.           

104
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,024
        What are we looking for?
  Under 0.93.                   

105
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,626
             So we're at 0.592. 

106
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:50,162
It's taking 4 minutes           
for it to run its test.         

107
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:52,163
                Four minutes?   
      Half of this will be gone.

108
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,632
            It won't even matter
               at that point.   

109
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,501
  It's ready to go.             
                 Look at that.  

110
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,904
                    Mmm.        
     I'm picking up the juniper.

111
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,371
              You're definitely 
        getting all those herbs.

112
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,041
              Not overly salty  
     by any means, but luscious.

113
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,777
I think people should be able to
come in and just have one slice.

114
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:06,845
                There you go.   

115
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,313
            Just come in and get
             a little dab of it.

116
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,947
    Okay, let's make a sandwich.
                I'm starving.   

117
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,516
  So we've got our              
  toasted ciabatta,             

118
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,185
roasted garlic aioli,           

119
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:15,721
  relish made with              
house-pickled fennel            

120
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,322
and roasted peppers,            

121
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,325
      our ham,                  
some aged provolone,            

122
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,527
     our coppa.                 
                   Ridiculous.  

123
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,929
 The lonza is going             
to be our spicy lonza.          

124
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,232
             What is the lonza? 
It's cured loin.                

125
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,203
    Don't put it on bread, dude.
             Just give it to me.

126
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:34,005
   Little iceberg               
 with some red onion            

127
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,807
and red wine vinegar.           

128
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:41,813
         That is up there in the
    best grinders I've ever had.

129
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,548
Thank you.                      
                The vinegars,   

130
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,951
            the pickled peppers,
           really nice ciabatta.

131
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,054
      The artisan charcuterie...

132
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,090
             ...and all the time
               and attention,   

133
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,558
              love and respect  
           that you've given it,

134
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,893
          it's really fantastic.

135
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,361
        It's, like, stupid good.

136
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,229
      You can get a scratch-made
             sandwich like this,

137
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,765
             local ingredients, 
                  dynamite.     

138
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,967
                    Mmm.        

139
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,368
    Joey, your Grinder's up.    

140
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,170
         The Grinder is         
      my favorite sandwich.     

141
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,372
         It tastes like         
     no other restaurant's.     

142
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,441
          The way pork          
         should be done.        

143
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,443
     They put a lot of love     
      into their products.      

144
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:14,246
             FIERI:             
  But one product was the first 
    to capture Aaron's heart.   

145
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:15,313
   It's all about               
    Aaron's dream               

146
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,449
   about American               
prosciutto-style ham.           

147
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,850
Everything comes down           
     from that.                 

148
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,986
      You get the sweetness     
    of their hazelnut finish.   

149
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,688
         Mouthwatering.         
     I can't stop eating it.    

150
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,192
                 So this is     
    a 2-1/2-year-old prosciutto.

151
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,666
                I don't know.   
              Let me try again. 

152
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,401
             Delicious. It melts
               in your mouth.   

153
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,270
              It's kind of like 
             meat cotton candy. 

154
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,005
                    Mmm.        
       It's got some other notes

155
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,808
          that I don't typically
            taste in prosciutto.

156
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,543
  It has a little herbaceousness
                   to it.       

157
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:45,477
            You've done it well.

158
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,012
                    Okay,       
        we have your prosciutto.

159
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,615
Everything he does to make      
the prosciutto terrific         

160
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,483
   translates into              
the other cuts of pork --       

161
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,752
the fresh cuts, the cured cuts, 
  the cooked meats.             

162
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,021
          Porchetta up.         

163
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,489
The infamous porchetta sandwich.

164
00:05:57,491 --> 00:06:00,158
     The belly and the loin     
     are rolled with spices.    

165
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,293
We roll and tie ours            
   around sausage.              

166
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,429
       That would be fine, then.
       I'll have seven of those.

167
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,098
   I keep coming back for it.   

168
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,567
      FIERI: And so are we.     
  We'll catch you in a minute.  

169
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,341
      FIERI: "Triple D" is      
   in a Portland kind of place  

170
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,675
   called Tails & Trotters...   

171
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,277
   Chris, Cubano.               

172
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,545
   ...at a pork-only paradise   

173
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:24,149
      serving up whole hog      
    over 100 different ways.    

174
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:25,684
            Whoo-hoo.           

175
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,619
          We love pork.         
           [ Laughs ]           

176
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,488
                  Whoo-hoo.     

177
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,022
 I might have given             
a yippee ki-yay, too.           

178
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,825
               A yippee ki-yay  
               and a whoo-hoo.  

179
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,093
  Can I get prosciutto, please? 

180
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,362
      You can come in here,     
     grab some stuff to go,     

181
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,696
        have a sandwich.        

182
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,098
We've got a porchetta.          

183
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,901
     Porchetta is the belly.    
         It's the loin.         

184
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,371
  With this great -- it's like  
    chili verde sauce on it.    

185
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:47,639
             Killer.            
                      All right.

186
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,307
  So we're going to             
 make our porchetta.            

187
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,309
Got a bone belly loin           
        here.                   

188
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,844
                         Got it.
Our seasoning is sugar,         

189
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,513
salt, then we're going to throw 
some lemon in there, as well.   

190
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,582
     So just a really quick cure
                 with this?     

191
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,717
Yep, just an overnight.         
 We'll rinse it off             

192
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,786
  and then coat it              
with a nice marinade            

193
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,789
  that is rosemary,             
    sage, capers,               

194
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,791
little bit of parsley,          
   juniper, thyme,              

195
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,193
    a whole bunch               
of herbs and spices.            

196
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09,528
             So semitraditional.

197
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,395
  We want it to be              
a little distinctive.           

198
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,664
So we roll and tie around       

199
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,332
some sweet Italian sausage      
      we make.                  

200
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,200
          Really? And how are we
              going to cook it? 

201
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,537
    Oven roasted                
 for a couple hours.            
                  Okay, next up?

202
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,072
 Salsa verde to cut             
the richness of the fat.        

203
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,874
 Pretty traditional.            
 We've got parsley,             

204
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:26,011
lemon zest, shallots,           
capers, salt and pepper.        

205
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,746
Then, we'll add enough olive oil
to bind it all together.        

206
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:29,815
                   Gotcha.      

207
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:32,083
So we've got our porchetta      
coming off the grill.           

208
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,618
     We're going                
   to chop it up.               

209
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,953
              And we serve this 
           on ciabatta, as well?

210
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,355
   Yes. We've got               
our roasted garlic aioli,       

211
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:38,757
little of that salsa verde      
    that we made.               

212
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,158
       Don't go light with that,
                   do ya?       

213
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,427
 Porchetta comes on.            

214
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,829
             I can already tell 
     I'm not going to love this.

215
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,965
 We've got a little             
   arugula salad.               

216
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,770
    There you go.               

217
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:53,638
                 This isn't     
          your average sandwich.

218
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,041
            This right here eats
               as a full meal.  

219
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,777
                 The pork's     
              nice and tender.  

220
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,712
I like that you have the variety
              from the sausage  

221
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,114
                 to the loin    
                to the bacon.   

222
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,116
                  The bread     
           is a huge complement.

223
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,719
       But it's the salsa verde,
          the way that comes in.

224
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,254
              Well done, buddy. 

225
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,722
 Awesome, thank you.            
               Well done, Aaron.

226
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,324
Man, I'm telling ya, should open
          a gym right next door.

227
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:17,094
           Taking farm to table,
       taking farm to treadmill.

228
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:18,930
                 Ridiculous.    

229
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,398
Porchetta for Jolene.           

230
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,067
           Fantastic, thank you.

231
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:24,135
    You really get what pork    
    should really taste like    

232
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,736
       when you bite into       
    one of these sandwiches.    

233
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,340
     So I can't come to Portland
       without seeing my cousin.

234
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,608
          This is my cousin Paul
             and his girlfriend.

235
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,877
             All right, brother.
             What do you think? 

236
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,079
  It's not just slices of pork. 
    It's substantial pieces.    

237
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,214
              There's something 
             going on in there. 

238
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,815
         Yeah, exactly.         
         It's delicious.        

239
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,817
  This is amazing.              
I absolutely love it.           

240
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,218
          Pulled pork.          

241
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,088
      The food is awesome.      

242
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,156
     We have a lot of great     
     butchers in this town.     

243
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,491
        But when you want       
        to come get pork,       

244
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,360
    you know you're going to    
    come to Tails & Trotters.   

245
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,895
       What you're doing and how
     you're putting it together,

246
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:54,232
     you definitely treat it all
          with a lot of respect.

247
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:57,101
    Ridiculous. Don't come here.
              You won't leave.  

248
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,670
              You should start  
            a bed-and-breakfast.

249
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,109
        FIERI: Coming up        
   in Louisville, Kentucky...   

250
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,043
                 Holy moly.     

251
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,045
        ...smoking wings        
       and monster ribs...      

252
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,580
              Look at the size  
               of that thing.   
     Yeah.                      

253
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,181
    ...just like momma makes.   

254
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,249
                  Oh, yeah,     
                I'll do that.   

255
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,424
 So you know how that food truck
  craze is going on everywhere? 

256
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,661
   Well, I've got one for you   
  here in Louisville, Kentucky, 

257
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:25,129
         where a guy is         
   a non-food-truck operator.   

258
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,197
       That means he's got      
          a food truck,         

259
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:27,599
    but it really didn't run.   

260
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,867
  So he borrows a kitchen from  
 a buddy of his that has a bar. 

261
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,002
  But the buddy that has a bar, 

262
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,270
        well, he's gonna        
       go out of business.      

263
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,139
So the guy borrowing the kitchen
    has to take the bar over.   

264
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:35,340
        And, well, that's       
       where we're at now.      

265
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:39,411
         This is Momma's        
     Mustard, Pickles & BBQ.    

266
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:43,748
Half rack of beef ribs.         

267
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,950
 Everything is phenomenal here. 

268
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,684
That's pulled chicken.          

269
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,486
    Don't really need sauces    
          on anything.          

270
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,088
Burnt ends for you, sir.        

271
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,756
   I found my barbecue place.   

272
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,958
    FIERI: Which is something   
      KC native Chad Cooley     

273
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,493
        was searching for       
  when he moved to Louisville.  

274
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:56,827
         We wanted some barbecue

275
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,697
             that I was used to 
           growing up in Kansas.

276
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:01,032
    So he and his chef buddy    
           Jamie Givan          

277
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,634
           took charge          
    and bought a food truck,    

278
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:04,235
       thanks to a little       
         Kentucky luck.         

279
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:07,104
Where did you get the money     
 to do the barbecue?            

280
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,373
     The horse, Mucho Macho Man.

281
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,775
You were part owner in it.      
                           Yeah.

282
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,711
          Seemed like every time
      we needed some more money,

283
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,245
                  the horse     
              would win a race. 

284
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,980
         He just kept funding us
                 as we grew.    

285
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,182
    Which is out of the truck   
     and into a restaurant,     

286
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,652
      smoking up everything     
from pork butt to chicken wings.

287
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,053
   Ten wings, side              
of buttermilk ranch.            

288
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,922
       Worlds best wings,       
            bar-none.           

289
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,956
  Come out perfect every time.  

290
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,459
                 All right.     
       How do we get into wings?

291
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,660
   First we start               
  with our dry rub.             

292
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,195
                       Okay.    
Dried brown sugar.              

293
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:31,662
 We add a little bit            
    of cornstarch               

294
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:32,997
   just to keep it              
   from clumping.               
              Dried brown sugar?

295
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,400
Yeah. Granulated sugar,         
   seasoned salt,               

296
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,402
garlic salt, paprika.           

297
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,270
   Like to mix it               
  halfway through.              

298
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,873
    Chili powder,               
black pepper, white pepper,     

299
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,675
  powdered mustard,             
  ground allspice,              

300
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,743
cayenne, and my favorite,       
  the ground cumin.             

301
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,211
               Do you want me   
               to go back here  

302
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,481
    and see if there's any other
          spices you didn't use?

303
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,349
  We got some more              
if you want to add 'em.         

304
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,883
              Do you use brine  
                or anything?    

305
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,752
  They're just going to sit here
             with this dry rub? 
This is it.                     

306
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:55,953
          Now, what kind of wood
       do you use in the smoker?

307
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,222
We use strictly hickory.        

308
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:58,489
              What temp are we  
             going to run it at?

309
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,091
  About 230.                    
                Hour and a half,

310
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,427
     bring 'em out, let 'em cool
   and then fry 'em for service?

311
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:05,096
  About 2 minutes,              

312
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:07,164
then we hit 'em with            
a little more Momma's rub.      

313
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,100
    We serve 'em                
with our buttermilk ranch.      

314
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,702
           So this is subnuclear
                 at this --     

315
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,704
                    Whoa!       
   Pardon me for using the fork.

316
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,706
  I know that no self-respecting
 chicken wing eater uses a fork.

317
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,710
            But these things are
         like 9,000 degrees hot.

318
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,914
              One of the things 
          about smoking wings --

319
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,249
      and I like smoked wings --

320
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:26,584
          One is that they could
            take too much smoke,

321
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:29,120
       and they can just be like
       you're eating an ashtray.

322
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,788
              Two, people don't 
               fry 'em enough.  

323
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,925
        So they don't get       
        that crispy wing texture
        that everybody loves.   

324
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,260
        Yeah.                   

325
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:36,528
         What we have right here

326
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,062
               is neither one   
             of those problems. 

327
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,130
     Thank you.                 

328
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:42,533
               Juicy, tender,   
           good smoke, nice rub.

329
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,536
      And that's no little dinky
           chicken wing, either.

330
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,271
         Oh, yeah, I'll do that.

331
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,606
                Nicely done.    
 Thank you.                     

332
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:49,874
             That's a real wing.

333
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,476
    Got wings up.               

334
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,478
      By far the best wings     
         I've ever had.         

335
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,413
          Thick, juicy,         
    and just very flavorful.    

336
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,818
 Momma's Mustard, Pickles & BBQ 
is one of the better restaurants

337
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,951
      that you're going to      
       find in Louisville.      

338
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,354
    Why Mustard,                
   Pickles & BBQ?               

339
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,356
                   COOLEY:      
       We had a lot of free time
                on our hands    

340
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:06,624
          because the food truck
               wouldn't work.   

341
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,359
       And the chef's on salary,
             so we might as well

342
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:09,694
       get some work out of him.

343
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:12,564
               I had him doing  
    Momma's mustard and pickles.

344
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,566
             FIERI:             
Which are Chad's momma's recipes

345
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,700
         served up with         
     one of their big hits.     

346
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,570
               The beef ribs.   

347
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,438
         I refer to them        
    as Fred Flintstone ribs.    

348
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,108
    There's so much on there,   
   you can't even eat it all.   

349
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,642
             All right, brother.
   We're going to               
  do our beef ribs.             

350
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,845
 Bone-in chuck ribs.            
                      Holy moly.

351
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:29,113
Yeah, that's one rack.          
Getting a little of             
the skin off the back.          

352
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,381
              Getting it done.  

353
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,316
Take as much fat off            
 as we possibly can.            

354
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,451
       Really, all the way down?

355
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,719
 Yeah, we want that             
 rub to get into it.            

356
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,187
We don't want it to have        
to penetrate the fat.           

357
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,789
               And we're using  
      Momma's rub again on this?

358
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:38,989
      Oh, yeah.                 
And go to the smoker.           

359
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,526
230 for about 5 hours.          
                         Okay.  

360
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,661
     All right.                 
    Pickle time.                

361
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,897
  What type of cucumber is this?
We use English cucumbers.       

362
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,999
   Sliced onions,               
little bit of bell pepper.      

363
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,134
       Garlic.                  
This is what Momma taught us.   

364
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,936
We're going to salt these       
  and then ice 'em.             

365
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,272
And that ice will slowly melt   
and just slowly salt them.      

366
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,140
It gives 'em a little bit       
more of a crunch, we think.     

367
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,575
          How long does that go?

368
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,544
Two to three hours. Then        
we're going to make our brine.  

369
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,345
                   Let's see it.
     Start with                 
apple cider vinegar,            

370
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:05,349
a bit of sugar, mustard seed,   
celery seed, and turmeric.      

371
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,951
     That's where your color is.
Oh, yeah.                       

372
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,619
   Now we can add               
  our cucumber mix.             

373
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,288
Right when they come to a boil, 
we'll get a good stir on them,  

374
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,024
  into the walk-in,             
    chill 'em...                

375
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:14,559
          And ready for service.
 Yes.                           

376
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,160
        All right, Hasenpfeffer.
              What do you got?  

377
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,361
This is Momma's mustard.        

378
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,898
Start with apple cider vinegar, 
little bit of egg yolk.         

379
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,233
         A bunch of dry mustard.
And we'll hit the sugar.        

380
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,567
Break up those yolks.           

381
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,637
And then our standard           
   yellow mustard.              

382
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,238
      Mix that.                 
Put it in the double boiler.    

383
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,041
Cook it until it gets           
to about 100, 185 degrees.      

384
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,443
And it is fantastic.            
I put this on cold pizza.       

385
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,312
                 On cold pizza? 
   Yeah, it's good              
   on everything.               

386
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,246
                 All right.     

387
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:36,781
      Beef ribs                 
right out of the smoker.        

388
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,449
Two ribs for a half rack.       

389
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,051
              Look at the size  
               of that thing.   
   Yeah.                        

390
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:43,187
                Whoa, look at   
         the smoke ring on that.

391
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,657
      Dude, that is championship
                right there.    

392
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,862
               That's no joke.  

393
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,997
          Tender, not dried out.
        That is a righteous rib.

394
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,466
     I like how it's got its own
    voodoo going on right there.

395
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:58,135
                Okay, so now    
              a little mustard? 
   Yeah.                        

396
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,603
             Oh, that goes great
               with that rib.   

397
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,340
        And the bread-and-butter
                   pickle,      

398
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,808
        still enough body to it,

399
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,609
            still enough crunch,
            good amount of acid,

400
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,077
               nice little bit  
             of sweetness to it.

401
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:10,081
           I like all the onion.
    Mmm, that was a good pickle.

402
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,348
      That's a real good pickle.

403
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,684
      You look at the smoke ring
              on that beef rib  

404
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,286
               and you look at  
               the size of it,  

405
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,688
              it's just simple, 
           straightforward good.

406
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,958
              Nice job, buddy.  
                  Nice job.     
  Thank you.                    

407
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,693
      Got a half rack beef.     

408
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,095
               They're juicy.   
               They're smoked.  

409
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,830
      They're the best beef ribs
               I've ever had.   

410
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,899
        Homemade pickles        
      are just phenomenal.      

411
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,234
    The mustard's fantastic.    
     Very difficult to beat.    

412
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,037
     Momma's is my favorite     
    restaurant in Louisville.   

413
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,105
         We all love it.        
    And we love them for it.    

414
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,975
I've had a lot of beef ribs.    
Those are rated at the top.     

415
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,643
                 Thank you.     
            Thank you very much.

416
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:41,111
     Well done.                 

417
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,047
             FIERI:             
     Up next, a Jersey girl     

418
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,581
trading computers for cooking...

419
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,651
So now you're starting to       
get all techy on me.            

420
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,719
 ...putting her own special spin
         on sandwiches.         

421
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,989
You got to make people          
  happy with that.              

422
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:55,326
  A friend of mine actually gave
  me a small piece of the horse.

423
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:56,560
 Did you barbecue --            

424
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,462
Sorry, that was wrong.          
                      Wow, yeah.

425
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,231
        We're going to cut that.
 That was bad.                  

426
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,404
So I'm here in the garden state,
           New Jersey,          

427
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,673
   in the township of Hamilton  
          on Route 33.          

428
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:11,142
     A lot of folks use this    
     to cruise into Trenton     

429
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,677
 or to commute to New York City.

430
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,545
  And when you're going through 
 and you're looking for a quick,

431
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,347
easy bite, well, you're in luck.

432
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,481
  There's a funky little joint, 

433
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,717
         and it's called        
      the Jersey Girl Café.     

434
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:24,955
       Hot Shelby in the window.

435
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,825
   I have ridiculous cravings   
  for this place all the time.  

436
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,760
        Barbecue burger,        
         mac 'n cheese.         

437
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,162
 I would take a train back down 
      to Jersey every week      

438
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,297
       just to come here.       

439
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,633
I need a turkey and brie        
        now.                    
         I adore Kathy.         

440
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:36,834
               Got everything?  
                You're good?    

441
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,436
          She came from         
       the tech industry.       

442
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,837
    I was a computer programmer,

443
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,241
         then a systems analyst,
          and a project manager.

444
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:46,644
             FIERI:             
  But eventually, Kathy Rana's  
    lifelong love of cooking    

445
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,646
       ended up taking her      
        from the keyboard       

446
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,648
      to the cutting board      
        at her own café.        

447
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,985
So you're basically taking      
all that smart stuff            

448
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:55,386
   and applying it              
 to the food world?             

449
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,321
             Including processes
      with running a restaurant.

450
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,724
So now you're starting          
to get all techy on me.         

451
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:02,192
When talking about processes    
in the analytical system        

452
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,262
that we'll be evaluating        
  for the moment...             

453
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:05,863
               Carlos, I need   
          a Jersey Belly Buster.

454
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,799
You can have things in a panini,
   in a rice bowl, in a wrap.   

455
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,467
Just really creative sandwiches.

456
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,670
             I got a kogi steak 
             on a torpedo roll. 

457
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:16,874
     Kogi steak sandwich --     
lean beef, Jersey ripe tomatoes.

458
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:20,344
      It's got a wonderful      
       Asian flair to it.       

459
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,812
I'm into this idea.             
                      All right.

460
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,082
           We are going to start
          with the bulgogi sauce

461
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,616
                   for our      
            kogi steak sandwich.

462
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,218
         We have diced up pears.

463
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,220
You don't see diced up pears    
going into many dishes.         

464
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,554
              Couple things --  
             It adds sweetness, 

465
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,290
                and it's also   
             gonna add texture. 

466
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,291
                Diced onion,    
             chopped scallions. 

467
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,694
        I got ginger and garlic,
                 palm sugar.    

468
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,095
    Okay.                       
                 Soy sauce.     

469
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,231
    Sesame seed,                
     sesame oil.                

470
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,233
          A little bit of water,
              salt and pepper.  

471
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,967
And how long are we gonna       
let this cook down for?         

472
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,504
  About 15, 20 minutes, or until
  the pears are nice and tender.

473
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,172
    Now we hit it               
with the immersion blender?     

474
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,107
         Correct. We'll chill it
                  overnight     

475
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,043
        and hold it for service.

476
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,177
  We ready to make              
  the sandwich now?             

477
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,179
                    Yeah.       
   A little bit of grill butter.

478
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,115
         Gonna start by toasting
              the torpedo roll. 

479
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,383
The torpedo roll is what we'd   
find a Philly Cheesesteak on?   

480
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,852
                Yes, exactly.   
  Okay, I got it.               

481
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,121
         We have top round beef,
            really, really rare.

482
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,455
So, like roast beef.            

483
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,057
              Now we got to add 
 a little bit of our kogi sauce.

484
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,458
     Just enough                
   to warm it up.               

485
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,462
     We have a red-leaf lettuce,
       a nice red Jersey tomato.

486
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:12,463
        Okay.                   

487
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:15,399
                Got our steak   
        all heated up and saucy.

488
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:19,003
               A little bit of  
          our spicy kogi pickle,

489
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,872
             and we're all set. 

490
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,477
It's almost like you're eating  
a whole Asian French dip.       

491
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,146
You got to make people          
  happy with that.              

492
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,147
                       We do.   
The bread's perfect.            

493
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,249
  The fresh veggie,             
the pickled cucumber,           

494
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:36,287
   and the tomato               
in a bulgogi-style sandwich     

495
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,755
is what legitimizes it.         

496
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:41,692
But the real key to this --     
that thin-sliced meat,          

497
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:44,495
    just so nice                
and light and tender.           

498
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:45,863
   Nice. Nice job.              

499
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,302
   Kogi steak in our torpedo.   

500
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,704
     The steak is marinated     
           just right.          

501
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,306
                 Hot Shelby     
              mac 'n cheese up. 

502
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:56,641
          Is there anyplace else
                 like this?     

503
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:57,641
   I think it's one of a kind.  

504
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,377
             FIERI:             
        Or two of a kind.       

505
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,512
         RANA: I have two cafés,
         both Jersey Girl Cafés.

506
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,180
     All right.                 
   The same town?               
                      Yeah.     

507
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,949
           Figure I'll have some
       on this side of the town,

508
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,050
          some on the other side
                  of town.      

509
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:07,585
           I could get everybody
                  that way.     

510
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,388
 It's kind of like one of those 
 hidden treasures of New Jersey.

511
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,788
   Her paninis are delicious.   

512
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,257
        Rosie Panini for Marcus.

513
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,726
      Really fresh chicken,     
            arugula.            

514
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:20,264
    And the red pepper pesto    
         is scrumptious.        

515
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,465
    Okay.                       
              The Rosie Panini. 

516
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,934
  Why is it Rosie?              

517
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:25,203
 I named the Rosie after my aunt
     Rose, who was my godmother,

518
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:26,537
               who passed away  
             a couple years ago.

519
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,573
             She was incredibly 
      encouraging and supportive

520
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:30,808
          and just the person...

521
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,476
So you named the dish           
     after her?                 
                        I did.  

522
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,744
           It reminds me of her.

523
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,479
    We season the chicken breast

524
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,915
              with kosher salt  
             and cracked pepper.

525
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,017
             It's going to roast
            in a 325-degree oven

526
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,552
           for about 20 minutes.

527
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:44,221
Next step?                      
           We are making roasted
              red pepper pesto. 

528
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:47,225
              We got our basil. 
    We're going to process this,

529
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:51,095
       add in our garlic cloves,
              Parmesan cheese.  

530
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,297
That is fragrant brasil.        
       Brasil?                  

531
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,833
           We're going to add in
         extra virgin olive oil.

532
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,167
        Okay.                   

533
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,503
             Roasted red peppers
              and goat cheese.  

534
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,105
    Goat cheese?                
Didn't see that coming.         

535
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,506
              It adds more body 
                to the sauce.   

536
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,575
  Makes it a little             
  more spreadable.              

537
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,778
        Nice.                   
     Next step?                 

538
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,980
         Roasted chicken breast.
                  Slice it.     

539
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,849
I'm gonna put this on the grill,
       get a little color on it.

540
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,651
  Okay.                         
        While that's warming up,

541
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,786
        I have my ciabatta bread
      that we get from Brooklyn.

542
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,788
There's a lot going on here     
in a little kitchen.            

543
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,857
                      It is.    
    And you don't               
   toast the bread              

544
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,258
   because you're               
 going to panini it?            

545
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,526
                  Exactly.      
     Got it.                    

546
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:23,860
              Fresh mozzarella  

547
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,330
             top and the bottom 
           so it's extra cheesy.

548
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,466
             This is our roasted
              red pepper pesto  

549
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,201
               and some nice,   
               fresh arugula.   

550
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:33,404
                Our chicken's   
               on top of here.  

551
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,672
             And then this goes 
            on the panini press.

552
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,006
       Hit it.                  
These things look like          

553
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,408
they've had a little bit        
    of a workout.               

554
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,809
                   It has.      
            We want to make sure

555
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,277
               that the crust   
             is nice and toasty 

556
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,812
           and it has nice color
                   on it.       

557
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,014
       Gotcha.                  

558
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,815
              Panini is ready.  

559
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,884
And what are you serving that   
with, a little broccoli slaw?   

560
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,954
          A broccoli salad, yes.
              And there we go.  

561
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,425
That's a really good            
      sandwich.                 
                      Good.     

562
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,627
   Fresh arugula,               
   homemade pesto,              

563
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,829
house-roasted chicken,          
and a dynamite ciabatta --      

564
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,732
just really good straightforward
   on a sandwich.               

565
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:04,969
    We have your                
    Rosie Panini.               

566
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:07,104
        Kathy always does       
       the chicken right.       

567
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:09,507
      The pesto, it's like      
    a nice song and a dance.    

568
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,775
         It just blends         
       very well together.      

569
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,444
               Beach Body Wrap  
               in the window.   

570
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,846
 You always know you're going to
 get good, fresh, healthy food. 

571
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:18,115
It's like if you made something 
at home for your kid.           

572
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,317
       How'd you find the place?

573
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,052
I own a cupcake shop            
   up the street.               

574
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,452
And she carries my products.    

575
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:23,521
                Have you been   
             on "Cupcake Wars?" 

576
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,056
Yes, I came in second           
 on "Cupcake Wars."             

577
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,123
                 Seriously?     
  Mm-hmm.                       

578
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,458
              "Sugar Showdown"? 
    I won.                      

579
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,859
                  Nice job.     

580
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,262
 It's very easy to fall in love 
     with Jersey Girl Café.     

581
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:33,130
        Once you try it,        
        you'll be hooked.       

582
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:34,498
     Well done.                 

583
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,502
  I got to come to              
New Jersey more often.          

584
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,739
   So that wraps this edition   

585
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,140
      of "Diners, Drive-Ins     
           and Dives."

590
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,418
Wings were one of the last      
proteins we put on the menu.    

591
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,686
You know, we started off        
  with your typical             

592
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,154
    pulled pork,                
pulled chicken, ribs.           

593
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:58,822
            Pulled chicken ribs?
