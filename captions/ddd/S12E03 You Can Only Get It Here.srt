               LOT OF WORK, MAN.

239
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,784
       SO WE GOT ALL THE BEEF   
   SHREDDED APART, COOL IT DOWN.

240
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:48,519
WHAT ARE WE UP TO NOW?          
             WE'RE GONNA FRY IT 
            A LITTLE BIT IN OIL.

241
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,920
ONIONS AND BURN IT              
  A LITTLE BIT.                 

242
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,656
              TO FLAVOR THE OIL,
                    RIGHT?      
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

243
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,525
      GOT TO TAKE THE ONION OUT.
NOW WE DROP THE MEAT            
     IN THERE.                  

244
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:55,994
    ALL THIS MEAT'S GONNA GO IN.
     GETS A LITTLE BIT OF A FRY.
UH-HUH.                         

245
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:58,930
  SOME OF THE RED SAUCE WE MADE,
    8 GALLONS, SMELLS AWESOME.  

246
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,132
              SO HOW MUCH LONGER
             IS THIS GONNA COOK?
15 MINUTES.                     

247
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:04,469
  THEN WE TAKE IT TO THE MASA.  
  HE'S THE BOSS-A OF THE MASA.  
UH-HUH.                         

248
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,738
           SO THE MASA BALLED UP
              AND READY TO GO.  

249
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,674
WE GOT TO SEPARATE.             
PUT THE OIL FIRST.              
     KIND OF CREAMS UP THE MASA.

250
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:12,076
SALT, BAKING POWDER.            
          THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM

251
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,478
      NICE AND LIGHT AND AIRY   
   AND NOT SUPER DENSE AND HARD.
NOW WE MIX IT.                  

252
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,581
                HOW MANY TAMALES
                 WILL THIS MAKE?
70 TAMALES.                     

253
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,217
                       ABOUT 70?
       MM-HMM.                  
WE ADD SOME RED SALSA.          

254
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,020
      SO WE MIX ALL THIS UP.    
 THEN WE START BUILDING TAMALES.

255
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:24,022
THAT'S RIGHT.                   
                         GOT IT.

256
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,957
     SO WE GOT THE HUSKS THAT   
  HAVE BEEN SOAKED IN THE WATER,

257
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,360
    SO THEY'RE NICE AND PLIABLE,
       NICE BIG FAT ONES, TOO.  

258
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:29,961
SOME OIL.                       
            SO IT DOESN'T STICK.

259
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,496
PUT SOME MASA.                  
                           OKAY.

260
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,765
SOME SALSA.                     
          OH, IT'S GONNA BE NICE
                AND MOIST.      

261
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,300
ADD SOME MEAT.                  
                THAT'S GENEROUS,
                     BABY.      

262
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,635
I HATE IT WHEN IT'S SO MUCH MASA
 AND JUST A LITTLE BIT OF MEAT. 

263
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,706
ROLL THE TAMALE, FOLD IT UP,    
  A LITTLE A BIT OF SALSA.      
     A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THERE.

264
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,842
YEAH, THERE WE GO.              
     AND THEN WE'RE GONNA STAND 
    ALL THOSE UP IN THE STEAMER.

265
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,644
             START IT FROM COLD,
                STACK THEM UP,  

266
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,780
                 35, 40 MINUTES 
               AND THEY'RE DONE.

267
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,715
  THAT'S RIGHT,                 
THIS ONE'S READY.               
                      ALL RIGHT.

268
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,785

  REALLY NICE FLAVOR TO IT, MMM.

270
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,592

380
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:18,283
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE USING       
   THE FOOD PROCESSOR,          

381
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,284

386
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,761
WANT ME TO HELP YOU?            
                             NO.

387
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,297

     TO HELP SOFTEN IT.         

388
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,632

    AND OUR GARLIC,             

476
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:18,422

THEN WE'LL ADD THE PIGTAILS.    
    GIVE IT SOME FLAVOR.        

482
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,107

491
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,200
           PIGTAIL IS A LITTLE--
                IT'S FATTY.     
MM-HMM.
