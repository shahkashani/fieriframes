1
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:02,601
You know, folks ask me
   all the time,

2
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:03,702
"Hey, Guy.
  That place you went to

3
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,104
in that one town
 that served that one dish,

4
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:06,605
how are they doing
  after 'Triple D'?"

5
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,807
You know what? I don't know.
  Let's check it out.

6
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:12,578
This is "Triple D Nation."

7
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,381
Over the years,
 I've seen and tasted it all.

8
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:17,216
This is ridiculous, dude.

9
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:19,284
But it turns out,
 it was only the beginning...

10
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,688
...'cause "Triple D" joints
  have been blowing up...

11
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,189
Did you see that?!

12
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,992
...and we're going back
  to see what's cooking.

13
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:28,560
Like on this trip --

14
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:32,498
a Minneapolis spot still making
 some killer Cuban cuisine,

15
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,699
a joint in Jackson

16
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:36,168
where the menu's got something
   for everyone,

17
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,504
and an O.G., "Triple D"
   Greek diner

18
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:41,306
where the welcome wagon
 was more like a hot rod.

19
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:43,142
- Welcome.
  -"Welcome." Wow.

20
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:45,711
I don't know. I like him.

21
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,014
And two dudes in Portland

22
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,417
whose sandwiches
 are taking over the town.

23
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:53,152
I don't even know if I want
 to call it gourmet.

24
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:54,620
I want to call it
 funkalicious.

25
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:58,690
Old friends, new places,
 and more off-the-hook flavors.

26
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:01,860
That's all right here,
 right now on "Triple-D Nation."

27
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,236
So, we're here in Seattle,
 Washington, to check out

28
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,805
one of the first
  "Triple D" joints.

29
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:14,406
I mean, this place is O.G.

30
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,708
And I wanted to stop by
 and just see what's new,

31
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,944
what's been happening,
 and how things have been

32
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:21,013
after "Diners,
  Drive-Ins & Dives."

33
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:24,750
This is Voula's Offshore Cafe.

34
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,752
I was here for that first
  "Triple D" episode.

35
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,921
I'm on camera
  for about 1/4 second.

36
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:32,691
After that,
 it did get a little busy.

37
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:33,992
How is your lunch,
     my lady?

38
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:35,794
- It was excellent as always.
   -That's good.

39
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:37,496
Voula's really nice,
   really caring,

40
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:39,064
and truly wants you
  to have a great meal

41
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,500
and a great time
 when you come and sit down.

42
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:43,469
That would be an understatement.

43
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:45,938
I think she might have been
 the best welcoming committee

44
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,639
we ever had.
     I'm Guy.

45
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,141
- Welcome.
   -"Welcome."

46
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,476
- Wow.
   -Thank you.

47
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:51,610
I don't get that
     every time

48
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,378
- on "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."
   -You don't?

49
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,913
No, I don't walk in
    and get hugged.

50
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,148
Thank goodness,
     because --

51
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,617
Hey, I always like
 handsome men, baby.

52
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:02,588
I don't know. I like him.

53
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,590
He's a really nice guy.

54
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:07,025
When I met Voula,
 she was running her Greek diner

55
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:10,596
with the help of her two sons,
  Sikey and Nikos.

56
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,698
And they were churning out
  breakfast and lunch

57
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,734
from behind the counter
  of this tiny joint.

58
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:16,802
All right, so, this
    is the beginning

59
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:17,870
of the Chinese pancake.

60
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:19,438
Now, is the egg yolk
    supposed to break?

61
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,039
- No.
  -You feel confident?

62
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,608
No.

63
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,510
Round of applause,
   ladies and gentlemen.

64
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:26,979
Evel Knievel
    jumps the fountain.

65
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:28,247
Thank you.

66
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:30,415
I remember answering the phone,
   and he said,

67
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,850
"So-and-so from Food Network --

68
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:34,319
We'd like to talk to you
about doing a show,"

69
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,622
not informing us
 of what it was.

70
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:40,459
We found out Friday
before the first episode

71
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,828
of "Diners, Drive-Ins
 & Dives" aired

72
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,198
as to what show
we were going to be on.

73
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,767
The truth of it is,
   this was the beginning.

74
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,435
I mean, it was the beginning
    of "Triple D."

75
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:53,405
And getting a chance
   to have you guys here

76
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,974
and all the enthusiasm
    from you, Voula,

77
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,610
you know, it was a --
  It was a really big deal.

78
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,279
- For you guys...
   -For you --

79
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:02,948
Just 'cause it's "Diners,
Drive-Ins & Dives," I'll give.

80
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,917
I mean, we don't have
an under-griddle cam.

81
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,251
We need to get an
 under-griddle cam.

82
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,920
- Under-griddle cam.
   -Slow-mo.

83
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:11,990
So, what has happened?
   Give me the rundown.

84
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,659
We tripled the business.

85
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:15,160
Triple the volume
   from where you were?

86
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:16,428
- Yes.
   -Really?

87
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,829
- Yes.
  -Bought the building.

88
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,464
- We bought the building.
 -You bought the building?

89
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,600
- Yep.
- You retired, real-time retired?

90
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:22,768
- She's out.
   -I'm out.

91
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,902
- Really retired?
   -She's out.

92
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,637
- Really out.
  -So who runs it now?

93
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,539
Sikey and Nikos.

94
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,475
Which means they
 get to make the menu decisions.

95
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,611
So, after the airing of the show

96
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:36,148
and the onslaught of customers
coming in, we decided, you know,

97
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,150
we have to have
a new special every weekend.

98
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:39,518
Two Big Juans.

99
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,454
The Big Juan is the
Goliath of breakfast burritos --

100
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,056
a real monster.

101
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,959
We needed to make something that
was ours characteristically,

102
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:50,095
and it was a breakfast.
So the Big Juan burrito

103
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:53,865
is our in-house made chorizo,
eggs, pico de gallo.

104
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,835
The chorizo and eggs is
 the heart and soul of the dish,

105
00:03:56,837 --> 00:04:00,672
but Voula's hot sauce takes it
 up a notch or maybe two.

106
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,975
We're going to start out
 with the onions, tomatoes,

107
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:04,376
the roasted Japanese peppers,

108
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:06,545
cilantro, and a little bit
 of roasted garlic in this pot,

109
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:09,214
which we're going to cook
   for five hours.

110
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,315
Now we blend it.

111
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,117
This is not so hot
  you can't eat it.

112
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,452
We do create an extra-hot

113
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,354
for those who really want
  to kick it up a notch.

114
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:18,690
The Big Juan is fantastic.

115
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:22,127
The hot of the chorizo,
 the homemade hot sauce --

116
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,363
It's just luscious.

117
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:26,231
It's got a lot of flavor.

118
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:29,034
One of my favorite
  breakfast burritos.

119
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:31,803
When I came here,
 there was no hole in that wall.

120
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,439
- That's right.
 -And everything that went on

121
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:38,310
at Voula's Offshore Cafe
  was on those griddles only.

122
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:39,511
In the expansion process,

123
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:41,380
we decided to do
 a secondary kitchen

124
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,882
that works hand-in-hand
with the front kitchen.

125
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,817
Pretty much tripled
    our cooking space,

126
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,552
and it's just made it
    a lot easier.

127
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,988
Everybody we talked to
when we were doing the remodel,

128
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,957
everybody wanted us
to shove everything in the back,

129
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,392
and I didn't want that,
 because the people

130
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:54,993
want to see us doing this
  out here.

131
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,228
Sitting at this counter

132
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,829
- is part of the whole --
   -Exactly.

133
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,665
People fight to get
    to this counter.

134
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,266
It's kind of like entertainment
while you're eating,

135
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:02,768
and it's pretty cool.

136
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,202
Two Squealers.

137
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,838
And the latest star of
the show is the Little Squealer,

138
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,940
the lunch version
 of your favorite breakfast,

139
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,442
the Piñata, which is actually

140
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:12,411
what I ate
 the first time I was there.

141
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,313
If Eggs Benedict
 tasted like that,

142
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,081
I might eat
Eggs Benedict every day.

143
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,182
Good.

144
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:21,019
The chipotle
hollandaise is money.

145
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,821
- Feed the camera.
    -Mmm.

146
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,123
Now, you could just drink
  that hollandaise sauce,

147
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,526
but instead, I made
  a little suggestion.

148
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,695
Now let's take some of this
and make some sandwiches.

149
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:31,163
Yeah, no kidding.

150
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,230
Which they did.

151
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:34,599
This is the Little Squealer.

152
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,168
We use our sliced
    smoked pork,

153
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,271
so it gives it a nice, smoky
 flavor throughout the sandwich.

154
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:41,940
But we wanted to use
  the chipotle hollandaise

155
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,442
that we use
    for the breakfast,

156
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:46,011
but adding tomato
    and Swiss cheese.

157
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,346
The hollandaise
  and the Swiss cheese

158
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,448
are just the best part
  of the sandwich.

159
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,249
There's a little bit of spice,
   it's creamy,

160
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,286
and it goes really, really well
 with the smoked pork shoulder.

161
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:57,389
It's all homemade.
 It's just a delicious sandwich.

162
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:58,990
I'm glad that you
   turned the reins over

163
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,425
finally to these boys.

164
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,694
Except one thing
 I didn't give it to them.

165
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,696
- Yes, one thing?
  -My house in Greece.

166
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,698
That's the only one thing
   you don't give to them?

167
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,700
You shouldn't.
  Give it to your other son,

168
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,801
the one with hair.

169
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,002
- Good.
  -The one with hair.

170
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,071
- I will do that.
 -Let me just get right in there

171
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,406
- on that deal.
   -All right.

172
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,875
Anytime you go to Greece,
 go ahead and stay in my place.

173
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,077
I love it.
   Wow. Congratulations.

174
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,912
- Thank you, buddy.
 -Very happy for you, man.

175
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:24,182
Awesome job.

176
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,650
It's nice to see those guys

177
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,753
finally giving their mom
   a break,

178
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:29,154
and I think that
  I'm going to hold Voula

179
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,790
to that house deal in Greece.
   Next up...

180
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,725
Can it get to the face
    without falling?

181
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,160
Oh. Mmm.

182
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,496
...a Minneapolis joint
  doubling up the staff

183
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,498
and the menu after doubling down

184
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,801
on authentic, off-the-hook
   Cuban cuisine.

185
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,540
10 years ago, I dropped
 into a tropical-looking joint

186
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,710
in Minneapolis
 with a rep for huge flavors.

187
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:54,346
Victor's Sandwich Cubano,
   two of them.

188
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,915
Imagine my surprise
 when I found a Greek chef

189
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,684
serving up authentic Cuban food.

190
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:03,688
This is Victor's 1959 Café.

191
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,223
Have your albóndigas.

192
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:09,227
It's really blown up a lot.
 There's always people here.

193
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,930
It's not every day
 that people associate Minnesota

194
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,366
with a iconic Cuban restaurant,

195
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:18,270
and then moreover with
a Greek woman that's leading it.

196
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,571
That's right.

197
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:22,841
Some of the best, most legit
  Cuban food we've seen,

198
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:26,178
all coming from Niki,
  who's full-on Greek.

199
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,913
Sandwich Cubano.

200
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,715
Here's ham for the two
  Victor's Cubanos.

201
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,518
You have got the bling.
    Look at this.

202
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,387
Yeah, like --
   And it's beauty bling.

203
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,088
So, this is going to be
   the Cuban picadillo.

204
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,859
- Am I --
  -The Cuban picadillo.

205
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,395
It's a very traditional,
   authentic Cuban dish.

206
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:44,696
So we're all browned up.

207
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,432
- Now who else jumps in the pool?
  -The Creole sauce.

208
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:49,034
Creole sauce
 into Cuban food?

209
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:51,837
Yeah, it's part of the Spanish
    influence in Cuba.

210
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,972
Green stuffed olives.

211
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,241
- My mouth is watering.

212
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,109
- Raisins.
 -Nice little sweetness there.

213
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,745
Little bit more saltiness,
     the capers.

214
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,314
Smells killer.

215
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,249
Tastes even better.

216
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,384
We serve it
    with rice and beans

217
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,886
and sweet plantains.

218
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,724
Mmm.

219
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,993
Mmm!
    That is awesome.

220
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,228
Good.
I'm glad you like it.

221
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,829
Little bit of saltiness
    from the caper

222
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,598
that was right there,
  sweetness of the raisin,

223
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,132
then some of the creaminess
    of the beans.

224
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,334
Ohh.

225
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,503
It's can it get to the face
    without falling?

226
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:27,439
Mmm.

227
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:29,941
He kept taking bites.

228
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,378
I know.

229
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,081
I can't let this go.
  Seriously, this is legit.

230
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,250
Ohh. Mmm.

231
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:40,085
And he got this smirk
  on the his face,

232
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:43,054
and he just kept
  taking more bites.

233
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,059
I will stab you
    with a fork.

234
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,629
And I thought to myself,

235
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:53,365
"Now, that's a compliment."

236
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,700
You've got frita, chiquita.

237
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:59,237
After "Triple D," I just kept
 wanting to make the dinner menu

238
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,939
as good as it could be.

239
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,240
Hello, hello.

240
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,542
Niki's priority

241
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:06,278
is to make sure
 that this is really authentic,

242
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:11,449
and she's always striving to
 continue to stay true to that.

243
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:14,920
And she managed to find a way
 to pack a ton of Cuban flavor

244
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:17,522
into a little snack
 with her new albóndigas,

245
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,457
which is an
  appetizer-sized version

246
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,293
of a traditional Cuban dish.

247
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:24,362
I was going
  for a particular flavor

248
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:27,265
that would be reminiscent
  of the Cuban burgers

249
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,501
that you taste
 when you're in Little Havana

250
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:31,303
in Miami, for example.

251
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:32,571
These Cuban meatballs

252
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,706
are a hearty combo
  of pork and beef

253
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,108
with a little kick
  of chorizo mixed in.

254
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,212
And then we season them with
 cumin, turmeric, and oregano.

255
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:44,115
But I hear it's her new
 homemade Cuban-inspired ketchup

256
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,518
that takes these meatballs
  to the next level.

257
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,020
One of the things that I love
  about that ketchup

258
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,522
is that there's no sugar in it.

259
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,424
Instead,
 it's more like a tomato sauce

260
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,126
that gets a spicy kick
 from the Aleppo peppers.

261
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:58,830
The albóndigas --
  Did I get that right?

262
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,031
I think it's
  a terrific flavor --

263
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:03,902
very chili-like,
  very dusky, rich.

264
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,304
As a Norwegian, you know,
who's used to Swedish meatballs,

265
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,540
this has just enough
  little zing to it

266
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,776
to make it interesting.

267
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,079
Mm, num, num,
     num, num.

268
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:17,549
We also got to check out
  Niki's coconut shrimp.

269
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,451
The best-seller
  is seasoned, battered,

270
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,785
and dusted with coconut

271
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,521
before getting pan-fried
  to a golden brown,

272
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:26,257
with tropical rice
 that packs a citrus punch.

273
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,593
If you like coconut,
  and if you like shrimp,

274
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,562
you cannot find
  a better combination.

275
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,864
It's really flavorful.
  It's really delicious.

276
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,433
It's really fresh.

277
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,902
It is bigger. It is busier.

278
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:41,373
The food is, believe it or not,
 better, so welcome back.

279
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,574
- Hi.
   -How are you?

280
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:44,109
Great. How are you?

281
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,311
I was able to hire more people

282
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,846
so that I didn't have to be here

283
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:51,116
from morning till night
  every single day.

284
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,417
- Let's hug.
  -Thank you. Okay!

285
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:55,553
We have to hug
  after each one of these.

286
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:57,022
Now I'm gonna take this
    and get in my car.

287
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,460
Now, that's what I like to hear.

288
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:05,864
Niki deserves to put her feet up
  every once in a while.

289
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,632
But coming up, there is no rest

290
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,501
for these two buddies
   in Portland.

291
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,536
Now, I thought their sandwiches
   were killer

292
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,004
when I first checked them out.

293
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,373
If you're gonna have a sandwich,
have a gourmet sandwich.

294
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,741
I don't even know if I want
 to call it gourmet.

295
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,510
- I want to call it funkalicious.
   -That's right.

296
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,712
But you won't believe
  the crazy concoctions

297
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:21,846
they're creating now.

298
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,581
It's killer. It's killer.

299
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:29,654
In 2009, I met a couple of dudes
who just love making sandwiches,

300
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,956
and they had some
 of the most killer combos

301
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,693
I think I've ever had
 between two slices of bread.

302
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:37,529
These days, they're blowing up
  all over Portland

303
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,164
with four different locations,

304
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,900
and their food
  is still outrageous.

305
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,035
This is Bunk Sandwiches.

306
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,574
- Chicken Parm.
 -I heard about Bunk Sandwiches.

307
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,943
It had been on "Diners,
  Drive-Ins & Dives"

308
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,378
and that I had to come here.

309
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,346
We got a fried chicken,
  add fries.

310
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:58,149
The best version of a sandwich
 you can possibly imagine.

311
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:01,086
With that ringing endorsement,
I couldn't wait to sink my teeth

312
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:03,121
into whatever owners
   Tommy Habetz

313
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,290
and Nick Wood were building.

314
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:06,658
Did you say "totally"
  or "deli"?

315
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,926
"Tolly."

316
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,928
- Totally deli?
  -Tolly.

317
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,796
Totally deli?

318
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,932
It was pretty wild
 the day that Guy showed up.

319
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:16,634
I didn't think we were a diner
 or a drive-in or a dive.

320
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:19,370
We were three months old.
  We were just babies.

321
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,706
And for us to be picked
  really meant something.

322
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,308
"Bunkity bunk bunk"?

323
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,576
I dig it.

324
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,810
Can I be
 skunkity-bunkity?

325
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,779
I'm not sure.
    Yeah, you could.

326
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:30,081
Their food was out of bounds!

327
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,417
Let's see.
 I had the red beans and rice...

328
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,651
This is dynamite.

329
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:34,886
...the pork belly Reuben...

330
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,354
Look at that.

331
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,522
You guys are great, man.

332
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:40,225
...and the oldie but goodie,
   the salt cod.

333
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,426
Now, it's not something
   that I see

334
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,461
on a lot
 of "Triple D" joint menus,

335
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:47,098
but the next time you see it,
 you got to check it out.

336
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,033
We're going to make a puree
     out of it.

337
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,602
- Out of the fish?
  -Out of the fish,

338
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,370
with a little bit
    of mashed potato.

339
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:53,872
Just what I thought
 I would be getting

340
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:56,074
when I pulled into
this local sandwich shop.

341
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,244
That's<i> crazy.</i>

342
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:00,578
There's so many
 components to it.

343
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,981
If you're gonna have a sandwich,
have a gourmet sandwich.

344
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,883
That's -- I don't even know
if I want to call it gourmet.

345
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:07,552
- I want to call it funkalicious.
   -That's right.

346
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:11,256
I don't know who I spoke with on
the phone for the original show,

347
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:12,457
but, you know,
  I went through a list

348
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,892
of all the sandwiches
   that we did.

349
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:16,461
And we did
  the salt cod sandwich,

350
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,630
and then we did
  the pork belly Reuben.

351
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:19,898
Those were the ones
   that jumped out

352
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,367
because they were kind of
 different and interesting,

353
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,702
but they were really just
 specials that we were running.

354
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:27,305
And even though they're
 still not on the daily menu,

355
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,641
don't worry, 'cause there's
  plenty to choose from

356
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,910
that really stack up.

357
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,112
We change
  the menu up constantly.

358
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:36,548
There were certain ones
 that people wanted repeatedly,

359
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,882
like the Italian.

360
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:40,151
Italian cured meats,
     table four.

361
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,853
The Italian cured meats --

362
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,823
Bunk's signature twist
  on the Italian sub.

363
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,858
We're going to season
 the bread a little bit with oil

364
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,226
and red wine vinegar.

365
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:49,727
Next thing we're going to do
   is lay down

366
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:52,497
some provolone piccante --
  a sharper provolone --

367
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,065
salami, capicola,

368
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:57,502
some beautiful ham that we use,
 smoked in Eastern Oregon.

369
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,805
Then Bunk's hot pepper
 infused lettuce goes on top.

370
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:04,275
That's a mix of peperoncini
  and hot cherry peppers.

371
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:08,046
It's got these pickled onions
  and peppers on there

372
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:11,115
that give it just
 the right amount of spice.

373
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:13,051
It's got a lot of richness
   in the meats.

374
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,586
Just can't stop eating it.

375
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:17,989
They've also upped their
side game, like this Latin twist

376
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,191
on your favorite
  school lunch staple --

377
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,594
the mole tot.

378
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:25,530
First thing we're going
 to do is caramelize the onions.

379
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,833
Ground tomatoes here,
  hydrated chilies.

380
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:32,670
And it wouldn't be mole
  without dark chocolate.

381
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:33,872
The tots are done.

382
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,274
We give it some of that
 mole sauce right on top.

383
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:39,410
Next, we're going to give it
 some crema, some avocados,

384
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,913
and to finish,
  some Cotija cheese.

385
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:44,215
One of our most popular dishes
  here at Bunk Bar.

386
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,017
I think Tommy's
  being a little modest.

387
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,753
I hear they go through over
 100 orders of these a week.

388
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,722
I've eaten my weight
   in those tots.

389
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,090
This is body by tots.

390
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:54,826
It's got a great sweetness
  and a good spice

391
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,628
and bite to it.

392
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,830
Insert music.

393
00:14:58,832 --> 00:14:59,898
Oh, yeah.

394
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:05,503
Stop music.

395
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,372
We're makin' bacon.

396
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:09,507
Want to try it?
 Oh, it is so good.

397
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,709
Bunk also isn't
  the hard-to-find joint

398
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,078
that it was back when
 I came here the first time.

399
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,714
Just across the Morrison Bridge
  from downtown Portland

400
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:19,350
and across the street from
 the Oregon Ballet Theater --

401
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,185
Now, I give you these specific
  driving instructions

402
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,454
'cause I drove
  by the joint twice.

403
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,323
They've got four places
   around town,

404
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:28,159
and there's no sign
  of slowing down.

405
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:31,329
When I come back to Portland,
    I'm coming to Bunk.

406
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,965
He promised to come back
 through, and now he has.

407
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,300
Load the trunk
  when you go to the Bunk.

408
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:36,768
That's right.
 We got a table here for you.

409
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,903
God. I'm going to make up all my
Bunk words and send them to you.

410
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,441
Bunk, chunk, hunk, lunk --

411
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,376
I'm still working on that list,
  but don't worry.

412
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:46,844
When I'm finished,
 I'll get it to you guys.

413
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:47,946
Coming up next...

414
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,514
What is this hippie
 mayonnaise called?

415
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:51,182
I'm going to start calling it
    hippie mayonnaise.

416
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,184
Not your average
  "Triple D" joint,

417
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:56,254
this little place in Jackson
  is still big on flavor

418
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:59,057
and hitting the big time
 with a whole new location.

419
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,327
Holy Bombay bowl.

420
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:08,366
So, back in 2014, I popped into
 a place in Jackson, Wyoming...

421
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,568
Thai noodles!
 ...that was doing exactly

422
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,771
what you'd expect in Jackson --
 100% organic everything.

423
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,473
Veggie burger
    with quinoa!

424
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,942
But don't think that means
  it's short on taste.

425
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:21,612
Believe me -- This place is
still in Flavortown city limits.

426
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,651
Vegan lasagna!

427
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,554
It's fresh, it's healthy,
 and it tastes delicious.

428
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,255
- Ooh, that looks delicious.
  -Elk biscuits and gravy

429
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:32,957
with the gluten-free biscuit.

430
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,259
My wife and I
 were watching "Triple D,"

431
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:36,828
and we saw Chef Amy.

432
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,198
And we actually scheduled
  our vacation around it.

433
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,100
You know, for what
 "Triple D" is, Lotus is --

434
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,602
it's pretty different.
 Soak our grains and legumes,

435
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:47,438
for crying out loud,
  and sprout things.

436
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,441
I heard the Bombay bowl
  was, well, the bomb,

437
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,643
so I had to see
 what that was all about.

438
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,379
- So this is the Bombay bowl.
    -So --

439
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,247
Bombay bowl.
 So you can get it
 any way you want?

440
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,583
You can get it with tofu --
Yeah, you can get it just as-is,

441
00:16:58,585 --> 00:16:59,684
or you can add tempeh.

442
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,319
Tempe, Arizona?

443
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,520
- You --
  -Ba-dum-bum. Thanks.

444
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,355
Be here all week.

445
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,657
So, today, we're making it
     with bison.

446
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,926
- This is some vegan mayonnaise.
  -Essentially, yeah.

447
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,762
What is this hippie
 mayonnaise called?

448
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:13,898
I'm going to start calling it
  hippie mayonnaise, but, um,

449
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,367
I call it kind of
  veggie rainbow mayonnaise.

450
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,502
Veggie rainbow.

451
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:20,671
I think Guy's excitement
 and his passion for food

452
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,440
was really contagious for me.

453
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,275
What the hell am I doing?
What do you need help with?
 What are you doing?

454
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:26,110
- What am I doing?
  -Get the onions in!

455
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,745
I'm like, really --

456
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,280
You're making
     me nervous!

457
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:30,915
The bison spice mixture.

458
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,384
A little cayenne in there,
as well, the chili powder.

459
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,586
- Exactly.
  -And the "xactly."

460
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,588
And the love.

461
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,724
The brown basmati, put down
   the sautéed veggies,

462
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,526
baby spinach, carrots.

463
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:42,860
- Got it.
   -Fresh mango.

464
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,729
Mango tango.

465
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,932
Holy Bombay bowl.

466
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,501
Super flavorful.
Not bland, not boring.

467
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,670
The thing that I'm actually
 most wowed about

468
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:56,074
is that vegetarian
 mayo concoction.

469
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:59,510
It adds such a nice,
velvety texture. Killer.

470
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,446
There was
 this big construction project

471
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:02,780
going on across the street.

472
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,115
This is Amy.
    She's the owner.

473
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,784
And Guy rounded up
some of the construction workers

474
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,753
and served them our bison.

475
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,154
- Wow, that's delicious.
   -Oh, it's good.

476
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,856
Out of bounds, man.

477
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:14,525
And the reaction
  was really positive.

478
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,060
And they were like,
  "Oh, I had no idea

479
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,895
organic food
  could taste so good."

480
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,564
Made me stoked.

481
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:21,032
We say it on "Triple D"
 all the time.

482
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,934
If it's funky,
 I'll find it.

483
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,936
Got to check this out.

484
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,437
People were coming in,
    asking,

485
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,706
"What are the dishes
  that you made for Guy?"

486
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,642
There's been an enormous amount
 of, like, recipe requests.

487
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,845
We would just tell them,
 you know, just come and see us.

488
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:36,481
We're not going anywhere.
If anything, we're going bigger.

489
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,649
And, boy, did she ever.

490
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:42,019
The quaint, little Lotus Cafe
 moved one block over and became

491
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:45,957
the bigger, more spacious
 Lotus Organic Restaurant.

492
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,726
So, we're more
  than double our size.

493
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:49,827
And that gave her space

494
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,196
to create even more
  righteous recipes,

495
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:55,133
like the elk sausage
  biscuits and gravy.

496
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,300
Elk biscuits and gravy

497
00:18:56,302 --> 00:19:00,004
is one of our most popular
  breakfast items.

498
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,373
The elk sausage
is locally seasoned and sourced,

499
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,208
and the gravy
  is made all in-house

500
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,644
with a blend of coconut milk
  and amaranth flour.

501
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,614
The elk gravy is unique
  in that it's non-dairy.

502
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,382
It tastes really good
  with the biscuits.

503
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,284
That had a fantastic flavor,

504
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:14,919
things that are hard
   to recreate.

505
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,621
The foundation of Lotus
   is organic

506
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:17,922
and then something for everyone,

507
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:21,259
that if it tastes good
 prepared in this unique way,

508
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:22,693
then it will go on the menu.

509
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:25,229
And her new vegan lasagna
  passes the taste test

510
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:26,464
with flying colors.

511
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:29,200
No meat, no dairy,
  but full of flavor.

512
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:31,469
We use French lentils.
 They're something that you can

513
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,371
sort of I guess
  sink your teeth into.

514
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:36,807
And people go nuts over
 Amy's homemade cashew cheese.

515
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,677
She soaks and blends
 the cashews, garlic, and salt

516
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,680
until it has the consistency
 of a soft ricotta cheese.

517
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,683
The lasagna noodles are ready.
 We'll start layering it.

518
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,652
Vegan lasagna,
  gluten-free bread.

519
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:50,788
It's pasta, noodles.
  It's done just right.

520
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,223
It's hard to tell
  it's even vegan.

521
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,592
It just tastes so hearty
 and filling and delicious.

522
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:01,265
So, it was an exciting time
 when "Triple D" contacted me,

523
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:04,068
because, days before
  the actual shoot,

524
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,670
I found out I was pregnant.

525
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,872
Now I feel like
 it's kind of coming full circle

526
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,675
now that Leo is 3,
 the same age that Jeff was

527
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,109
at the time of the first shoot.

528
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,744
- Congratulations. You are --
   -You bet.

529
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,880
I don't know what you're
doing next time you're
 in Jackson Hole,

530
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,616
besides snowmobiling
or hiking with seaweed snacks,

531
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,084
but when you have a chance,

532
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,253
make sure you make time
to come down to Lotus Cafe.

533
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,121
Girl's off the hook!

534
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:27,992
That's right.

535
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,129
So, what more could you ask for?

536
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:34,532
I mean, a blinged-out
   Cubano joint,

537
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,834
an O.G. "Triple D" diner,

538
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:39,103
a talk-of-the-town
   sandwich shop,

539
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:42,139
and an organic joint
 that's really keeping it real.

540
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:44,342
Well, that's it for this
 road trip, but don't you worry.

541
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:46,477
We got plenty more joints
   to look back on

542
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,080
all over the "Triple D Nation."

543
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,882
We come in here and we sing

544
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:54,085
Come on!

545
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:58,823
That we do.
