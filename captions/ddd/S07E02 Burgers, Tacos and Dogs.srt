GO, OKAY.                       
        WE KINDA LET THAT SIMMER
            FOR A LITTLE BIT.   

273
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:47,218
   A LITTLE BIT OF CHICKEN STOCK
            AND THEN...         
THAT'S THE MAGIC?               

274
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,620
                     ABUELITA...
MEXICAN CHOCOLATE.              

275
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,222
 A LITTLE SALT, AND WE LET THAT 
  SIMMER FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES.  

276
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:54,492
NOW WHAT DOES THIS MOLE         
TYPICALLY GET SERVED ON?        
       TURKEY, WHICH IS A VERY  
     TRADITIONAL DISH IN MEXICO.

277
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,694
       GO INTO RURAL MEXICO--   
     THERE'S TURKEYS EVERYWHERE.

278
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,364
            OKAY, SO THE RICE   
        AND THE TURKEY ARE DONE,

279
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,833
       AND THEN WE HIT THE MOLE.
A LITTLE TOASTED SESAME SEED.   

280
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,135
         MMM, DUDE. REALLY NICE,
            GREAT COMPLEXITY.

00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,905
        GET THE VINEGAR,        
 GET THE SPICE, THE TANG OF IT. 

282
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,641
       MMM. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE 
        AN ORCHESTRA OF FLAVOR. 

283
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,576
           AND THAT RIGHT THERE,
               I DON'T KNOW     

284
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,445
       IF IT'S THE PHILHARMONIC,
         OR IF IT'S METALLICA,  

285
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,246
     BUT THAT RIGHT THERE JAMS. 
                MMM.            

286
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,048
            THE MOLES           
   HAVE MORE OF A RICH TASTE.   

287
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,317
             POZOLE DE MARISCOS.
       THE FOOD'S GREAT.        

288
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,253
    FRESH, CLEAN, DELICIOUS.    
             DO YOU ALWAYS ORDER
               THE SAME THING?  

289
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,255
 NO, THERE'S TOO MUCH           
GOOD STUFF ON THE MENU          

290
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,257
TO ALWAYS ORDER                 
THE SAME THING.                 
            (Bryce) TWO FAJITAS.

291
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,926
      THEY DO SOME THINGS       
     A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY.      
GOTTA ADD OUR OWN               
LITTLE FLAVOR TO IT.            

292
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,729
JUST HAVE A TACO HERE           
    IS DIFFERENT                

293
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,530
THAN A TACO EXPERIENCE          
  SOMEWHERE ELSE...             
       <i> LIKE THIS ONE...</i>        

294

           <i> WITH DUCK</i>           
       <i> INSTEAD OF PORK.</i>        

295
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,069
        I GOT DUCK TACO.        
WHERE DO YOU FIND DUCK          
  ON A MEXICAN MENU?            

296
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,071
   DUCK IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS  
         WHERE, I THINK,        

297
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,873
      SOME PEOPLE KINDA GO,     
   "DUCK--HEY, I'M NOT SURE."   

298
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,609
   BUT ONCE THEY HAVE 'EM...    
IT'S ACTUALLY MY FAVORITE THING 
          ON THE MENU.          

299

AND THE VINEGAR'S GONNA         
    KINDA RELEASE               

304
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:59,490
SOME OF THAT STUFF IN THERE     
 AND GET THEM KINDA SOFT.       
                   OKAY.        
           "SOME OF THAT STUFF"?

305
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,492

          HOW LONG DOES THIS GO?

308
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,366
ABOUT HALF AN HOUR OR SO.       
                  OKAY. BUT LOOK
                 AT THE PEPPERS,

309
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:11,236

     BY SOAKING IN THE VINEGAR. 

310

PUT SOME OF THAT IN A BLENDER,  
ADD A LITTLE LIQUID IN THERE.   

312

      GO FULL SPEED. YOU ANIMAL.
THERE WE GO. LOOK OUT.          

313
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:22,513
           OKAY, CAN I TRY THIS?
              THAT'S KILLER.    

314
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,449
   I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY CALL IT
        "HAMBURGER HELPER."     

315
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,517
         I THINK IT TASTES GREAT
             JUST BY ITSELF.    
(laughs)                        

316
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:29,386
ADD A LITTLE OIL, THEN WE PUT   
  THAT ON THE STOVE AGAIN,      

317
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:31,723
      WE DO A LITTLE SAUTé      
TO KINDA RELEASE ALL THAT STUFF,

318
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,725

           BRING THE FLAVORS UP.

319
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,593
THEN WE TAKE DUCK BREAST,       
       CHOP IT UP.              

320
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,263
  THEN WE JUST TAKE THAT,       
MARINATE IT WITH THE PASTOR.    
         WE'LL MIXY, MIXY, MIXY.

321
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,632
                  AND HOW LONG  
               DOES IT MARINATE?
 IT DOESN'T HAVE                
TO SIT REAL LONG.               

322
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:43,201

  THAT WE MAKE HERE.            

323

  PUT A LITTLE OIL IN THERE...

325
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,675
                SO I DO NOT SEE 
               A TORTILLA PRESS.
WE DON'T HAVE ONE.              

326
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,010
         YOU KNOW, YOU CAN GO   
       TO MEXICO AND GET THESE.

329
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,750
KIND FLATTEN IT OUT             
   A LITTLE BIT.                
        GIVE A LITTLE PATTY-PAT.

330
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,552

                 WE'LL ADD      
           A LITTLE WATER TO IT.
THE TORTILLAS ARE SO BIG,       
THEY LOOK LIKE PANCAKES.        

336
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:17,701
 PUTTING A LITTLE BIT

        RIGHT. I THINK THE DUCK 
       IS READY HERE, TORTILLAS.

          NOT GREASY AT ALL.    
EIGHT MINUTES IN A FRYER?       

394
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,413
    IT'S LIGHT AND CRUNCHY LIKE 
    NOTHING YOU EVER HAD, OKAY? 

395
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,616

IT TAKES ABOUT EIGHT MINUTES    
     IN THE DEEP FRYER,         

398
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:52,023
    AND THIS IS                 
WHAT HAPPENS TO IT.             
           IT LOOKS INTERESTING.

         IT WAS GREAT.          
         I NEVER THOUGHT        
 THERE COULD BE A DOG LIKE THIS.

430
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,229

      A BACON-WRAPPED HOT DOG?  

464
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,245
THE MARKET JUST WENT UP         
  ON DOGS AND BACON.            

465
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:30,047

                    THAT'S OKAY.

466

              NATURAL SWEETNESS.

THAT'S RIGHT.

     EVERYTHING YOU OWN IN THIS?
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.               

513

       TO BIND IT.

       THE DOG TOGETHER.        
           WE LOVE IT SO MUCH.

      CHILI, ONIONS AND MUSTARD.

543
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,466

  OH, FOR SURE.                 
THIS IS TERRIFIC.               

544
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,134
           AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK,
             SOMEBODY COMES UP  

545
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,470
    AND SAYS, "IT'S THE BEST DOG
     I EVER HAD... IN MY LIFE." 
REALLY?                         

546
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,472
           SO WAS THAT          
  A KILLER ROAD TRIP, OR WHAT?  

547
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,207
