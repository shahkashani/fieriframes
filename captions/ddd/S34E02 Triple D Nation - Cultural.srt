  checked out in that one city

       This is ridiculous, dude.

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,683
        But it turns out,       
   it was only the beginning,   

8
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,485
    because "Triple D" joints   
      have been blowing up,

00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:22,888

   Nice hot grill.              

453
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,040
        Cut it into a butterfly.

    [ Chuckles ]                
    Look at that.               

455
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,577
    Because I'm a starch junkie,
                  you know      

456
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,313
               I've got to go   
         after this pilaf first.

457
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:32,116
                [ Chuckles ]    
     Great texture, very creamy,

458
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,785
             handmade by the guy
             in the dress shirt.

459
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,988
                You've got to   
               check this out.  

460
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,124
             FIERI:             
  These days, that dress shirt  
  has seen a little less action 

461
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:44,595
   since the Prince's son Aziz  
   has taken over the kitchen.  

462
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:48,265
 Aziz is doing a fantastic job. 
      He cooks everything.      

463
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,734
         He came up with        
       his own new dishes.      

464
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,470
           FIERI: Like          
  the Prince Lebanese special.  

465
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,605
            It is our           
     flame-grilled sampler.     

466
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,874
        We'll start first       
     with our Kefta kebabs.     

467
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,475
   We got some fresh parsley,   

468
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,945
      rough chopped onions,     
      jalapeño and garlic.      

469
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,814
     Add in our seasonings.     

470
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,150
 We're going to dump it straight
  on top with the ground beef,  

471
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:09,020
      and we're going to do     
  fresh parsley, diced onions.  

472
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:11,288
  Hand mix it, and we're going  
       to shape our kebabs      

473
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,957
       and get them ready       
         for the grill.         

474
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,893
  Next thing we're going to do  
      is our chicken kebab.     

475
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,028
     We call it shish taouk.    

476
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,562
     We're going to go ahead    
     and start with yogurt,     

477
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:23,434
 a little onion, a couple whole 
  lemons, garlic and jalapeños. 

478
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,636
    It's going to have curry,   
      oregano, lemon pepper     

479
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,572
        and a whole bunch       
      of other seasonings.      

480
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:29,040
    We're going to pour this    
         directly on top        

481
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,108
     of our chicken breasts     
         and marinade it        

482
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,578
         and let it sit         
       for about 24 hours.      

483
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,447
          To finish out         
  the Prince Lebanese special,  

484
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,183
  we're going to have our steak 
medallions and our mechoui lamb.

485
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,385
    This is the same marinade   
        we did with Guy.        

486
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:42,653
 We're going to start grilling. 

487
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,055
 We're going to add our meats --
      shish-taouk chicken,      

488
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,390
      boneless leg of lamb,     

489
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:50,461
    and the tower-fillet beef   
 medallion, ground-beef kebabs. 

490
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,930
     We're going to plate it    
    with our vermicelli rice.   

491
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:55,266
    Finish with a little bit    
    of fresh chopped parsley.   

492
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,268
    Prince Lebanese special.    

493
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,469
     MAN: I like the spice.     

494
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,272
       I really like lamb,      
      and the beef as well,     

495
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,074
   it's like a velvet texture.  

496
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:04,942
       It's all so juicy.       
          It's not dry.         

497
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:07,078
  The chicken has got the good  
       heavy grill marks.       

498
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,215
    Anything with grill marks   
       is good in my book.      

499
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:13,150
             Mm! Do you airmail?
              Load a trunk up?  

500
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,019
I'll drive it up there          
      for you.                  

501
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:18,222
        When Guy came in,       
   this was it, 32 seats only,  

502
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:21,692
       and from that time       
   it just went unbelievable.   

503
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,761
     Now we seat about 150.     

504
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,030
      FIERI: And more seats     
   means more folks eating up   

505
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,833
    those cultural classics.    

506

             WOMAN:             
   Chicken shawarma is great.   

507
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,569
     It's my favorite thing     
          on the menu.          

508
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,304
 It's what I've always ordered. 

509
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:36,106
  It's what I always recommend. 

510
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,175
     This is one of our most    
        popular entrees.        

511
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,111
Diced chicken, just a little bit
          of olive oil          

512
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:42,246
        and corn oil mix,       
      apple cider vinegar,      

513
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,582
       the family's recipe      
   on the shawarma seasoning.   

514
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:47,118
       It's seasoned salt,      
        cinnamon, nutmeg,       

515
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,054
   cumin powder, white pepper,  
    red pepper, black pepper.   

516
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:51,655
     We're going to roll it     
      around a little bit.      

517
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,725
  This marinade is going to sit 
          for 24 hours.         

518
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:57,862
 We're going to add our onions, 
   lemon juice and garlic on,   

519
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,864
       fresh diced tomato,      
       shawarma seasoning,      

520
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:03,267
        touch of the oil,       
      house-made hot sauce.     

521
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,003
       Shawarma plate up.       

522
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,706
  The chicken is always juicy,  
        cooked perfectly.

00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,341
            WOMAN #2:           
  You really get a lot of spice 

524
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:13,344
        and a little kick       
   of almost sweet at the end,  

525
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:16,413
     and the rice is cooked     
           perfectly.           

526
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,748
   -Prince, I've had a blast.   
        -Thank you, sir.        

527

     The Prince and his heir    
 are definitely still cooking up
