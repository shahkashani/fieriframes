1
00:00:01,035 --> 00:00:02,001
Hey, there.

2
00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:03,469
I'm Guy Fieri,
  and we're rolling out

3
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:06,872
looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,707
This trip...
  Whoo-whoo!

5
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,042
...we're going East Coast...

6
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:11,076
Brilliant!

7
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,411
...West Coast...
    Look at this guy.

8
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:13,312
...and Great Lakes.

9
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:14,680
Well, me likey.

10
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:17,149
Like, with a jazzed-up classic
  in Norfolk, Virginia...

11
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:20,052
This is a really nice,
mature grilled cheese.

12
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:22,054
...a rocking Reuben
  in Lansing, Michigan...

13
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:23,622
That's never
 a bad thing.

14
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,491
...and in a Los Angeles
   market...

15
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:26,525
Gorgeous.

16
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,394
...tostadas
  with a towering twist.

17
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:30,496
Look at
   that bite right there.

18
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:32,431
That's all right here,
   right now

19
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,534
on "Diners, Drive-ins
   & Dives."

20
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,650
I'm here in the Old Town area
  of Lansing, Michigan,

21
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,719
where an old-school
  heavy metal rocker...

22
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:54,887
Whoo-hoo!

23
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,788
...is smoking anything
 he can get his hands on.

24
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,724
Meat, that is.
   It's his band.

25
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:00,159
It's his way.

26
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:02,895
And from what I hear, everybody
 comes back for the encore.

27
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:06,432
This is Meat BBQ.

28
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,303
Everything's great,
 so it's always hard

29
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,604
to choose
 when you come here.

30
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,339
A made-to-order
   mac and cheese.

31
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:15,707
Sauce on a heifer.

32
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,309
I've lived in Texas,
 I've lived in New Mexico,

33
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,678
and we've had great barbecue,
  but nothing compares.

34
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,780
Chin-Gorilla in the window!
   Let's go!

35
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,116
I'm a big fan of music.

36
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:25,717
There's a bunch
 of rock 'n' roll stuff in here.

37
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,187
So showed up once
  and kept coming back.

38
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:30,856
Yep, this joint's a
 rock 'n' roll fantasy amplified

39
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,491
by Sean Johnson's 'cue.

40
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,692
I wanted to be
  a professional musician.

41
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,060
That didn't work out.

42
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:35,994
So I was like, "Okay, I got
  to figure out something."

43
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:37,062
- Well, so did I.
    -Yeah.

44
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,063
But my lack of
being able to play...

45
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:42,768
So what kind of
 barbecue do you do?

46
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,970
I stick with, like,
 the traditional Southern style.

47
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:46,505
I just pull from all
   the different regions.

48
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,841
- The Pork Belly Reuben.
  -Pork Belly Reuben.

49
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:51,310
They got brisket, pork belly,
 thousand island dressing

50
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:53,579
in there,
  and it tastes amazing.

51
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:54,847
Give me
 the breakdown here.

52
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,915
Today we're making our
    pork belly pastrami

53
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,383
that we use for our
    Pork Belly Reuben.

54
00:01:58,486 --> 00:02:00,486
I like using pork belly
 'cause it's unctuous and fatty

55
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:01,787
and it just kind of slides
   down your throat.

56
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:03,755
You know how to
 spell "unctuous"?

57
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:05,891
U-n-x, something,
   something, something.

58
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,593
- You know how I spell it?
   -What's that?

59
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:08,694
Wrong every time.

60
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:12,798
We're gonna start out with some
  kosher salt, brown sugar

61
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,366
to make our brine
    for our belly.

62
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,734
Curing salt.
   -Got it.

63
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:16,768
Pickling spice.

64
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:17,836
A little bit of minced
    garlic here.

65
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,771
And water on it.
     Mix it up.

66
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:22,741
Got a good rhythm
 going there.

67
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:23,709
Pork belly.

68
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:24,943
- Into the brine?
    -Yep.

69
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:26,745
That's gonna sit in there
  for about 10 to 14 days.

70
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,480
- Pull it out, dry-rub it?
 -I just do some black pepper.

71
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:30,215
And how long we gonna
 smoke it for?

72
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,483
About 10 to 12 hours.

73
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:34,486
We use a mesquite overnight,
   about 170, 180 degrees.

74
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:35,654
Really low and slow.

75
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,623
So we get some
    good smoke on it.

76
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:38,891
Next up?

77
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,360
This is our basic house rub --
  granulated garlic,

78
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,328
kosher salt,
    black pepper,

79
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,830
some white sugar,
    chili powder.

80
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:45,931
Okay.

81
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,766
Nice, big brisket.
    -Yep.

82
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,334
That's the dry rub
all over the brisket?

83
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:50,435
Yep.

84
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:51,870
And how long's this
 gonna go down?

85
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,238
We use temperature
     as a guide

86
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,339
to kind of get us
    in the ball park,

87
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:57,242
but everything
    is done by feel.

88
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,444
That's our finished belly
  right there.

89
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:01,813
And then there's our fat,
  old brisket.

90
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,081
There's the money shot.

91
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:04,583
Be a shame not to try that.

92
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,087
That just melted
     completely.

93
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,589
Unctuous.

94
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,957
The perfect time
    to use the word.

95
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:13,926
I'm gonna throw this
 pork belly on the grill here

96
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,227
and let that go
    for a little while.

97
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,596
Butter up some rye buns.
   -Rye not?

98
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,964
Gonna toss on our kraut.

99
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,399
Swiss cheese.

100
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,735
Take some of that brisket,
  toss it on the bun there.

101
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,103
Take our pork belly.

102
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:28,140
This kraut.

103
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:30,976
This is a house-made
    thousand island.

104
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,644
It's an unctuous mess.

105
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,181
It's great.

106
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:37,249
Really good pastrami.

107
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,151
Just the right amount
 of sauerkraut.

108
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:40,219
Great rye.

109
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,787
I like that you cut it
  a little bit

110
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,989
with the beefiness
 of the brisket.

111
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,858
Chunks of pickle
inside the thousand island.

112
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:51,697
Basically, what you've got
 is pastrami bacon.

113
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:52,631
Yeah.

114
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,099
And that's
 never a bad thing.

115
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,834
- I'll take that.
  -You should take it.

116
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:58,937
'Cause this is fantastic.
   -Thanks, man.

117
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,372
Pork belly's working.

118
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:02,674
Every time I eat it, I find
 something else in the sandwich

119
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,676
that just explodes in my mouth.

120
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:05,911
Every once in a while,
I get to cruise a town

121
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,379
and find one of your
 Food Network Star

122
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,948
buddies, and this is
the one and only Adrian.

123
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,316
Have you ever been
 to Meat BBQ?

124
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,517
Quite a few times.

125
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,685
You don't look like you
eat here very often.

126
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,087
Once in a while,
    you must do it.

127
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,421
You got to go big.

128
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,890
But it's not just
 the meat taking center stage.

129
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:21,927
The pickle fries are at
another level of ridiculous.

130
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,895
We had a fry slicer
   we weren't using.

131
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:24,930
One night,
    we started getting

132
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,298
a little crazy
    and a little kooky,

133
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,733
and we started throwing
   pickles through them.

134
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,234
Just cornmeal and...

135
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:32,971
It's like cornmeal with sugar,
  salt, and Cajun seasoning.

136
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,840
Top three best pickle
fries I've ever had.

137
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,475
And the wings
  aren't bad, either.

138
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:37,976
Smoked Wings -- black magic.

139
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:39,945
They're crispy.
 They're juicy. They're hot.

140
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:41,046
When you can actually
  just feel

141
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,682
the chicken fall
 right off the bone.

142
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,784
- What are we doing?
 -Our brine for our wings.

143
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,119
We're gonna do
    some hot sauce.

144
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:52,024
Kosher salt, white sugar, plain,
   old Michigan tap water.

145
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,660
I'm just gonna place
  these right into the brine.

146
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,695
These are our chicken wings
 that we've brined overnight.

147
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,031
Hit them with the dry rub
that we hit the brisket with.

148
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,932
- Absolutely.
 -In the smoker for how long?

149
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:03,902
For about an hour
  and a half to two hours.

150
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:05,604
When the come out,
we fry them before service?

151
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,105
Yeah.

152
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,107
You have all these
different wing sauces.

153
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:12,277
We have your traditional Kansas
  City style barbecue sauce,

154
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,413
Carolina mustard,
    hot garlic sauce.

155
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,048
This is our
    Cherry Bomb Sauce.

156
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,416
We're gonna start
  with some cherries here.

157
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,251
Ginger ale --
    a native product.

158
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:20,719
A little ketchup.

159
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:21,920
Chipotles and adobo.

160
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,889
- Word to that.
 -Michigan cherry preserves.

161
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,257
A little bit of apple
    cider vinegar.

162
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,825
Simmer for about
    a half an hour.

163
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:30,462
And then we're gonna run it
 in just a regular, old blender.

164
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:33,965
Throw in some wings,
 a little bit of Cherry Bomb.

165
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:37,035
A little bit of the Black Magic,
  which is a coffee sauce.

166
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,972
Well, me likey.

167
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:44,743
I mean, that's like when
 you're lucky enough

168
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,578
to get one of those wings off
that roasted chicken

169
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,614
that your grandma made,

170
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:50,649
that's that wing.

171
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:51,650
Great flavor.

172
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:54,086
I think that the cherry
  and chipotle

173
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,921
is gangster and delicious,

174
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,456
but this...

175
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:58,590
Yeah, it's the Black Magic.

176
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,658
...and it's outrageous.

177
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,625
Killed it.
    Thanks, man.

178
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:01,893
Outstanding.

179
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,096
I got the smoked wings
  and the Black Magic Sauce.

180
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:07,032
Absolutely my hands-down
  favorite thing to eat

181
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,500
in and around town.

182
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:10,669
So I figured if we're gonna
come down here to Meat BBQ,

183
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:13,138
we got to bring in some
barbecue aficionados.

184
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,042
Two of my buddies from
Motley Que -- MikeyZ and T-Rex.

185
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:19,277
Nobody eats wings
in a white shirt, by the way.

186
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,146
You got to be careful.
   You need a bib, but...

187
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,482
- What do you think?
 -I like the spice on this.

188
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,150
And the sauces
   are just incredible.

189
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,252
I mean, it's
  competition-level barbecue.

190
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:28,987
I'd eat this all day long.

191
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,322
Ribs in the window.

192
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:31,356
No joke.

193
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,891
Definitely
 the bomb dot com.

194
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:36,595
If you had played music 1/10th
as good as you make food,

195
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:37,863
we'd be going to
 all your concerts.

196
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:38,697
This is my concert.

197
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:39,965
This is my rock stardom.

198
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,501
Good night, East Lansing!

199
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:46,772
Next up...

200
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:49,007
I got good news,
    and I got bad news.

201
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:52,344
The good news is outrageous
  Mexican in Los Angeles.

202
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:53,678
That's fantastic.

203
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:56,748
The bad news is I might
 eat myself into a power nap.

204
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,950
I haven't had to bust out
   the hunch in a while.

205
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,051
This one might deserve it.

206
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,655
Whoo-whoo!

207
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,090
That's the train
into Flavortown, baby.

208
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,592
There you go.

209
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,300
The next time you come to LA,
 you got to check this out.

210
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,402
It's called
   Grand Central Market.

211
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,137
Here's the deal --
 They got all these great,

212
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,440
little restaurant booths --
 anything you can imagine.

213
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:22,541
But one place in particular --

214
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:23,775
I just happen to be
  cruising through,

215
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,076
and I meet this young chef.

216
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:26,378
I start to get his story.

217
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,846
I'm telling you it's gonna
   blow you away.

218
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,948
You're gonna love the dude,
 and this is his joint --

219
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,584
La Tostadería.

220
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,255
Four Patrona Burgers all day!

221
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:38,723
It's the best seafood in LA.

222
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,425
Fish and shrimp taco
  ready to plate, chef.

223
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,694
The food is fresh.
   It's flavorful.

224
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,629
- This is Shrimp Ceviche.
   -Thank you.

225
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,598
I definitely think that this
  restaurant stands out

226
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,799
in Grand Central Market.

227
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,668
That's because it's run
   by this cat --

228
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,102
Fernando Villagomez.

229
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:53,104
Three more minutes
   on the burgers!

230
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:55,874
He moved from Mexico
 to Canada when he was 21

231
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,376
and eventually opened up
  his first taqueria.

232
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,611
So you're there
    for five years,

233
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:00,812
and then you come
   to the United States.

234
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,052
Far end of the market.

235
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,354
He does carnitas.

236
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:10,622
Only carnitas.

237
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,724
After six years of killing it
  with the carnitas,

238
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:13,892
Fernando hit a wall.

239
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:14,993
I'm always thinking, like,

240
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:18,263
I have to have more skills
  in the kitchen,

241
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:21,333
so I say, "You know what,
I have to go back to school

242
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:25,070
to learn more about food,
about cuisine, flavor profile."

243
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,939
And after all that schooling,
  he opened up this joint

244
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,075
and threw his lessons
  right into the menu.

245
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,977
Octopus Tostada up!

246
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,812
The Octopus Tostada --
  It's very bright.

247
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:37,115
It's a fried tortilla with a
 mound of deliciousness on top.

248
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:39,484
It's got peppers in it.
 It's got your cherry tomatoes.

249
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,419
It's got your texture
 that you need from the octopus.

250
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,089
I love octopus.
    Let me see it.

251
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,993
Water, sake -- give you
 that Asian flavor,

252
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:51,196
but still you have the flavor
profile of the Mexican cuisine.

253
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,231
And you learned about Asian food
  when you were at school?

254
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,733
- Yeah.
  -Look at this guy.

255
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:55,767
Fish sauce.

256
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,369
I've cooked with
    a lot of Latinos,

257
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:58,703
and this is the first time

258
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,039
I've ever seen anybody
    with fish sauce.

259
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,945
Again, first time I've ever
 seen star anise in a taqueria.

260
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,113
Thyme.
  Bay leaves.

261
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,548
Shallots.
  Basil.

262
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,815
What do you call basil in...

263
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,284
Basil is basil.

264
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,219
I never use it before
  in Mexico.

265
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:15,320
No, I've never seen it.

266
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:16,521
I've never seen it
  in Mexico.

267
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,023
Okay, chili diablo
    We at least know --

268
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,324
We know this one.
    -Yeah.

269
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:22,360
So we're just making
  a really nice, light broth

270
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:23,862
to poach the octopus.

271
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,597
Mexican octopus --
 wild octopus.

272
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,132
- Wild octopus from Mexico.
   -Wild octopus.

273
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,301
Let it cook
for like 45 minutes.

274
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,435
Got it.

275
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:31,736
We already have
 the octopus done.

276
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,138
We have to cool it down.

277
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,506
Ice water.

278
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:37,375
Once it cools down all the way,
   take off all the skin.

279
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:38,410
Yes.

280
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:39,444
Slice it thin,
    put on the tostada.

281
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,112
- Put it in the tostada.
   -Got it.

282
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,347
Make it up.

283
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,116
Cucumbers,
red bell peppers, radishes,

284
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,885
heirloom cherry tomatoes.

285
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,687
This is all the chef stuff
    coming out.

286
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:51,389
It isn't just chopped tomatoes
 like you have in pico de gallo.

287
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,024
Red onion.
  Cilantro.

288
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,159
Okay.

289
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,160
Cilantro --
If you're a Mexican --

290
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,328
It's the state flower,
     buddy.

291
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,964
That's what it is.
 Sea salt. Pepper.

292
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,500
Lime juice for acid.

293
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,402
And this is made fresh
   every time like this.

294
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:05,770
Every -- By order.

295
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,340
This market is slamming
   and jamming and busy

296
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,241
and there's a line
    out of the place

297
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,944
and he's taking it and making it
    to order each time.

298
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,579
Then you get ready
 to plate it.

299
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,081
Okay.

300
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,620
Really impressive, chef.

301
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:24,556
Gorgeous.

302
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,057
Yeah.

303
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,293
I'm getting the tomato
 and I'm getting the bell pepper

304
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,295
and I'm getting the onion
 and I'm getting the cilantro

305
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,497
and I'm getting all
  of these flavors together.

306
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,867
This right here is taking what
 you've learned becoming a chef,

307
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,969
along with your
    Mexican traditions,

308
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,004
and it's delicious, man.

309
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,206
Look at
   that bite right there.

310
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,074
Here's the Octopus Tostada.

311
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,377
The octopus is very tender
   and tasty,

312
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,845
seasoned properly.

313
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,413
It's spicy.
   It's lemon-y.

314
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,215
It's tangy.
   It's fresh.

315
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,883
It has good presentation.

316
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,053
That's because Chef Fernando
 doesn't skimp on the details.

317
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,321
Where are the plates from?

318
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:58,423
They're from Capula,
Michoacan, in Mexico.

319
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,125
You had these specially
   made in Michoacan?

320
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,259
Yeah.

321
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:02,394
I think you know in
 restaurant business

322
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,829
you have to have
 not just the food.

323
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,332
It's experience.
 See this tile?

324
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,501
Made in Mexico.
  The boards?

325
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:10,802
Made in Mexico.

326
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,037
I love this guy.

327
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,938
Here's the Octopus Tostada.

328
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,607
All these different
   food options,

329
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,509
but this one
  definitely stood out.

330
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:19,010
Here's what's happening.

331
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,879
We're hanging out at Grand
 Central Market in Los Angeles.

332
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,547
This chef --
   a guy you got to meet.

333
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,749
Come back.
The Patrona Burger's on its way.

334
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,384
Patrona Burgers out!

335
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:29,387
It's fresh, it's flavorful,
 and it's everything you could

336
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,389
possibly want
  in a seafood burger.

337
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:34,159
The tostada, though --
   It's gonna be as good?

338
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,094
- Better than that.
   -We'll see.

339
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,570
Welcome back.

340
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:48,606
I am hanging out at La
 Tostadería with Chef Fernando.

341
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,709
This guy's got a story
    that you will love.

342
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:53,645
Comes from Mexico, goes to
  Canada, opens a taqueria,

343
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,080
comes down to
    the United States,

344
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,582
opens a carnitas joint here
  in Grand Central Market,

345
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,217
then goes to culinary school,

346
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,219
elevates himself
   in the world of food,

347
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,455
and opens up
    La Tostadería.

348
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,557
Really fresh seafood,
  great ingredients,

349
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,826
and they definitely take
 their time with every plate.

350
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:10,095
It's a cross between
   a great ceviche joint

351
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:12,330
and a taco stand,
    a tostada stand.

352
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,899
So, he tells me
   that he makes a burger.

353
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,401
Patrona Burger at the window.

354
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:17,702
The Patrona Burger's delicious.

355
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,405
A combination of cheese
  and shrimp and aioli.

356
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,307
It's not your typical
  seafood burger --

357
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,875
what you get in a lot
  of other restaurants.

358
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,577
It can't be beat.
   It's delicious.

359
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,746
He says if I don't
    love the burger,

360
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:30,181
he's gonna buy free lunch
   for all my crew.

361
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,684
I hate the burger.

362
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:33,718
All right, what's first?

363
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,855
Okay, mango,
red bell pepper, chives.

364
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:37,756
And then...

365
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,090
Let me guess --
     cilantro.

366
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,558
Cilantro.
  Exactly.

367
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,227
I can't believe your middle
   name's not "Cilantro."

368
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:46,598
Okay.

369
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,100
Avocados from the capital
 of the avocado --

370
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,535
Michoacan.

371
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:53,171
You just drop Michoacan in
 as often as you can, don't you?

372
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,240
- I love my state.
   -I know you do.

373
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:57,809
So you just toss it
 all together.

374
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,477
All right,
   time for the burger?

375
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,679
Wild Mexican shrimp.

376
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,047
- Not frozen.
   -No frozen.

377
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,749
- Okay.
  -Makes big difference.

378
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:05,917
Makes a huge difference.

379
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,686
Salt, pepper, butter.

380
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:09,754
The bun, also.

381
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,122
This is Oaxaca cheese.

382
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,691
Oaxaca cheese is like
    jack mozzarella.

383
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:14,859
- Yeah.
 -That's gonna be kind of

384
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:15,794
what actually holds
   this burger together.

385
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:16,928
Yeah.

386
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,663
It's like the duct tape
   of Mexican food.

387
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:20,732
Now we got the buns.

388
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,167
Okay.

389
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,302
And before culinary school, he
called that chipotle mayonnaise.

390
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,004
Lettuce.
  Tomato.

391
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:30,942
Now we have our shrimp cooked
with the Oaxaca cheese melting.

392
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,043
Onion.

393
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,212
We gonna use
the avocado mango radish.

394
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,847
As much as I think
   I'm gonna love this,

395
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:36,881
I'm still gonna tell you

396
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,384
I hate it so you
   got to feed my crew.

397
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,552
Yes!

398
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,322
This is for the crunchiness.

399
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,858
Done.

400
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,227
I haven't had to bust out
   the hunch in a while.

401
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,863
This one might deserve it.

402
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,502
I got good news,
    and I got bad news.

403
00:13:57,604 --> 00:13:58,403
Tell me.

404
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,938
Good news is...

405
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,406
that's fantastic.

406
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:05,276
The bad news is the crew's
 hitting the vending machine.

407
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,112
When you bite into it, you get
 the saltiness of the cheese,

408
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,347
the texture of the cheese.

409
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:10,949
The shrimp's cooked perfectly.

410
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:12,984
And then all
   the accoutrements --

411
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,153
the shredded lettuce,
   the chipotle mayo,

412
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,855
the tomato,
    the raw onion,

413
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:19,557
the phenomenal salsa
 with the mango and the avocado.

414
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,159
I pride myself on my burgers.

415
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,794
I'm known for my burgers.

416
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:26,331
That right there, in my
 expectation level of burgers --

417
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:27,966
That is about
    as high as they go.

418
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,667
- Thank you.
   -Outstanding.

419
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:30,735
Thank you.

420
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:31,836
Patrona Burger.

421
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,471
The bread is really moist.

422
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,306
It's got some nice
  aioli sauce on it.

423
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:36,541
It's really tasty.

424
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,710
You can tell the seafood --
  It's not frozen.

425
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:41,145
All these extra little toppings
 on it makes it the bomb.

426
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,248
Two orders of fish tacos out.

427
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,884
You come to a market like this,
   you stereotype

428
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:47,352
that it's not
 that "wow" factor.

429
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:48,453
Yeah.

430
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,555
This is, like, high-end,
 fancy restaurant,

431
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,056
elevated Mexican food.

432
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,424
Completely unexpected.

433
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,126
La Tostadería --
  fresh as can be.

434
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,761
It's everything that you need,
   basically.

435
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,062
I got some plates for you.

436
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,530
Take it home.

437
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:03,701
And any time you see my plates,
 you're gonna remember about me.

438
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,336
I won't forget you,
     my brother.

439
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:06,971
You know I love this.

440
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,240
That's awesome. Thank you.
  -You're welcome.

441
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,909
Huh?

442
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,847
Coming up, we're crossing the
 country to Norfolk, Virginia...

443
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,715
We just entered ridiculous.

444
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,318
...to enjoy going gourmet
 with a familiar favorite.

445
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,153
I think if you're gonna have
a grilled-cheese-ery,

446
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,521
you better deliver.
 You delivered.

447
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,666
So I'm here in Norfolk,
  Virginia, and you know,

448
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,634
in today's world,
   we are so carb-

449
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,870
and calorie-conscious,
  as we should be.

450
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,071
So if we're gonna eat
   fried chicken,

451
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:41,639
got to be the-bomb
   fried chicken.

452
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,207
Gonna eat pizza,
 got to be the real deal.

453
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,410
And when it comes to grilled
 cheese, what am I looking for?

454
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,078
It's got to have a nice,
   crunchy crust,

455
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,379
it's got to have
  ooey-gooey cheese,

456
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,914
and it's got to be unique.

457
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,549
And I hear this is
  the joint to check out.

458
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,584
This is
 the Grilled Cheese Bistro.

459
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:57,088
Nice toast on caprese.

460
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,690
When you come to the
  Grilled Cheese Bistro,

461
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,358
don't expect plain, old cheddar.

462
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,793
You name it, they have it all.

463
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:03,561
Your Gooey with
  a dipper of soup.

464
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:07,398
How can I compare grilled cheese
 that I had as a kid to this?

465
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,802
You can't because Dina Taylor's
 taking her childhood classic

466
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:13,004
and elevating it
  to a whole other level.

467
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,539
What makes a great
 grilled cheese?

468
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,107
Just being
    a little creative.

469
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:19,010
I guess a little more
   gourmet grilled cheese.

470
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:20,678
You have your
  vegetarian options.

471
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,913
You have your meaty options.

472
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,281
You have a seafood option.

473
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,816
The Lobster Mac and Cheese.

474
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:27,752
It's lobster mac and cheese
 in between two pieces of bread.

475
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,854
The combination of the two --
   It's perfect.

476
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:31,656
- So, what are we gonna make?
 -We're making The Hangover.

477
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,725
We put mac and cheese
 inside of the grilled cheese,

478
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,361
and special occasions
   we add lobster to it.

479
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,896
Okay, we're making a bechamel
we're gonna add this cheese to.

480
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,598
So go ahead and give me
 the breakdown here.

481
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,501
Black truffle oil,
    shallots, garlic,

482
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:46,938
fresh thyme, a little
 chicken-based flour, slowly.

483
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,373
- So you're building your roux.
    -Yeah.

484
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:51,275
We're gonna add the wine --
   3/4 of the bottle.

485
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:54,345
And then I drink the rest.

486
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:56,848
Heavy cream.

487
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,116
Lots of cheese.

488
00:16:58,218 --> 00:16:59,150
Fontina, cheddar, and mozz.

489
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,351
- Yeah.
   -Got it.

490
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,854
It'll start melting
   and doing its thing.

491
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:05,123
- What's its thing?
 -It starts getting gooey.

492
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,357
Isn't that
 the melting part?

493
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,892
That's the melting part.

494
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,827
Mix it with the pasta.

495
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,929
Next step, we're gonna
    make the lobster.

496
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,398
Butter.
    -Okay.

497
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,434
Lobster -- tails, claws,
   whatever you want.

498
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,003
Fresh thyme in there.
And a little bit of lemon juice.

499
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,071
Salt and pepper.

500
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:21,272
Now we start to build
 the sandwich?

501
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,473
Yep.

502
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,641
Okay, well, let's get
 into this, sister.

503
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,710
Clarified butter.
   This is cheddar cheese.

504
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,145
The bread comes from
     New Jersey.

505
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,414
People are really surprised
  to see the thickness of it.

506
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:30,782
Beautiful.

507
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:34,185
The mac and cheese,
and we're adding the lobster in.

508
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:35,453
Seal this up.

509
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,288
We just entered ridiculous.
Look at the size of it.

510
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,057
Look at that.

511
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,559
Here we go.

512
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:48,866
When you come in, you want fat,
  you want crunch,

513
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,269
you want salt, you want...

514
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:52,303
Cheesiness.

515
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,871
That's the sandwich you get.

516
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:57,275
I love your cheese sauce
because it's sticky enough,

517
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:59,043
and the way that you
 built the bread --

518
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,379
the amount of time
 that you let that sit on there,

519
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:04,715
it's really worth it because
it builds a fantastic crust.

520
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:05,817
You did a good job.
   -Thank you.

521
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,385
You did a really good job.

522
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,121
It is the best mac and cheese
  I have ever had.

523
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:11,856
So, in case you don't
  know who this is.

524
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:15,493
It's the Internet sensation --
the Queen of Norfolk.

525
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,661
This is Abby.

526
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,029
And what do you think
of this grilled cheese?

527
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,397
It's super-gooey.

528
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,432
The bread adds a perfect crunch

529
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,035
and actually a good amount
   of flavor, too.

530
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,070
The gooier the better.

531
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,939
Can you say
 "unemployment"?

532
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:31,008
As soon as she can drive,
  I'm done.

533
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,076
This is absolutely the best.

534
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,478
Worth every calorie.

535
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,180
And the crazy thing is
 these calories are put out

536
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,715
by a real-deal
   body builder.

537
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:38,816
I was dieting.

538
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:39,984
I was getting ready
    for a competition.

539
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,652
I was craving some cheese
   and some bread.

540
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,721
That's how this
    concept started.

541
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,756
But it's not all carbolicious.

542
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,658
There's some veggies
  thrown in the mix, too.

543
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,093
I have Don Quixote.

544
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:51,529
This sandwich is
  the vegetarian option.

545
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,565
It's got mushrooms, olive.

546
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,734
Next up is going to be...

547
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,236
Don Quixote Sandwich
    Grilled Cheese.

548
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,370
And why do you
 name it that?

549
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,506
It has the little
   Mediterranean flavors.

550
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:02,840
It's a Spanish novel.

551
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,810
I just thought it was
  a brilliant name.

552
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:08,246
It wasn't just a good name --
  a brilliant name.

553
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,547
A brilliant name.

554
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,449
We're gonna make
    the olive tapenade.

555
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:14,485
Olive oil, lemon juice,
   some kalamata olives.

556
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,586
Got it.

557
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:16,621
- Capers.
   -A ton of them.

558
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,222
Parsley.
    A little garlic.

559
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,057
Blend this up together,
    and it's done.

560
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,226
That's the olive tapenade.
All right, next step?

561
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,995
Get our sandwich going.

562
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:25,229
Sourdough bread.

563
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,665
Spread a little bit of our
  homemade olive tapenade,

564
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,067
two slices of fontina cheese
   on each side.

565
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,702
We're gonna get it
   covered a little bit.

566
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:32,837
One little dome.

567
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:33,905
Do you have more domes?
   -We have...

568
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,206
One little, two little,
 three little --

569
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,474
...20 domes.

570
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,709
We're going to put on
   our oyster mushrooms.

571
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:39,777
Caramelized onions.

572
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,345
Roasted red peppers.

573
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,414
Parmesan cheese.

574
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,349
It's got
    a nice toast to it.

575
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,985
And it's ready.

576
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,288
There you go.

577
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,857
Great colors, caramelized
onions, oyster mushrooms,

578
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,493
roasted red bell peppers.

579
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:00,198
This is a really nice,
mature grilled cheese.

580
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,566
Caramelized onions,
boom, right off the bat,

581
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:02,733
you're gonna get sweet.

582
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:04,068
Roasted red bell pepper --
you're gonna get sweet.

583
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,405
But bringing in the acidity of
those capers and the kalamatas

584
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:08,706
is where you really killed it.

585
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,174
Really good job.
And what was the name?

586
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,209
Don Quixote.

587
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,376
Yeah, but what type
 of name is it?

588
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,779
- It's a...
  -It's a brilliant name.

589
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,881
Brilliant name for
a brilliant sandwich.

590
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:19,317
- Don Quixote. Excellent.
   -Nicely done.

591
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,552
The oyster mushrooms
  with the roasted red pepper

592
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,754
and the olive tapenade --
     Whoo!

593
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:24,922
So good.

594
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,891
There's flavor down
  to the last bite.

595
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,893
Johnny Appleseed right here.

596
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:31,862
Everybody needs to come to have
 the grilled cheese here.

597
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,931
I think if you're gonna have
 a grilled-cheese-ery,

598
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:36,067
you better deliver.
 You delivered.

599
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:37,902
- All right, cool.
   -Nice job.

600
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,772
So, was this a great
  road trip or what?

601
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,074
But don't you worry.

602
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:45,810
I got plenty more joints to find
  all over this country.

603
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,345
I'll be looking
  for you next time

604
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:50,214
on "Diners, Drive-ins
   & Dives"!

605
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:51,182
What else you got up
 your sleeve?

606
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:52,617
- The Don Quixote.
   -Don Quixote?

607
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,285
Yeah.
    Not "donkey."

608
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:55,386
I have two donkeys.

609
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,520
Taco and Burrito.

610
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:58,389
I thought you might have
 a donkey named "Hotay."
