226
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,609
        It's a restaurant       
         of street food         

227
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,944
from around the world.          

228
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,145
      And the culinary trip     
       going on here comes      

229
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,414
   from husband-and-wife team   

230
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,549
          Josh Lanahan          
     and Michelle Lozuaway,     

231
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,952
      who travel the globe      
     for their inspiration.     

232
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,287
         They've been everywhere

233
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,754
         and whatever they like,
           they brought it here.

234
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,891
So it is like a food lesson     
from all over the world.        

235
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,026
 The seafood samita.            

236
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,297
Samita's a Mexican sandwich     
from Pueblo, Mexico.            

237
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,632
     But, here, it's getting    
         a seafood spin.        

238
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,968
          I've never had seafood
         like this, in a burger.

239
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,171
             Hit it.            
 -We've got fresh local pollock,

240
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,106
 shallots, shrimps,             
    and scallops                

241
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,374
     that we're gonna grind.    
           -Very nice.          

242
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,643
  We add some diced             
    sea scallops.               

243
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,444
        Okay, so a little       
     more texture in there.     

244
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,313
    Yeah. Shrimp.               
 Then with some eggs            

245
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,782
from my own chickens.           

246
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,717
        These are our --        
 -How many chickens do you have?

247
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,186
 We have 17. We had             
 100, at one point,             

248
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,854
    but, that was               
    way too many.               

249
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:10,922
       And then the panko.      
              -Yep.             

250
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,390
  Next step, we add our spices. 
             -Okay.             

251
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:15,293
Kosher salt, fresh-ground       
black pepper, dried thyme,      

252
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,596
a little cayenne pepper,        
 and then mix it up.            

253
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:19,297
     Now form it into molds.    
             -Right.            

254
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:20,731
Patty these all out,            

255
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,400
    pop 'em right               
   in the freezer.              

256
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:25,136
 Out of the freezer, bread 'em, 
     flour, egg wash, panko?    

257
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,005
    Yep, standard               
 breading procedure.            

258
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,540
       Drop to the fryer.       
             Dig it.            

259
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,008
      What are we into now?     

260
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,143
      -Chipotle mayonnaise.     
       -All right, hit it.      

261
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,211
   We got roasted               
    red peppers,                

262
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,480
   Spanish onions,              
 chipotles in Adobo.            

263
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,882
A little bit of ketchup,        
    fresh garlic,               

264
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,552
    kosher salt,                
 and fresh cilantro.            

265
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:42,687
      You have a good flow,     
           my friend.           

266
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,289
 So, now, we put our            
mayonnaise in a bowl.           

267
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,359
    That's a lotta food lube.   
   -That's good on everything.  

268
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,293
         -Fold that in.         
       -Whisk it together,      

269
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,963
     let it sit                 
 for an hour or so.             

270
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,164
           Delicious.           
           -Here's our          

271
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,499
seafood samita patty.           

272
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:57,301
 We're serving it on            
a toasted sesame-seed bun.      

273
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,906
And we take a slice of blanco   
cheese on the griddle,          

274
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:03,508
our chipotle mayonnaise,        
plenty of it, and then...       

275
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,176
     Cilantro, like a salad.    

276
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,112
These are our pickled red       
onions that we make here.       

277
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:08,713
  And then, because             
it doesn't have enough,         

278
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,981
 some fatty avocado.            

279
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,716
          There you go.         

280
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,851
        Nice wrapup, son.       

281
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,187
  The cheese is gangster, dude. 
             -Right?            

282
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,590
     But cheese and seafood?    

283
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:19,924
    I'm trusting you on this.   

284
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,327
                     ♪♪         

285
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,896
   This is a rocking sandwich.  

286
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,130
      I mean, really good.      

287
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,333
     You really concentrated    
           on texture.          

288
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:29,668
  You get the scallop in there, 

289
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,536
  and you get those big chunks  
     of the shrimp in there.    

290
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:34,072
  And then you accentuate with  
 the different layers of flavor.

291
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,606
       With the creaminess      
         of the avocado         

292
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,807
 and the little bit of the bite 

293
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,209
       that you're getting      
     from the chipotle mayo.    

294
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:41,413
  And then, the big, herbaceous 
    note of tons of cilantro.   

295
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,815
    Really nice toasted bun,    
    creaminess of the cheese.   

296
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,216
           -It works.           
           -Dynamite.           

297
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,084
      Order up:                 
   seafood samita.              

298
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,753
   It's absolutely delicious.   

299
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,154
I don't know how to describe    
  the fried cheese.             

300
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,355
    It's so good.               

301
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,891
      Street is definitely      
           a community          

302
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:55,160
     where everyone can come    
   and share a delicious meal.  

303
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,560
   It's eclectic.               
      It's fun.                 

304
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:57,796
   It's certainly               
a different environment.        

305
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,831
         It's got its own thing,
        especially in this area.

306
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,100
WOMAN: Portsmouth is a beautiful
        little sea town.        

307
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,835
      Always has tourists,      
         but we're just         

308
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,837
          a little bit          
      off the beaten path.      

309
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,172
   This town does               
  a lot of seafood,             

310
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,439
so having these kind of         

311
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,642
nontraditional comfort          
foods is a nice break.          

312
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:13,044
I got a lamb shawarma, side     
curry fries, in the window.     

313
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,380
   The lamb shawarma is great.  
        -So much flavor.        

314
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,248
               It's definitely  
             a little bit messy,

315
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,717
             but it's worth it. 

316
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,652
   Lamb shawarma.               
    Our version.                

317
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,987
Unfortunately, we don't         
have a vertical spit,           

318
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,122
 so we have to roast            
      our lamb.                 

319
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,390
              Okay.             
-We're gonna make our spice rub.

320
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,191
Fresh-ground black pepper,      
  ground cinnamon,              

321
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,327
little bit of turmeric,         
    ground clove,               

322
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,795
kosher salt, paprika,           

323
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,197
    fresh bread,                
 granulated garlic,             

324
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,931
    ground cumin,               
  ground coriander.             

325
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,200
     So all the key spices.     

326
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,134
We're gonna rub liberally.      

327
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,002
         Feel the burn.         

328
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,537
   We're gonna put              
    sliced onions               

329
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,339
  and whole garlic              
      as a bed.                 

330
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,474
      Wrap it in the oven.      
            -4 hours.           

331
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,742
              -At?              
              -325.             

332
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,077
      Thing's gonna shred,      
            for sure.           

333
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,678
       All right, brother,      
         tzatziki time.         

334
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,747
      Tzatziki.                 
We got our really thick,        

335
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,282
strained, beautiful,            
    Greek yogurt.               

336
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,818
  You get strange Greek yogurt. 
    -Yeah. It's very strange.

00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,135
           Ivan's...?           
           -Cookhouse.          

559
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,936
  Anyhow, we're in North Miami  

560
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,340
        at this fantastic       
      Haitian, Caribbean...     

561
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,475
              Asian, you know,  
              you name it all.  

562
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,611
        You name it all,        
 and he calls it the Cookhouse, 

563
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,880
   but I think it's more like   
      coming to his house.      

564
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,548
                 Got a griot    
            coming up right now.

565
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,016
              It's incredible.  

566
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,417
   All my friends               
 that I brought here            

567
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,420
  from other places             
  in the Caribbean,             

568
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:43,754
they love his cooking.          

569
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,824
     It's an explosion of colors
          and flavors and taste.

570
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,893
        Grilled octopus shallot.

571
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,894
    Octopus is a common food    
            in Haiti.           

572
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,563
  The way Ivan does             
    the octopus,                

573
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:55,099
  it's very tender,             
   very flavorful.              

574
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,901
    It just melt                
   in your mouth.               

575
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:59,036
   I know we don't see octopus  
      a lot on "Triple D,"      

576
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,173
    but octopus is one of my    
    hands-down favorite, so.    

577
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,041
          -Let's do it.         
    -We caught that earlier.    

578
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:06,310
         No, we didn't.         
          -Now, first,          

579
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,645
                I'm gonna do    
               some mirepoix.   

580
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,181
     A bunch of fresh thyme.    
  -Living on the edge, we are.  

581
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:12,183
         -Some parsley.         
             -Okay.             

582
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,852
 -Some cloves. This is allspice.
            -Got it.            

583
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,521
           And then you just put
       that baby boy right here.

584
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,524
 His day went from bad to worse.
            How long?           

585
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,326
  -About, you know, 45 minutes. 
          -Let it cool?         

586
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,728
  -Let it cool and then cut it. 
 -So we're not eating the body? 

587
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,129
              -No.              
     -We're gonna grill it?     

588
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,531
          Gonna grill it, first,

589
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,266
       and then we're gonna make
      a beautiful salad with it.

590
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,001
              Okay.             
    -We got some red onions.    

591
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,603
            Capers with a little
              juice, you know,  

592
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:33,738
           for the salty flavor.

593
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,006

595
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,476
  Crushed red pepper in there.  
         -A little salt?        

596
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,677
               A little salt.
