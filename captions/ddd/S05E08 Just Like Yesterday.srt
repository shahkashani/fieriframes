        IT NEVER CHANGES.       

50
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,103
        IF IT AIN'T BROKE       
        DON'T FIX IT.

00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:46,572
       (Guy)                    
       AND IT AIN'T BROKE.      

52
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:48,640
       SO JEFF KACHA

THE ORIGINAL OWNERS,            

55
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,447
THEY ASKED "IF I WERE           
TO SELL IT TO YOU               
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?"             

56
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,449
AND I SAID, "NOTHING."          

57
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:58,717
         THAT'S A GOOD ATTITUDE,
         MAN.                   

58
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,452
AND THAT'S WHY                  
HE CHOSE US TO BUY IT,          

59
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,121
BECAUSE WE SAID WE              
WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING.        

60
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,990
      (Guy)                     
      NOT THE FRENCH TOAST,     
      NOT THE SHORT RIBS...     

61
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,925
    (Tania)                     
    CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS.      

62
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,593
(Guy)                           
AND NOT THIS CHILDHOOD FAVORITE.

63
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,929
      IT'S A COMFORT FOOD,      
       I LOVE THE FLAVORS.      

64
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:13,332
WHEN I WAS A KID WE USED        
TO PACK ON THE HORSES           
UP IN THE MOUNTAINS.            

65
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,666
WE WOULD BE COLD                
AND MY DAD WOULD SAY,           

66
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:15,868
"I'M GONNA MAKE SOMETHING       
TO WARM YOU UP."                

67
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:17,402
AND HE WOULD MAKE               
CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS.          

68
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,270
AND IT WAS THE GREATEST         
THING IN THE WORLD.             

69
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,004
SO LET'S GET IT ON.             

70
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,207
          WE HAVE FOUR CHICKENS.

71
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:23,341
JUST THE WHOLE CHICKEN,         
WE'RE NOT BREAKING THEM UP      
OR ANYTHING.                    

72
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,210
         NO, TOSS THEM IN THERE.

73
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,145
PUT IN SOME ONIONS              
AND CELERY.                     

74
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:30,215

           SEASONED SALT, WATER.

75
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:32,017
THIS GONNA KIND OF MAKE         
OUR STOCK ALSO?                 
                        CORRECT.

76
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,086
ENOUGH TO COVER                 
THE CHICKEN.                    

77
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:35,753
WE SIMMER THIS                  
FOR?                            
                      TWO HOURS.

78
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:39,357
TAKE THE CHICKENS OUT,          
THERE WE GO.                    

79
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,093
LET THIS COOL DOWN.             

80
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,894
WE'RE GONNA TAKE ALL            
THE CHICKEN OFF THE BONE.       

81
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,896
           DON'T USE THE SKIN   
           AND STRAIN THE STOCK.

82
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:46,965
           LOOK AT THAT,        
           THAT'S GOLDEN NECTAR.

83
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,301
            THAT'S CHICKEN GRAVY
            GOODNESS, RIGHT?    

84
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,237
SALT.                           

85
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,972
       LITTLE CHICKEN BASE TO IT
       TO FORTIFY THE FLAVOR    
       A LITTLE MORE.           

86
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,441
             SO HERE'S OUR BREW,
            LET THAT TIGHTEN UP.

87
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:58,377
          WHEN ARE WE GOING     
          TO MAKE THE DUMPLINGS?

88
00:02:58,379 --> 00:02:59,578
WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD            
AND MAKE THOSE DUMPLINGS        
RIGHT NOW.                      

89
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,913
              LET'S GO DUMPLIFY.

90
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,915
            EGGS, VEGETABLE OIL,
            BAKING POWDER...    

91
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:05,917
SALT,                           
AND NOW FLOUR.

YOU WHISK ALL THAT UP.          

93
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,722
SO THIS IS KIND OF              
A WET DOUGH VERSUS              
A KNEADED DOUGH?                
                        CORRECT.

94
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,190
YOU GOT A LITTLE BIT            
 OF MILK, ALL OF IT,            

95
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:14,058
OR A LITTLE AT A TIME?          
               LITTLE AT A TIME.

96
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,861
NOW YOU'RE GONNA DROP IT        
INTO THE GRAVY?                 

97
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,329
       SCOOP IT OUT AND STEAM IT
       IN A STEAMER.            

98
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,598
             WHOA, IT DOESN'T GO
             THROUGH THE HOLE?  
NO.                             

99
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,801
        HOW LONG WILL THEY TAKE?
ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.             

100
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,270
DUDE, I CAN'T WAIT              
TO TRY THAT.                    

101
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,272
I'M EXCITED!!

00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,944
OH, YOU ADD A LITTLE            
DARK AND WHITE MEAT.            
                        OH YEAH.

104
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,179
YOU GET OUT,                    
LOOK AT THAT.                   

105
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:41,086
WOW, IT'S JUST                  
MASSIVE FLAVOR.                 

106
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:43,155
TENDER CHICKEN.                 

107
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,156
THE DUMPLING                    
BEING DONE IN THE STEAM,        

108
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:46,692
 I MEAN, THE WHOLE              
GIDDY-UP, BROTHER,              

109
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,827
THIS IS ABOUT AS OLD-SCHOOL     
AS IT GETS.                     

110
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:52,764
THAT SHOULD BE THE DEFINITION   
OF CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS.       

111
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,767
THIS IS JUST,                   
YOU'RE ON POINT, MAN.           

112
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,502
   IT'S A VERY HOMEMADE DISH.   

113
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:00,238
       BETTER THAN MOTHER       
       USED TO MAKE.            

114
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:02,373
  AND YOU CAN TELL IT WAS       
  DELICIOUS, BECAUSE IT'S GONE. 

115
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,775
      I THINK EVERYTHING IS     
      VERY, VERY GOOD.          

116
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,377
      IT'S JUST OLD SCHOOL.     

117
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:07,178

     AND HAS BEEN SINCE '44.    

118

       I HAVE SOME MUFFINS      
       FOR YOU THERE.           

119
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:10,181
      WE USUALLY COME HERE      
      FOR BREAKFAST.            

120
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,517
      I HAVE THE PANCAKES.      

121
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:13,718
   THE WALDORF SALAD, WHO DOES  
   WALDORF SALAD ANYMORE?       

122
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,321
THE LAMB SHANK.                 

123
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,023
   (Guy)                        
   YEP, LIKE BACK IN THE '40s   
   WITH MINT JELLY.             

124
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,858
   IT JUST FALLS OFF THE BONE.  

125
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,393
     WANT ME TO PLATE ONE UP    
     FOR YOU?                   

126
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:23,128
                  NO, I WANT YOU
                  TO PLATE FOUR.

127
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:24,596
             SERVED UP,         
             LOOK AT THAT THING.

128
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,930
               THAT IS A MONSTER
               SHANK.           

129
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,200
LITTLE MASH ON THERE.           

130
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:31,136
WOW, MAN.                       

131
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,470
WELL I GOTTA SAY SOMETHING ABOUT
THE WAY THEY WERE DOING THEM    
BACK IN 1944,                   

132
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,739
THEY WERE KNOCKING THEM DEAD.   

133
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,008
THANK YOU.                      
             (Guy)              
             AND THEY STILL ARE.

134
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:39,611
 WE HAVE REGULARS THAT HAVE BEEN
 COMING HERE FOR A LONG TIME.   

135
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:40,946
          AND EVERYTHING'S GOOD?
WONDERFUL.                      

136
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,682
35, 40 YEARS.                   

137
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:47,486
THEY'LL SIT AT THE SAME TABLE,  
SAME TIME.                      

138
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,822
WE HAVE STANDING RESERVATIONS   
THREE DAYS A WEEK.              
          STANDING RESERVATIONS.

139
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,290
           SO IF THEY EVER WANT 
           TO COME AND FIND YOU,

140
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:54,159
                 THEY KNOW WHERE
                YOU'RE GONNA BE.

141
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,294
         (Guy)                  
         AND WHAT YOU'RE        
         GONNA EAT.             

142
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,164
    IT'S ONE OF THE STANDARDS   
    HERE.                       

143
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:00,498
THESE BIG OL' BRISKETS,         
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TRIM THEM    
OR ANYTHING,                    

144
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,167
BECAUSE YOU WANT FAT            
AS FLAVOR.                      

145
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,568
SO NOW WE'RE GOING              
TO MAKE THE BRINE.              

146
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,502
                 WE'RE GONNA ADD
                 THE SALT.      

147
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,838
WHOA!                           

148
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,240
          GO AHEAD AND POUR IT  
          INTO OUR WHITE BUCKET.

149
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,709
WHEN DOES THE PICKLING          
SPICE GET INVOLVED?             

150
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,176
     WE'RE GONNA THROW THAT   IN
     RIGHT NOW.                 

151
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,512
SO YOU DUMP IN A COUPLE         
OF CUPS OF THAT.                

152
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,848
NOW HOW LONG WILL YOU           
LET THIS BRINE?                 

153
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:19,050
       THIS IS A SEVEN-DAY CURE.
SEVEN DAY, REALLY?              

154
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,986
          WE HAVE SEVEN OF THESE
          BUCKETS GOING.        

155
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,523
YOU MAKE ONE EVERY DAY?         
                      EVERY DAY.

156
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,724
       SO AFTER THAT WE GO AHEAD
       AND WEIGH THEM DOWN      
       WITH PLATES.             

157
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,260
AND THE REASON YOU USE          
THE PLATES IS SO                

158
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:29,995
YOU GET THE PRESSURE            
ALL AROUND,                     

159
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,597
AS OPPOSED TO JUST ONE,         
BECAUSE ONE WILL BUBBLE UP.     

160
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,266
            AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL
            LEAVE IT.           

161
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:38,337
THAT'S HOW YOU ROLL.            
             THAT'S HOW WE ROLL.

162
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,338
BETTER OPEN UP MAGIC.           

163
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:43,007
              GRAB THEM BY HAND.

164
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,943
SWEET, YOU CAN                  
REALLY SMELL IT.                

165
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,011
   YOU CAN CATCH                
THAT PICKLING SPICE             
   RIGHT THERE.                 

166
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,746
               SMELLS GOOD, HUH?

167
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,347
               ADD A LITTLE MORE
               PICKLING SPICE.  

168
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,349
         PUT THE BROWN SUGAR IN.

169
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,618
             FILL IT WITH WATER.

170
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,087
        WHAT GAS STATION DID YOU
        RIP THAT OFF FROM?      

171
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:57,756
                 LET HER SIMMER.
HOW DO THEY LOOK?               

172
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,090
                     'TIL IT ALL
                    FALLS APART.

173
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,292
WHOA, SERVE ME UP.

ON THE SIDE.                    

176
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,299
THAT'S GREAT,                   
JUST FALLS APART.               

177
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,501
THIS IS REALLY GOOD             
CORNED BEEF.                    

178
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,771
IT'S SUPER TENDER.              

179
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:13,705
THE FAT MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH     
LIKE BUTTER.                    

180
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,110
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT?       

181
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,313

THAT GUY IS NUMBER ONE.         

182
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:22,447
       IT'S TENDER, FRESH.      

183
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:23,915
           VERY TASTY.          

184
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,450
     IT'S MY FAVORITE HERE.     

185
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,185
       EATING HERE IS LIKE      
       COMING HOME.             

186
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,987
    IT'S LIKE A SUNDAY MEAL.    

187
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,788
  IT'S THANKSGIVING ON A PLATE. 

188
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,590

189
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,726
   CONSISTENTLY GOOD QUALITY.   

190
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,928
                I GUESS,        
                IN TODAY'S WORLD

191
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,663
         THERE'S NOT MANY THINGS
         THAT WE CAN COUNT ON   

192
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,431
           THAT ARE STAYING TRUE
           TO WHAT IT WAS.      

193
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,667
WE JUST LOVE IT HERE.

       NEXT DOOR.

WALKING INTO HOME.

00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,720
       EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT.
EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT.       

215
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,122

       IF YOU WANT FAMILY STYLE,

216
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,590

        THIS PLACE IS,          

218

    IT'S A FAMILY RESTAURANT.   

219
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:42,994

       WITH HIS FAMILY.         

221
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:47,198
         ALFREDO SAUCE?         

222
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,600
YOUR TWIN DAUGHTERS, ARE THEY   
GONNA TAKE OVER?                

223
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,201
              YEAH, THEY'RE VERY
              PERSONABLE.       

224
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,736
             THEY'RE VERY GOOD, 
             THEY'RE VERY AWARE.

225
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:53,538
THOSE TWO RUNNING THIS HOUSE,   
OH, MY GOODNESS.                

226
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:56,140
     THAT'S SPECIAL FOR YOU,    
     RIGHT?                     

227
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,275
 (Guy)                          
 AND THEY'LL STILL BE SERVING UP
 THE RED SAUCE CLASSICS...      

228
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,144
 THE MEATBALLS, THE SOFT SHELLS.

229
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,679
       CAN I GET A GALLON       
       OF THAT TO GO?           

230
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,280
        (Guy)                   
        AND ALL THE OTHER       
        FAMILY FAVORITES.       

231
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,548
    YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE    
     TO MAKE IT COMPLICATED.    

232
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,284
    SIMPLE FLAVORS, BUT NICE,   
    BIG TASTES.                 

233
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,685
    THE FLAVOR'S IN THE FOOD.   

234
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:08,753
THE MUSSELS ARE VERY GOOD.      

235
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,755
PORK CHOPS.                     

236
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,757
  THE LEMON CHICKEN             
  IS THE BEST THING THEY SERVE. 

237
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,426
I HEARD THE LEMON CHICKEN       
IS SUPPOSED TO BE               
YOUR SPECIALTY,                 

238
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:15,961
AND THE BOMB.                   

239
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,429
   EVERYBODY REALLY LOVES IT.   

240
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,831
             GET A WHOLE CHICKEN
             AND JUST CUT IT UP.

241
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,167
       PUT A LITTLE COOKING OIL,
       A TOUCH OF OLIVE OIL.    

242
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,235
           THEN I GET SOME FRESH
           GARLIC AND PEPPER.   

243
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:26,170
               A LITTLE SALT,   
               A LITTLE OREGANO.

244
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,072
            THEN YOU GET A FRESH
            WHOLE LEMON,        

245
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:29,640
      AND YOU JUST              
      SQUEEZE IT RIGHT IN THERE.

246
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,243
LOOK AT THAT THING,             
IT'S LIKE A VICE-GRIP.          

247
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,244
HE'LL BE TAKING ROCKS           
AND MAKING ROCK JUICE           
IN A SECOND.                    

248
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,512
              AND THEN THIS GOES
              IN THE BROILER.   

249
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,780
HOW LONG ARE WE                 
GOING TO GO DOWN.               

250
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,716
WITH THIS HEAT IT COOKS         
IN 15 MINUTES.                  

251
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,518
            I'M EXPECTING MAGIC.
YOU'LL GET IT.                  

252
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,786
AND THEN WE USE POTATOES.       

253
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,321
         AND THIS IS WHAT       
         COMES ALONG SIDE OF IT?

254
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,323
          IS THE BIG BIRD READY?
IT'S READY.                     

255
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:46,925
LOOK AT THE WAY THAT'S          
ROASTED DOWN LIKE THAT.         

256
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,859
              IT REALLY HOLDS IN
              THE JUICES.       

257
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:51,396
       GET A FEW OF THE POTATOES
      AND ADD IT TO THE CHICKEN.

258
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,532
  SPRINKLE IT WITH THE OIL      
  AND IT GIVES IT A GREAT TASTE.

259
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:54,866
AND THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE?       
           THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE.

260
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,467
WANT TO ARM WRESTLE             
FOR THE THIGH?                  

261
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,536
    I DON'T WANT TO             
    EMBARRASS YOU ON THE CAMERA.

262
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,605
LOOK AT THAT,                   
MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH.            

263
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,540
IT'S SUPER CRISPY.              

264
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,075
NOW I GET A LITTLE              
OF THE LEMON.                   

265
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,877
DEFINITELY PICKING UP           
SOME OF THE OREGANO.            

266
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:08,747
BREAST MEAT RIGHT THERE,        
NICE AND SUPER JUICY.           

267
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,281
I'M STARTING TO UNDERSTAND,     
JOEY,                           

268
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,483
WHY YOU'RE SO POPULAR.          

269
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,818
I'M GONNA TELL YOU, THAT'S      
SOME BODACIOUS BIRD, BROTHER.   

270
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:16,287
THAT'S TRIPLE B ON "TRIPLE D."  

271
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,289
I COULD EAT                     
THAT WHOLE BIRD.                

272
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,825
              YOU'RE DOING      
              A PRETTY GOOD JOB.
I KNOW.                         

273
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,160
WELL DONE ON THE OUTSIDE        
AND VERY TENDER ON THE INSIDE.  

274
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,896
IT'S SPICY.                     
                     IT'S JUICY.

275
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,364
IT'S ONE OF                     
MY FAVORITES HERE.              

276
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,499
IT'S A WONDERFUL                
DISH.                           

277

    IT'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN    
    HAVING HERE FOR 25 YEARS.   

278
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,636
     YOU CAN'T FORGET           
     WHERE YOU'VE COME FROM     

279
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:32,637
    AND WHAT'S WORKED FOR YOU   
    ALL THESE YEARS.

YOU BET.                        

281
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,241
  (Guy)                         
  ITALIAN FAMILY COOKING        
  THAT'S BECOME A LOCAL LEGEND.

           DID YOU GROW UP HERE?

284
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,379
       I WAS BROUGHT HERE       
       AS A KID.                

285
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,914
    MY MA'S BEEN COMING HERE

     ALL RIGHT HERE SO FAR?     

292
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:57,862
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE          
A LEGACY IN ITALIAN FOOD        
IN CHICAGO?                     

293
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,665
                    I'M HONORED.

294
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,333
     I'M HONORED THAT MY GRANDMA
     AND GRANDPA WERE ABLE      
     TO START THIS.             

295
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,267
         IT'S A GREAT TRADITION.

296
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:04,736
       A LOT OF PEOPLE COME HERE
      FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

297
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:05,937
LET'S TALK ABOUT                
WHO THEY ARE,                   

298
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,806
DICK VITALE, PHIL JACKSON,      
BOB COSTAS.                     

299
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,607
WHO'S THIS CAT?                 
                 ROCKY MARCIANO.

300
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:12,210
       THIS WAS MY GRANDPA HERE.

301
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,678
       (Guy)                    
       AND MAKING EVERYONE      
       FEEL AT HOME IS          
       A FAMILY TRADITION       

302
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,013
    JOEY'S PROUD TO CARRY ON.   

303

 RIGHT DOWN TO THE TOMATO SAUCE 
 GRANDMA CALLED "RED GRAVY."    

306
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,689
THIS IS THE WAY WE              
WERE BROUGHT UP.                

307
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,491
THIS IS THE WAY                 
MY GRANDPA AND GRANDMA          
TAUGHT US.

                     NECK BONES.

310
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,764
          THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
          ANY RIB RIGHT THERE.  

311
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,766
         SO YOU GET A BUNCH     
         OF MARROW OUT OF THERE.

312
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:35,500
         YOU'RE GONNA GET A TON 
         OF FLAVOR OUT OF THERE.

313
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,101
EVERYONE IN THE POOL.           
                       TOMATOES.

314
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,970
ADD A LITTLE BASIL              
TO IT.                          

315
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,505
               AND THEN YOU JUST
               LET IT GO DOWN   

316
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:43,174
          FOR ABOUT 3 1/2 HOURS.

317
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,442
HOW ABOUT YOU DO                
THE REST OF THE SHOW BY YOURSELF

318
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,911
            AND I'LL WATCH THIS.

319
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:49,514
   LOOK AT THAT,                
   JUST GET IT GOING RIGHT HERE.

320
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,850
     I HAVE A THING ABOUT GRAVY,
     TOMATO SAUCE,              

321
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,853
               AND THAT IS, JUST
               MAKE IT RIGHT,   

322
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,254
         JUST MAKE IT RIGHTEOUS.

323
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,057
             MY FRIEND, THIS IS 
            RIGHT AND RIGHTEOUS.

324
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:01,926
FOR THAT YOU GET A HUG.         

325
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,261
        THE SAUCE IS OUT        
        OF THIS WORLD.          

326
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,995
        (Guy)                   
        WHATEVER IT'S ON,       

327
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,865
     MOSTACCIOLI,               
     THE EGGPLANT PARMESAN,     

328
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,332
AND THIS HEAVY HITTER...        
                   CHICKEN PARM.

329
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:13,938
                         WINNER.

330
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:16,808
     I'VE TRIED THE CHICKEN,    
     I'VE TRIED THE RAVIOLI.    

331
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,209
   THE MEATBALLS, PRETTY MUCH   
   EVERYTHING IS REAL GOOD.     

332
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,277
         FRIED CALAMARI.        

333
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,211
      SHELLS AND BROCCOLI.      

334
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,081
VEAL PICCANTE.                  

335
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,282
   (Guy)                        
   JOEY SAYS THIS ONE'S         
   A NEWCOMER, HIS OWN RECIPE.  

336
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:26,885
   ON THE MENU ONLY TEN YEARS.  

337
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,486
BRING IT ON.                    

338
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,288
                   INSIDE ROUND.

339
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,622
YOU DO THE VEAL TOP ROUND       
ON EVERYTHING HERE.             

340
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:32,623
           YEAH, WE TRIM IT     
           AND CUT IT OURSELVES.

341
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:33,825
THAT'S OLD-SCHOOL.              

342
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,693
TENDERIZE IT                    
A LITTLE BIT.                   

343
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,228
                   PUT THEM     
                   IN THE FLOUR.

344
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,763
STRAIGHT EGG WASH.              
            AND THE BREAD CRUMBS

345
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,765
    I USE THE WHITE BREAD CRUMBS

346
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,100
         I DON'T USE THE REGULAR
         HARD BREAD CRUMBS,     

347
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,234
        THAT'S WHAT MAKES ITS IT
        SO GOOD.                

348
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,637
                START WITH      
                A LITTLE BUTTER.

349
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,704
AND THE VEAL DOESN'T            
TAKE TO LONG TO COOK.           
                 NO, IT DOESN'T.

350
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:49,840
I USE A LITTLE                  
LEMON JUICE.                    
         A LITTLE CHICKEN STOCK.

351
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,509
       AND THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE.

352
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,712
          THAT'S A NICE PORTION.

353
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:55,046
SPRINKLE A LITTLE               
JUICE ON THERE.                 

354
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,781
SOME PINE NUTS.                 

355
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:57,315
           THAT'S A NICE LOOKING
           ROUND.               

356
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,720
          THERE'S TONS OF FLAVOR
          IN THAT.              

357
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,455
               I COULD DO DAMAGE
               ON THIS.         

358
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,992
            SUPER TENDER,       
            IT'S NICE AND LIGHT.

359
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,594
          YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

360
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,595
 THAT'S THE REAL-DEAL HOLY VEAL.

361
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,665
          I'LL BE HERE ALL WEEK.

362
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,801
        YOU SHOULD TRY THE VEAL.

363
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,071
           AND DON'T FORGET     
           TO TIP YOUR WAITRESS.

364
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,673
      HOW MANY YEARS I'VE WANTED
      TO USE THAT LINE          

365
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:23,674
          AND IT FINALLY WORKED.

366
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,277
                        I'M OUT.

367
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,746
            THE VEAL IS THE BEST
            IN THE CITY.        

368
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,480
         IT MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH.

369
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:32,016
               EVERYTHING'S GOOD
               AND FRESH.       

370
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,818
             IT COULDN'T BE DONE
             ANY BETTER.        

371
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,620
IT'S JUST A FAMILY PLACE.       

372
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,421
    I CAN TELL A LOT OF LOVE    
    WAS PUT INTO THIS.          

373
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:38,689
       YOU GOTTA LOVE           
       WHAT YOU'RE DOING.       

374
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,157
         AND THAT'S WHAT        
         WE DO HERE.            

375
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,560
        IT TASTES LIKE          
        HOMEMADE COOKING.       

376
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,762
      THERE'S NOTHING MORE      
      YOU CAN ADD.              

377
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:47,832
    THIS IS THE BEST ITALIAN    
    RESTAURANT IN THE CITY      
    OF CHICAGO.                 

378
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,768
             JOEY, I CAN SEE WHY
             EVERYBODY,

    TO YOUR WIFE,

       WHY EVERYBODY LOVES JOEY.

00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,173
           THANKS FOR SHARING IT
           WITH US.             

383
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:56,975
TWO SCRAMBLED, HAM.             

384
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,377
        (Guy)                   
        UP NEXT, ATLANTA.       

385
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,446
FOR GRITS AND GRAVY...          
            JUST LIKE GRANDMA'S.

386
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:05,049
         AND ICEBOX PIE.        

387
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:05,917
YOU'LL LIKE THIS.               

388
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,390
        SO THERE'S A TIME       
        IN YOUR LIFE            

389
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,192
     WHEN A FAMILY TRADITION    
     BECOMES KINDA LIKE         

390
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,794
     THE CORNERSTONE OF YOUR    
     FOOD FOUNDATION.           

391
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,329
     FOR ME, AT A YOUNG AGE     
     IT WAS SIMPLE,             

392
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,665
       GRITS, HAM,              
       AND RED-EYE GRAVY.       

393
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,767
   NOW, ON "TRIPLE D,"          
   YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT TO STOP   

394
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:25,003
   AT A PLACE KNOWN FOR THEIR   
    GREAT SOUTHERN BREAKFAST.   

395
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,205
 HERE WE ARE,                   
 THE SILVER SKILLET IN ATLANTA. 

396
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,340
    GIVE ME A CHICKEN BISCUIT   
    AND TWO SCRAMBLED, HAM.     

397
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,208
    FRIED PORK CHOPS, GRITS.    

398
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,810
       BISCUITS AND GRAVY.      

399
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:35,146
ENJOY.                          

400
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,548
  COUNTY HAM IS SUCH            
  A SOUTHERN THING, I LOVE IT.  

401
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:39,150
   TRADITIONAL SOUTHERN FOOD.   

402
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,019
 (Guy)                          
 THE SAME AS IN '67 WHEN        
 GEORGE DECKER BOUGHT THE JOINT.

403
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,688
  MY FATHER HAD THE RESTAURANT  
  FOR 20 YEARS.                 

404
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,090
 (Guy)                          
 HIS DAUGHTER, TERESA TOOK OVER 
 IN THE LATE '80s.              

405
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:49,227
    THEN HER HUSBAND JEFF       
    STARTED PITCHING IN, TOO.   

406
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,562
       YOU'RE EATING MY FAVORITE
       BREAKFAST.               

407
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,297
                  GRITS AND HAM.

408
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,698
AND THESE ARE GREAT,            
THEY'RE PERFECT.                

409
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:56,433
DO YOU LIKE GRITS?              
                     LOVE GRITS.

410
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,369
THIS IS THE RATIO?              
                            YES.

411
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,638
                        SERIOUS.

412
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,841
WHY NOT BUTTER?                 
            MARGARINE GIVES THEM
            A BETTER FLAVOR.    

413
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:07,578
             MELTS AND SEEMS TO 
             HOLD UP BETTER OVER
             THE LONG TERM.     

414
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,246
I LIKE IT, AND THIS WAS         
THE WAY YOUR DAD WAS DOING IT?  
                            YEP.

415
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,515
                  BOILING WATER?
YES.                            

416
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,918
    NOW, IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
    A RAPID, SCREAMING BOIL.    

417
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,054
THIS IS FINE, AS LONG AS        
YOU CAN SEE THE...              

418
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,655
                 DON'T WATCH IT,
                 IT WON'T BOIL. 

419
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,124
     NEXT, ON "DINERS, DRIVE-INS
     AND DIVES,"                

420
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,993
  IT'S BOBBIN' FOR MARGARINE    
  IN A HOT POT OF BOILING WATER.

421
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,196
A LITTLE SALT.                  

422
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:28,799
       AND THE MEASUREMENT STYLE
       IS CALLED...             
SOME.                           

423
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,869
NOW WE ADD THE GRITS.           

424
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,670
              NOW GO TO A SIMMER
              AND COVER?        
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

425
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:34,072
                 THIS IS THE LID
                 FOR THIS POT.  

426
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,274
CIRCA?                          
                           1956.

427
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,876
I HAVE TO GET                   
THIS COOKWARE SET.              

428
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:41,011
             YOU CAN ONLY BUY IT
             FROM HERE.         

429
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,081
                OKAY, SO HOW ARE
                OUR GRITS?      
           WE'RE DONE.          

430
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,082
                LOOK AT THAT,   
                NICE AND CREAMY.

431
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,352
       NOW SHOULD WE TASTE THEM,
       ABSOLUTELY.              

432
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:48,920
       I JUST WANT TO TASTE THEM
       IN THEIR NATURAL STATE.  
OKAY.                           

433
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:52,957
        I LIKE IT WITH          
        THE MARGARINE LIKE THAT.

434
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,959
                  THEY'RE TASTY,
                   I LOVE GRITS.

435
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,226
          I'D EAT THEM IN A BOAT
          WITH A GOAT,          

436
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:59,697
        IN A HOUSE WITH A MOUSE.

437
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,365
 JUST TASTE LIKE GRITS          
ARE SUPPOSED TO TASTE.          

438
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,301
IT'S THE CLOSEST THING          
TO HOME COOKING.                

439
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:04,702
     IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE     
     YOU'RE IN YOUR OWN KITCHEN.

440
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,771
EXCEPT YOU DON'T HAVE TO COOK   
OR CLEAN UP.                    

441
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,439
THE WAITRESSES ARE VERY NICE    
AND VERY FRIENDLY.              

442
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,508
      WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE, DEAR?

443
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,643
   THEY'RE "DARLIN', SWEETIE,   
   WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU?"     

444
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:15,446
         SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY,  
         THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

445
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:20,384
 BECAUSE IT'S AN                
OLD-TIMEY PLACE.                
        IT'S AN OLD-TIMEY JOINT.

446
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,520
     IT'S HARD TO REPRODUCE THAT
     IF IT'S NOT THE REAL DEAL. 

447
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,056
THOSE SIGNS HAVE BEEN THERE     
FOR 50 YEARS?                   

448
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,057
            THEY'RE THE ORIGINAL
             HAND-PAINTED SIGNS.

449
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,659
EVERYTHING IS JUST LIKE         
IT WAS WHEN THEY BUILT IT.      

450
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:30,061
    (Guy)                       
    ESPECIALLY THE FAVORITES.   

451
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,662
GOT PORK CHOP ON THE EGG.       

452
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:32,997
EGGS, GRITS,                    
BISCUITS.                       

453
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,432
THE BISCUITS ARE GREAT.         

454
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,534
THEY'RE REALLY MOIST            
AND FLUFFY.                     

455
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,403
GOOD BISCUIT,                   
NICE AND LIGHT.                 

456
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:39,270
A SCRAMBLED EGG                 
AND CHEESE BISCUIT.             

457
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,738
CHICKEN BISCUIT.                

458
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,272
BACON JELLY BISCUIT.            

459
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:42,840
YOU GOTTA HAVE                  
THE JELLY ON IT.                

460
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,478
                YOU GOTTA HAVE  
                THE JELLY ON IT.

461
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,480
        EIGHT COUNTRY HAM       
        BISCUITS.               

462
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,015
     IT'S THAT SOUTHERN HAM,    
     IT'S FABULOUS.             

463
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,617
     IT'S A REAL SALTY HAM.     

464
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,820
          TAKE THE SLICE OF HAM.
AND JUST LET ME                 
EAT IT NOW.                     

465
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:58,189
                      OPEN WIDE.

466
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,890
                   TRIM THE HAM.

467
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,492
IS THIS REALLY THE KNIFE        
YOU USE?                        

468
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,360
                        IT IS.  
I KNOW WHAT TO GET YOU          
FOR CHRISTMAS.                  

469
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:04,963
EACH PIECE WE                   
DO THIS TO?                     
                    EVERY PIECE.

470
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,897
                   HAND TRIMMED.

471
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,066
SO IT'S HAND-TO-HAM COMBAT.     

472
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,240
         OKAY, I'LL GIVE        
         YOU THAT ONE.          

473
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:17,442
THEY HAVE TO HAVE               
THE BONE IN THEM?               

474
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,510
        BONE-IN FOR COUNTRY HAM.

475
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,512
IS THIS THE WAY EVERYBODY       
MAKES THIS DOWN HERE IN ATLANTA?

476
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:25,049
           NO, THIS IS A SKILLET
           SECRET FAMILY RECIPE,

477
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,985
                HANDED DOWN FROM
                MY DAD.         

478
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,519
SOY SAUCE?                      
                      SOY SAUCE.

479
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:31,722
BY THE GALLON,                  
WOW.                            

480
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,324
AND THAT'S BROWN SUGAR.         
              LIGHT BROWN SUGAR.

481
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,659
PAPRIKA.                        

482
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,795
WHAT IS THIS, COFFEE?           

483
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:41,732
         THIS IS NOT COFFEE,    
         THIS IS A SECRET SAUCE.

484
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,801
THAT'S COLA.                    

485
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,070
SOY SAUCE, BROWN SUGAR,         
PAPRIKA,                        

486
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,205
COLA,                           

487
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:51,009
SOUNDS LIKE BREAKFAST           
DOESN'T IT?                     

488
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,676
THE HAM IS NOW GOING            
TO GO IN THE MAGIC MIXTURE.     

489
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,945
                 PIECE BY PIECE.

490
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,346
'CAUSE IF YOU STICK THEM        
IN THERE AS A CLUMP,            

491
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:57,815
IT WON'T GET TO THE MIDDLE.     

492
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,650
           MARINATES OVER NIGHT.

493
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,753
YOUR HAM IS DONE,               
YOU COOK THAT.                  

494
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,555
YOU GONNA DRAG THAT             
OVER MY TENNIES?                

495
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,557
NOW HOW DO WE MAKE              
THE RED-EYE GRAVY?              

496
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,025
              WE TAKE THE JUICE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?      

497
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,827
                JUST STAND THERE
                AND LOOK PRETTY.

498
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:10,761
WANT ME TO MOVE THIS AROUND     
AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT?     

499
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:12,563
                 DON'T YOU DARE.

500
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:15,099
             ADD OUR HOT COFFEE.

501
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,568
AND THAT IS THE                 
RED-EYE GRAVY.                  
       THAT'S THE RED-EYE GRAVY.

502
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:18,769
                RED-EYE GRAVY,  
                A BOWL OF GRITS,

503
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,504
                     GOOD TO GO.

504
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,706
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW             
WE DO IT AT MY HOUSE.           

505
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,441
THROW THOSE GRITS DOWN THERE.   

506
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,175
I CUT ALL MY HAM UP             
AHEAD OF TIME,                  

507
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:25,743
LIKE MY GRANDFATHER             
USED TO DO IT.                  

508
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,055
I'M REALLY HAPPY                
THAT YOU USED THE SIDE          
WITH THE BONE.                  

509
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:39,723
THAT'S THE BEST.                

510
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,395
LET ME JUST TRY                 
THE GRAVY NOW.                  

511
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,532
NOW THE RED-EYE GRAVY           
TASTE MORE LIKE MY              
RED-EYE GRAVY.                  

512
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,535
YOU CAN TELL I DON'T            
LIKE THIS AT ALL.               

513
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,603
I'M GONNA PUT THIS              
IN MY CAR.                      

514
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:53,737
 IT'S EXCELLENT,                
EXTREMELY SALTY.                
               I THINK IT TASTES
               DELICIOUS.       

515
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,406
THE RED-EYE GRAVY               
IS REAL UNIQUE.                 

516
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,809
      JUST LIKE GRANDMA'S.      

517
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,944
      (Guy)                     
      AND HEY, GRANDMA MADE     
      DESSERT, TOO.             

518
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,880
               LEMON ICEBOX PIE,
       WHEN WE COME BACK.       

519
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:05,182
WITH A PIECE THAT BIG,          

520
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,084
I'M GONNA HAVE TO PUSH          
THE CAMARO TO MY NEXT DINER.    

521
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:15,692
 (Guy)                          
 THE SILVER SKILLET HAS BEEN AN 
 ATLANTA INSTITUTION SINCE 1956.

522
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:16,894
      IT'S A LANDMARK HERE      
      IN ATLANTA.               

523
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,031
          THERE YOU GO.         

524
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:22,100
    IT'S A '50s DINNER,         
    STICK-TO-YOUR RIBS FOOD.    

525
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:25,036
     (GUY)                      
     TERESA BRECKINRIDGE HAS    
     KEPT IT ALL GOING          

526
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,637
     SINCE SHE TOOK IT OVER     
     FROM HER DAD.              

527
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:28,839
       IT'S A GOOD              
       SOUTHERN BREAKFAST.      

528
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:30,108
      (Guy)                     
      WITH ALL KINDS            
      OF SOUTHERN CLASSICS,     

529
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:31,642
   AND THAT INCLUDES DESSERT.   

530
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,377
               LEMON ICEBOX PIE.

531
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,179
     THE PIE IS EXCEPTIONAL.    

532
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,914
ICEBOX MEANS                    
IT'S KEPT COLD.                 
                          RIGHT.

533
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,849
BUT IT GETS BAKED?              
                            YES.

534
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,317
                    CRUST FIRST?

535
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:41,986
 WE'RE GONNA DO THE CRUST FIRST.

536
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,120
         A COUPLE OF HANDFULS OF
         GRAHAM CRACKER CRUMBS. 

537
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,855
               LIQUID MARGARINE.

538
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,390
            WE'RE GONNA MIX THIS
            TOGETHER.           

539
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:47,724
              PUT IT IN THE OVEN
              FOR 20 MINUTES.   

540
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,861
 NOW TO MAKE                    
THE CUSTARD.                    

541
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,863
               EGGS, WE ONLY USE
               THE YOLK.        

542
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,532
WOW, LOOK AT                    
THAT BOWL.                      

543
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:58,336
A.D.                            

544
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,671
                  IT CAME WITH  
                  THE OTHER SET.

545
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:02,740
                 SWEETENED      
                 CONDENSED MILK.

546
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:03,941
YOUR DAD'S RECIPE               
ALSO?                           
                            YES.

547
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,610
THIS MAN HAD IT                 
GOING ON.                       
                         HE DID.

548
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:09,280
                         LEMONS.
<i>EN GARDE.</i>                       

549
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,215
SORRY, HOW MANY?                
                          EIGHT.

550
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,551
           SQUEEZE THEM BY HAND.

551
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,887
I'M GONNA HAMMER                
YOU DOWN LIKE THAT.             

552
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,557
SOMETIMES I DON'T EVEN          
 KNOW MY OWN STRENGTH.          

553
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:23,227
      YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING AROUND
      AND I'VE BEEN WORKING.    

554
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:29,166
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN.        

555
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,901
         THAT'S A LOT OF MIXTURE
         FOR ONE PIE.           

556
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,903
       IT IS, BUT IT WILL       
       TIGHTEN UP.              

557
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,772
WILL IT FIT?                    
                      IT'LL FIT.

558
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,640
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE               
DONE THIS BEFORE.               
                    A FEW TIMES.

559
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,309
 AND NOW WE'RE GOING            
TO HIT IT WITH WHAT?            

560
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,511
       A FEW VANILLA WAFERS,    
       GENTLY PUSH THEM DOWN IN.

561
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,179
NOW WE BAKE IT?                 
                     20 MINUTES.

562
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:44,181
THEN YOU LET IT                 
COOL DOWN.                      

563
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:45,515
THEN WE HIT IT WITH             
A LITTLE...                     
                  CREAM TOPPING.

564
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:46,284
THAT'S A LOT OF PIE,            
HEAVY.                          

565
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:50,120
OOH, I LIKE THAT,               
A LITTLE CRUNCH ON TOP.         

566
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,989
WHAT WOULD BE NICE THERE        
 IS A LITTLE LEMON ZEST.        

567
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,725
BUT YOU KNOW,                   
ON A DIFFERENT DAY.             

568
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,796
WITH A PIECE THAT BIG,          
I'M GONNA HAVE TO PUSH          

569
00:19:58,865 --> 00:19:59,897
THE CAMARO TO MY                
NEXT DINER.                     

570
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,269
I LIKE GRAHAM CRACKER           
ON THE BOTTOM.                  

571
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,004
THAT HAS GOT TO BE              
SO REFRESHING                   

572
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,206
ON A HOT DAY.                   

573
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,874
IT'S NOT OVERLY SWEET.          
                             NO.

574
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,342
GOOD LITTLE AMOUNT              
OF CITRUS.                      

575
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,678
                JUST ENOUGH TART
                TO KINDA...     

576
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,947
IT LETS YOU KNOW                
IT'S THERE.                     

577
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,482
YOU WOULD LIKE THIS.            

578
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,484
     THE PIE WAS DELICIOUS.     

579
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,885
      THERE'S A LOT OF LOVE     
      WENT IN TO THAT PIE.      

580
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:23,154
      YOU'RE RUNNING LATE,      
      KIDDO.                    

581
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,155
        SOUTHERN CHARM          
        AND HOSPITALITY.        

582
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:26,957
     THE ATLANTA, AUTHENTIC     
     EXPERIENCE.                

583
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,625
                      FANTASTIC.
EXCELLENT.                      

584
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:31,629
THIS IS GOOD FOOD.              

585
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,497
      (Guy)                     
      THE WAY THEY'VE BEEN      
      DOING IT HERE FOR         
      HALF A CENTURY.           

586
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:36,433
       UNFORTUNATELY,           
       I CAN'T DOUBLE DIP.      

587
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:40,771
    I SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH MORE
    OF A BIG BITE STYLE.        

588
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,573
THE BIG BOY SPOON.              

589
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,442
   SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP.  

590
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:46,143
   BUT WE'VE GOT
